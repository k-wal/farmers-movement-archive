01-01-2022||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh assembly polls: Mayawati hits back at Amit Shah over jibe||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati on Saturday hit back at Union home minister Amit Shah over his jibe wherein he had said “behenji chunav aa gaya hai, bahar nikaliye (behenji, elections are here, start campaigning)” in the context of the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls’Accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress of holding political rallies at public expense when in power, the BSP chief Mayawati claimed that funds contributed by the poor to the government exchequer was keeping the ruling party warm. She also advised “other parties” to not worry about the BSP. Addressing a public meeting in Moradabad on Thursday in the run-up to the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls, Amit Shah had said that Mayawati was “afraid” and also alleged that she was yet to shake off the cold. “Behenji ki toh abhi thand hi nahin udi hai ... woh bhaiybhit hain .. behenji chunaav aa gaya hai, thoda bahut bahar nikaliye, baad mein ye na kehna ki maine prachaar nahi kiya tha (behenji hasn’t shaken off the cold yet. She is afraid. Behenji elections are here, now step out a little else don’t say later that you didn’t campaign),” Shah had said in his first sharp, pointed attack on Mayawati during the UP assembly poll campaign. The Uttar Pradesh assembly polls are due to be held early this year. Mayawati said the crowd in the rallies organised by the BJP and Congress (wherever these parties are in power), mostly comprised government servants or ticket seekers. “Despite taunts directed at me by political parties, my party believes in doing things differently,” she said. Unlike these parties, her party’s campaigns are funded by poor voters of her party, she further said. “If I, too, like these parties, start holding mass campaigns close to the polls, the poor won’t be able to take the burden of holding rallies during the elections,” she said. When out of power, the BJP and the Congress, too, don’t hold rallies months ahead of the elections, Mayawati said. “The BJP and the Congress, too, when in power, start resorting to airy-fairy announcements, foundation stone laying functions and inaugurations, about two and half months ahead of elections. In these public meetings, government money is wasted,” she said.At its public meetings, the BJP has been targeting Mayawati referring her to as “bua” though the bulk of the attack is directed at Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav whom the party leaders have been referring to as “babua”.
01-01-2022||Mumbai||CM: No property tax of residential properties up to 500 sq ft||Mumbai: Property tax on residential units of up to 500 square feet, located within the Mumbai municipal area limits, will be waived off, the Maharashtra government said on Saturday.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced the decision after a meeting with the state urban development department held earlier in the day.The announcement comes ahead of Mumbai municipal corporation elections expected to be held next month.There are over 1.6 million residential properties which will stand to benefit from the decision. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said that this will come into force in the financial year of 2022-23.The BMC collects between ₹4,000 crore to ₹5,000 crore in property tax every year and the outstanding amount is usually around ₹1,500 crore. With this waiver, the civic body is likely to face an annual revenue loss of up to ₹500 crore.The Shiv Sena had promised the waiver in the run up to the BMC elections in 2017. The party has been heading the BMC for over two decades now.“I am giving you all the good news on the very first day of this year. We have tried to pay off the debt of the hardworking Mumbaikars by deciding to waive off property tax for homes up to 500 square feet,” CM Thackeray, who is also the Sena president, was quoted as saying in a release issued by the chief minister’s office.“We have fulfilled most of the promises made during 2017 and today another important promise has been fulfilled,” he said.To implement the decision, the Bharatiya Janata Party-Sena government led by Devendra Fadnavis amended the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act in 2019. The waiver would only be limited to the general component of the tax, which is 10-20% of the total amount.The CM chaired a virtual meeting on Saturday with Urban Development Minister Eknath Shinde , Mumbai district guardian minister Aslam Shaikh, Mumbai suburban district guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray, Mayor Kishori Pednekar and Chief Secretary Debashish Chakrabarty.Chakrabarty said that the BMC has been given the power to implement the decision.Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Saturday said: “Implementation of the waiver will kick off from the upcoming 2022-23 financial year, and property tax in entire (for all components) for flats below 500 sq ft will be waived off.”Last year, the government clarified that it would issue property-tax bills to owners of such structures with a partial waiver. The partial waiver only included the general tax component, which is one of seven components that also include sewage and drain charges, among others, that owners would still be required to be paid.In the current system, property tax is levied for a building. But since last year, the BMC has also started issuing property tax on individual flats. There are around 400,000 housing societies in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cm-no-property-tax-of-residential-properties-up-to-500-sq-ft-101641061621604.html
01-01-2022||Delhi||Police team attacked while arresting drug dealer in Inderpuri||New Delhi: Four policemen, including an inspector, were injured on Saturday morning after a mob comprising of nearly 60 people and led by a wanted narcotic drugs supplier resorted to stone pelting and firing bullets at the police party from outer-north district that had gone to west Delhi’s Inderpuri to arrest the drug dealer. The police team responded to the violence and opened fired at the mob, injuring two alleged attackers, including a relative of the drug peddler, senior police officers said.Deputy commissioner of police (outer-north) Brijendra Kumar Yadav said that on Saturday around 8.30 am, the district’s anti-narcotics team led by Inspector Brajpal had gone to Inderpuri to arrest Dharamvir alias Palla, a notorious drug supplier, in a case in which non-bailable warrant was issued against him by the concerned court. Dharamvir was not found present at his home but the raiding team continued the search operation.“As our team members came out of Dharamvir’s house, they saw him leading a mob of 50-60 people who were armed with sticks and stones. Suddenly, the mob launched an attack on the police team and started pelting stones. When our team members fired some rounds in the air in self-defence and to disperse the attackers, bullets were fired at them from the mob. Showing courage, Inspector Brijpal fired bullets aiming the legs of the attackers and saved his team members,” said DCP Yadav.The DCP further said that in the police firing, two men from the crowd, identified as Amit and Shoaib, suffered bullet injuries. Apart from the inspector, three other policemen were also injured in the attack. All the six injured persons were taken to a nearby hospital for medical attention. Taking advantage of the melee, Dharamvir fled the violence spot, said Yadav.“Amit has been identified as Dharamvir’s relative and is involved in six crimes including dacoity, robbery, and attempt to murder. A case has been registered in connection with Saturday’s violence and attack on the police party. Efforts were on to identify and nab all the attackers and Dharamvir as well,” said a police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-team-attacked-while-arresting-drug-dealer-in-inderpuri-101641061080795.html

All health care workers are being trained and instructed for the treatment of the coronavirus. There is no separate treatment for the different variants of the virus,” Jain said at a press briefing, adding that so far all patients of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus have showed milder symptoms or remained asymptomatic.
01-01-2022||Delhi||Govt orders inquiry in poor state of Rajan Babu TB hospital building||New Delhi: Delhi urban development minister minister Satyendar Jain has ordered an inquiry into allegations that the North MCD-run Rajan Babu TB hospital was running from a dilapidated building that the civic body had itself declared dangerous for use.The North Delhi Municipal Corporation, however, described the order as “politically biased”, and argued that only one “small section” of the building has been declared unfit which is already empty. It said that ten other wards of 700-bed hospital are in fully usable condition.On Thursday, AAP MLA from Kalkaji, Atishi, said that several blocks of the hospital building located in north Delhi’s Tagore Park extension, were dilapidated, yet facilities were being run from there.Jain has sought an action taken report from the North MCD on the matter. “...life of patients, attendants, staff and citizens is being put in danger. It seems the building may collapse any time. In view of above, for the safety of human lives, doctors and paramedics working in above said MCD hospital, immediate inquiry may be conducted for the vacation and sealing of the building,” Jain said in an order issued on Saturday.After Atishi live streamed the condition of the building during a visit on Thursday, the leader of opposition in North MCD Vikas Goel filed a complaint at the Mukherjee Nagar police station.North MCD mayor Raja Iqbal Singh said the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is trying to malign the image of the hospital by highlighting a small section of the building which is in depleted state, and already declared dangerous. “The claim by AAP leaders that the entire hospital is unfit for human occupation is complete lie. Rajan Babu hospital is a huge 700-bed facility providing specialised treatment in chest diseases and it was this hospital, which, during the critical second Covid wave, provided 100 oxygen beds as an emergency measure when the Delhi government was failing in arranging beds. It is shocking that today the Delhi government is trying to malign the hospital,” Singh said.He added that on receiving a complaint the minister should have sought a administrative report from the administration or the commissioner North MCD on the status of the building, but he chose to bypass the legal way, and has directly passed the order of vacation and sealing of the hospital.Standing committee chairman Jogi Ram Jain said only the municipal corporations have the power to survey and declare any building dangerous for human occupation, and in this case North MCD already passed necessary order declaring a small portion of the concerned building inhabitable. “One covered verandah has been declared unfit while 10 other wards are fully usable. A report from IIT Roorkee on building’s overall safety has already been sought,” he added.Jain said that the corporation is passing through financial crisis due to non-payment of dues by Delhi government due to which it has not been able to immediately start the repair and renovation of the concerned section of building.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-orders-inquiry-in-poor-state-of-rajan-babu-tb-hospital-building-101641060540716.html

01-01-2022||Lucknow||Ram temple: Experts to take decision on placement of stones||As placement of stones will be of prime importance in the construction of main structure of Ram temple in Ayodhya, the Ram Mandir Construction Committee has decided to seek expert opinion in this regard.As no cement will be used in laying the temple’s structure, selection of proper stones will be a major task for engineers involved in the construction work. The construction committee is likely to start laying of stones for the main structure of the temple from February–March this year. According to members of Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Trust, construction work of the temple’s main structure involving only stones would be carried out under the watchful eyes of experts. These experts will decide on the utility of the stones depending on their durability, said a member of the Trust. “Stones of Rajasthan and Karnataka have different qualities. Experts have pointed out that stones from the southern Indian state have more capacity to bear load. Taking this into consideration, now experts will decide which stone will be placed where,” said a member of the Trust. The two-storey temple’s design has been conceived in such a manner that it will be constructed by using stone slabs while no cement and iron will be used. The 125-feet high temple will have 106 pillars on each of the two floors. According to Annu Bhai Sompura, incharge of the Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas Karyashaala, temple’s pillars on the ground floor will be 16.5 feet tall while those on the second floor will be 14.5 feet tall. The temple will have a magnificent ‘Shikhara’—a prominent feature of the Nagara style of architecture. During the meeting of the Ram Mandir Construction Committee on December 30 last year in Ayodhya, two experts, including Prof KS Rao from IIT Delhi and another from Pune, were present to brief the construction committee and Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Trust about the quality of stones found in Karnataka and Rajasthan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ram-temple-experts-to-take-decision-on-placement-of-stones-101641059821481.html

01-01-2022||Mumbai||18 booked for drunk driving on the New Year’s Eve in Mumbai||Mumbai: The Covid-19 pandemic and restrictions imposed on new year celebrations in Mumbai has brought down considerably the drunk driving cases registered in the city on the New Year’s Eve. Mumbai traffic police on Friday night registered 1,375 cases of traffic violations, including 18 for drunk driving. On December 31, 2020, the traffic police had caught 35 drivers behind the wheel inebriated, whereas in 2019, the number was far greater. The Mumbai traffic police had caught 778 drunk drivers on the New Year’s Eve in 2019. Though the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation and the Mumbai police had imposed complete ban on New Year’s celebrations, both indoors and outdoors, Mumbai traffic police had on Friday night made elaborate plans to crack down on errant drivers, especially those driving under the influence of liquor or drugs and accordingly posted policemen at 100 nakabandi check-posts at strategically located points in the city. During the night, the traffic police in all booked 1,375 individuals for various traffic violations like drunk driving, riding motorcycles without helmet, riding triple seat etc. Like last year, traffic police on Friday did not make use of breath analysers – to prevent the possible spread of Covid-19 – the traffic police caught 18 drivers driving under influence of alcohol. According to the officers 408 two wheeler riders were caught without helmet with maximum in Ghatkopar area with 66 and 41 in Mahim. The other offences were rash driving where 12 drivers were caught and 16 riding triple seat. The police attributed the low number of drunk driving cases to low key celebration and Covid-19 pandemic induced restrictions, as people preferred to return home early and stay indoors during the night in view of the recent spike in Covid-19 cases in the city. Maximum number of drunk drivers were caught in Bhoiwada area (4) followed by Oshiwara (3). “Only 8 people were caught drunk driving in the west region. We also observed that there was no crowd on the streets due to the restrictions imposed on New Year’s celebrations and awareness about the enhanced traffic fines, which also acted as a deterrent,” said a traffic police officer. Nitin Pawar, deputy commissioner of police (traffic) west region said that they had put up nakabandis at 35 locations in the west region from Bandra to Jogeshwari from 7pm on Friday to make sure that people drove responsibly. He said that during the nakabandis drivers who were found to be obeying traffic rules were rewarded with a key chain from the traffic police and a chance to click selfies the traffic police mascot. Due to the pandemic, the traffic police had decided not to use breath analysers, due to which blood tests of motorists and two-wheeler riders was conducted in the nearest hospital. First Information Reports have been registered against 18 drivers caught drunk driving under relevant provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.DCP Raj Tilak Roshan said that during the nakabandi traffic police constables used to stop vehicles randomly and observe the driver from a distance –at least four feet and take the driver for medical check-up if they suspected him or her to be under influence of alcohol. The suspected drivers were thus taken to the nearest hospitals, where doctor’s determined on the basis of their close observation whether the driver is drunk or not, Roshan added. Another police officer said, blood sample of the driver is taken and sent for analysis to determine blood alcohol content, if the doctors opined that the driver was under influence and an FIR was lodged against the driver. This officer added that the next day the driver is asked to remain present in the court concerned for further proceedings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/18-booked-for-drunk-driving-on-the-new-year-s-eve-in-mumbai-101641058862512.html

Since the traffic police were not using alchometers to check alcohol in the driver’s body, those who were visually drunk were sent to hospitals for checking of alcohol in their blood.“We had [police] stations teams at hospitals for checking of alcohol in blood. Those found drunk were prosecuted and not allowed to drive further. A total of 36 drunk drivers were caught and prosecuted,” said a senior traffic police officer, who asked not to be named.

I care about their education but safety comes first.” said Kaneez Fatima whose two daughters study at Lucknow Public School.“We are continuing with hybrid mode and parents are comfortable with it,” said Shaily Srivastava, vice-principal, SKD Academy, UP Board branch. “The situation is highly unpredictable. Some parents are hoping for physical classes to prevent learning gaps while others are reluctant and want their kids to stay home,” said Hema Tandon, student counsellor at City Montessori School, Rajendra Nagar 1 branch.“Parents feel that students get careless in schools and it gets difficult to follow Covid protocols there,” said a teacher of junior section Babita Konar. “Over the last few days, the attendance has dipped. Parents having children in 15-18 age group are eagerly waiting for the vaccination of their wards,” said Madhulika Agarwal, head, Kunskapsskolan School, Lucknow. She further said the school might have to resume online classes as safety of students was the top priority.Varsha Agarwal, mother of two children studying at City Montessori School, Rajendra Nagar 1 branch, said her elder daughter will get vaccinated soon and can continue with physical classes. However, she is not comfortable sending her son to school without vaccination.“Parents want their wards to attend physical classes. However, some parents have not sent their kids at all except for examinations,” said Shivani Pandiya, a primary section teacher at Rani Laxmi Bai Memorial School. While vaccination for teenagers in 15-18 age group is all set to start from January 3, the threat for younger children continues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-amid-rise-in-covid-cases-parents-unwilling-to-send-wards-to-school-101641058382046.html
01-01-2022||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s daily Covid tally crosses 9,000-mark||Mumbai Reporting a surge in Covid cases for the sixth consecutive day, Maharashtra reported 9,170 fresh infections, taking the count to 6,687,991 on Saturday. The tally of active cases went further up to 32,224, as 1,445 recoveries were reported in the last 24 hours. The state also reported six Omicron cases- with four in Pune and two from Pimpri Chinchwad, taking the Omicron tally in the state to 460. So far, 180 cases have been discharged following a negative RT-PCR test, stated a release issued by the state health department.It also saw seven casualties and the total number of fatalities stood at 141,533.State health minister Rajesh Tope on Saturday said that they will impose stringent restrictions if the situation does not get under control. However, they would wait for a few days before taking any such decision.“The chief minister is also of the view that stern action should be taken if required for the welfare of the people. We have come to the first step (of lockdown) by restricting the number of people attending marriages, funerals and social, religious and political gatherings. To see the impact, we will have to wait for a few days as they were imposed only from January 1 at midnight. If it doesn’t come under control, then the state can consider bringing restrictions on restaurants, cinema halls, schools and colleges as there are no restrictions on them as of now,” the health minister added.He said that Omicron cases can be detected by the RT-PCR laboratories if they start using S-gene kits. “In the Omicron variant, the S-Gene is absent in the RT-PCR tests. S-Gene kits will help in detecting Omicron cases. We have decided to procure these kits (for government laboratories) and private labs will be asked to use them by fixing their rates so that it will be affordable for the people,” he informed.The daily cases are also increasing in Mumbai, as it clocked 6,180 cases. In the last 24 hours, the state tested 1,26,490 samples and had a positivity rate of 7.24%. However, the overall positivity rate of the state stood at 9.67%, the statement said.The state also vaccinated 3,29,224 doses on Saturday and has administered a total of 1,34,036,246 doses to date, according to the data available on the Co-Win portal.
01-01-2022||Mumbai||Doctors bank on new antiviral drug Molnupiravir and antibody cocktails for high-risk patients||Mumbai: With Mumbai emerging as the epicentre of a fresh wave of Covid-19 cases, doctors said that they will bank on two medications, the new antiviral drug molnupiravir and the monoclonal antibody cocktail drug, to treat patients who are at risk of developing severe disease. Doctors said the number of patients qualifying for these medicines has increased over the past 10 days since the city began experiencing a surge. Both molnupiravir and the antibody cocktail drug are indicated for patients with mild disease who are at the risk of progression to severe Covid-19. “In the past few days, we have been getting a lot of patients who are in the mild category and a large number of them are candidates for these medications,” said Dr Vasant Nagvekar from Lilavati Hospital in Bandra. With the highly mutated Omicron variant in circulation, a considerable number of the new cases are among people who have been fully vaccinated, many of them senior citizens and those with co-morbidities. Doctors also said that the more potent Delta variants of the virus is still in circulation and is also causing hospitalisations. Nagvekar said he has started prescribing molnupiravir to the patients soon as they report symptoms. If the symptoms don’t subside within a span of 48 to 72 hours but they have not progressed, he prescribes the antibody cocktail drug. “Molnupiravir allows some breathing space to observe the patient and his disease progression, before moving on to the more expensive cocktail drug,” he said adding that he administered molnupiravir to seven patients on Friday. Molnupiravir was granted emergency use approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December. The Drug Controller General of India also allowed its emergency use last week. According to Nagvekar, a five-day course of molnupiravir costs ₹2,700. The monoclonal antibody cocktail drug is a combination of two or more monoclonal antibodies. In November 2020, the U.S. FDA issued an emergency use authorisation to REGEN-COV, which contains two monoclonal antibodies— casirivimab and imdevimab. It received emergency use authorisation in India in May 2021. REGEN-COV is available in India through a tie-up between Roche India and Cipla. While REGEN-COV is widely in use, India’s drug regulator has also approved American pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly’s antibody-drug combination. Early in December, a study by Frankfurt-based researchers found that the REGEN-COV’s cocktail failed to neutralise the Omicron variant in a laboratory setting. Eli Lilly has also announced that its cocktail has “reduced neutralisation activity” against Omicron. At the civic-run Seven Hills Hospital in Marol, 1660 patients have received the REGEN-COV cocktail since May 2021; 220 received it in December. “We have been admitting a lot of international travellers since the Omicron scare began and fitting candidates have received the cocktail therapy. We have observed beneficial results in almost all patients,” said Dr Smita Chavan, deputy dean at Seven Hills Hospital. “It’s hard to comment on the cocktail’s impact on Omicron patients as we have not done any specific study. But none of the patients who were administered the therapy in December has progressed to severe disease,” she said. While Seven Hills is administering the cocktail therapy free of cost, a pack of REGEN-COV costs 119,500 in the private sector. One pack can be used for two patients, thus the cost per patient comes to ₹59,750. Infectious disease expert Dr Om Srivastava said that a combination of molnupiravir and antibody cocktail drugs is likely to become the mainstream treatment in the coming days. “Both the medications are targeted at the mild patient category that has increased now. The cocktail therapy definitely plays a role in shortening the recovery period,” he said adding that he had administered the cocktail drug to nearly 10 patients in the past week.

01-01-2022||Lucknow||Ayodhya: Over 1.12 lakh devotees seek Ram Lalla’s blessings on New Year||More than 1.12 lakh devotees turned up at Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya to pay obeisance to Ram Lalla (infant Lord Ram) on the first day of 2022, said the temple administration. Since 7am, devotees in large numbers could be seen at main entrance of the Ram Janmabhoomi waiting for their turn to enter the campus. In first four hours from 7 am to 11am, 53,000 devotees turned up there. In the second half from 2pm to 6pm, more than 59000 devotees visited the Ram Janmabhoomi to seek blessings of the presiding deity. Security personnel had a tough time in screening devotees and thereafter permitting them to enter the Ram Janmabhoomi campus. The narrow lane starting from Hanuman Garhi temple and leading to Ram Janmabhoomi was packed with devotees. “We did not expect such huge turnout of devotees on first day of the year,” said Champat Rai, general secretary, Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Trust. The Hanuman Garhi temple also witnessed huge turnout of devotees. Cops had a tough time in controlling crowd and ensuring there was no untoward incident. After the Vaishno Devi incident in Jammu and Kashmir in which 12 people were killed and 13 others injured in the stampede on Saturday morning, cops were on high alert in Ayodhya to regulate movement of devotees. But the Ayodhya administration was not prepared for such a huge turnout of devotees, said a senior official of the Ayodhya administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ayodhya-over-1-12-lakh-devotees-seek-ram-lalla-s-blessings-on-new-year-101641057904893.html
01-01-2022||Delhi||Daily covid cases grow by 50%, harsher curbs unlikely soon||New Delhi: Daily Covid-19 infections in the Capital jumped over 50% on Saturday as the latest surge of infections, fuelled by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, continued to spread its footprint in Delhi, with the test positivity rate shooting past 3% even as the Delhi government said it was closely monitoring the situation but did not plan to impose fresh economic and travel restrictions in view of the low rate of hospitalisations.Delhi added 2,716 cases of Covid-19, according to the state’s Saturday health bulletin, 51% more than the 1,796 infections the Capital saw on Friday. The spike on Saturday was the highest in a single-day since May 21, when the city recorded 3,009 infections.Also Read | Delhi govt readies 159 centres for vaccines to 15-18 year oldsOf nearly 75,000 samples collected on Saturday, 3.64% returned positive results as this statistic - the test positivity rate - also hit its highest mark in Delhi since May 21, when 4.76% samples returned positive results.The city also recorded one death of the infection, after adding no fatalities in the last three days of December.A senior government official said for the time being status quo will be maintained with regard to restrictions being enforced in the Capital, and added that government was closely monitoring the situation. “There is no need to panic because though the surge is sharp, the infection is mild,” said the official who asked not to be named,Currently Delhi is under yellow alert – the first level of restrictions under Graded Response Action Plan - triggered when positivity rate stayed above 0.5% for two consecutive days. It led to a night curfew, closing of schools, colleges, movie theatres and gyms. Immediately after the restrictions were imposed business community and health experts said the government must readjust the restrictions to account for Omicron variant’s reduced virulence.Also Read | Delhi govt readies 3,000 Covid beds of kids as cases surgeOfficial aware of the matter on Saturday said even though the positivity rate breached 2% on Saturday, the government may not invoke the orange alert under which harsher curbs such as Metro, malls and non-essential offices are ordered shut along with imposition of full curfew on weekend.The city’s Covid-19 curve has spiked upwards sharply since mid-December, fuelled majorly by the Omicron variant, according to one study. In the first half of December, Delhi recorded a total of 740 fresh infections. In the second, this number grew nearly nine times to 6,361.Between December 21 and 28, the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS) analysed 125 samples, of which 67 (54%) were of the Omicron variant.Delhi has, over the past seven days, recorded an average of 1,124 fresh cases each day. This is the first time this number, known as the case trajectory, has crossed the 1,000 mark since end-May, when the fourth wave of the pandemic in Delhi began to level out.However, even after two weeks of consistent uptick in cases, Covid-19 hospitalisations continue to remain low in the city, with nearly 21,000 beds vacant in the city’s health care facilities, according to data from the state government’s Delhi Corona App.Also Read | New Year’s eve: 657 fined for breaking traffic rules, over 4K for Covid protocolsThe number of single-day recoveries also hit a nearly seven-month high on Saturday, according to the health bulletin, which showed that 765 people in Delhi recovered from Covid-19. This is the most in a day since 876 people recovered on June 7 last year.Deaths too have been at low levels in that time, with nine people succumbing to the infection throughout December. In comparison, seven people died of the infection in November, and four in October.These numbers underline global trends that the Omicron variant appears to be more transmissible but less virulent, and that the variant of concern (VOC) does not crowd hospitals like the Delta variant did.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital, said: “The positivity rate will witness a sharper increase in the weeks to come but the examples of other parts of the world shows that the cases will soon start coming down. So, there is no need to panic. There is possibility that more new positive cases will be found in the community which is still negligible as compared to UK, US, Canada, and others.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-daily-covid-cases-grow-by-50-harsher-curbs-unlikely-soon-101641057900615.html

01-01-2022||Mumbai||Resident doctors demand recruitment of non-academic juniors||Mumbai: Maharashtra resident doctors continued the state-wide strike on Saturday protesting against the delay in the release of NEET PG counselling date, with doctors from three more Mumbai hospitals joining in support. According to Central Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD), nearly 6,000 resident doctors from more than 20 medical colleges across Maharashtra participated in the protest on Saturday. “We will request the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) to issue one notification stating recruitment of non-academic Junior Residents (JRs) equal to the number of residents in that particular colleges. So that patient care would not get hampered amidst OMICRON Covid cases surge,” said the statement released by MARD. The resident doctors demanded that the prerequisites like form filling, document verification among other things should be asked to be completed as soon as possible and release of the schedule regarding the same to avoid further delay in the process. Mehak Agarwal, joint secretary of MARD said, “We need assurance that the state counselling will start as soon as the timetable for All India NEET PG counselling is out. At least the preliminary procedures like student verification should be handled,” Dr Avinash Dahiphale, president of Central MARD said that all the government and corporation medical colleges across Maharashtra are protesting. “We will continue the strike until our demands are fulfilled but considering the surge in the Covid cases we will continue working in the Covid wards and emergency services.” Hospital authorities said that some elective surgeries were postponed due to the strike, but a large impact has been avoided as other medical staff has been mobilised. “There was no impact on any medical services considering only half of the resident doctors in the hospital had joined the strike,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of BYL Nair Hospital.

01-01-2022||Pune||International flight operation from Pune airport may resume from January 7||Pune: Pune airport in Lohegaon is expected to start international flight from January 7 with flight for Sharjah. The international flight operations at Pune airport were completely shut since March 2020 due to the Covid outbreak. “Flight for Sharjah may take off from Pune International Airport on January 7, we are waiting for final confirmation. Airport is ready to resume international flight operations,” said an airport official on request of anonymity. Before the first lockdown, Pune airport had two international flights to Dubai which were operated by SpiceJet and Air India Express. “We are expecting more flights for gulf countries, however, now due to the Omicron threat many countries have altered travelling policies which has impacted the pre-planned schedule which we wanted to implement from January 2022. Now the plans will be delayed, but many airlines have shown interest to start international flights from Pune airport,” the official said. On the last day of 2020, 17,105 passengers took flight from Pune airport. 9,665 arrived while 7,440 departed from 68 flights. “The passenger movement reached up to 22,000 on few occasions during December. We were expecting higher footfall during the new year, but impact of Omicron has made the difference,” he said. Pune always had international flights for gulf countries and the airport is expecting the same once service resumes. Once the international flight service resumes, decision on whether Sharjah return passengers will have to take seven days quarantine will be decided in a few days. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has made seven days home quarantine compulsory for flyers coming from the United Arab Emirates and they have to go for compulsory RT-PCR test at the airport even if they are fully vaccinated on arrival. Atiq Shaik, regular flyer to Sharjah, said, “I have booked my ticket from Mumbai. If flight service restarts then I may book my return flight for February at Pune airport as it will be more convenient.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/international-flight-operation-from-pune-airport-may-resume-from-january-7-101641056402329.html
01-01-2022||Pune||Dabholkar murder trial: Cross examination of rationalist’s son by defence concludes||PUNE: From earlier arrests to Naxal-links, the team of defence lawyers tried to display alternate theories for the murder of Dr Narendra Dabholkar on the concluding day of the cross-questioning of his son Dr Hamid Dabholkar on Saturday in Pune. The cross questioning was happening in the court of Judge SR Navander with special public prosecutor Prakash Suryavanshi and defence lawyers Prakash Salsingikar and Suvarna Vast. Four of the five accused - Virendra Tawade, Sharad Kalaskar, Sachin Andure, and Vikram Bhave - were present in court while Sanjeev Punalekar was granted exemption. Salsingikar questioned Dr Hamid about the complaints that his late father was working on before he was gunned down near Omkareshwar bridge on the morning of August 20, 2013. The witness maintained a steady answer of not knowing anything about the workings of his father’s organisation before his murder. The lawyer questioned him about work and complaints by the slain rationalist regarding bogus doctors, traders of stones claimed to have magical powers and religious organisations. The lawyer questioned Dr Hamid about the differences between Dr Dabholkar and the warkari community. However, he said that he did not know. The lawyer read a section from a Writ Petition filed in the Bombay High Court that mentioned opposition by the warkari community to the Anti-Black Magic Bill that was the brainchild of Dr Dabholkar. To this, Dr Hamid said, “I had told the lawyers who wrote the writ petition that a section of warkari community had opposed to the bill and not the entire community.” Advocate Salsingikar questioned him about the split in the organisation. “The organisation was called Akhil Bharatiya Andhashradha Nirmoolan Samiti where he (Dr Narendra Dabholkar) used to work. Shyam Manav was the president of that organisation. Why did they split?” asked advocate Salsingikar. “It was 32 years ago. I was barely 7-8 years of age. I do not remember. But I do know that they had a difference of opinion. The difference was in relation to the procedure of work and not the work itself,” said Dr Hamid. The next hearing of the case is slated to be held on January 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/dabholkar-murder-trial-cross-examination-of-rationalist-s-son-by-defence-concludes-101641056220704.html

01-01-2022||Pune||Lakhs visit ‘Jaystambh’ monument to mark 204th anniversary of Bhima Koregaon battle||Pune: Thousands of Dalits across the country offered their homage to the martyrs of the battle of Bhima Koregaon at the Dalit war memorial popularly known as “Jaystambh” at Perne hamlet in Bhima Koregaon village on Saturday despite Covid restrictions in place and Section 144 clamped by the district administration. According to the police, over a million Dalits paid tributes at the obelisk during the daylong event. Compared to the 203 anniversary celebrations last year which was a low-key affair due to the Covid 19 restrictions, the turnout for the event was fairly large despite pandemic curbs. The Bhima Koregaon obelisk was decorated with Indian army’s Mahar regiment insignia and the floral decoration was symbolic of the Indian tricolour this time to commemorate the 204th anniversary of the battle amidst police security and surveillance of intelligence agencies. The victory pillar was erected by the Britishers in 1821 to commemorate the memory of the historic battle which marked the defeat of Peshwa Bajirao II by British army, comprising mostly of Dalit Mahars. According to the Dalit narrative, the 500 Dalit Mahar soldiers defeated the 25,000 strong army of the Peshwas during the battle. The Dalits regard the battle as their war of freedom from the oppressive rules of casteist Peshwas. For the 204th anniversary celebrations, the ministry of social justice of the government of Maharashtra made elaborate arrangements for organising the event. The Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) authorities had made free bus service available from different embarkation points to the war memorial. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar was the first state functionary to arrive at Bhima Koregaon where he placed a wreath at the memorial in the presence of top administrative and police officials of the government who offered their salute to the departed war heroes. Pawar said, “Maharashtra has a history of bravery and valour and this is seen when you turn the pages of state history. During the past, the brave warriors sacrificed their lives in the battle of Bhima Koregaon. This history of bravery must remain etched in the mind of the youngsters.

01-01-2022||Patna||16 of Bihar’s 31 ministers have guns||Ministers in the Nitish Kumar cabinet are not only well off in terms of landed property and movable assets but they also have a fascination for guns, as per the latest update of assets declared by 31 ministers in the Bihar government. Altogether, 16 ministers, including state’s deputy chief minister Renu Devi, own rifles and pistols, their prices ranging from ₹50,000 to ₹4 lakh. As per the affidavits of assets declared by ministers on December 31, 2021, as part of annual exercise introduced in 2011 by chief minister Nitish Kumar to bring transparency in government, the CM himself does not own any arms and his net assets consist of a flat in New Delhi worth ₹58.85 lakh and movable assets worth ₹16.51 lakh. In 2021, Kumar’s cash in hand decreased by about ₹6,500. He has declared having only ₹29,385 in hand in 2021, as against ₹35,885 in 2020.Kumar’s son Nishant, however, is richer than him, having immovable assets, including inherited land, valued at ₹1.98 crore and movable assets valued at ₹1.63 crore. Kumar’s two deputies, Tar Kishore Prasad and Renu Devi, are richer than him.Prasad has a net worth above ₹2 crore in the form of ancestral and self-acquired property but has become poorer in terms of cash in hand. Prasad, who holds the finance portfolio, had ₹56,000 in cash in 2020, which has now reduced to ₹10,000. Renu Devi’s cash in hand has increased substantially, from ₹48,504 in 2020 to ₹4.51 lakh in 2021.Among the top most ministers in terms of net worth includes fishery and animal husbandry minister Mukesh Sahni, whose immovable assets is valued at ₹8.34 crore and movable assets at ₹1.31 crore, including ₹98 lakh investment in debentures/mutual funds. However, Sahni, who was the richest among his cabinet colleagues in 2020, has now become poorer by few crores. In his last affidavit in January 2021, the former Bollywood set designer had declared assets worth around ₹13 crore, including apartments and buildings in Mumbai. Other rich ministers include water resources minister Sanjay Jha, health minister Mangal Pandey, science and technology minister Sumit Singh, excise minister Sunil Kumar, labour resources minister Jibesh Kumar and panchayati raj minister Samrat Choudhary. Their net worth is between ₹2 crore to ₹5 crore. Fascination for guns is a striking aspect. A total of 16 ministers possess arms ranging from rifles, double barrel guns to pistols. Janak Ram, minister for mines and geology, has a 30.06 bore rifle valued at ₹1.25 lakh and a .32 bore pistol valued at ₹4.05 lakh. Similarly, panchayati raj minister Samrat Choudhary too has a rifle valued at ₹4 lakh. Among the three female ministers in the Nitish cabinet, deputy chief minister Renu Devi and food and consumer protection department minister Leshi Singh have arms. While Renu Devi has a pistol and rifle, Leshi Singh has a rifle and a double-barrel gun. The other ministers holding licensed arms include Jama Khan, Jayant Raj, Narayan Prasad, Sunil Kumar, Sumit Kumar Singh, Subhash Singh, Ashok Choudhary, Santosh Suman, Mangal Pandey, Ram Surat Kumar, Shravan Kumar and Pramod Kumar. “Possession of arms by people, including ministers, is more of a status symbol,” social scientist Rakesh Tiwary said, adding that such practice by ministers should be discouraged as it was not in sync with the good governance agenda of the Nitish Kumar government. Apart from guns, the ministers, as per their affidavits, also display an inclination for investing in jewellery and ornaments. Deputy CM Renu Devi has 510 grams of gold valued at ₹23.82 lakh while 1.95 kg of silver worth ₹1.19 lakh.Transport minister Sheela Kumar has jewellery worth ₹16.20 lakh. A few ministers are poorer than their spouses.For instance, road construction minister Nitin Nabin has a net worth of ₹63.84 lakh while his wife has assets (both movable and immovable ) worth ₹1.48 crore. Wives of other minister like Jibesh Kumar, Samrat Choudhary and Sumit Singh too are richer than spouses.

The denial of permission drew sharp reaction from former Shiv Sena MP Shivajirao Adhalrao Patil.Adhalrao said that this was the first race after Supreme Court’s decision and was to be held at Landewadi in Ambegaon Taluka on Saturday morning. He said that till Friday evening, they had no clue that the races would be cancelled. The race received a good response and farmers from various districts arrived to compete. Patil has also questioned district collectorates decision to cancel the bullock-cart race, where as other events in the city are being conducted.“We had sought permission for the races a few days ago. The administration gave us no clue that it would cancel the races at the last minute. Participants from various locations had started to arrive at the location. The district administration was satisfied with our preparations, however, they suddenly took the decision to cancel the event without taking us in confidence,” said Adhalrao.He along with local farmers held a sit-in agitation to protest against the administration’s move.“The Pune district cooperative bank carried an indoor campaign even on December 30, for the upcoming elections. If the Covid-19 cases have increased, the rules should be same for all,” added Adhalrao.The participants echoed Adhalroa’s comment and said that large number of people have gathered at Bhima Koregaon to pay tribute, if they can be allowed there, then the administration should consider this event too.Adhalrao said,”We promised the administration that the event is in an open space and will be conducted following all the Covid norms.”Many Adhallrao Patil supporters were agitated over cancelling the event and blamed the opposition parties mainly Nationalist Congers Party (NCP) for it. Patil’s supporters alleged that as the event received huge response, the opposition cancelled it by using the district administration as its means.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/bullock-cart-race-in-ambegaon-cancelled-in-wake-of-surge-in-covid-19-cases-101641054420697.html

01-01-2022||Pune||Safety concerns: Parents in Pune prefer online classes||PUNE Despite the schools assuring safety of the students on school campus, parents prefer online classes as the Covid-19 cases spike again in the city. However, citing learning loss, schools and principals said that offline schools will be helpful for the studies. Hairshchandra Gaikwad, president of the Pune district principals’ association said, “The teaching and non-teaching staff are geared up to start offline classes. Offline classes will help children bridge the learning loss. But in the light of the recent increase in cases, most schools will continue in hybrid mode of teaching. It is important to start offline lectures. Person to person interaction is important for children while learning and offline classes will ensure that.”However, parents feel that online education in this scenario will be safer. Prashant Khande, a parent said, “As the cases are increasing, parents are scared about the new variant. The immunity of young students is low. Also, only two months of the academic year are remaining. It is not going to make much difference for the students to attend offline cases. Higher classes can follow social distancing and other Covid appropriate behaviour but students from class 1 to Class 5 are likely not to follow.”He added that many parents are facing the issue of transport. “School transport is not functional. Many parents have to drop students to school. As offices are functional, this becomes a difficult task. With the increase in cases, the government may take the decision to close schools in the next couple of weeks. And hence, parents are choosing online education over offline classes as of now,” said Khande.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/safety-concerns-parents-in-pune-prefer-online-classes-101641053341720.html
01-01-2022||Pune||Maharashtra sees 34% decline in Covid testing in six months: Centre to state||Pune: The central government has written to the state that the number of Covid tests carried out on residents has dropped by 34% in the past six months even as the administration is placing restrictions to check the spread of Omicron variant. A comparison on the number of tests made for the two weeks period between May 20 and June 2 post second wave peak period in April and between December 16 and December 29 make experts believe that the third wave could be round the corner. The central government also warned that in addition to the rise of cases, increased transmissibility of the Omicron variant and with most new cases reported as asymptomatic, initial testing will help to ensure that the infected individuals do not spread the virus. According to the Centre’s letter to Maharashtra, a copy of which is with HT, in the two weeks’ time period between May 20 and June 2, Maharashtra saw a total of 3,560,282 Covid tests which fell by over 34% to 2,339,002 for the period between December 16 and December 29. As the Omicron threat is looming, the central government has asked the state government to increase testing and most states have shown a drastic fall in the test numbers. In the past two weeks, multiple districts namely Mumbai, Mumbai suburban, Pune, Thane and Nagpur have shown a sudden and drastic rise in the number of new Covid cases which has further pushed the demand for increased testing as this has also lessened the doubling time of Covid cases. In addition to increased testing, the Centre has also asked the states to ensure that the logistics like stock of testing reagents and kits is maintained so that there are no stock outs or shortages. The states with the highest fall in testing percentage are Arunachal Pradesh with 68% decline for the same period mentioned above, Assam with 58% decline, Nagaland with 52%, Punjab with 39% and Daman and Diu with 34% decline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/maharashtra-sees-34-decline-in-covid-testing-in-six-months-centre-to-state-101641053160628.html
01-01-2022||Mumbai||EOW arrests Delhi-based CA in cheating case||Mumbai The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Mumbai police arrested a 38-year-old chartered accountant (CA) from Delhi in a cheating case registered in Mumbai against the director of a Powai-based company that fraudulently availed business loan from ICICI Bank using forged documents. The arrested CA, identified as Kapil Mittal, is a resident of Delhi and is accused of helping the prime accused Sanjay Sinha in the alleged fraud. Sinha, a director of Leeve Logistics Ltd., was arrested by the EOW in August 2019. Investigations by EOW banking unit 1 official revealed that Sinha, in 2013-14, under the pretext of buying a forklift from Kamal Sales Corporation, availed a loan of ₹4.41 crore from ICICI Bank. The accused allegedly submitted bogus and forged invoices and other documents of Kamal Sales Corporation to the bank to avail the loan and later used the loan money for self-gain, said an EOW officer. After Sinha’s company defaulted in loan repayment, Ashok Upadhyay, chief regional officer (sales) of the bank in 2017 lodged FIR against Sinha, his accountant Shrikant Naik and others at Malad police station. The case was later transferred to the EOW. During EOW’s investigation, the police found that Sinha diverted funds into his account and later to other accounts to withdraw cash, said an EOW officer. EOW officers suspect that Mittal was aware of the unlawful acts and was also instrumental in the subsequent cash transactions. They alleged that he was part of the criminal conspiracy and helped the main accused in the case. “Once his role was ascertained, he was arrested in the case recently. He was produced in the court on Friday and was remanded to judicial custody,” said Datta Pable, senior inspector of EOW Banking unit-1. Sinha, Mittal and other accused have been booked under sections 420 (Cheating), 466 (forgery of record of Court or of public register, etc.), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will, etc.), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (Using as genuine a forged document or electronic record) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/eow-arrests-delhi-based-ca-in-cheating-case-101641052560116.html

Throughout his journey, he sowed seeds along the routes till the Himalayas besides planting at the places where he took shelter.Ganai said, “It was a wonderful experience for me. The journey was planned to be completed in 80 days but I completed it in 75 days and returned on December 31. I always dreamt of seeing Everest but did not have the finance for the same. Thus, I embarked on the journey surviving merely on one meal a day. Several people from UP, MP and also from Nepal helped me and guided me to reach the base camp of Annapurna.“I was also studying online for at least an hour a day during the journey and used to walk 35-40km a day and slept in a tent or shelters given in different hostels and schools. With the idea to plant trees, I happened to meet some social workers, hostel students, school students of different regions and planted trees too. I had carried some seeds that I sowed during the journey.”Ganai always wanted to explore the world. This is merely the beginning. He said he’s also a nature lover and active in environmental activities in his surroundings. He never wanted to use environmentally-unfriendly means of travelling and also due to lack of finance, he started his walking journey and successfully completed his dream and, in the process, encouraged other youngsters to live their dreams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bhiwandi-resident-completes-walk-to-the-himalayas-in-75-days-101641052020108.html

01-01-2022||Mumbai||18 booked for drunk driving on New Year’s Eve in Mumbai||The Covid-19 pandemic and restrictions imposed on New Year celebrations in Mumbai has brought down considerably drunk driving cases registered in the city on New Year’s Eve. Mumbai traffic police on Friday night registered 1,375 cases of traffic violations, including 18 for drunk driving. On December 31, 2020, the traffic police had caught 35 drivers behind the wheel inebriated, whereas in 2019, the number was far greater. The Mumbai traffic police had caught 778 drunk drivers on New Year’s Eve in 2019. Though the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation and the Mumbai police had imposed a complete ban on New Year’s celebrations, both indoors and outdoors, Mumbai traffic police had on Friday night made elaborate plans to crack down on errant drivers, especially those driving under the influence of liquor or drugs and accordingly posted policemen at 100 nakabandi check-posts at strategically located points in the city. During the night, the traffic police in all booked 1,375 individuals for various traffic violations like drunk driving, riding motorcycles without helmets, riding triple seat etc. Like last year, traffic police on Friday did not make use of breath analysers – to prevent the possible spread of Covid-19 – the traffic police caught 18 drivers driving under the influence of alcohol. According to the officers, 408 two wheeler riders were caught without helmet with the maximum in Ghatkopar area with 66 and 41 in Mahim. The other offences were rash driving where 12 drivers were caught and 16 were riding triple seat. The police attributed the low number of drunk driving cases to low key celebration and Covid-19 pandemic induced restrictions, as people preferred to return home early and stay indoors during the night in view of the recent spike in Covid-19 cases in the city. The maximum number of drunk drivers were caught in Bhoiwada area (4) followed by Oshiwara (3). “Only 8 people were caught drunk driving in the west region. We also observed that there was no crowd on the streets due to the restrictions imposed on New Year’s celebrations and awareness about the enhanced traffic fines, which also acted as a deterrent,” said a traffic police officer. Nitin Pawar, deputy commissioner of police (traffic) west region said that they had put up nakabandis at 35 locations in the west region from Bandra to Jogeshwari from 7pm on Friday to make sure that people drove responsibly. He said that during the nakabandis drivers who were found to be obeying traffic rules were rewarded with a key chain from the traffic police and a chance to click selfies with the traffic police mascot. Due to the pandemic, the traffic police had decided not to use breath analysers, due to which blood tests of motorists and two-wheeler riders was conducted in the nearest hospital. First Information Reports have been registered against 18 drivers caught driving under the influence of alcohol under relevant provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/18-booked-for-drunk-driving-on-new-year-s-eve-in-mumbai-101641051368681.html

01-01-2022||Mumbai||53% of state’s mangrove area now legally a ‘forest’||MUMBAI: More than half of the state’s total mangrove cover was protected as a legal ‘forest’ at the end of 2021, up from 30% at the beginning of that year. This means that, to be diverted for any non-forestry purpose, project proponents must seek mandatory forest clearance (FC) from the forest department, in addition to the Bombay HC’s permission and CRZ clearance. Moreover, in case of any land use violation (such as illegal dumping, unauthorised clearing or landfilling of mangroves or hindrance to flow of tidal waters), the forest department will have the jurisdiction to take action against offenders and remediate the area. In effect, any kind of development will be practically impossible without being subjected to scrutiny by state and central authorities. On mangrove land that is not legally a forest, this responsibility lies with the land-owning agencies, either urban local bodies or special purpose vehicles. The increase of 23 percentage points from 30% to 53% in mangroves as forest follows a Bombay High Court order and subsequent litigation to ensure compliance with the direction. The state government in 2021 brought 2,427 hectares of mangroves under the purview of Section 4 of the Indian Forest Act (1927), and 9,785 hectares under purview of Section 20 of the Act (indicating that any third-party claims over the land have been settled after inquiries by appointed survey officers). Maharashtra’s total mangrove cover is approximately 32,000 hectares, of which 16,984 hectares are now legal forests, and require clearance under the Forest Clearance Act (1980) to be diverted for any non-forestry purpose. Of the remaining, close to 3,000 hectares of mangroves will be brought under the ambit of the act in 2022, officials said. This is because 13,000 hectares of mangroves have been identified as being on private land. “Any mangrove cover on privately owned land cannot be declared as a reserve forest. But they are nevertheless covered under the Environment Protection Act, as per the Coastal Regulatory Zone rules. So while it won’t require forest clearance to divert the land there is still a layer of protection. Besides, the Bombay High Court also has to give permission for diversion of mangroves as well,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forests (mangrove cell). Mangroves play an import role in coastal and intertidal ecosystems, fostering a range of biodiversity in addition to other ecosystem services including protection from flooding and storm surges, helping soil stabilisation, and being valuable carbon sinks. For metropolitan cities like Mumbai that are vulnerable to climate change, they are significant in mitigating its adverse impacts. In 2021, a total of 927 hectares of mangroves in Ratnagiri, 121.8 hectares in Palghar, and 1387 acres in Thane district were brought under Section 4 of the Forest Act, while 3,090.9 hectares in Mumbai’s suburbs, 2,302 hectares in Raigad, 2013.5 hectares in Thane, 2004 hectares in Palghar and 374.5 hectares in Sindhudurg district were brought under purview of Section 20. “This whole process starts by first declaring the mangrove site as a reserved forest under Section 4 of the Forest Act, which we had done even earlier, starting 2015. What follows, as per Sections 6 to 19 of the Forest Act, is the process of settlement of any rights that other parties may claim over the land. Following this, some portion of the land may be excluded from the final notification under Section 20,” Tiwari explained. A significant development in mangrove conservation in the past year also includes the transfer of mangrove land by government agencies to the forest department for safekeeping. In 2021, a total of 1,810 hectares of land were handed over to the mangrove department for safekeeping by the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation, the Mira-Bhayander Municipal Corporation and the City Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO). “Just over 3,000 hectares of mangroves on government land are expected to be transferred to us in the new year, with a major chunk of about 1,400 hectares being in Vasai-Virar, 900 hectares at the Jawaharlal Nehru port in Uran and another 800 or so hectares scattered across other bodies,” Tiwari said. As per data shared by the state forest department, a total of 715,352 mangrove saplings were planted on 161.47 hectares of degraded land across Maharashtra’s coastal districts in 2021. This restoration drive is slated to continue between 2022 and 2026, with 3100 hectares of mangrove swamps slotted for plantation work in this period with the aid of the Green Climate Fund of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), of which the forest department has already received ₹4.7 crore. “Further tranches will be released once we have finished spending the initial installment,” said Tiwari. BN Kumar, a Navi Mumbai-based activist, who has been campaigning for better protection of mangroves in and around Uran, said that the area of pending takeover could be much more than 3,000 hectares. “The forest department is yet to consider mangroves under Navi Mumbai SEZ which are huge. They have not yet asked the consortium for information on mangrove cover, even though the land belongs to CIDCO, which has an ownership stake in the SEZ. So those lands are government lands, and the mangroves should rightly be brought under the ambit of the Forest Act. Our request to the chief minister has been referred to the environment and forest departments for action,” said Kumar, who runs the NGO NatConnect Foundation.

This is the biggest jump in single-day case count in the national capital since May 21 when 3,009 infections were logged amid the second wave of the pandemic. The cumulative tally of the city now stands at 14,50,927.The case positivity rate of Delhi has touched a worrying 3.44%, which is also the highest since May 21 when it was 4.76%. Notably, the case positivity rate has been consistently witnessing an increase with it being 2.44% on Friday and 1.73% on Thursday.The national capital also confirmed the first death due to coronavirus in 2022, thereby taking its death toll to 25,108, according to the health bulletin data. Delhi logged as many as nine deaths last month, which was the highest monthly toll in four months.The only good sign that remains is the rising daily recoveries. On Saturday, Delhi reported a total of 765 new recoveries as opposed to 467 on Friday and 423 on Thursday. The total number of patients recovered from the virus has climbed to 14,19,459.Also Read | 'Highest ever surge in world': Centre asks states to set up makeshift hospitalsOwing to rapid growth in single-day cases, containment zones in Delhi has also been seeing sharp rise. On Saturday, the numbers rose to 1,243 as against 914 on the preceding day. The number of occupied beds in hospitals also increased to 247 on the first day of the year from 226 on Friday and 189 on Thursday.The health bulletin specified that these beds also comprise patients, who are suspect cases of Covid-19. On Friday, the Centre and the ICMR asked all states and Union territories (UTs) to test every individual with fever with/without cough, bodyache, fatigue, recent loss of taste or smell, sore throat, headache and diarrhoea as symptoms. The government also stated that these people should be considered as a suspect case of Covid-19.Delhi is currently under a yellow alert as part of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in which all educational institutions, cinemas and gyms have been shut down. Furthermore, restaurants, bars, buses and metros have been directed to function at 50% seating capacity. There is also a night curfew between 10pm and 5am.The spike comes amid the Omicorn outbreak that has so far been detected in more than 20 states and UTs in India. Of the total 1,431 Omicron cases confirmed in the country, Delhi has the second spot with 351 infections, behind Maharashtra's 454.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-starts-2022-with-over-2-000-new-covid-19-cases-one-fresh-death-101641043296700.html
01-01-2022||Pune||Delta still the dominant strain in December samples||PUNE According to officials, out of the 435 samples that have been genome sequenced at various Pune labs, only 13 samples have tested positive for the Omicron variant while others have tested positive for the Delta variant or its sub-lineages. While hundreds of samples are still to be sequenced and are in process, experts say that if the doubling rate of the city goes at about two-and-a-half-days as it is happening in the UK and other countries, it would be evident that Omicron has become dominant. However, as of now, based on the genome sequencing results, it is clear that Delta still appears to be dominant in Pune. These samples are selected randomly of Covid-19 positive patients through community surveillance who do not necessarily have foreign travel history or have come in contact with any such person who has travelled to affected countries. A senior doctor at BJ Medical College requesting anonymity said, “Out of the 339 samples which IISER genome sequenced from Covid-19 positive patients from Pune, only seven tested positive for Omicron whereas of the 96 which BJ Medical College sequenced, only six tested positive for the new variant. Rest of the samples tested positive for either the delta variant or its sub-lineages. All these samples were selected randomly through community surveillance and date from December 1 to 31. We can safely say that even now the Delta variant is very much dominant and that Omicron, although present in the community, is not very widespread.”Pune has various centres which are involved in genome sequencing- Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Centre (IISER), BJ Medical College, National Institute of Virology (NIV) and National Centre for Cell Sciences (NCCS) which are also part of the PuneCOG initiative which focus on sequencing samples from Pune and INSACOG initiative which sequence samples from across the country.Dr Rajesh Karyakarte, head of Microbiology Department at BJ Government Medical College said, “Although Omicron is being reported, Delta continues to remain dominant as evident from the sequencing results. It is crucial to remember the Sars-CoV-2 continues to mutate and so each new variant of concern brings a new challenge, however, as far the new variant is only simmering and does not explode it is fine. Once the virus spreads and explodes in its distribution among the public no matter how mild it is seen today, the sheer rise in numbers will add load on the already exhausted health machinery. It will add pressure on the oxygen and drug requirements and the manpower at the hospitals.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/delta-still-the-dominant-strain-in-december-samples-101641045006405.html
01-01-2022||Pune||Covid vax drive gains pace, 1.84 mn doses administered in Pune dist in December||PUNE As the Covid-19 cases is increasing, Pune district is reporting more vaccinations. After a drop in vaccinations in October and November, more doses were administered in December last year, as per data available on the Co-WIN dashboard.In December more than 1,844,000 doses were administered in the Pune district as per the data available on the Co-WIN dashboard. Almost 104% of the population is vaccinated with the first dose and 75% of the eligible population is now vaccinated with both doses.Currently, Pune district is in the second spot in the state in terms of vaccinating the eligible population, while Mumbai stands in the first place.“As the threat of Omicron is looming, the flow of people at the vaccination centres has increased. In the last two months (October-November) response had dropped, but now people have started taking their shots,” said additional district health officer Dr Abhay Tidke, Pune Zilla Parishad.As per the numbers available on the Co-WIN portal in August and September almost 1.75 million and 2.55 million doses were administered in the district respectively. But this response dropped in the subsequent months. In October and November, almost 1.6 million and 1.1 million doses were administered respectively. With more than 1.8 million doses being administered in December, vaccination again gained pace. One more contributing factor for the rise in the numbers is the targeted efforts by the administration to encourage people to get the jab and to remove vaccine hesitancy.“Now we are tracking those who are eligible for the second dose. As new beneficiaries are coming up the numbers are updated. Some beneficiaries hesitate in taking the second dose. So, in our blocks and in our health facilities, we have prepared the lists of beneficiaries who are due and they are distributed in the centres where they had taken the first dose. We have arranged call centres and daily one call is made to them to take a second dose. But some of these people have migrated or are now in different districts,” said Dr Tidke.The overall vaccination number in the state has also increased in December. As per Co-WIN 19,144,408, vaccine doses were administered in the state in December. And 87.16% eligible population in the state has received the first dose and 57% of the eligible population has received both of the doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-vax-drive-gains-pace-1-84-mn-doses-administered-in-pune-dist-in-december-101641044759953.html
01-01-2022||Mumbai||443 cases registered in Thane for traffic violations on New Year eve||Thane traffic police have registered 443 cases of traffic rule flouters on the New Year eve on Friday while no accidents were reported.Thirty six teams were formed to take action against those who violated the traffic rules.Police officials said on Saturday that 443 people fined on December 31 with the latest fine system were less compared to the last few years.Till Saturday morning, 297 challans were issued for drunk-driving, 131 for dangerous driving, 15 for riding triples. On the eve of 2021 New Year’s Day, Thane police had registered 623 cases of drunk-driving while in the preceding year, the corresponding number was 1,673.Last year, even though there was a strict lockdown, more cases were registered. Officials claimed that the reduction in the number of December 31 cases is due to strict action taken by police since December 1 and also an increase in the fine amount.Balasaheb Patil, DCP (traffic), Thane, said, “These cases are registered across all the five zones of Thane. We had 36 teams standing at every important point. Also, we had done an awareness campaign on December 30 about increased traffic fines and that one should follow rules. Continued vigilance and strict action across December helped reduce the cases.” Also, adequate security arrangements had been put in place on New Year eve to implement the guidelines issued by the government keeping in view the spread of Covid, police added.Meanwhile, in Navi Mumbai, no untoward incident was reported within the limits of Navi Mumbai police commissionerate on New Year eve.With tight police bandobast, 44 drunk drivers were caught while 1,691 motorists were penalised for flouting various traffic norms including driving without wearing seatbelt, riding without a helmet and rash driving.“Bandobast was there at all major checkpoints. We also had nakabandi at various places,” DCP (traffic), Purushottam Karad, said.Panvel municipal commissioner, Ganesh Deshmukh, and his staff had also got on to the road for penalising the Covid rule violators. Action was taken against establishments that were crowded and those that continued to operate even after the stipulated time. Citizens who crowded public places and did not wear masks were also penalised.On December 29, a fine of ₹95,000 was recovered by the police. The fine amounts on December 30 and 31 were ₹1.87 lakh and ₹2.52 lakh, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/443-cases-registered-in-thane-for-traffic-violations-on-new-year-eve-101641044699848.html
01-01-2022||Pune||5.33 lakh in 15-18 years group eligible for Covid vaccination in Pune district||PUNE Starting from January 3, the Pune district administration will start vaccinating children aged between 15-18 years who have been made eligible for the first time, exactly a year after the government began vaccinating the adult population in multiple phases. A total of 533,000 teenagers are eligible to get the Covaxin dose, of which, 169,000 are in Pune city. The administration claims to have enough stock of the Covaxin and can get more stocks if required as promised by the state government, However, private hospitals are yet to be permitted to get the stock to vaccinate the younger population.Dr Sanjay Deshmuh, deputy health officer, Pune said, “We estimate that there are about 5.33 lakh eligible beneficiaries in the district and as of now we have about 2.5 lakh doses of Covaxin. We can get more stock if required. Those wishing to take the vaccine can show either an Aadhar card or a school or college issued identity card at the vaccination centres. We have about 40 centres in Pune city, 12 in PCMC and 25 in Pune rural. Out of the 5.33 lakh eligible beneficiaries, 2.51 lakh are from Pune rural, 1.69 lakh are from Pune city and 1.12 lakh from PCMC. We have allowed both online registration through the Co-Win app and also walk-in registration to make it smoother. The second dose needs to be taken after 28 days, which is in the next month, so hopefully we will be able to vaccinate this age group much faster than the other age categories.”Pune city has about 169,228 kids who are eligible to take the vaccine and the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) will be operating 40 centres which will be dedicated for this age group at each of the 15 wards in the city. All beneficiaries born before 2007 are eligible to get the shot. However private hospitals would not be able to start the vaccination as they are yet to get the permission for the same. Dr H K Sale, executive director at Noble Hospital said, “Private hospitals are yet to get the permission to start vaccination for beneficiaries and also only limited hospitals would have the Covaxin stock with them. So unless the government permits us and gives us enough stock we would not be able to vaccinate the younger population.” Dr Suryakant Deokar, Civic immunisation officer said, “We assume that there are close to two lakh beneficiaries aged 15-18 years, and also 50,000 and one lakh of the floating population as most students from other districts come to the city for education purposes. They only need to show their id cards issued by the college or school which would be enough for vaccination.” BOXHeadline: Shots for minorsStrapline: 15-18 age group to get Covaxin from January 3Pune district vaccination targetDistrict projected population 15yr to 18yr age (4.7%)Pune rural (47%) 5,348,881 251,397 PMC (32%) 3,600,594 169,228 PCMC (21%) 2,404,188 112,997PUNE district 11,353,663 533,622*Source: Pune circle health departmentNumber of vaccination centresPune city: 40PCMC: 12 Pune rural: 25What documents are needed?-All the beneficiaries can register themselves through existing Co-WIN or walk-in at vaccination centres-Beneficiaries can show either an Aadhar card or a school or college issued identity card at the vaccination centres||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/533-lakh-in-15-18-years-group-eligible-for-covid-vaccination-in-pune-district-101641043745787.html
01-01-2022||Mumbai||Navi Mumbai civic body to revamp Sagar Vihar in Vashi as proper tourist spot||In an effort to make Sagar Vihar along the Vashi creek a proper tourist spot, the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has undertaken a major revamp of the area.Once a happening place of the satellite city, this area has been lying neglected for the past two-and-a-half decades. The NMMC has now allocated a budget of ₹1.50Cr to revamp it so that the area can pull the crowd like earlier.Arvind Shinde, executive engineer of NMMC said, “The land of that area earlier belonged to CIDCO and hence we were unable to do anything there. Recently, CIDCO transferred the land to us, and accordingly, we planned to give it a facelift. Apart from the main entrance, we will develop stamped concrete pathways (in an area of 1,500sqm) so that the local residents come and walk there. We will barricade the entire area and then plant bamboo trees as partitions. The space between every two partitions will be turned into landscaping areas.“We are also planning to develop two pergolas where the residents can come and sit in their leisure time. Those will be developed in such a way that the entire area can also be used as an amphitheatre, and different programmes can be held there,” he said.Divya Vaibhav Gaikwad, the local corporator of the area, said that there will also be a sculpture near the main entrance that will show a child right from its birth till old age. For the entertainment of the children, there will also be a fountain.Gaikwad said, “In the 1980s and the early 1990s, a private company used to operate a hovercraft at Sagar Vihar and people used to enjoy the rides. That area was well maintained then. When NMMC came into existence in the early 1990s, CIDCO stopped paying attention there and the company also stopped the rides citing poor responses. Despite having resources, NMMC was unable to develop it as CIDCO was the owner of the land. We had been following it up for several years, and two CIDCO MDs and five NMMC commissioners changed during that time. Finally, CIDCO agreed to transfer the land to NMMC.“Once NMMC develops the area, we will approach the authorities concerned and request them to restart water taxis. CIDCO has recently developed a jetty in Belapur for running water taxis between Navi Mumbai and Mumbai. So, we will try to do something similar in Vashi also in the second phase.”

The civic body has started identifying the roads for safety audit through IIT Mumbai.For the first time, KDMC has decided to audit the roads in the city to make it safer for citizens, as every year the roads develop numerous potholes during monsoon.“This initiative by the civic body is to learn more about the roads and make it safer for the people. The audit will help give a deeper insight about the roads and take necessary steps for the future,” said Sapna Koli, city engineer, KDMC.Primarily, a team of IIT Mumbai would work in identifying such roads in the city that need a detailed audit. To identify such roads, the team is awaiting the data records of road accidents of the last two to three years in Kalyan-Dombivli from the police.“Based on the data, we can see which roads have a large number of accidents and accordingly will help identify the roads that require detailed audit. We are waiting for the records to be given to us. Once we get them, further audit work will be conducted,” said a representative of IIT Bombay.The KDMC has appointed IIT Mumbai as consultant for road safety audit for which the work order was given on March 19, 2020 for the duration of one year. However, due to the Covid pandemic-led lockdown, the work was delayed. The institute has now commenced the work for audit.A total of ₹7lakh is being spent for the safety audit of the roads.Earlier, in KDMC limits, several accidents due to potholes were reported following which residents and activists have demanded safer roads in the city. In July 2018, a 26-year-old Kalpesh Jadhav died due to potholes at the Gandhari Bridge in Kalyan. Jadhav, a resident of Nandkar village, Bhiwandi, was crushed under a trailer after he fell off his bike because of the pothole.“There are several roads in Kalyan and Dombivli that are cement-concretised and are safe during monsoon as they don’t develop potholes. Asphalt roads are unsafe as they have numerous potholes every year during the rainy days. Concretisation of most of the roads will help make it safer for the motorists,” said Anuj Patil, a 27-year-old resident of Manpada, Dombivli.SCOPE OF ROAD AUDIT*** Analysis and identification of road sections in KDMC area and intersection for safety audit.*** Detailed road safety audit of intersection/road length adopting best international safety audit practice and giving recommendations for safety improvement. *** To issue final certification about the work carried out as per recommendations.ROAD DETAILS IN KDMC LIMITS440km: Total length of road 55km: Cement concrete road385km: Asphalt roads35km: Roads in Dombivli MIDC proposed for concretisation, work to be carried out by MMRDAPOTHOLES – DEATH TRAPSJuly 13, 2018 : A 26-year-old Kalpesh Jadhav died because of a pothole at Gandhari Bridge in Kalyan.

01-01-2022||Mumbai||Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation fire department received 25% fewer calls in 2021||There were 25% fewer calls for fire accidents reported in 2021 as compared to the previous year. While the fire department received 1,688 calls in 2021, it had received 2,227 calls in 2020.Fire officials from Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation claimed that due to the pandemic, most of the industries and companies were shut down in 2020 and hence the fire incidents reported were more.“Lack of people’s presence in the industries was the main reason for the higher number of incidents as there was no one to look after the maintenance of the equipment and also to douse the fire at the beginning itself. With complete lockdown, there was a lack of inspection by the fire department as well,” chief fire officer, Shirish Aradwad, said.Apart from fire incidents, fire stations receive various calls of rescue, emergency and during accidents. “Any incident that requires saving a life or property, fire stations can be called. We do not take any calls lightly and do our best to reach the spot immediately,” a fire officer said.In cases of accidents, when a person is stuck inside a vehicle or when a heavy vehicle turns turtle, fire stations are informed. “We are also called to rescue birds and animals that are probably stuck somewhere and are unable to move. Instances where there is an oil spillage or a chemical spillage, where vehicles tend to skid, we take those incidents as emergencies. Cases of gas leakage or rescuing a person who would have jumped into water are also considered as emergencies.

On December 20 it was 20,443.“The passenger traffic has reached around 20,000 on a daily basis. When 24 hours operation started, we were expecting numbers to go somewhere near 30,000 but due to the Omicron threat many flights for new destinations were cancelled and many people cancelled the travelling plans as well,” said an official from the Pune airport.The officials were expecting 90 flights after 24 hours of operation.“The number has still not gone above 70, steadily it is increasing. Many airlines are still not starting flights for new places as different travelling restrictions are placed in different states and once everything is normal, we will see flight numbers going up,” he said.In pre-Covid days the airport has seen passenger footfall of, 28,000-30,000 passengers in a day.“Now let’s see how the situation of Covid 19 improves, once it is normal, we will see a surge in flyers as well as flight,” added the official.Ritesh Loda, a flyer, said, “We have to deal with long check-in queues in Pune so many are still avoiding night flights from the city as they have to wait for longer duration as compared to other airports.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/omicron-threat-affects-passenger-traffic-at-pune-airport-101641039779309.html

Kids are more vulnerable as they have not received the Covid-19 vaccine yet. By considering this instead of waiting for state guidelines, the municipal corporation needs to make a decision at the local level.””I spoke with various officers and they too agree with the same. If the kids get infected in large numbers, it will create panic, by considering that quick steps are expected,” he said.An official from the municipal administration on anonymity said that they have discussed the issue with the municipal commissioner. It is decided to brief the political leadership about it and a decision will be taken soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/politicos-appeal-to-municipal-commissioner-to-shut-schools-in-pune-amid-surge-in-covid-cases-101641039539236.html

Nodal officers will also be appointed in due time for handling Covid victims’ bodies, and for mass sanitisation drives,” said SS Rohilla, public relations officer, MCG.Following the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in April, the MCG had started operating each of these measures with less than 10% of its usual staff strength and deputed officials to other civic roles.Gurugram has been witnessing a steady rise in the Covid-19 cases in the past few weeks. On December 1 this year, the total number of Covid-19 cases in the city since the start of the pandemic stood at 181,709, with only 67 active cases. On December 30, the district had 182,682 Covid-19 cases, with 660 active cases, according to the data from the district health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugram-civic-body-to-reactivate-covid-measures-101641038519165.html

The suspect, Arif who is a resident of the same village, was arrested on Wednesday, police said, adding that the skeletal remains of the boy’s body were recovered from Rajasthan’s Alwar. According to police, the victim, a class six student, had gone for tuition on August 24 and never returned home. His parents found that some money was missing from the almirah and complained to police and a missing report was lodged at Pinagwan police station on August 26, police said. Shamsher Singh, deputy superintendent of police, Punhana, said that the boy’s father had sold a plot for about ₹4 lakh. “The boy initially stole ₹50,000 and used the money for shopping and partying with his friends. He also told his friends who were senior to him that there was more money kept in the house. His friends conspired and planned to encourage him to steal money and flee with him to another city,” he said. Police were tracking locations of two suspects who were frequently travelling from Pinagwan village to other cities and found the location in the village on Tuesday following which teams were formed and he was arrested from his house, said the officer. Singh said that the suspect revealed during questioning that he, along with his friend, lured the victim to Gurugram and later boarded a bus for Haridwar where they spent a week. “From Haridwar, they went to Rajasthan’s Sariska where they both strangulated the boy and fled to Mumbai,” he said. Police said the suspects regularly kept visiting the village so that no one could suspect them but a few villagers had last seen the boy with them and had informed his father following which he asked police to arrest them. Singh said two police teams were sent to a spot near Sariska in Alwar to collect DNA samples. Police said the suspects spent ₹3.70 lakh in these months on travelling. Raees Khan, father of the victim, said, “The suspects used to often visit our house and were friends of my son. But now they are the killers. All this happened just for money,” he said. Singh said they are conducting raids to arrest the second suspect who keeps changing his locations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nuh-cops-arrest-man-for-killing-11-year-old-boy-in-rajasthan-101641037558957.html
01-01-2022||Mumbai||Event management pro arrested for making obscene video calls to woman in Kalyan||The issue of misuse of technology for criminal activities is once again in the spotlight after the Mahatma Phule Chowk police arrested an event management professional for allegedly making obscene video calls using international virtual number software.Initially conceived for businesses that need to make a large number of calls on a daily basis for purposes of sales and marketing, international virtual number software generates random mobile numbers that flash on the recipient’s caller id. The idea behind the technology was for the business owners to avoid revealing their personal numbers, but, as with all technology, cybercriminals quickly realised its value and started using it to mask their identity while committing crimes.According to police officials, the victim registered a complaint with them on December 29 last year. In her statement, the victim said that she had been getting obscene messages and video calls from multiple unknown numbers from December 12, and that the offender was covering the camera to hide his face during the video calls. The police registered a case against unknown persons and started investigating based on all the numbers from which the victim had received the calls and messages.“We realised that the accused was using virtual international number software in order to hide his identity. Hence, we sought assistance from Thane cyber cell and, using technical investigation methods, identified the cellular as well as internet service provider whose services were being used by the accused. We contacted both the service providers and sought details of the Internet Protocol (IP) address that the accused was using,” senior police inspector Ashok Honmane, Mahatma Phule Chowk police station, said.Using these details, the police identified the accused as Gurdeepsingh Khalsa (27), a resident of the Ulhasnagar Camp No. 5. The accused was picked up from his residence on December 30 and, during questioning, allegedly confessed to having committed the crime.“The accused works in the event management industry. He shoots videos with various female models and uploads them on his YouTube channel. The accused has said that he had approached the victim as he wanted to shoot a fashion video with her. But, she had refused, which had angered him. Hence, he started to make obscene calls and send obscene messages to her,” Honmane said.Khalsa was placed under arrest and charged with outraging a woman’s modesty. He was produced in court and remanded in police custody till January 2. Police are finding out if he has targetted other women in the past.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/event-management-pro-arrested-for-making-obscene-video-calls-to-woman-in-kalyan-101641037138924.html
01-01-2022||Delhi||Time to read the fine print of consumer law to punish unfair trade practices||New Delhi: The hospitalisation of 16 children and the death of three of them, following administration of a cough syrup containing dextromethorphan during September-October this year in Delhi and another equally tragic incident involving 15 children and the death of nine of them in Jammu and Kashmir last year from an adulterated cough expectorant, throw up serious questions about the safety and efficacy of cough medications for children. It also brings to the fore the need to hold pharmaceutical companies accountable under the Consumer Protection Act too and force them to pay hefty compensation and punitive damages to the victims, in addition to prosecution under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act.I will discuss the safety and efficacy of these cough medications in another column, but this week, I wish to emphasise the urgent need for payment of adequate compensation to the families, whose children suffered the consequences of consumption of these cough preparations - both in J&K and in Delhi. And I would urge the consumer affairs ministry in both the states (or at the Centre) which are empowered to take up such class action suits on behalf of consumers, to immediately seek the intervention of the consumer courts. In fact the Consumer Protection Act provides for just such contingencies by defining a ‘consumer’ as not just an individual consumer or a voluntary consumer organisation, but also the central government, any state government and the central authority.Unfortunately, most state governments are not even aware of this provision , that paves the way for such petitions to be filed by governments on behalf of victims of unsafe products and services. This compensation is very different from what the governments may give as ex-gratia and is basically meant to hold the wrong doer accountable for violations of the rights of consumers, particularly the right to safe goods and services. It is for this reason that the law also provides for award of punitive damages. The compensation package of course should be worked out in such a way that it should serve as a deterrent to companies that take consumer safety lightly and play with the lives of children. In the Udhampur case, for example, the cough syrup Coldbest –PC manufactured by Digital Vision, Himachal Pradesh, was found to be contaminated with the nephrotoxic chemical Diethylene Glycol, leading to the recall of the drug from eight states in the beginning of last year. Subsequently in August, 2020, another cough syrup-Cofset AT manufactured by the same company was ordered to be recalled following a case of renal failure in a child.What is most shocking here is that the pharmaceutical company did not do due diligence before releasing the cough syrup into the market. And this is inexcusable given the fact that the extreme toxicity of Diethylene Glycol is well documented. In fact there have been mass poisoning cases from this chemical around the world. In the United States, the death of over 100 patients in 1937 from consumption of Elixir Sulfanamide containing diethylene glycol, led to the birth of their law on drug safety. India too has had its share of DG deaths, perhaps the last one being in 1998, when 36 children aged between two months and six years were admitted to two hospitals in Delhi with symptoms of acute renal failure caused by Diethylene Glycol contamination of a cough expectorant . As many as 33 children died as a result.In the Delhi cough syrup tragedy, the Delhi government is inquiring into whether the incidents were caused on account of sub-standard cough syrup or it was a case of drug overdosing. The Director General of Health Services, union health ministry, in the meanwhile has recommended that the cough suppressant Dextromethorphan manufactured by Omega Pharma be withdrawn in larger public interest. It has also warned that cough syrup dextromethorphan should not be prescribed for children below four years of age. Here again, depending on the report of the inquiry, those responsible for the suffering of the sixteen children will have to be held accountable under the consumer protection law too and made to pay hefty compensation. Meanwhile, parents have to be educated on the side effects of these medications. We in India have for long used natural remedies for cough and cold, particularly in children. These need to be nurtured, propagated and practised.
01-01-2022||Delhi||Cheers 2022! Delhi-NCR’s resolutions are aligned with the #NewNormal||The pandemic has changed people’s lifestyles in more ways than one can imagine. And as we enter a new year with a toast to a better, safer life, residents of Delhi-NCR tell us about their resolutions for 2022, and how their promises for this year have been influenced by the health crisis in the world. For the greater good Ashita Oberoi, a home chef in Kalkaji, is motivated to do her bit for society. “Last year, I devoted myself to Covid-19 patients and their care. I cooked for them and their families, and did whatever I could to make them comfortable. This year, I plan to connect with NGOs and help feed people. My aim is if I am cooking food for someone, I want to donate 50 extra meal boxes to an NGO that serves food to the underprivileged. I am already part of a group where I get leads for those who need help near my location. I resolve to help as much as I can,” Oberoi shares.Making mental health a priority Nancy Awasthi, a homemaker from CR Park, says she has realised the importance of taking it easy and focusing on her mental well-being. “After being at home for a year, I have realised that I don’t have to indulge in the social requirement of going to parties! I love taking care of my family, and being at peace with my decision to be at home is something I resolve to do this year,” she adds.Safety over socialising Meanwhile, Shubham Kumar, a software developer from Noida, aims to not take any risks with Covid-19 this year. “Most public places, like malls, are going to be not so accessible in the days to come. And even when they are, I plan to keep away to avoid any chance of infection. I had refused all New Year get-togethers as well. I’ll limit my physical interactions this year to just my close family members, in order to keep them safe. We continue to be a huge support for each other during the pandemic,” says Kumar.Cooking it up Dhruv Deshwal, a student from Indirapuram, realised his love for cooking during the second lockdown. “2021 was a revelation for me and I was surprised to discover that I enjoy cooking. Lately, I haven’t been able to cook much as I have been busy with college and stuff. However, I resolve to go back to cooking at least once every three-four days as it is quite therapeutic for me,” Deshwal says.Local trips FTW!“International trips plan hi nahin karne,” says Shifali Gupta, a finance associate from GTB Nagar. “I had a baby last year and my life revolves around him now. Due to Omicron and the rising spread of Covid-19, we will look for travel places within the city, like museum walks and picnic spots, once it’s allowed. Just spending time together with family,” she says.Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cheers-2022-delhi-ncr-s-resolutions-are-aligned-with-the-newnormal-101641036179138.html

This is sheer politics. I will meet him again on Monday along with my cabinet colleagues and if he still does not clear the file, I’ll sit on dharna,” the chief minister said.The Punjab cabinet had decided to regularise the services of the 36,000 employees working on contract in November.After passing it, the government sent The Punjab Protection and Regularisation of Contractual Employees Bill to the governor for his assent in the first week of December.Free travel for college, university studentsThe chief minister also announced free travel for students of colleges and universities from Saturday and declared that they can avail the facility by showing the identity cards issued by their educational institutions.“The students can make the bus pass before March 31. By that time, they can avail this service using their identity cards,” Channi announced. He said 25,000 flats will be built and handed over to the economically weaker sections at nominal rates.“Whatever we have done in 100 days is more than what the previous dispensation (led by Capt Amarinder Singh) did in four-and-a-half years,” he added.

01-01-2022||Pune||Startup Mantra: Climbing the ladder of startup success as woman entrepreneur||Here is a ‘startup’ from ‘Bharat’ which is neither founded by any IIT-IIM alumni nor it is tech-based with VC backing or angel funding. It is a story of Amruta Vasant Mangale, a 32-year-old married woman from Pune, who pivoted twice to create a company with turnover of ₹5 crore in just two operational years hit by Covid-19 lockdowns and that too in a sector like manufacturing where women-entrepreneurs are uncommon. Launched under the brand name ‘Beestofix’, Amruta has now set her vision to turn her company into a ‘unicorn’ and create 5,000 direct or indirect employment opportunities. In the beginning… Amruta, a native of Indapur tehsil in Pune district, completed her MSc in Organic Chemistry from Pune University (Savitribai Phule Pune University). Her father insisted that she find a job to become financially independent before marriage. Accordingly, Amruta took a job as quality control officer at Sonai Dairy located on Baramati-Indapur road. Says Amruta, “The job was a turning point for me. It taught me how to handle a team and face challenges upfront. Girls, especially from rural areas, are not used to work with boys and lead an all-male group. I took this job as an opportunity to learn leadership and presentation skills. In turn, it also helped me to be more disciplined which later proved beneficial to me in setting up the business.” “Post-marriage, I came to Pune city in 2015. Till then I had never stayed in a city. I told my husband that I want to start working again and he too supported me. Since I was new to the city, I decided to travel alone and get to know the city and simultaneously looked for job opportunities. I kept on searching for job till 2016 but could not get one. I consider myself lucky in the sense that if had got a job I would have never thought of becoming an entrepreneur,” Amruta said. Restlessness Amruta was becoming restless at home as she knew that going ahead age would not be on her side if she starts late. When Amruta expressed her wish of starting a business, her husband and father-in-law too supported her. “Every woman needs 100 per cent support from her family and in-laws. This is her fundamental right,” asserts Amruta. “While searching for business opportunities, I noticed that CCTV cameras are being installed everywhere, including rural areas and from small shops to big commercial establishments. Since my husband was working in an electronics-based company in Ranjangaon MIDC, I decided to get into electronics services as I could utilise his domain knowledge. I searched on Google and started calling units in Bhosari MIDC to check if they had requirements of CCTV installation or other services,” said Amruta. “My first attempt at doing business was a mix of good and bad experiences. Some trusted me for being a woman while others did not for the same reason. Even today the mindset is not right towards women. Some don’t take us women seriously. I was often asked to confirm with ‘sir’ or ‘husband’ about the final rates for the products being sold. With CCTV installation services, I started my entrepreneurial journey. However, soon I realised that it’s not profitable in real terms. I had inventory stock of ₹1.5 lakh, including cameras, wires, DVR, hard disks, etc. It was a liability and setback for me,” added Amruta. Ecommerce success Amruta started looking for options to get rid of her inventory stock. While searching online, she came across ecommerce platforms which offered a chance of becoming online sellers. “I did not know that we needed only VAT and company name to register on these platforms as sellers,” she says. “We decided to form a company in the name of Hindavi Solution Pvt Ltd and enrolled it on an ecommerce platform. We had to provide inventory stock and estimated delivery period to start selling. I calculated the shipping charges, other costs and profit margins using an Excel sheet and uploaded the product photos on the site. Within a week I got my first order. Tasting success on one platform, Amruta soon enrolled on several other ecommerce platforms and the business took grip,” Amruta said. “I have this ‘never give up’ attitude which has helped me tide over all difficult situation till date. I joined ecommerce platforms in February 2017 and did a business of ₹1.5 lakh in just a quarter. Next year in 2017-18, it went up to ₹13 lakh. It boosted my confidence but the next year in 2018-19 it went down to ₹4 lakh as things took a different turn,” Amruta said. Manufacturing dreams Early success in ecommerce space sparked a debate in Amruta’s home. Amruta wanted to expand her existing business, while her in-laws and husband were of the view that she should dream big and setup a manufacturing plant. But Amruta was clueless about everything – right from what to manufacture, how to setup a plant to how to approach new customers. Says Amruta, “When I visited Bhosari MIDC, I saw several small suppliers providing spare items to big units. I started researching the companies that were functional in industrial areas in and around Pune and opportunities which I could encash. I noticed that packaging industry is big and the tape market is huge within this industry segment. Also, there were not many chemical industries around Pune. There are big companies in Pune who are tape manufacturers but they had to source tape adhesives, etc from out-of-state-located companies. There was no local supplier. Besides this, we made a list of 25 such business opportunities.” Pivot Like many others, Amruta also saw videos on YouTube about setting up companies but soon realised it is not as easy as it is made out to be. Also, some of the businesses they had shortlisted had very less profit margins. “We decided to make a product which is consumable and required in retail as well as industrial sectors. We started studying about adhesives, how they are made and machinery needed to produce it. We also analysed the tape industry, the payment cycle period, inventory costing, profit margins, etc. Companies manufacturing adhesives were not catering to local markets and were export-oriented completely. I sensed a huge opportunity here. I thought if I could look for local companies whose monthly consumption is 50 to 60 tonnes and tap just one tonne of it, then I can setup and get my business running,” Amruta stated. “Setting up an adhesive manufacturing plant is not an easy task. So, we looked for consultants from Pune and Mumbai. Some consultants supported while some sympathised or ridiculed as they thought we could not bear the huge costs involved in the process. One consultant helped me in starting the business on a small scale, but on the condition of complete advance payment. Instead of bulk orders, I paid only for some barrels and supplied those to local companies,” she added. Fresh start As Amruta focussed on the adhesive business opportunity, she lost focus on the ecommerce sales of electronic products and accessories. Amruta says, “I identified a plot in Chimbali area in Moshi and did an agreement with the owner. It was a 4,000 square feet plot and the owner built a shed structure over it. In October 2018, we did the groundbreaking ceremony. I sourced machinery from Nashik, purchased material and finally in January 2019, setup the plant with the help of a consultant.” “When I actually started production under our brand name ‘Beestofix’, I had only one employee and we were able to have only two or three batches of production per month. Companies were not ready to part with their existing suppliers. Numerous customer visits, slowly building trust and initially offering our product free for trial are the things which worked in my favour. But now I have completely stopped giving any free trials and I am proud to have achieved this in just two years. The first production order was delivered on March 30 and second big order was received within 15 days. Since then, we have never looked back,” said Amruta. Explaining the reason behind naming her product as Beestofix, Amruta says, “No one works as hard as a honeybee. The hexagon shaped structure of beehive is the best fixed bond – using least material to hold most weight – known to us and hence we derived the name ‘Beestofix’ from the words bees and best fix.” Customer acquisition Getting large-scale companies as customers was the next big challenge for Amruta. “I used to stand near their production line for hours. Once I demonstrated my product’s efficiency to a customer and they were surprised with the good quality outcome as compared to their earlier suppliers. That was the moment when I got the first big order,” Amruta said. Adding further, she says, “I realised that since most competitors were based out-of-state, I should capitalise on my strengths of prompt after-sales services. Soon, all happy customers started recommending us and the networking effect kicked in.” Diversification Says Amruta, “Once our first product of adhesive stabilised, I realised that we can’t stay put in the market with just single product. We were thinking of adding new product offerings and that’s when our customer themselves showed us the direction. Some customers suggested us to provide with colour pigments or tape colours along with adhesives. I had no clue of what it was, but promised them that soon I will deliver it to them. We did our research and trials and customers were happy with it. Soon, that product too became popular with other customers. We are now getting enquiries from Nashik, Goa, Aurangabad, Bengaluru etc.” Beetofix has also added two new products – printing ink on plastic rolls and adhesives for joining wood – to its range. Covid impact When Covid-19 outbreak started in Pune, Amruta had to shut her plant for two months. “It came as a shock for me personally and was also distracting for my employees. By then I had three employees and they were thinking of going back to their village. However, I requested them to stay back and promised to look after them and their families. I supported them financially and treated them as family. After the restrictions were relaxed, we followed Covid-appropriate behaviour, all sanitisation norms and checked temperature and oxygen levels daily. This benefited me post-Covid a lot,” she stated. Funding Raising capital for business was one of the toughest parts of Amruta’s entrepreneurial journey. She says, “I visited almost all banks to raise funds. Bank officials used to see my tax returns of last three years and either reject the proposal or asked for heavy security, collaterals. Finally, I had to sell all my jewellery, break all FDs and we had to sell our farm to raise funds to setup the manufacturing plant. This entire process was very painful and disappointing, but that’s when I decided that one day these bank officials will come to my company and offer me loan.” While Amruta managed to get the plant ready, she was in need of more funds. That’s when one of their customers asked Amruta to contact Bharatiya Yuva Shakti Trust (BYST), a not-for-profit organisation that primarily assists disadvantaged Indian youth in developing business ideas into viable enterprises under the guidance of a mentor. BYST helped Amruta with mentoring and creating a business plan, which enabled her to get a short-term loan of ₹20 lakh from a bank. Lakshmi Venkatesan, founding and managing trustee, BYST said, “For majority startups from ‘Bharat’, venture capital or angel funding is not accessible. They really depend on debt financing. Another big challenge for these ‘rural entrepreneurs’ or ‘grampreneurs’ is the ‘mentoring-barrier’. If we lose one entrepreneur like Amruta for lack of mentoring or funds, we are losing our ability to create 10 jobs. Hence, we focus on mentoring the entrepreneurs for two years and helping them with idea validation and further creating a robust business plan. Mentoring helps these same entrepreneurs – rejected earlier by banks – receive debt financing, even without security or collaterals.” Amruta has also won the ‘Young Entrepreneur of the Year 2020’ award on November 3, 2020 conferred by Youth Business International (YBI), UK. She competed with about a thousand entrepreneurs from 46 countries in this contest. -------------------------------- Sales and revenues Industrial adhesive - 70 tonnes daily Printing ink – 1,000 kg per month Colour pigment – 1.5 kg per month --- FY 2020-21 – ₹1.82 Crore FY 2021- 22 – Crossed ₹5 crore in Q2 --- Profit margin Industrial adhesive – 8- 10 per cent Retail adhesive – 13-15 per cent Future Plans “I have set a goal of achieving ₹10 crore turnover this financial year itself.

01-01-2022||Chandigarh||Only court can decide on SIT probe report in Hyderpora encounter: IGP Vijay Kumar||The Jammu and Kashmir police on Friday refused to get cowed down by the criticism of Valley’s political leaders and civil society over the Hyderpora encounter investigation saying only the court can decide whether their investigation was right or wrong, not media, politicians or families of those killed.Inspector-general of police (IGP) Vijay Kumar said that people have a right to seek a probe by a higher agency but they can’t tag the probe of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the police as wrong.“In a democratic set up, media, politicians or even family have the right to not agree with the investigation and demand a higher-level investigation like from the NIA, the CBI or the high court. We have no problem. But whether any investigation is right or wrong it will be decided by the court,” Kumar said at a press conference in Srinagar when asked about the criticism of the police’s special investigation team threatening to take legal action against those questioning its probe.Soon after SIT head DIG Sujit Kumar on Tuesday indicated no wrongdoing on part of the security forces in the Hyderpora encounter in which four persons, including three residents of J&K and a suspected Pakistani, were killed at a shopping complex on November 15 under controversial circumstances, almost all top leaders of mainstream political parties had questioned the probe by SIT.Next day, the SIT had warned political leaders for casting doubts upon the evidence obtained by SIT in the Hyderpora encounter case and threatened to take penal action which again caused outrage among the political leaders and civil society.“A SIT is investigating and a DIG-rank officer will charge-sheet and submit it to court which will decide whether it is right or wrong. This won’t be done by a politician, a family member or any media has no right,” Kumar said.“We have not given any clean chit. Each page will be judged by the court. I request and advise such leaders not to instigate the public. Let the court decide,” he said.Without naming anybody, Kumar also accused politicians of legitimising terrorism. He said that till 2-3 months back only militants would legitimise killings of civilians or police.“But unfortunately, some of our political leaders are also legitimising terrorism now. Mehran was a dangerous terrorist who killed many civilians. After his encounter, you take his photo and go to Jantar Mantar and cry tyranny. Is it wrong to kill a dangerous terrorist like Abbas Shiekh? You want to get sympathy. I want to tell our political parties and leaders to stop this. You are provoking society,” he said.People’s Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti had held a protest sit-in at Jantar Mantar in Delhi early this month against killings of “innocent civilians”.On being asked why J&K police were getting increasingly targeted by militants, Kumar said that the neighbouring country was afraid of them.“Today, if Pakistan is fearful of anything, that is Jammu and Kashmir Police. Militancy ends when the local police come to take the (central) role. J&K police are in a central role and will have to work more. Militancy is an obstacle to peace and development. Army and other forces will assist but J&K police will have to take the central role against terrorism,” Kumar said.“It is the modus operandi of Pakistan to demoralise the J&K police, but J&K police will continue to move ahead and work for neutralising all those who are enemies of peace and development,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/only-court-can-decide-on-sit-probe-report-in-hyderpora-encounter-igp-vijay-kumar-101640988352018.html

Do they not know that the electricity department doesn’t fall under the MC?”On AAP’s promise of free water, Kher said she had spoken about the issue in the Parliament in 2014 and worked out a water-sharing agreement with adjoining Punjab and Haryana. She also said she was “upset” with the people of Chandigarh for voting out BJP councillors “despite all the work they had done”. “When I was elected MP in 2014, the House was dominated by Congress councillors. No work used to be done and I was asked by officials to avoid attending House meetings and only come for voting. Will the same situation be the same in the house now,” she asked. City BJP president Arun Sood and outgoing mayor Ravikant Sharma were also present on the occasion, along with other BJP councillors and candidates who had fought the elections. Sood spoke about the achievements of the outgoing MC House and said the city has never seen so much development in the past. Outgoing mayor Sharma spoke about the new community centre and said that it had been built at a cost of Rs. 4.64 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aaps-promise-of-free-power-unfeasible-says-chandigarh-mp-kirron-kher-101640988051702.html

The principal secretary, AK Sinha, said the MC officials will have to bear any financial repercussions arising due to contractual clauses or litigation due to non-payment of dues. The civic body owes the company ₹11.83 crore for services rendered between July and November. The company has installed over 1 lakh streetlights across the city. Company officials had complained to the principal secretary about non-payment of dues and the absence of a standard procedure to get funds cleared from the civic body. On the civic body not having adequate funds to honour its liabilities, Sinha said no organisation should enter into an agreement which it cannot uphold, as it also blots the government’s reputation. “It is unacceptable that a bill’s processing period should exceed the billing cycle. Directions have been issued to make the payment at the earliest,” Sinha said. Alleging that not paying the company was a ploy to get private contractors to maintain the streetlights, former MC councillor Inder Aggarwal said, “How can the MC expect the lights to be maintained, if they are not paying the company.” Despite attempts to reach MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal, he remained unavailable for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/led-streetlight-project-principal-secy-pulls-up-ludhiana-mc-over-delay-in-payment-101640987811619.html

01-01-2022||Chandigarh||3 JeM militants killed, 6 security personnel injured in Srinagar encounter||The police on Friday claimed to have killed three Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) militants in Pantha Chowk. Six security forces personnel were injured in the encounter that ended on Friday.This is the third encounter since Wednesday night in which nine militants were killed. Police on Friday said that number of local militants came down to less than 100 first time after years.Inspector-general of police Vijay Kumar said one of the militants killed in the encounter was involved in the attack on the police bus at Pantha Chowk.Giving details about the encounter, Kumar said a cordon was laid at Pantha Chowk after receiving input about the presence of militants in the area. “There was firing from inside in which three police personnel and two CRPF persons were injured. The injured were hospitalised and are stable. Later, another person was injured. Three JeM terrorists were killed in the encounter.”Kumar said one of the militants had been identified as Suhail Ahmad Rather, who was involved in the Zewan terror attack on the police bus.“We are trying to identify the other two as well. It appears they are foreign terrorists,” he said.He said that this encounter was important because after the attack on the police bus on December 13, the police had promised that the killer will be neutralised soon. “The J&K police worked like a team and developed a small input which resulted in the success of this operation,” he said.Six militants and an Army jawan were killed in the encounters in Anantnag and Kulgam, which broke out on Wednesday night and ended on Thursday.The militants killed in the operations were identified as Sultan, alias Rayees, alias Mavia (a foreign national), Nisar Ahmad Khanday of Dudwangan Kapran and Altaf Ahmad Shah of Nathipora Dooru.

01-01-2022||Chandigarh||Improvement in ground situation in Kashmir: IGP Vijay Kumar||A top Kashmir cop on Friday said that there was an improvement in the ground situation in Jammu and Kashmir with 2021 marking a decrease in terror incidents, civilian and security forces’ killings, law and order issues and induction of youth into militancy as compared to 2020. Inspector general of police (IGP) Vijay Kumar counted the peaceful burial of hardline Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Geelani and the killing of maximum top commanders of militants as major achievements of 2021. “As the IG, Kashmir, my biggest challenge was the death and burial management of Syed Ali Geelani. Every IG would say that Geelani should not die in their tenure,” Kumar said at the year-end press conference in Srinagar. The authorities had imposed a clampdown across Kashmir after the death of the 91-year-old separatist leader in September with streets barricaded, internet and mobile networks snapped and key roads sealed to restrict the movement of people. Geelani, who spent around two decades in jail, had died after a prolonged illness. He was buried at a graveyard near his residence in Srinagar’s Hyderpora amid allegations by his family that the police had forcibly taken away his body. Among other things like killing of soft targets, narcotics and cybercrime, the police said their major challenge for the next year which they are currently facing is a ‘hybrid terrorist’. Kumar said after some attacks when they analysed the CCTV footage they found the involvement of some minor boys of 17 years of age about which even their parents were unaware. “Such type of people who indulge in terror incidents and kill people but there is no record of theirs in police stations, police and parents are unaware and even sister agencies are unaware. We have named them hybrid terrorists,” he said. He said that they identify them by their digital imprints by sending their devices to forensic labs. “We arrest them and then interrogate them to get to more such people. This challenge will continue. We have identified 25 such persons till now and will soon categorise them,” he said. Kumar said that there was a marked improvement in the ground situation in Kashmir in 2021 as compared to 2020. “Political parties and the media have been repeatedly claiming that the situation has not improved. Some even claimed that the 1990s situation has returned. The facts on the ground show that these claims are wrong,” he said. Giving figures, Kumar said that only 192 terror incidents were reported in 2021 as compared to 238 in 202. He said 34 civilians and 29 security forces personnel were killed in 2021 while the numbers were 37 and 57, respectively, in 2020. “This is despite militants having openly instigated saying they will kill civilians and politicians this year,” he said. He said the J&K police have been attacked 16 times this year in which 20 personnel have been killed. “We have solved all these cases. Some have been neutralised and some have been arrested except one case of Bandipora,” he said. Kumar said that as against 167 new recruits into militancy in 2020, this year there were 128 new recruits. “Of these 128, as many as 73 were killed in encounters, 16 were arrested and 39 are active in the field,” he said. He said that maximum recruitment happened in the Shopian district where 33 persons joined. He said that law and order incidents halved in 2021 than the previous year. As against 147 law and order incidents in 2020, there were 64 such types of incidents in 2021. The IG said that there were 168 identified and categorised active militants in the Valley of which almost the locals and foreigners are equal in number. “Almost 85 are locals and 83 are foreigners, besides 25 are hybrid,” he said. He said that 171 militants were killed in 2021, of which 152 were locals and 19 were foreigners. He said that they have recovered 127 assault rifles and 167 pistols. “The number of pistols is higher. It is almost equal to the number of terrorists killed,” he said. There were a series of attacks by pistol-borne militants in the Valley in 2021 many of which were against people belonging to minorities and non-locals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/improvement-in-ground-situation-in-kashmir-igp-vijay-kumar-101640987511652.html

01-01-2022||Chandigarh||Automobile registrations in Chandigarh accelerated by 24.96% in 2021||After the Covid outbreak and the resultant lockdown put brakes on vehicle registrations in 2020, dealers in Chandigarh had a chance to rejoice as the numbers showed a slight improvement in 2021. As per the data provided by the registration and licensing authority (RLA) and state transport authority (STA), there was a 24.96% increase in vehicle registrations in 2021, as compared to the year before. With an overwhelming majority of people opting for dealer-pointer registrations, these are seen as a marker of vehicle sales in the city. Though the registration numbers in 2021 were lower than pre-Covid times, city-based dealers say the problem is not with demand but with a shortage in supply. They added that vehicle sales are likely to reach pre-Covid levels by mid-2022.As per officials, there was an increase in the sales of cars as well as two-wheelers in 2021. The sales of electric vehicles also doubled from 370 in 2020 to 733 in 2021.Vice-president of the Federation of Chandigarh Regional Automobile Dealers, Ranjeev Dahuja said, “The rise could have been even higher, but the dealers are facing a shortage of stock. The demand of cars is almost 40% more than the supply.” Dahuja, who also owns a Tata dealership in the city, said that even a one-to-three month waiting period doesn’t deter people, most of whom still prefer premium SUVs over other cars.Prices may rise this yearNitin Mehan, the owner of Autopace Chandigarh and general secretary of the federation, added, “While there is a semiconductor shortage which has affected the supply, it is certain to get fixed by the second half of 2022. However, the price of some components used in making cars is going up in the global markets and a price hike of 4-5% can be expected within January itself.”While the sale of electric vehicles has increased, Dahuja, said it will still be a few years before the concept properly catches on in the city and charging infrastructure will be needed for that.The sale of two-wheelers remained less than cars, however, senior vice-president of Platinum Honda for the tricity Sushil Dutta said there is likely to be a rise in 2022. “There was around a 7% growth in our sales this year but we expect a further increase in 2022. As more offices stop with work from home, people will need vehicles. Because of Covid, there is also a push towards owning a vehicle, so we expect sales to rise further in the coming days,” said Dutta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/automobile-registrations-in-chandigarh-accelerated-by-24-96-in-2021-101640987331427.html

01-01-2022||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | Council defers hike in GST; garment traders rejoice||Hailing it as a ‘New Year’s gift’ for the sector, the textile and garment traders in the industrial hub of the state heaved a sigh of relief over the decision taken by the GST council on Friday to defer the increase in GST rate on fabrics, textile from 5 to 12 percent.The sector was exasperated when the government had earlier notified that the increased rates will be applicable from January 1, 2022. The manufacturers and traders said the hike in the tax rate would have not only impacted the business at large, the customers would also have been at the receiving end. The prices of the end products would have increased by around 20 percent, that too when the public is dealing with financial constraints amid pandemic.Traders bid revocation of notificationThe traders further demanded that after deferring the hike, the union government should permanently revoke the earlier notification as yet fear looms over the industry that the government can again increase the rate any time in future.Punjab Cloth Merchants Association (PCMA) president Sonu Nilibar said “The decision to defer the hike in tax rate is appreciable as the industry would have suffered a lot due to this decision. The production cost would have increased and ultimately the customers had to suffer as the cost of garments including ‘saree’ would have increased by around 20 percent. Traders and industrialists from across the country were mounting pressure on the government, who has finally paid heed to the problem,” said Nilibar. The hosiery traders in the hosiery hub of the state said the business is already moving through slump due to the ongoing pandemic and the hike would have pushed the sector on the verge of closure. Ludhiana Woollen Manufacturers Association and Knitwear Club president Darshan Dawar said, “The hike in the GST rate would have proved to be the final nail in the coffin as the sector has already been struggling due to the slump in the market amid pandemic. The purchasing capacity of the customers has already been reduced and the sector is relieved with the decision to defer the hike.”Members of Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal also appreciated the decision taken by the GST council. General secretary Sunil Mehra said the decision will give a boost to the trade. Some condemn the moveMeanwhile, a section of the industry also condemned the union government for unnecessarily triggering fear in the market.Condemning the move to notify the hike earlier and deferring the decision later, general secretary of the Knitwear and Textile Club Charanjiv Singh said, “It is not the first time that the union government has caused unnecessary panic in the market. It had done a similar experiment with the farmers as well, but had to withdraw the controversial farm laws at the end. Similarly, it had created panic by notifying a hike in GST rate for garments, which is unjustified and could have destroyed the hosiery industry.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-council-defers-hike-in-gst-garment-traders-rejoice-101640985950801.html

The CM returned to the state capital after he met Central leaders in New Delhi. He had flown to Delhi the day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended a mega rally in Mandi on December 27 held to mark the four years’ regime of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Himachal Pradesh. The party high command will definitely have its focus on Himachal and Gujarat after the polls are over in five states. “There could be a reshuffle in the cabinet as well as in the organisational setup,” said the CM. Speculation of the cabinet reshuffle has been rife after the party suffered electoral reverses in the bypolls to three assemblies – Arki, Jubbal Kotkhai, Fatehpur and Mandi parliamentary seats - from where former chief minister Virbhadra Singh’s widow Pratibha Singh trounced Kargil war hero, BJP’s nominee Kushal Thakur. “Modi’s rally had boosted the morale of the party. The gathering at the rally was historic, the CM said, adding that the party high command does not take any elections lightly. “The PM, Union home minister Amit Shah and national party chief JP Nadda do not take the elections lightly,” he said. “Moreover, Himachal is the home state of Nadda. We all will work hard for the assembly elections due next year,” he said. Jai Ram said the Congress in Punjab was in a disarray after the change of leadership. Similarly, there was turmoil in the Uttarakhand Congress. Thakur also commented on the internal strife in the Congress. “There is a turmoil in the opponent party. There are many leaders striving hard to pin down each other. The situation will be entirely different in the 2022 polls,” he said. The CM made clear that the PM will make repeated visits to Himachal next year to bolster the prospects of the party. “Covid has had a large impact, but we ensured that the development of the state does not take a hit,” he said, adding that he has asked Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman regarding the extension of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation facility for the next three years. He said the state was receiving GST compensation and revenue deficit grant (RDG) as a part of the Central assistance and out of this, the GST compensation is effective only till June 2022. Moreover, the RDG will also be reduced in the coming years as per the recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission, which will adversely affect the finances of the state. Therefore, the GST compensation facility should continue, he said.

The NCST gave direction that demarcation to be done by the Survey of India at the spot.In 2016, a team of surveyor-general of India visited the disputed border in the presence of high officials from both sides. The Survey of India substantiated Himachal’s claim on the territory still no solution to the issue was found as the officials representing the then Jammu and Kashmir government rejected the validity of the maps presented by officials of the surveyor-general of India. Himachal alleges that the Leh administration was not honouring the maps of SOI and not cooperating in carrying out the demarcation of boundaries to settle down the issue. There is another dispute at the Shinkula Pass border. Kargil district claims its territory up to Palmo village which is in fact 10 km from the border on the Himachal side.

With Panchkula observing a strict curfew from 11pm to 5am, and Chandigarh allowing clubs and hotels to open only till midnight, most clubs in the two cities did not hold any celebrations. The mood was comparatively cheerful in Mohali, which allowed late night parties, but allowed only fully vaccinated people to turn up. Playing it safeChandigarh Club had issued a circular a few days in advance saying that complimentary guest passes issued in the previous years will not be issued this year and a DJ night was organised for the members. The Chandigarh Golf Club also held a members-only event while Chandigarh Press Club also didn’t hold any celebrations.Strict checkingIn Sector 26, police presence was seen throughout the sector while teams of the UT administration were also seen issuing challans. Debdip Chaterjee, manager of the Great Bear Microbrewery in Sector 26, said, “It was like any other day for us. The restrictions have confused people, which affected the turnout.”Manish Goel, director of Social in Sector 7 and Swagath in Sector 26, said, “Clubbing saw a fairly good response but restaurants suffered the most. Police teams blocked the roads around Sectors 26 and 7, which dissuaded many people. The high number of Covid cases on Friday also affected the turnout.”Sector 17 remained mostly empty. Neeraj Bajaj, president of Business Promotion Council, Sector 17, said, “Sector 17 saw very less footfall, even lesser than 2020. The confusion related to vaccination certificates discouraged visitors from Punjab and Haryana.”Sector 22 also presented a desolate picture. As per the proprietor of Hotel Aroma, Manmohan Kohli, the response was even worse than last year. “The recent uptick in cases has affected the mood around here. When such bad things happen, people don’t want to go out and celebrate and it also hits the hospitality industry hard.”In Chandigarh, around 1,800 cops, including a special ‘Lady Police Squad’ were on duty. As many as 43 internal nakas and seven outer barriers were set up to check for drunken driving. The traffic police had created nine restricted vehicle zones. Around 350 traffic cops were also on duty.Huge footfall in Mohali mallAt VR Mall in Mohali, the mood was upbeat. A cashier here described how even last year a high footfall was seen here but the numbers were even higher in 2021.

Speaking while leading a peace march in Patiala, Kejriwal said, “Some people have started their dirty deeds. An attempt of desecration was made at the Golden Temple in Amritsar and a bomb exploded in Ludhiana. Such attempts are being made to break the communal harmony of Punjab and disturb the peace and tranquillity here.”Accompanied by AAP’s state president Bhagwant Mann and leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema, Kejriwal said the people of Punjab had no faith in these parties. Slamming Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi-led Congress government, Kejriwal said, “The ruling Congressmen are not concerned for Punjab as they are fighting among themselves for the chief minister’s seat. Channi government is the weakest Punjab has ever seen and it has failed to restore peace in the state.” The AAP supremo also questioned the timing of desecration of Guru Granth Sahib, bomb blasts and terror activities. “It all started just before the elections. That is why Punjabis need to be extremely vigilant and united,” he added. Kejriwal said in the Golden Temple lynching case, the Congress government had promised to identify and arrest the conspirators within 48 hours. “This announcement has not been fulfilled yet,” he said adding that peace and prosperity of Punjab would not be allowed to deteriorate at any cost. Kejriwal said people of Punjab were well aware of “selfish, opportunistic and mafia forces like the Congress, Captain, Badals and the BJP”. “Therefore, for the 2022 elections, the people have made up their mind to remove these corrupt people from powerful positions. The people of Chandigarh have recently shown this after Delhi,” he added. BJP pursuing policy of hatred: BhagwantAccusing the BJP of pursuing a policy of hatred, Bhagwant Mann said, “People of Chandigarh have shown that they wanted a policy of communal harmony and development. The state has to keep an eye on ill intenders because whenever elections come, sacrilege, bomb blasts and other incendiary incidents are carried out on the land of Punjab.”

Different statements were issued by chief minister Charanjit Channi, PPCC president Navjot Sidhu, home minister Sukhjinder Randhwa and DGP Siddharth Chattopadhyaya after the blast. Channi also tried to blame the SAD for the blast, he added. Akali leader Harish Rai Dhanda said that role of MLA Simarjit Singh Bains should also be probed in the blast as hearing of the rape case against him was scheduled on the day of blast. ‘Cong responsible for Golden Temple sacrilege’Grewal also alleged that the Congress was behind the recent sacrilege incident at the Golden Temple. He accused the state government of extending protection to those behind the heinous act. Seeks probe into ‘scams’ by AshuAccusing cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu of committing multi-crore scams, Grewal sought an impartial probe in the different cases of corruption, including scam worth hundreds of crore in purchase of gunny bags and increase in cash credit limit for buying paddy by ₹14,000 crore.

01-01-2022||World||Violence against women insults God, Pope voices in New Year's message||Pope Francis used his New Year's message on Saturday to issue a clarion call for an end to violence against women, saying it was insulting to God.Francis, 85, celebrated a Mass in St. Peter's Basilica on the day the Roman Catholic Church marks both the solemnity of Holy Mary Mother of God as well as its annual World Day of Peace.Francis appeared to be in good form on Saturday following an unexplained incident on New Year's Eve where he attended a service but at the last minute did not preside over it as he had been expected to.At the start of the Mass on Saturday, he walked the entire length of the central aisle of basilica, as opposed to Friday night, when he emerged from a side entrance close to the altar and watched from the sidelines.Francis suffers from a sciatica condition that causes pain in the legs, and sometimes a flare up prevents him from standing for long periods.Francis wove his New Year's homily around the themes of motherhood and women - saying it was they who kept together the threads of life - and used it to make one of his strongest calls yet for an end to violence against them."And since mothers bestow life, and women keep the world (together), let us all make greater efforts to promote mothers and to protect women," Francis said."How much violence is directed against women! Enough! To hurt a woman is to insult God, who from a woman took on our humanity - not through an angel, not directly, but through a woman," he said, in a reference to Jesus's mother Mary.During an Italian television programme last month, Francis told a woman who had been beaten by her ex-husband that men who commit violence against women engage in something that is "almost satanic".Since the COVID-19 pandemic began nearly two years ago, Francis has several times spoken out against domestic violence, which has increased in many countries since lockdowns left many women trapped with their abusers.Public participation at the Mass was lower than in some past years because of COVID restrictions. Italy, which surrounds Vatican City, reported coronavirus related cases on Friday and has recently imposed new measures such as an obligation to wear masks outdoors.In the text of his Message for the World Day of Peace, issued last month, Francis said nations should divert money spent on armaments to invest in education, and decried growing military costs at the expense of social services.The annual peace message is sent to heads of state and international organisations, and the pope gives a signed copy to leaders who make official visits to him at the Vatican during the upcoming year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/violence-against-women-insults-god-pope-voices-in-new-year-s-message-101641039621689.html
01-01-2022||World||European Union drafts plan to mark nuclear gas and investments as green||European Union has drawn up plans to label some natural gas and nuclear energy projects as "green" investments after a year-long battle between governments over which investments are truly climate friendly.The European Commission is expected to propose rules in January deciding whether gas and nuclear projects will be included in the EU "sustainable finance taxonomy".This is a list of economic activies and the environmental criteria they must meet to be labelled as green investments. By restricting the "green" label to truly climate friendly projects, the system aims to make those investments more attractive to private capital, and stop "greenwashing", where companies or investors overstate their eco-friendly credentials.Brussels has also made moves to apply the taxonomy to some EU funding, meaning the rules could decide which projects are eligible for certain public finance.A draft of the Commission's proposal, seen by Reuters, would label nuclear power plant investments as green if the project has a plan, funds and a site to safely dispose of radioactive waste. To be deemed green, new nuclear plants must receive construction permits before 2045.Investments in natural gas power plants would also be deemed green if they produce emissions below 270g of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt hour, replace a more polluting fossil fuel plant, and receive a construction permit by Dec. 31 2030. Such plants must meet other conditions including that they are technically equipped to burn low-carbon gases.Gas power generation would be labelled green on the grounds that it is a "transitional" activity - defined as one that is not fully sustainable, but which has emissions below industry average and does not lock in polluting assets during the shift to clean energy.The Commission could not immediately be reached for comment.EU countries and a panel of expert advisors will scrutinise the draft proposal, which could change before it is due to be published later in January. Once published, the proposal could be vetoed by a majority of EU countries or by the European Parliament.The policy has been mired in lobbying from governments for more than a year and EU countries disagree on which fuels are truly sustainable.Natural gas emits roughly half the CO2 emissions of coal when burned in power plants, but gas infrastructure is also associated with leaks of methane, a potent planet-warming gas.The EU's expert advisers had recommended that gas plants not be labelled as green investments unless they met a lower 100g CO2/kwh emissions limit, based on the deep emissions cuts scientists say are needed to avoid disastrous climate change.Nuclear power produces very low CO2 emissions but the Commission sought expert advice this year on whether the fuel should be deemed green given the potential environmental impact of radioactive waste disposal.Brussels finished the rules last year for parts of the green list including sectors such as buildings and transport and from this month investments not included in the taxonomy cannot be marketed as climate-friendly in the EU. The gas and nuclear rules will kick in later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-union-drafts-plan-to-mark-nuclear-gas-and-investments-as-green-101641038460298.html

According to the report, the highest number of injured were also reported from Balochistan where more than 50 per cent of the total injured were recorded.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was the second most affected region next to Balochistan, the report said.Experts are wary of Pakistan's role in Afghanistan, publicly supporting an end to the regional conflict but ultimately undermining any kind of peace that interferes with the self-interest of its leaders.They warn that such an act could backfire on Pakistan, especially on its military and intelligence establishment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/militant-attacks-rise-in-pakistan-after-taliban-offensive-in-afghanistan-report-101641029848877.html

Since 1991, as many as 2721 journalists have been killed around the world.The figure represents one of the lowest death tolls since the IFJ began publishing annual reports on journalists killed in work-related incidents, including targeted killings, crossfire fatalities as well as bomb attacks, IFJ said in a statement.The Asia Pacific region tops the regional list with 20 killings, before the Americas (10), Africa (8), Europe (6) and the Middle East and Arab World on just one. There was also a deadly accident that cost the lives of two journalists in Iran.While this decrease is welcome news, it is small comfort in the face of continued violence which claimed the lives of journalists in countries like Afghanistan (9), and Mexico (8). Other South Asian countries including Pakistan also recorded incidents of violence."This also provides further evidence for a recurring finding in these publications that more journalists and media workers more often than not are killed for exposing corruption, crime and abuse of power in their communities, cities and countries," read the statement.It further reported that the risks associated with armed conflict have reduced in recent years due to limited exposure for media professionals who are increasingly fewer in reporting close-ups from war theatre.At the same time, the threats of a crime gang and drug cartels' rule from the slums in Mexico to the streets of European cities in Greece and the Netherlands continue to increase and account for many targeted killings of media workers in 2021, the statement added."These 45 colleagues we lost to violence this year remind us of the terrible sacrifice journalists across the world continue to pay for serving the public interest and we remain in the debt to them and thousands of others who paid the ultimate price," said IFJ General Secretary Anthony Bellanger."The IFJ believes that the only tribute fit for the cause to which they gave their lives should be an unrelenting pursuit for justice to them. That's why we continue to advocate for the adoption of a new United Nations Convention for the protection of journalists which would ensure accountability for journalists' killings."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/media-federation-says-45-journalists-killed-in-2021-101641029855110.html

Ramaphosa sat alongside her, with a matching necktie.The cathedral and the Table Mountain that rises above the city have been illuminated every night this week in purple, the colour of Tutu's clerical robes.Life-size posters of Tutu, with his hands clasped, were placed outside the cathedral, where the number of congregants was restricted in line with COVID-19 measures.Hundreds of well-wishers had queued on Thursday and Friday to pay their last respects to Tutu as he lay in state at the cathedral. On Saturday, his simple coffin was once again wheeled into the church as the requiem Mass got under way.The choir then gave a resounding rendition of "Great is Thy Faithfullness".Tutu was widely revered across South Africa's racial and cultural divides for his moral integrity. He never stopped fighting for his vision of a "Rainbow Nation" in which all races in post-apartheid South Africa could live in harmony.Cape Town, the city where Tutu lived for most of his later life, was unseasonably rainy on Saturday as mourners gathered to bid farewell to the man fondly known as "The Arch" and often described as South Africa's "moral compass".As Anglican archbishop of Cape Town, Tutu turned St George's into what is known as a "People's Cathedral" a refuge for anti-apartheid activists during the turbulent 1980s and 1990s when security forces brutally repressed the mass democratic movement.His body will be cremated in a private ceremony after the requiem Mass and will then be interred behind the pulpit from where he once denounced bigotry and racial tyranny.A small crowd of around 100 people followed the funeral proceedings on a big screen at the Grand Parade, opposite City Hall where Tutu joined Nelson Mandela when he gave his first speech after being freed from prison.Mandela, who became the country's first post-apartheid president and who died in December 2013, once said of his friend:"Sometimes strident, often tender, never afraid and seldom without humour, Desmond Tutu's voice will always be the voice of the voiceless."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/funeral-begins-for-south-africa-s-anti-apartheid-veteran-desmond-tutu-101641028014106.html
01-01-2022||World||What is Florona, flu plus Corona, first detected in Israel? All you need to know||Israel has reportedly recorded the first case of Florona, which is believed to be a double infection of Covid-19 and influenza. According to reports, the first case of this was recorded this week in a pregnant woman who was admitted to the Rabin Medical Centre to give birth. Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth reported that the young woman was not vaccinated.The news of Florona comes at a time when the world is battling a new surge of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic driven by the new variant Omicron, which was first detected in South Africa in November 2021. The fast-transmissible variant has already spread to most of the countries and has overtaken the previous variant Delta in the US and UK.Florona, however, is not a new variant, to dispel misgivings, as it is believed to be the occurrence of flu and corona at the same time. Israeli doctors said Florona is being studied as Isreal has seen a surge in influenza cases in the last few weeks.Dr Nahla Abdel Wahab, a doctor at Cairo University Hospital, told Israeli media that Florona may indicate a major breakdown of the immunity system as two viruses are entering the human body at the same time.Israel has already begun administering fourth vaccine shots against Covid-19 on Friday to individuals with a compromised immune system.Experts have also flagged Delmicron, a combination of Delta and Omicron variants, which might have caused the surge in the US and Europe. Delmicron, too, is not a new variant but the attack of Delta and Omicron strains together. Commenting on Delmicron, Moderna's chief medical officer Dr Paul Burton has said it was possible that both the strains can swap genes and trigger a more dangerous variant. "There's certainly data, there have been some papers published again from South Africa earlier from the pandemic when people - and certainly immunocompromised people - can harbour both viruses," Burton was quoted as saying by the Daily Mail.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-is-florona-flu-plus-corona-first-detected-in-israel-all-you-need-to-know-101641027672824.html

So far, over 10 ministers and over 20 MLAs have tested positive for coronavirus. Everybody wants to be part of the celebrations of New Year, birthdays and other occasions. Keep in mind that the new variant (Omicron) spreads fast and hence caution is needed,” Pawar told reporters after visiting the Jaystambh monument in Perne village in the Pune district on the occasion of the 204th anniversary of the Battle of Koregaon Bhima.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi has appealed and some states have announced a night curfew. In Maharashtra, cases are increasing (particularly) in Mumbai and Pune,” he added.Among the infected ministers include revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat, school education minister Varsha Gaikwad, women and child development minister Yashomati Thakur and minister of state for urban development Prajakt Tanpure. All of them took to twitter to inform about being Covid-19 positive over the past one week.Other ministers and legislators who have tested positive for coronavirus include tribal development minister KC Padvi, MLAs Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, Sameer Meghe and Madhuri Misal.Notably, Maharashtra on Friday reported 8,067 fresh coronavirus cases, nearly 50% more than the previous day.Earlier, more than 2,300 people, who accessed the state legislature building during the five-day winter session, were tested for Covid-19, of which results of 54 came out positive. These exclude the ministers and MLAs mentioned above. Several House staffers, police personnel and journalists who covered the legislative proceedings were found to be infected.The secretariat had made it mandatory for all participating members to undergo Covid-19 tests twice during the assembly session — first at the beginning of the session and then after a gap of three days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-least-10-maharashtra-ministers-20-mlas-test-positive-for-covid-19-ajit-pawar-101641060600809.html
01-01-2022||India||India donates 500,000 Covid vaccine doses to Afghanistan||New Delhi: India on Saturday donated 500,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines to the Indira Gandhi children’s hospital in Kabul, and pledged to send another 500,000 jabs in the coming weeks as part of humanitarian aid for the people of Afghanistan.The vaccines were sent to Kabul via a flight of Iran’s Mahan Air, as there are currently no direct flights between India and Afghanistan. India had earlier sent 1.6 tonnes of life-saving medicines to the same hospital, drawing praise from the Taliban.“Today, India supplied the next batch of humanitarian assistance consisting of 500,000 doses of COVID vaccine (Covaxin) to Afghanistan. The same was handed over to the Indira Gandhi Hospital, Kabul,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement. “Another batch of additional 500,000 doses would be supplied in (the) coming weeks.”On December 11, the Indian government sent 1.6 tonnes of medicines to the Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health in Kabul on a special charter flight that also ferried 85 Afghan nationals who were stuck in India after the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. The same flight had brought 104 people, mostly Afghan Sikhs and Hindus, from Kabul to New Delhi a day earlier.The medicines were routed through the World Health Organization.India’s offer to provide 50,000 tonnes of wheat to Afghanistan via Pakistani land routes, however, has been held up because of conditions attached by Pakistan. On December 3, Pakistan said it would allow wheat and medicines to be shipped via the Wagah land border crossing in Afghan trucks, but it is yet to finalise modalities.India is committed to provide humanitarian aid to Afghan people consisting of food grains, one million doses of Covid-19 vaccines and essential life-saving drugs, the external affairs ministry said.India will undertake the supply of wheat and the remaining medical assistance in the coming weeks, the ministry said. “In this regard, we are in touch with UN agencies and others for finalising the modalities for transportation,” it added.An estimated 98% of Afghans are starving because of a spiralling economic crisis, conflict and drought, and this figure has increased 17% since August, according to the World Food Programme.“Afghanistan is facing an avalanche of hunger and destitution the likes of which I have never seen in my 20 plus years with the World Food Programme,” said Mary-Ellen McGroarty, the agency’s country director for Afghanistan. “We urgently need $220 million a month in 2022 to assist 23 million Afghans.”

There were nearly 80,000 pilgrims in the area at the time of the incident, according to estimates.“Twelve pilgrims died and 14 others were injured in the stampede in the market area near a body scanner,” duty officer Jagdev Singh said.Those injured were rushed to the Mata Vaishno Devi Narayana Superspeciality Hospital in Kakryal, he said.A statement from the Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board said nine of the injured were discharged after first aid and the rest were undergoing treatment.J&K director general of police (DGP) Dilbag Singh, who visited the shrine after the stampede, told reporters that preliminary information suggested there was a minor altercation among some boys, and within seconds, there was a stampede.“Police and officials of the civil administration were quick to respond, and the order within the crowd was immediately restored, but by that time, the damage had been done,” he said.Witnesses, however, alleged that the number of devotees was beyond the permitted level with flagrant violation of Covid-19 norms. Some survivors also accused the Jammu and Kashmir administration of “mismanagement”.“The Shrine Board said they were following Covid protocols and have imposed a cap of 25,000 devotees per day. How were there 200,000 people in the area at the time of the incident?” a pilgrim from Delhi asked.A shopkeeper in the area also blamed overcrowding for the stampede. “The Bhawan area in Trikuta Hills cannot cater to the heavy rush of pilgrims but the Shrine Board allowed a large number of pilgrims, which led to chaos and subsequent stampede,” he said.The pilgrims staged a protest in the area and sought a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the alleged lapses.The Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board, however, denied the charges saying all necessary arrangements were made in view of the expected rush.“An unfortunate stampede happened near Gate No. 3 at Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Bhawan. Rescue and evacuation operations were immediately launched by the Shrine Board authorities, District Administration and Police,” an official statement from the board said.The Board also said that on Friday and Saturday, only 35,000 pilgrims were allowed to proceed for the yatra against the normal capacity of 50,000 in view of the pandemic.“It is pertinent to mention here that the National Green Tribunal has capped the normal capacity of Yatra per day to 50000. Pertinently, keeping in view the COVID-19 Pandemic, 35000 pilgrims were allowed to proceed for yatra on 31st December 2021 and for 1st Jan. 2022,” the Board said in its statement.Officials present at the scene said that 12 people died on spot and their bodies were taken to a hospital in the Katra base camp.Condolences poured in from all quarters and Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to J&K lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha and Union minister Jitendra Singh to take stock of the situationThe central government is in constant touch with the J&K administration to assist the affected people, the PM said.Speaking at an event in Delhi, Modi said he was “extremely saddened by the loss of lives due to a stampede at Mata Vaishno Devi Bhawan. Condolences to the bereaved families. May the injured recover soon”.

Farmers will also get free electricity to drive pumps to irrigate their fields, he said.“This will be the first promise in the SP’s manifesto,” the former chief minister said. “And everyone knows that what SP promises, it delivers.”The Bharatiya Janata Party made every effort to ruin 2021, Yadav said at the party’s office in Lucknow. He also attacked the BJP government over tax raids in Kannauj and Kanpur.“I came to the conclusion that it was a snag in Digital India. Accidentally, the raid revealed tonnes of cash at the house of a person who is a BJP person,” he said. “And all the money that came out was not of the SP, but it might be of the BJP.” Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath was quick to slam Yadav over his poll promise of free electricity. “Now when elections are near, they are promising free electricity, but did not give electricity to people when they governed the state,” Adityanath said. “It was our government that provided electricity and constructed toilets.” Similar promises have been made by Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal of the Aam Aadmi Party at election rallies in Goa, Punjab and Uttarakhand, states that are headed to the polls with Uttar Pradesh.Last week, during his Vijay Rath Yatra in Unnao, Yadav had promised ₹5 lakh compensation to cyclists in a road accident and ₹5 lakh for death in a bull attack. He also promised an extension of the Kanpur metro to Unnao, and an expressway from Lucknow to Saharanpur.
01-01-2022||India||₹1.29L-cr GST kitty in Dec indicates robust economic activity||New Delhi: The Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection in December last year was ₹1,29,780 crore, marginally lower than the ₹1.30 lakh crore figure achieved in the two preceding months, but a 12.7% increase on an annual basis, official data showed on Saturday.The indirect tax revenue, a weathervane of economic health, in November surged to ₹1,31,526 crore, the second highest since the new tax regime was launched in July 2017 on robust recovery of business activities after the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic and increased compliance.Also Read | GST Council defers tax hike on textilesDecember was the sixth straight month when levies from goods sold and services rendered stood at over ₹1 lakh crore.The December collections were marginally lower than ₹1.31 lakh crore in November, government data showed, but were 25.8% higher than the revenues collected in December 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted economic activity.As the December number shows the volume of business transactions in November, there was no impact of the recent surge in cases of the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus, experts said. Some impact was expected in the next two months, depending on the extent of mobility curbs and restrictions on business activities, said MS Mani, partner at consultancy firm Deloitte India.Mani said the GST revenue in December was marginally lower by less than ₹2,000 crore, which is normal and doesn’t indicate anything amiss. “The GST collections reflect the continuing improvement in various macroeconomic parameters and appear to have now established a consistent trend over the past few months,” the analyst said.“The GST collection in the month is close to ₹1.30 lakh crore despite reduction of 17% in the number of e-way bills generated in the month of November, 2021 (6.1 crore) as compared to the month of October, 2021 (7.4 crore) due to improved tax compliance and better tax administration by both central and state tax authorities,” the finance ministry said in a statement. Electronic waybills are a digital compliance mechanism under the GST regime to track movement of goods.Despite the lower number of e-way bills, GST revenue is robust mainly because of increased contributions from services, experts said. “It is also accompanied by a continuing focus on implementation of technology based anti-evasion measures,” Mani said.The GST collections in December were “certainly impressive” given the “sequential drop in GST e-way bills” that had been seen during the festive month of November, said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at rating agency ICRA Ltd.“This performance can be attributed both to anti-evasion activities as well as the sharp growth in revenue from imports,” she said. During the month, revenues from import of goods were 36% higher compared to the same period last year.Notwithstanding the current increase in Omicron cases, the finance ministry expects “the positive trend in the revenues will continue” in the fourth financial quarter to March due to increased compliance.Average quarterly GST collection has been robust in the third quarter ended December at ₹1.3 lakh crore, compared to ₹1.1 lakh crore average in the first quarter and ₹1.15 lakh crore in the three months ended September.Out of the ₹1,29,780 crore gross GST revenue collected in December, ₹22,578 crore is central GST (CGST), ₹28,658 crore is state GST (SGST), and ₹69,155 crore is integrated GST (IGST) that include ₹37,527 crore collected on import of goods, and ₹9,389 crore cess on luxury items and sin goods, according to the finance ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/129lcr-gst-kitty-in-dec-indicates-robust-economic-activity-101641059760088.html

This can be done in coordination with organisations like Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). This will aid the process of rapid creation of field hospitals or temporary hospital set-ups,” the letter read.India on Saturday reported 26,663 Covid-19 cases, taking the overall tally to 34,887,184.States have also been advised to consider using hotel rooms and other accommodations in sync with Covid-dedicated hospitals to cater to patients showing mild to moderate symptoms, as was done in some states earlier.“It is imperative to re-emphasize the significance of timely upgrade in health infrastructure as with the sudden spike in Covid infections, we might witness increase in stress on health infrastructure,” Bhushan said.It is important for the states to monitor their home isolation protocol and its implementation at the field level, he said.“Special teams should be constituted to monitor all home isolation cases. Call centres and control rooms should also aid in the outbound calling while monitoring such patients and ensure that such cases are shifted to an appropriate health facility via dedicated ambulances,” he added.“A mechanism wherein citizen can call and get ambulance and a bed in a transparent manner needs to be operationalised. The call centres, district or state level dashboards/portals can also help in organizing the same.”Bhushan said that the states are also requested to ensure that the existing Covid-dedicated health infrastructure is revisited and necessary action to ensure its operational readiness is taken.“Focus should be maintained on rural areas and paediatric cases. States need to regularly review the availability of required logistics, oxygen availability and buffer stock of drugs across all health facilities,” he said.“Effective contact tracing coupled with quarantine of contacts, including facility quarantine for high risk and comorbid contacts, should be taken up at the earliest,” the health secretary said.“For a country like ours, even a small percentage would mean large numbers when talking in absolute terms,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head, pulmonary medicine department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi, stressing on preparedness. “It is good to remain prepared.”

The other three named are Jitendra Narayan Tyagi, formerly known as Waseem Rizwi, Annapurna Maa alias Pooja Shakun Pandey, and Dharamdas Maharaj, a general secretary of the Hindu Mahasabha.Police have added section 295(a) of the Indian Penal Code (insulting a religion with deliberate and malicious acts) to the complaint, Kumar said.“As assured earlier, police are taking all necessary action in the case as the probe is progressing,” he said.Police had on December 23 registered a case under section 153 (a) of IPC (promoting disharmony, enmity or feelings of hatred) against Tyagi and other unidentified accused at the Kotwali police station after videos of the event held on December 17-19 caused a furore on social media as there were calls for violence against minorities from the podium.On December 25, police added the names of Pandey and Dharamdas Maharaj, both hailing from Haridwar. The case is being investigated by a sub-inspector of police at the Kotwali police precinct.Experts, however, questioned the “delay” in police action in the case.“In such incidents, police should be very very active as communal issues are always very sensitive in our country. But here it seems to be the opposite, don’t know why. It should not have happened at all,” said senior advocate in Nainital high court, Kartikeya Gupta.Citing the sections of Indian Penal Code used in the case, Gupta added, “No section of IPC bars arresting. If the accused is not cooperating in the probe, then he/she could be arrested...”Army officer Lt Gen Gambhir Singh Negi (retd), too, criticised the “delayed” action. “What happened in the Dharma Sansad was completely against the principles of secularism which is the core of our constitution. How can anyone call for violence against a particular community that too by dragging army in it which is the foremost secular institution of India. The delay in action by police against the accused is definitely questionable,” said Negi.

01-01-2022||India||UK may offer cheaper, easier visas to clinch trade deal with India: Report||The UK is planning to relax immigration rules by offering cheaper and easier visas for Indian tourists, students and professionals, in an attempt to clinch a trade deal with India, a media report said on Saturday. UK International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan is expected to travel to New Delhi this month, when formal negotiations on a proposed India-UK free trade agreement (FTA) are expected to begin.Trevelyan is expected to use this visit to open the prospect of relaxing immigration rules for Indian citizens, a key demand from New Delhi, The Times newspaper reported.While she has the backing of Liz Truss, the Foreign Secretary, who has put securing closer ties with India on top of the government’s agenda to counter the growing influence of China, Home Secretary Priti Patel is opposed to this move, the report said.In May last year, Patel had signed a ‘bespoke’ and reciprocal Migration and Mobility Partnership (MMP) with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar to have around 3,000 students and professionals a year access work experience benefits in either country.Under the MMP, both sides have agreed to work towards an April 2022 timeline to bring the new system in place, with work underway in the High Commission in London and the Ministry of External Affairs in New Delhi.However, under further immigration plans reportedly in the works, one option being looked at is a scheme similar to that agreed as part of the UK’s FTA with Australia, which would allow young Indians the chance to come and work in the UK for up to three years.Another option would be to cut visa fees for students, thereby allowing them to stay in the UK for a period after they graduate, possibly building upon the Graduate Route visa under the points-based immigration rules currently in place, the report said.There could also be reductions in the fees for work and tourism visas.At present, it can cost an Indian citizen up to GBP 1,400 for a work visa, while students pay GBP 348 and tourists GBP 95 respectively.These are in sharp contrast with visa fees for countries such as China, who have to pay significantly less.Indian-origin peer Lord Karan Bilimoria, the president of the Confederation of British Industry, has been among the most vocal advocates for lowering visa fees for Indians.“That FTA, I hope, will benefit in enhancing bilateral trade and be as comprehensive as possible. Movement of people; reduction of duties and tariffs – the tariff on Scotch whisky is 150 per cent, that’s got to be reduced drastically; academic collaborations and cross-border research is going to be huge between our countries and partnering on a Green industrial revolution. There is a vast array to really ramp up business and trade between our two countries,” he had said.A senior government source told 'The Times' that there was an acceptance by ministers that the price of a trade deal with India would be to make a “generous” offer on visas.“The tech and digital space in India are still hugely protectionist and if we could open up even a slither of access, it would put us ahead in the game,” a government official was quoted as saying.The UK government has repeatedly said it wants a deal that slashes barriers for doing business with India.According to the Department for International Trade, preparations for the launch of negotiations for the UK-India FTA ‘remains underway’ since the conclusion of bilateral working groups.Trevelyan and her Indian counterpart, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal, had also held talks during the G-20 trade ministers meeting in Sorrento, Italy, last October to discuss “final preparations” for the launch of India-UK FTA negotiations this year.“We look forward to launching negotiations early this year. India is projected to become the world’s third-largest economy by 2050, and a trade deal will open huge opportunities for UK businesses to trade with India’s GBP 2 trillion economy,” a UK government spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-may-offer-cheaper-easier-visas-to-clinch-trade-deal-with-india-report-101641055703929.html
01-01-2022||India||Omicron fears dampen New Year celebrations in India as third wave warning surfaces | 10 points||Restrictions continue to exist at public places across the country as India’s Covid-19 curve maintains its upward trajectory amid a third wave warning. Experts even believe that the third wave of the pandemic is already here as the Omicron variant has started replacing Delta across states. Earlier today, the Centre urged states and union territories to take immediate steps to ensure enough beds in hospitals, oxygen availability and ramp up health care facilities.India registered 16,764 cases on December 31, including 1,431 Omicron cases, as per the health bulletin. This is the highest ever single-day rise in the past 70 days.Here are the latest developments on India’s coronavirus cases:1. The registration process for vaccination of children of the age group 15-18 years has begun today on the Centre’s Co-WIN app. Launching the same, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said, “If the children are safe, then the future of the country is safe!” Covid-19 vaccination for children begins on January 3, 2021.2. Delhi and Mumbai continue to remain on the top of the chart in terms of coronavirus infections, with the Maharashtra capital leading the way. Mumbai on Saturday recorded 6,347 cases (including 454 Omicron cases) while Delhi logged a huge surge of 2,716 fresh Covid-19 cases (including 351 Omicron cases), as many as 920 more than yesterday's 1,796, the health bulletin data showed.3. Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, in a letter to states and union territories, said that due to the spread of Omicron cases, “the world is currently reporting the highest ever surge in Covid-19 cases”.4. In Maharashtra, 10 ministers and at least 20 MLAs were found to have been infected with Covid. Meanwhile, the national capital confirmed the first death due to coronavirus in 2022, thereby taking its death toll to 25,108, according to the state’s health department.5. On the other hand, several reports have suggested that West Bengal may be pulled under a lockdown due to the doubling of daily cases. The reports, however, could not be confirmed by Hindustan Times.6. Experts and scientists continue to have different projections regarding the peak of the third wave of the pandemic, speculating the severity of a possible surge of Omicron cases. Several projections have said that it will not be severe but the infections will spread faster than before and the number of cases is likely to be high.7. Experts have predicted a third wave peak likely to arrive by February- March.8.

What experts said||Maharashtra additional chief secretary (health) Dr Pradeep Vyas has recently predicted that Maharashtra may report a total of two lakh active COVID-19 cases by the third week of January. "Based on the current trend of rising Covid cases in the state, it is expected that we will have about two lakh active cases by the third week of January 2022," he told ANI.Dr Vyas said the narrative that Omicron is mild and not fatal might be misleading. "It's equally fatal for those who are not vaccinated and have comorbidities," he said.According to IIT-Kanpur professor Manindra Agarwal, the peak will be in early March with around 1.8 lakh cases per day. One in 10 cases will require hospitalisation, he said.

Sarma, a senior BJP leader of the North East, said: "certain positive development" regarding the Act will take place soon in neighbouring Nagaland, where too it is in force. With militancy on the wane the Army has virtually withdrawn from Assam, except from five-six districts and when AFSPA comes up for renewal after four months the state government will take a “pragmatic decision”, he said. AFSPA has often been termed as "draconian" by political parties of the northeast because of the special powers it grants to the Indian Armed Forces to maintain public order in "disturbed areas" and its withdrawal has been demanded by civil society groups and rights activists. It was imposed in Assam in November 1990 and has been extended every six months since then after a review by the state government. “As far as AFSPA is concerned, Assam will see some rationalising in 2022 ... How and when we don't know. But I am an optimistic man. We are looking at 2022 as a year of hope. There will be some positive moments regarding the Act,” Sarma told reporters here. On the continuation of AFSPA in Nagaland, he said the Centre has already formed a committee to look into the matter. "The committee will submit its report in 45 days and I am hopeful there will be a certain positive development," he added. The Centre had on December 26 constituted a high-level committee headed by a secretary rank officer to examine the possibility of lifting the controversial AFSPA in Nagaland, apparently to soothe the rising tension in the northeastern state over the killing of 14 civilians. The committee was set up three days after Union Home Minister Amit Shah held a meeting with Sarma and his Nagaland counterpart Neiphiu Rio. The demand for repeal of AFSPA from the northeast came to the fore in December last year after 13 civilians were gunned down by the Army in a botched anti-insurgency operation in Nagaland and another person was killed in subsequent violence. The demand was made to the Centre even by the chief ministers of Nagaland and Meghalaya. The Act is in force in Manipur (excluding Imphal Municipal Council Area), in Changlang, Longding and Tirap districts of Arunachal Pradesh and areas falling within the jurisdiction of eight police stations of its districts bordering Assam, besides Nagaland and Assam. It was extended by six months in Nagaland by the Centre earlier this week. Sarma said tribal insurgency is almost over in Assam and credited the civil society organisations and students bodies for it. “The era of tribal militancy is over. All militant groups, but the ULFA have come overground and deposited arms ... Our last hurdle is ULFA(I),” he said. “The tribals are now firm on standing against insurgency. There won’t be any resurgence of militancy among them if we do not inflict any injustice on them,” the chief minister said. Sarma said he has learnt from his personal interactions with people who are directly or indirectly in touch with ULFA(I) chief, Paresh Barua that the militant leader wants a negotiated settlement like the government. “The stumbling block is ‘sovereignty’. ULFA(I) will want a discussion over it, which we cannot hold. We are working on breaking the deadlock,” he said. The unilateral ceasefire called by ULFA(I) in response to his call for peace after assuming office in May last year is a positive step. The Assam government reciprocated by not engaging in any "direct conflict" with the outfit in the last eight months, Sarma said. “But if we get information that people are trying to join ULFA(I) or its members are demanding money from the people then as the government we have to intervene,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/positive-development-on-afspa-in-assam-nagaland-soon-himanta-101641045332946.html
01-01-2022||India||December GST nears ₹1.30 lakh crore, Fin Min expects trend to continue||The Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection in December 2021 is ₹1,29,780 crore, marginally lower than ₹1.30 lakh crore figure achieved in the preceding two straight months, but 12.7% increase on an annualised basis and 25.8% higher than the revenues collected in December 2019, which was a pre-Covid period, according to official data.The indirect tax revenue, a weathervane of economic health, in November surged to ₹1,31,526 lakh crore, the second highest since the new tax regime was launched in July 2017 on robust recovery of business activities after the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic and increased compliance.As the December collection figure indicates the volume of business transactions that took place in November, there is no impact of recent surge in new variant of Covid-19, according to experts. Some minor impact of Omicron on the GST collections is expected in the next two months depending on the extent of mobility curbs and restrictions on business activities, MS Mani, partner at consultancy firm Deloitte India said.The pandemic is fast spreading in the country as India saw 22,775 new Covid-19 cases, highest since October 6 and Omicron infection jumped to 1,431 with 161 fresh cases, the Union health ministry said on Saturday. Mani said the GST revenue in December is marginally low by less than ₹2,000 crore, which is normal and doesn’t indicate anything amiss. “The GST collections reflect the continuing improvement in various macroeconomic parameters and appear to have now established a consistent trend over the past few months,” he said.“The GST collection in the month is close to ₹1.30 lakh crore despite reduction of 17% in the number of e-way bills generated in the month of November, 2021 (6.1 crore) as compared to the month of October, 2021 (7.4 crore) due to improved tax compliance and better tax administration by both central and state tax authorities,” Union finance ministry said in a statement. Electronic Way Bill (e-way bill) is a digital compliance mechanism under the GST regime to track movement of goods.Despite lower number of e-way bills, GST revenue is robust mainly because of increased contributions from services, experts said. “It is also accompanied by a continuing focus on implementation of technology based anti-evasion measures,” Mani said.Aditi Nayar, chief economist at rating agency ICRA Ltd said the GST collections for December is “certainly impressive” given the “sequential drop in GST e-way bills” that had been seen during the festive month of November. “This performance can be attributed both to anti-evasion activities as well as the sharp growth in revenue from imports,” she said. During the month, revenues from import of goods were as 36% higher compared to the same period last year.Notwithstanding current surge in Omicron cases, finance ministry expects “the positive trend in the revenues will continue” in the fourth quarter (January-March 2022) due to increased compliance. Average quarterly GST collections has been robust in the third quarter ended December 31, 2021 at ₹1.30 lakh crore, compared to ₹1.10 lakh crore average in Q1 and ₹1.15 lakh crore in Q2 of the current fiscal year.“Coupled with economic recovery, anti-evasion activities, especially action against fake billers have been contributing to the enhanced GST. The improvement in revenue has also been due to various rate rationalisation measures undertaken by the [GST] Council to correct inverted duty structure,” it said.Out of the ₹1,29,780 crore gross GST revenue collected in December, ₹22,578 crore is central GST (CGST), ₹28,658 crore is state GST (SGST), and ₹69,155 crore is integrated GST (IGST) that include ₹37,527 crore collected on import of goods, and ₹9,389 crore cess on luxury items and sin goods, according to the finance ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/december-gst-nears-rs-1-30-lakh-crore-fin-min-expects-trend-to-continue-101641046079873.html

Out of these new cases, around 5,712 are asymptomatic, which may be an indication of the spread of the Omicron variant, which is spreading fast without causing severe illness. On Friday, Mumbai recorded 5,428 fresh cases; on Thursday, the tally was 3,555. Maharashtra on Saturday reported 9,170 new cases, 1,445 recoveries, and 7 deaths today.  The state also reported six Omicron cases taking the overall Omicron tally to 460.  The Covid situation of Maharashtra, propelled by Omicron cases, has brought back talks of lockdown, while several restrictions have already been imposed in the state.  Health minister Rajesh Tope on Saturday said lockdown is not under discussion currently. "Decision of lockdown is not under discussion currently. The government will take decision about restrictions by taking into consideration the case positivity rate, hospital bed occupancy and oxygen consumption. If the daily (medical) oxygen requirement crosses 700 metric tons, then the state will go into lockdown automatically," the health minister said. On Friday, Maharashtra minister Vijay Wadettiwar said the stage of lockdown is approaching, but the chief minister will take a decision on when to impose it.About 10 ministers of the state and 20 MLAs have been infected with Covid, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said on Saturday. "We cut short the Assembly session recently. So far, over 10 ministers and over 20 MLAs have tested positive for coronavirus. Everybody wants to be part of the celebrations of New Year, birthdays and other occasions. Keep in mind that the new variant (Omicron) spreads fast and hence caution is needed. PM Narendra Modi has appealed and some states have announced a night curfew. In Maharashtra, cases are increasing in Mumbai and Pune," Pawar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-reports-6-347-covid-cases-lockdown-not-under-discussion-says-minister-101641043207160.html

Apart from adding more beds to hospitals, ramping up health care facilities, the states have been asked to check their oxygen availability, on a note of caution. The world is currently reporting the highest ever surge in Covid-19 cases, secretary Rajesh Bhushan wrote in his letter. "In the context of the spread of Variant of Concern Omicron, the world is currently reporting the highest ever surge in Covid-19 cases. In India, the case trajectory is also showcasing an upward trend with 16,764 cases reported on December 31, the highest ever single-day rise in the past 70 days. Many developed nations in Europe and the Americas are reporting a significant rise in new cases in the past few weeks, which indicates high transmissibility of the virus," the secretary added.India's Omicron tally crosses 1,400-mark, 5 states have more than 100 casesThe health infrastructure may soon start getting stressed as there is a sudden increase in cases, the Centre said.In view of this, the Centre has asked the states to create makeshift hospitals. States may also utilise hotel accommodations for patients having mild to moderate symptoms, as it was done during the earlier surges in some states, it said. To monitor patients under home isolation, the states should constitute special teams, call centres, control rooms. A clear focus on rural areas and pediatric cases must also be maintained, the letter said."States need to regularly review the availability of required logistics, oxygen availability and buffer stick of drugs across all health facilities in the state," the Centre said.The alert comes amid a series of letters the Centre has recently written to the states and the UTs in view of the sudden surge, which is being seen as the beginning of a fresh wave in the country.On December 31, the Centre asked all states to test all fever, body ache cases for Covid and treat them for Covid, unless the test results prove otherwise. On the very first day of 2022, India reported 22,775 new Covid-19 cases and 406 deaths. The number of Omicron infections stands at 1,431, as on Saturday morning.Omicron, the newest variant of SARS-CoV-2, is believed to be spreading very fast though the severity is not worrying as most Omicron patients are asymptomatic and are recovering without being hospitalised. But if patients are not isolated properly, there is an increased risk of transmission among other family members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/add-more-beds-in-hospitals-prepare-child-care-unit-centre-writes-to-states-as-omicron-cases-rise-101641038129305.html

01-01-2022||India||The year ahead: Can US Build Back Better?||There will be an urgency about Joe Biden’s presidency this year. The past year did not pan out quite the way he had hoped. But 2022 may be his last chance to make a difference.The Biden administration will begin its second year both determined and desperate. Its flagship Build Back Better legislation, a $1.7 trillion transformation of the United States welfare system, failed to garner the needed Senate votes in December. The president has seen his approval rating fall to a dismal 43%. His administration is struggling with yet another Covid wave. Inflation is beginning to spread through the economy.Biden’s political agenda is solely about blunting the anti-establishment, working class anger that led to the rise of Donald Trump. Securing the US against a second Trump presidency is the Holy Grail of the Biden presidency. And the orange-haired reality TV star has the Oval Office in his sights. Reportedly, Trump had to be dissuaded by aides from announcing his intention to run again after the US’s tragicomic withdrawal from Kabul. If his doctors give him the green signal, expect him to announcing in 2022.Biden will now try to push his agenda in bite-sized chunks. As he told party members recently, “We have to keep making the case”. Build Back Better, for example, will probably be shrunk-wrapped to Mild Medium-sized Milquetoast and put before the Senate again. Climate crisis policies will come sliced and diced.The world at large is only marginally better for Biden. Three major foreign policy crises will roll on into the new year. First is the military buildup along the Ukraine-Russia border. The coming six-party negotiations will seek to find a solution, and will kick off global diplomacy for 2022. But Putin won’t back down in a hurry.Second are tensions over Taiwan, though this seems to be increasingly shadow boxing, all fighter aircraft but no intention to fight. However, the US and China will continue to spar on many things economic. China will seek to use trade diplomacy to isolate America. Washington will double down on technology coalitions. The Quad, something Biden sees at the core of his China response, will assemble in Tokyo in February and probably at least once more later in the year.And finally there’s Iran. The attempt to resurrect the US-Iran nuclear deal will continue apace. Iran will not roll back its nuclear programme or its informal West Asian empire, as Washington is demanding. But Biden will also resist calls from Israel to consider a military solution. His instinct has been to not invest too much in West Asia, something which Iran will leverage as the US leader’s home front looms ever larger in importance.After all, by next spring the US will be all about the midterm congressional elections in November. With the entire lower house and a third of the Senate up for grabs, the odds are Biden will lose his slender congressional majority, be unable to pass legislation thereafter and end up a de facto two-year president. Trump has already been endorsing dozens of rabid Republicans at the congressional and state levels. Which is why Biden’s passage of Build Back Better and similar legislation is so crucial. The US president will also move more aggressively on voting rights and anti-monopoly legislation in the coming year, blocking the Republicans from suppressing minority voter rights and Mark Zuckerberg from subverting everyone’s data rights.These moves and more may prove important legacies of the Biden presidency but will be drowned out by the noise which will engulf the US in 2023. Noise by a Republican Party going off the rails, a virus that refuses to go away, and a club sandwich of overseas enemies who see Biden as weak and doddering. The US president will have a tough year, but more importantly it may be his last chance to proof his country against those who would Make America Trumped Again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-year-ahead-can-us-build-back-better-101641037679462.html

The incident happened at the mining site in Bhiwani district of the northern state after a portion of stone mine crashed down on the workers, reportedly owing to a landslide.Taking to Twitter, Vij said that the local administration is taking care of the rescue operation.

01-01-2022||India||The year ahead: Privacy, connectivity will define our tech interactions||The long-term nature of the Covid-19 pandemic we are living through will define a lot of how the development, and our interface with technology, will take place through most of 2022. The themes will revolve around the work-from-home (WFH) lifestyle, and tools that make things simpler on that front. Since it’s all online, security and privacy will remain in focus.Artificial intelligence all aroundThe definition of a smart device has changed. Earlier, a smart TV was that because it could connect to the internet, compared with one that couldn’t. Now, anything tagged as smart must have a mind of its own. That’s where artificial intelligence (AI) comes into the picture.The cameras in your computing device can track your face and swivel to keep you in the frame. Netflix can predict what you want to watch next. Your phone has AI to determine which apps you use when and prepares them for better performance. Your car can tell you when you’re inattentive and alerts you. AI will continue to be everywhere, even more so. Be it your Android phone or iPhone, the apps in your phone, a smart speaker, your TV and the car you drive will have greater infusion of AI.Need for data privacyThe wheels of change are in motion. Facebook has decided to remove facial recognition from its platform. WhatsApp is giving us powerful encryption for backups. Android and iOS as smartphone platforms are making it more difficult for you to be tracked by advertisers and are restricting apps from sending out your data without your permission.“As companies have to comply with stricter and more diverse privacy regulations worldwide, they are giving users more tools for controlling their privacy as they use their services,” says Anna Larkina, a security expert at Kaspersky. But do not for a moment expect big tech to make it easy for users — data collection continues to be critical for most tech companies as a source of revenue, and they would want that drip feed to not completely dry up.Your phone, all powerfulIt is expected that semiconductor shortages will ease off in H2 2022 but expect no let-up in phone launches. Phone companies appear well stocked. Everyone will be at it. OnePlus and Samsung usually launch flagship phones in the first few months of a new year — the OnePlus 10 and the Samsung Galaxy S22 series should make their debuts then.Digitimes Research expects smartphone shipments to increase around 7% in 2022, compared with the year before. Smartphone makers including Xiaomi and Realme will launch phones in different price bands through the year. And that’s before we get to the annual updates from Apple and Google for the iPhone and Pixel phones later in the year. Could we see a more affordable iPhone launched before the summer? That could well be the next generation iPhone SE.Internet that connects youThe very basis for WFH is reliable internet connectivity. The home broadband as well as 4G mobile networks have held up well over the work and video streaming rigours of the last two years. Home broadband tariffs have remained stable while the speeds on offer are between 30Mbps and 1Gbps. In 2021, broadband will have its newest cutting-edge iteration — satellite broadband. Alongside, we’ll have the next evolution of mobile networks with 5G.Satellite broadband simplifies things — beaming down internet via a satellite dish installed in your balcony or rooftop, from a constellation of satellites in the sky. Much like a direct to home (DTH) TV network. It is expected that Elon Musk’s Starlink will launch services. Expect OneWeb, which is owned by Bharti Airtel and the Government of UK, to be in play. Make no mistake, satellite broadband will add another option to the connectivity spectrum, but it’ll not be cheap — Starlink’s monthly subscription is expected at $99.Work and education, from homeAlongside work-from-home is the very important dimension of online classrooms. In India, affordable computing is crucial, that is PCs and laptops which are priced around ₹30,000. Microsoft’s big focus for 2022 is education and Windows 11 SE has been tweaked to put the education apps front and centre while streamlining a lot of other functionality to make it work on PCs around the ₹20,000 price point (and beyond).There are also the new education-focused PCs which the likes of HP, Lenovo and Dell will be rolling out in 2022. Ketan Patel, managing director at HP India, points out while speaking with HT that from a state of panic caused by the low PC penetration at the beginning of the pandemic, we are now seeing a 45% year-on-year growth for PCs, with WFH and online classrooms driving sales.
01-01-2022||India||The year ahead: Seven states in poll position||Uttar Pradesh is India’s most populous state and arguably its most politically crucial province. With a population over 200 million cutting across caste and communities, and 80 Lok Sabha seats and 403 assembly seats, the state wields disproportionate power in the country’s politics. Having roots in the state propels a political party or leader to the national arena because no other state comes close in terms of political heft – the next biggest state, Maharashtra, has 48 Lok Sabha seats and 288 assembly segments. No wonder, then, that nine of the country’s 14 Prime Ministers have had ties to the state, or that when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was contemplating an inaugural general election run, he chose an Uttar Pradesh constituency – Varanasi.These are some of the reasons why the assembly election scheduled to be held in Uttar Pradesh in February-March is the political event of 2022, one that is likely to determine whether the Opposition is spirited enough to take on the Bharatiya Janata Party in the 2024 general election, or whether the ruling party will get the same boost from the state that it did in 2017, when it won an unprecedented mandate of 312 seats.To be sure, there are also a number of other state elections that will make headlines and change political dynamics – notably Punjab, where the impact of the farm protests and their success in making the central government reverse course; Goa, where the fight is as much between the BJP and the Congress as it is between the Aam Aadmi Party and the Trinamool Congress to emerge as the new Opposition alternative, Uttarakhand, where the incumbent BJP appears to be in trouble after changing two chief ministers in a year, and in Manipur, where the Congress will seek to wrest power from the BJP in a state where it emerged as the single-largest party only to see its lawmakers defect.Among these, Punjab is particularly important because it is the state that birthed the first successful popular movement to effect a reversal of a significant economic policy decision by this government. It is also the state that has seen its government and ruling party in churn. If the state’s first Dalit chief minister staves off challenges from political opponents within and outside the party, it will be pleasant news for the win-starved Congress party.Towards the end of the year, two other important states go to the polls. In Himachal Pradesh, BJP chief minister Jai Ram Thakur will have to combat a series of bypoll reverses and an energised Congress party. In Gujarat, the home state of PM Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah, the BJP virtually changed its entire government in September in an attempt to beat back anti-incumbency. Will the Congress party be able to repeat its spirited challenge of the 2017 campaign, or will new chief minister Bhupendra Patel manage to stitch together a multi-caste coalition that has been the hallmark of the BJP’s dominance in the western state? We will know in December.Of course, the other thing on India’s radar this year will be social cohesion, or rather, tension. Hate speeches and inflammatory remarks by some Hindu leaders, enduring caste cleavages and the oppression faced by Dalit populations across the country, and the response of the political class to it will be important to track for anyone interested in India’s future.But back to UP for a bit. The assembly polls in 2017 happened in the shadow of the disruptive impact of demonetisation, which had been implemented just three months before, and demonstrated PM Modi’s ability to rise above partisan issues and appeal directly to the people. Even as people were hurting under the decision to scrap high-value notes, they were steadfast in the belief that Modi had taken the decision to flush out black money. A doomed alliance between the Congress and the Samajwadi Party (SP) failed to fire on the ground, and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) lost the backing of some of its core supporters – its vote share was still significant but was rendered insignificant in a first-past-the-post system.In contrast, the BJP banked on the PM’s appeal and carefully forged an alliance of non-dominant communities from the other backward classes (OBC) and scheduled castes (SC), weaning these groups away from the regional outfits with the promise of empowerment, economic mobility and social recognition. Having learnt its lesson from the 2015 Bihar polls, the party was deft in dispelling any notion that it was against the emancipation of underprivileged castes. Hindutva and development were the glue that held together this coalition of extremes.The 2022 elections are happening under very different circumstances. The BJP has won a national re-election, having successfully defended UP from a formidable-looking alliance between the SP and the BSP, once-vaunted Opposition unity has since evaporated, and chief minister Yogi Adityanath has built a strong personal, if somewhat controversial, brand on Hindutva and law-and-order.Yet the stakes are the same, if not higher.This is a must-win election for the BJP, which faced a defeat in the West Bengal election and has since seen a string of leaders in the eastern state head towards its principal adversary, the Trinamool Congress. It is important for India’s ruling party to show that it can defend the state it showcases as the new development model for the country. The state is at the heart of the party’s Hindutva agenda and the success of its temple agenda – the construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya began after the 2019 election and this will be the first major election where its impact can be gauged.For the Opposition too, the Uttar Pradesh elections are crucial. The polls will determine whether the original playground of the Mandal revolution has been overrun (or co-opted), whether strong regional parties can indeed challenge the BJP on its home turf (remember West Bengal was an unfamiliar frontier for the party), and if they can leverage popular discontent into electoral advantage. At stake also is the pre-eminence of the Congress as the primary pole in Opposition politics and a poor performance by the party will surely spark dissension and renewed talk of leadership. The election is crucial for the rest of India too.It will tell us how deeply the Hindutva project has permeated the masses, and whether the Opposition’s attempts at forging an alliance of backward castes is successful. It will indicate whether Adityanath – who has been projected by the BJP as its next big leader – has successfully built a brand and following. It will be show whether a new round of mandir politics – first Ayodhya, then Varanasi and Mathura – is having an impact. And it will show how Dalit communities respond to a spate of attacks and pervasive discrimination.But most importantly, it will be a barometer – the first, in fact – to understand whether the devastation during the second wave of the pandemic will have a political cost. Uttar Pradesh was home to some of the most controversial moments this summer, including the floating bodies in the Ganga, the mass graves on its banks, the oxygen shortage, the deaths of teachers during local body polls and the desperation for medicines and beds as health infrastructure collapsed and the state seemed effete. Can people really bury their loved ones but not let it became a factor in choosing their representatives? When public health collapses during a once-in-a-generation pandemic, do people blame god or government? Uttar Pradesh will tell us.
01-01-2022||India||The year ahead: A year of hope and caution||Is the glass half full or half empty?The year 2021 ended under the shadow of a new variant of concern (VOC) of the Sars-CoV-2: Omicron. The mutant spreads at unprecedented speed but seems significantly less virulent. It cheats existing immune defences but leaves the body better prepared to deal with the other known variants. It rises in sharp, dizzyingly quick waves but recedes just as quickly.After the horror of the Delta variant, some say Omicron brings hope in the possibility that it could tear through the world, leaving a degree of baseline immunity that would help everyone deal with the virus better.Others see Omicron as but merely a reflection of the unpredictable directions the virus can evolve in, and a turn for the worse may just be around the corner. The year 2022 will answer which scenario is right.The half fullThe experience of past pandemics and what we know about the evolution of infectious pathogens suggests there is a high likelihood of the coronavirus eventually becoming much more innocuous in the long term.Over time, a variant with increased transmissibility but decreased virulence – the ability to lead to serious disease – will lead the way to the Sars-CoV-2 becoming endemic. Coupled with the likelihood of eventual high population immunity, the virus might possibly become like the other coronaviruses that causes common colds in humans.In other words, it sounds very much like how Omicron has behaved.The half emptyThat Omicron arose with dozens of mutations only shows the virus might have a lot of scope for mutations. One evolutionary scenario is that it mutates further to pick up the morbidity and mortality traits as other coronaviruses that have existed, like Mers, which has a 35% fatality rate, and the first Sars-CoV, which had an estimated 10% fatality rate.Human factors play a huge part in such evolution. At present, there is large vaccine inequity in the world. Countries such as Israel are planning to give the second boosters – the fourth doses – while most people in sub-Saharan Africa are yet to even receive their first. At this rate, it will be years before an acceptable share of the global population has a primary vaccination course, let alone boosters. The virus, then, will continue spreading and, as it spreads, evolving.A second grim evolutionary scenario, which experts say is highly likely and is corroborated by some of the direction Omicron has taken, is of the virus becoming completely resistant to the current class of vaccines.Omicron has demonstrated that the virus can evolve much faster than the world can update its vaccines. The first of Omicron-specific vaccines are not expected until March, 2022 – a time by when most Omicron waves are expected to be over.Vaccines, then, are not the pandemic panacea the world hoped for a year ago.But they can be.The hunt for the silver bulletResearchers around the world are working on what are being regarded as pan-coronavirus shots. The objective is to create a future-proof vaccine that protects against all past variants, and will therefore be able to protect against future variants.Recently, the US military’s Walter Reed Army Institute published encouraging animal trial results of a similar vaccine. Known as the Spike Ferritin Nanoparticle Covid-19 vaccine, or SpFN, the vaccine has completed Phase 1 human trials with results undergoing final review. According to reports, unlike the other coronavirus shots, SpFN uses “a soccer ball-shaped protein with 24 faces for its vaccine, which allows scientists to attach the spikes of multiple coronavirus strains on different faces of the protein”.Another attempt is by a private company called BioVaxys Technology Group, which filed a patent for a similar method of using multiple spike proteins to train the human immunity into recognising the common cold coronaviruses, the Sars-CoV-2 and the first Sars virus.A second breakthrough that can come over the next 12 months is in the form of nasal vaccines. Even if they are designed on the older variants, these could provide a significant boost to protection by creating better immunity at the first site where the Sars-CoV-2 lands when it enters the human body: the mucous membrane in the upper air passage.Yale professor Akiko Iwasaki, one of the preeminent experts in immunology, summed up the huge potential of such vaccines with a simple analogy: “It is like having guards outside your home, versus guards placed inside the door.”And third, research on antiviral drugs is continuing. The last year yielded Molnupiravir and Paxlovid, two drugs that can help treat infected people to reduce their risk of death. It is likely that more candidates will hit success in the coming year.These three endeavours will determine whether science outpaces the virus for good, which in turn will likely be the pandemic story of 2022.
01-01-2022||India||The year ahead: The numbers game of boosting the Covid-19 battle||If 2020 is remembered as the year of the pandemic, the year 2021 went down in history as the year humanity fought back – the year of the vaccines. In the past year, billions of people spread across the world were administered shots of vaccines to protect against Covid-19.As the year was drawing to a close, however, a new, and heavily mutated and transmissible variant Omicron sent scientists and governments huddling to rework their vaccination strategies.In India, and across the world, the year ended with the governments revising their vaccination strategy to tackle the new threat. How many vaccine shots will be required for this new round of vaccinations with additional doses, and beyond? What does it mean for India’s target of achieving “full vaccination”? Here’s a look at what the events of the last few weeks mean for this year.Getting to “full vaccination”First, a look at what has been achieved on the vaccination front in 2021. A total of 1.44 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered across India. These have been done so to more than 843 million of India’s estimated 940 million adults. Around nine out of every 10 adults in India have now received at least one shot of the vaccines – nearly 62% have received two shots of the vaccines, and another 28% have been partially vaccinated.Now, to establish what the final target is – full vaccination. Depending on what time of the pandemic and where in the world this question is asked, the term “full vaccination” may go on to mean different things. In the first 10-11 months of India’s vaccination drive, the full vaccination target referred to the administration of two doses of the vaccine to everyone over the age of 18.On December 25 last year, the central government expanded the vaccination drive to cover children of ages 15 and above, and a booster dose (a third after the two original shots) to health care and frontline workers, and people above the age of 60 with certain health conditions – a decision made to counter the Omicron threat.As per the original calculations of covering 940 million people with two doses, India needed around 1.88 billion doses. But to completely cover the added categories and a further expansion of the programme to cover the entire population, this needs to be redone.First, the immediate maths. So far, roughly 10.4 million health care workers have been vaccinated, while another 18.4 million frontline workers have been given shots, according to government figures. So, giving these two groups of people a single additional shot adds around 29 million doses to the target. There are an estimated 138 million people above the age of 60 years in the country (as per Census of India’s estimates). While the drive currently has only been expanded to those who have certain medical conditions in this group, there are no estimates on how many such people there are. At some point, however, this entire category is set to be covered.A tally that has been added to the overall number is the number of children between the ages of 15 and 18 years who were made eligible on December 25 – of which there are 74 million, as per estimates. Two shots for each of this group means another 148 million doses added to the dose target.According to Our World in Data, 92 countries have so far started administered booster shots. India’s neighbours such as Sri Lanka and China, and economic peers such as Brazil are all in that list.In the long term, the Indian inoculation drive is likely to cover the entire adult population with a third additional dose like other nations to tackle threats of new variants. If all adults are to be covered in the coming months with the third shot, a total of 940 million doses gets added to the target.If the entire adult population is administered three doses of Covid-19 vaccines in India, the doses required will be 2.82 billion. With two doses for children above the age of 15 (boosters are not on the horizon for children just yet and the government doesn’t appear to immediately be considering children under the age of 15 for vaccination), the total number of doses needed will stand at 2.97 billion. Achieving the new goalOriginally, the target set for two-dose coverage of all adults was for December 31, 2021. The seven-day average of daily dose administration, a statistic that evens out the dip generally seen over the weekends, touched a peak of 9.7 million for the week ending September 23 last year after several states increased daily numbers to mark Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s birthday on September 17. At that pace, India was set to hit the year-end target, but since then, it has again dropped. It fell to around 2 million doses a day during the end of October but has again increased slightly to around 5.8 million in the past week.If the current pace of 5.8 million doses a day continues unchanged (and assuming no vaccine supply issues crop up), then India could hit the 2.97-billion dose target by mid-September, data shows. If the country manages to again soar at the peak recorded rate of 10.9 million doses a day, then it would hit the target by mid-May. If the current pace drops to around 4 million, then this target date moves to early 2023, according to data.In either case, the year of the pandemic, then of vaccination appear set to be followed by 2022 being the year of booster doses – and, most likely, also the year that begins the endemic phase of Sars-CoV-2.

01-01-2022||India||India sends 500,000 Covid-19 vaccines to Afghanistan||India on Saturday donated 500,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines to the Indira Gandhi Children’s Hospital in Kabul and pledged to send another 500,000 jabs in the coming weeks as part of humanitarian aid for the people of Afghanistan. The vaccines were sent to Kabul via a flight of Iran’s Mahan Air as there are currently no direct flights between India and Afghanistan. India had earlier sent 1.6 tonnes of life-saving medicines to the same hospital, drawing praise from the Taliban. “Today, India supplied the next batch of humanitarian assistance consisting of 500,000 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine (Covaxin) to Afghanistan. The same was handed over to the Indira Gandhi Hospital, Kabul,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement. “Another batch of additional 500,000 doses would be supplied in [the] coming weeks,” the statement said. On December 11, the Indian government sent 1.6 tonnes of medicines to the Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health in Kabul on a special charter flight that also ferried 85 Afghan nationals who were stuck in India after the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. The same flight had brought 104 people, mostly Afghan Sikhs and Hindus, from Kabul to New Delhi a day earlier. The medicines, like the vaccines delivered on Saturday, were routed through the World Health Organization (WHO). India’s offer to provide 50,000 tonnes of wheat to Afghanistan via Pakistani land routes, however, has been held up because of conditions attached by Pakistan. On December 3, Pakistan said it would allow wheat and medicines to be shipped via the Wagah land border crossing in Afghan trucks but it is yet to finalise modalities. The external affairs ministry said India is committed to provide humanitarian aid to Afghan people consisting of food grains, one million doses of Covid-19 vaccines and essential life-saving drugs. India will undertake the supply of wheat and the remaining medical assistance in the coming weeks, the ministry said. “In this regard, we are in touch with UN agencies and others for finalising the modalities for transportation,” it added. According to the World Food Programme (WFP), an estimated 98% of Afghans are not consuming enough food because of a spiralling economic crisis, conflict and drought, and this figure has increased 17% since August. “Afghanistan is facing an avalanche of hunger and destitution the likes of which I have never seen in my twenty plus years with the World Food Programme,” said Mary-Ellen McGroarty, WFP country director for Afghanistan. “We urgently need $220 million a month in 2022 to assist 23 million Afghans,” she added. 
01-01-2022||India||Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami launches Free Mobile Tablet scheme||Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami launched a Free Mobile Tablet scheme for students here on Saturday.About 2 lakh 65 thousand students of Class 10 and 12 of degree colleges and state schools will get benefit from this scheme, as per government data.The state government official said that ₹12,000 was given by the DBT for buying mobile tablets to class 10 and 12 students of state government schools.Chief Minister Shri Pushkar Singh Dhami distributed free tablets to 100 girl students of the Government Girls Inter College of Dehradun's Rajpur Road. On Saturday, this programme was organised in all the 70 Vidhan Sabhas of the state. The Chief Minister also announced that an auditorium would be built at Government Girls Inter College, Rajpur Road.The DBT has already transferred funds to 1 lakh 59 thousand students of class 10 and 12 of government schools for buying the tablet.Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said, "During the Corona period, children had to face lots of difficulties in taking online classes. Keeping in mind the problems that the children faced, tablets are being given to them by the government.He further said that India is a young country with 65 per cent of the country's population below 35 years of age. The country is progressing rapidly under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. India is becoming self-reliant.He said that all possible efforts are being made by the state government for the qualitative improvement of education in the state. "Virtual classes are being run in 500 schools of the state under digital learning. These services will soon be started in 600 other schools also. 1,418 smart classes are being set up in 709 government schools of the state, this work will be completed by January 15, 2022", he added.As per the state government, free textbooks will be provided to the students of classes 9 to 12 in all government schools. Along with that, free bags and shoes are also being provided to the students of classes 1 to 8 in government schools.The government has also decided to increase the amount of state-level scholarship keeping in mind the interest of the students. The amount of the Shivanand Nautiyal State Merit Scholarship has been increased from ₹250 to ₹1,500 per month and the number of beneficiary students has also been increased from 11 to 100. The amount of Sridev Suman scholarship has also been increased from ₹150 to ₹1,000. Under Chief Minister Pratibha Protsahan Yojana, a scholarship of ₹2,500 is being given to the meritorious students of class 12 for the next five years.The Chief Minister appealed to the people of the state that vigilance is necessary to protect one against the new COVID-19 variant Omicron. He said that everyone must follow the appropriate COVID-19 behaviour. "All preparations have been made by the government to protect against corona, but vigilance is very important to prevent it", said Dhami.

01-01-2022||India||‘Better bargaining, large scale trading…’: PM Modi lists 5 powers of FPOs||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday listed five powers of the farmer product organisations (FPOs) during his address after releasing the 10th instalment of financial benefit under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme.PM Modi said that the FPOs have a major role to play in mobilising the “growing potential of small farmers” of India. “Small farmers who earlier used to remain isolated, have big powers now in the form of [the] FPO,” he added.Here is the list of five powers listed by PM Modi:Under the PM-KISAN scheme, more than ₹20,000 crore was transferred to over 10 crore beneficiary families across the country.

01-01-2022||India||India and Pakistan exchange lists of nuclear installations and prisoners||NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan on Saturday exchanged lists of nuclear installations that cannot be attacked in the event of hostilities, maintaining a tradition dating back more than three decades despite bilateral relations being at an all-time low. The two sides also exchanged lists of prisoners held in each other’s jails, and the Indian side sought the early release of civilian prisoners, missing Indian defence personnel and fishermen. The lists of nuclear installations and facilities were simultaneously exchanged through diplomatic channels in New Delhi and Islamabad according to the provisions of the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities. Both sides do not disclose details of the facilities. The agreement was signed on December 31, 1988 and entered into force on January 27, 1991. It states that India and Pakistan have to inform each other of the nuclear installations and facilities to be covered under the pact on January 1 every calendar year. “This is the 31st consecutive exchange of such lists between the two countries, the first one having taken place on January 1, 1992,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement. According to the lists of civilian prisoners and fishermen exchanged simultaneously through diplomatic channels in New Delhi and Islamabad, India currently has 282 Pakistani civilian prisoners and 73 fishermen in its custody. On the other hand, Pakistan has in its custody 51 civilian prisoners and 577 fishermen who are either Indians or are believed to be Indians. These lists are exchanged in line with the provisions of the Agreement on Consular Access signed in May 2008. Under this pact, the two sides exchange comprehensive lists on January 1 and July 1 every year. “The Government has called for early release and repatriation of civilian prisoners, missing Indian defence personnel and fishermen, along with their boats, from Pakistan’s custody,” the external affairs ministry said in a separate statement. In this context, Pakistan was asked to expedite the release of two Indian civilian prisoners and 356 fishermen whose nationality has already been confirmed and conveyed to Pakistan. Pakistan was also asked to provide immediate consular access to 182 Indian fishermen and 17 civilian prisoners who “are in Pakistan’s custody and are believed to be Indian”, the statement said. The Indian side requested Pakistan to expedite the grant of visas to members of a team of medical experts and facilitate their visit to Pakistan to “assess the mental condition of believed-to-be Indian prisoners of unsound mind” who are being held in different jails. “It was also proposed to organise an early visit of the Joint Judicial Committee to Pakistan,” the statement said, referring to a mechanism comprising legal experts from both sides created under the terms of the 2008 agreement. The signing of the 2008 agreement helped speed up identification and release of hundreds of prisoners, a majority of them fishermen. However, the process has been hit in recent years by bilateral tensions. The Indian side further urged Pakistan to expedite action “at its end to confirm the nationality status of 68 Pakistan prisoners, including fishermen, whose repatriation is pending for want of nationality confirmation by Pakistan”. “In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, Pakistan has been requested to ensure the safety, security and welfare of all Indian and believed-to-be Indian civil prisoners and fishermen,” the statement said. “India remains committed to addressing, on priority, all humanitarian matters, including those pertaining to prisoners and fishermen in each other’s country,” it added.

Later, he and Mehbooba Mufti tweeted videos of protests that their party leaders still managed to organise.“Some things never change,” the National Conference (NC) vice president said on Twitter on Saturday morning along with photographs of the police presence outside his house.“Good morning & welcome to 2022. A new year with the same J&K police illegally locking people in their homes & an administration so terrified of normal democratic activity. Trucks parked outside our gates to scuttle the peaceful @JKPAGD sit-in protest. Some things never change,” Abdullah said in a tweet.Talk about a lawless police state, the police have even locked the internal gate connecting my father’s home to my sister’s. Yet our leaders have the cheek to tell the world that India is the largest democracy, hah!! pic.twitter.com/flNICRGk58“Talk about a lawless police state, the police have even locked the internal gate connecting my father’s home to my sister’s. Yet our leaders have the cheek to tell the world that India is the largest democracy, hah!!”“GOI trumpets scrapping Article 370 & dismembering J&K throughout the country but is deeply paranoid and intolerant when people of J&K want to protest against its disempowerment. For the umpteenth time, we’ve been placed under house arrest for trying to organise a peaceful protest,” Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti said in a tweet.There was no official statement on the restrictions placed on the political leadersThe PAGD leadership last month rejected the draft proposal of the Delimitation Commission, that seeks to increase the total number of Jammu and Kashmir assembly seats from 83 to 90, with 43 in the Jammu region and 47 in Kashmir. In the current assembly, Jammu has 37 members and Kashmir has 46.The amalgam has called the proposal an act to ‘divide people on the basis of religion and groups’.On December 21, the PAGD held a meeting under the chairmanship of NC chief Farooq Abdullah and expressed their deep dissatisfaction and shock with regard to recommendations of the commission. The meeting was attended by PDP president Mehbooba Mufti, CPI (M) general secretary Mohammad Yusuf Tarigami, Awami National Conference vice-president Muzuffar Shah and other political leaders of alliance constituents.On Saturday, Mehbooba Mufti said she has been put under house arrest and lambasted the government of India for stopping people to protest ‘disempowerment’ of J&K.PAGD is the alliance of mainstream parties including National Conference, PDP, Communist Party of India-M, J&K Awami National Conference and others which came together to fight for the restoration of region’s special status which was revoked on August 5,2019 and the region split into two union territories.National Conference vice president Omar Abdullah said that the administration was ‘terrified’ of normal democratic activity in J&K and said that police have even locked gates of the homes of his family members.PAGD spokesperson Muhammad Yousuf Tarigami told a local news agency that the gate of his quarter has been locked by the police. “The intentions are very clear. The Government of India by using the Delimitation Commission wants to dis-empower us,” he said.“It is new year and the message is loud and clear that there are no rights for the people of Kashmir even to protest. We have been put under house arrest and workers have been reportedly put in police stations, “ he said.“It is how their louder claims of building ‘New Kashmir’ get exposed. Not allowing us to hold a peaceful protest and express our legitimate concerns, this is how they want to run Kashmir, “ he said.The Delimitation Commission for the UT was formed by the union government on March 06, 2020, just six months after special status of J&K under Article 370 was revoked and the region split into two union territories – J&K with a legislative assembly and Ladakh without one. Earlier the delimitation of the constituencies in J&K was scheduled to be held in 2026. However following the central government’s changes in J&K after August 5, 2019, the J&K Reorganization Act increased the number of voting constituencies for J&K to 90.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/under-house-arrest-kashmir-s-pagd-leaders-say-govt-wants-to-scuttle-protest-101641026098244.html

He also called for additional investments in advanced weather prediction mechanism. The letter was sent after intense rains in the state on December 30 and 31. “I request the Government of India to do the needful to enhance the capacity of IMC, Chennai to enable it to make predictions of high alert situations earlier and notify the same to the state government well in time.”Tamil Nadu's capital Chennai and nearby areas witnessed heavy rainfall on the last two days of 2021.In his letter to Union home minister Amit Shah, Stalin said that the alerts from the IMC in Chennai were used by the state government in preparing for disaster situations. “We have, however, noted that IMC is unable to predict red alert situation sufficiently in advance giving hardly any time,” he said.Also read | Record rain batters Chennai, more predicted for four districts in Tamil NaduHe also said that the shortcoming of the IMC’s capability to provide accurate information was hindering the state’s efforts towards the timely mobilisation of the emergency management system. “This results in total disruption of normal life, movement of health care support systems and also causing loss of lives and damages to critical infrastructure,” he added.Noting that this necessitated additional investments in advanced weather prediction mechanism and technology upgrade in the IMC. “In this regard, I request the Government of India to do the needful to enhance the capacity of IMC, Chennai to enable it to make predictions of high alert situations earlier and notify the same to the State Government well in time,” he said.Meanwhile, some parts of Chennai complained of waterlogging on Saturday, two days after swift, heavy rains pounded the city on Thursday night and dispersed, moderate rains on Friday. Residents complained on Twitter about stagnant rain water in many streets and localities across the city, despite a let-up in rains since Friday night.Taking to Twitter, some people shared images of waterlogged streets and warned others of avoiding such roads. Meanwhile, many others also shared pictures of some of the main roads in the city which were devoid of any such stagnation.Former Tamil Nadu CM and opposition All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) leader Edappadi K Palaniswami criticised the ruling DMK and said that Chennai was inundated after just one day’s heavy rains.He also said that the government should have been prepared for the situation, particularly after the recent floods in the city due to the northeast monsoon.Following the heavy rain on Thursday night, office goers complained of traffic jams in many arterial roads in the city.The IMD, meanwhile, predicted that there would be isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall over coastal Tamil Nadu and the neighbouring Union territory of Puducherry for the next 24 hours and would then decrease.“Strong northeasterly winds are prevailing off the coast off Tamilnadu in the lower levels. A cyclonic circulation lies over southwest Bay of Bengal off Sri Lanka coast at middle tropospheric level. Under its influence, fairly widespread rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall activity is very likely over coastal Tamilnadu during next 24 hours and decrease thereafter,” the weather bureau said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-cm-stalin-asks-centre-to-enhance-imd-s-capacity-says-met-dept-missed-predicting-chennai-rain-this-week-101641024449416.html

On the first day of this New Year, I urge the citizens to take the chance to vote out the anti-people parties in the upcoming polls this year", said Mayawati.The BSP chief said that the big parties who have been in power in the Centre like BJP and Congress, only show up ahead for state or regional polls by conducting big extravagant rallies."The rallies that they hold are out of Central fund which comes from common people's taxes. My party cannot afford such big election rallies even if we want to. BSP is a poor man's party which consists of people like laborers", added Mayawati.She further said that her party ideology is against holding extravagant rallies."As far as election publicity is concerned BSP has its own way of functioning which is different from other parties", added the former UP CM. "Other parties get money from big industrialists and ponzi scams, BSP doesn't", said Mayawati.Regarding the stampede accident at Vaishno Devi Shrine today, Mayawati expressed her grief and said, "My condolences are with the families of the deceased".

This increase is only ₹1 plus Goods and Services Tax (GST), which is very nominal to customers against the maintenance charges paid by banks as earlier they were charging ₹20."Nipun Jain, Chief Executive Officer, RapiPay Fintech clarified, "Consumers withdrawing cash using our Micro ATMs and Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AEPS) will not be affected with the recent RBI guideline to increase ATM transactions charges (applicable after the customers exhaust the free monthly limit).""We believe this will boost the already growing demand for cash withdrawal through AEPS and Micro ATMs at our direct business outlets and help us in achieving our goal of growing financial inclusion in deeper geographies and far-flung areas like North East, Kashmir, Ladakh, and Uttrakhand. We have sold over one lakh Micro ATMs since we began operations last year. Our average ticket size of withdrawal has climbed from ₹3500 to ₹3800, with a CAGR growth of 25 per cent in Micro ATMs in the last one year," Jain added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/atm-service-charges-increase-to-cost-rs-21-per-transaction-from-today-101641016819628.html

Health and education authorities will join hands to set up special camps in schools and junior colleges across the state and vaccinate students. Those who are not in schools and colleges can get their jabs at regular vaccination centres. “Vaccination of this new section of the population will start on January 3. We have taken it as a mission to finish first dose vaccination of all eligible 15–18-year-olds by January 9 before the start of third dose vaccination for citizens above 60, and frontline and healthcare workers from January 10,” Mahanta said.“I request all parents and guardians to ensure that their children get the first dose by January 9 so that they are eligible to get their second dose in February before start of the final or board exams,” he added. Director (Health Services) Munindra Nath Ngatey said Assam has nearly 2 million eligible recipients who fall in the 15-18 age category. Mahanta said till date the state administered 37.5 million doses (21.7 million first dose and 15.8 million second dose) of Covid-19 vaccine across the state. Though Assam is yet to record any case of Omicron variant of Covid-19, the minister said that preparations are already underway to tackle the fast-spreading variant. “To fight the possible onslaught of Omicron we have 9,000 extra beds, 1,000 ICU beds and 2,600 oxygen beds ready at the moment. If required, we can increase the total number of beds to 25,000 within one week,” said Mahanta.He added the state will have two genome testing laboratories (one in Jorhat and another in Guwahati) within the next few days for genome sequencing of the Omicron variant. Till date, Assam has recorded 620,563 Covid-19 cases with 612,282 recoveries and 6,164 deaths. 
01-01-2022||India||Assam Congress MLA Sashi Kanta Das who extended support to BJP suspended||GUWAHATI: The Congress on Friday suspended one of its legislators in Assam for offering support to the state’s Bharatiya Janata Party-led government. Assm unit chief Bhupen Kumar Borah suspended Raha MLA Sashi Kanta Das from the party “pending disciplinary proceeding with immediate effect for repeatedly violating party discipline and indulging in anti-party activities”, said an order issued by general secretary Bobbeeta Sharma. On December 20, Sashi Kanta Das shocked his party colleagues by announcing his support to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government headed by Himanta Biswa Sarma. The MLA made the disclosure just ahead of the winter session of the assembly. “Within a short span, CM Sarma has been able to bring various communities in the state together and also give rapid boost to development. I talked with him about development issues in Raha and he assured all help. Therefore, I’ve decided to support the government,” Das told journalists on December 20.“A decision on switching of parties and joining the BJP hasn’t been taken at this point. For now I’ve decided to support the government for the sake of development of my constituency,” he had added. Welcoming the decision, Sarma said that there are many more legislators in the opposition camp who are willing to join the ruling party due to the work carried out by the state government.Earlier this year, Congress MLAs Rupjyoti Kurmi from Mariani and Sushanta Borgohain from Thowra resigned from their seats and joined the BJP. An All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) MLA, Phanidhar Talukdar from Bhabanipur, had also quit his party and joined the ruling party. All three MLAs won bypolls in November and became BJP MLAs.

01-01-2022||India||Swiggy, Zomato to pay 5% GST from today: What are the new changes and how will it impact customers||Online food delivery platforms such as Swiggy and Zomato will have to pay five per cent goods and services tax starting Saturday (January 1) as the changes to GST rules will come into effect. These changes are based on the decision taken at the 45th GST council meeting on September 17, 2021, to crack down on restaurants that don't pay taxes.The services offered by these platforms and cloud kitchens and central kitchens were covered under ‘restaurant service’ and would attract 5% GST without any input tax credit (ITC), the Union finance ministry had said after the meeting.What changes now?With the new rules, food delivery platforms are expected to pay 5% GST on restaurant services that they provide. Previously, the restaurants themselves collected and deposited the tax to the government, but now the delivery platforms will be responsible for paying them to the taxmen. This is being done as the government found that several restaurants listed on the food delivery platforms were evading taxes, even though they were being collected from the customers.Why the changes ?“As ‘restaurant service’ has been notified under section 9(5) of the CGST Act, 2017, the electronics commerce oprator (ECO) shall be liable to pay GST on restaurant services provided, with effect from the 1st January, 2022,” a circular from the finance ministry said.“Accordingly, the ECOs will no longer be required to collect TCS and file GSTR 8 in respect of restaurant services on which it pays tax in terms of section 9(5),” it added.Are customers paying a new tax ?The finance ministry has clarified that the customers who avail the services of these platforms will not be paying any new tax. The 5% GST would only be deposited through a different route to the government.Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said that the customers would not be paying any new taxes due to the changes, according to a report by Livemint.Implications for small eateries and compliance burdenThe decision is likely to affect smaller players, restaurants that are earning under ₹20 lakh per annum, according to the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI). The body said that these restaurants were not filing GST previously, however, will now need to do so as the move will bring them under the government’s taxnet.Further, it also said that the compliance burden on restaurants would now increase as they still need to collect GST for dine-ins, takeaways and own delivery while not having to collect taxes for orders through delivery platforms.(With inputs from Livemint)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/swiggy-zomato-to-pay-5-gst-from-today-what-are-the-new-changes-and-how-will-it-impact-customers-101641002218236.html

01-01-2022||India||Navy to test Rafale-M jet for INS Vikrant||With countdown already begun to commission indigenous aircraft carrier 1 as INS Vikrant in August 2022, the Indian Navy will conduct flight trials of Rafale-Maritime fighter at Shore Based Test Facility at INS Hansa in Goa on January 6 onwards as part of its exercise to identify the best warplane to suit the 40,000 tonne carrier. The IAC 1 is based at Cochin shipyard and is currently undergoing intensive sea trials in Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean.According to officials in knowledge of the matter, the Rafale-M fighter will be pushed through intensive trial at the 283 metre mock-up ski jump facility at INS Hansa for nearly 12 days to assess whether the fighter aircraft is best suited for IAC-1. The Rafale M fighter is the principal weapon system for French Charles De Gaulle aircraft carrier and has also shown its inter-operability with US aircraft carriers way back in 2008.The Indian Navy is also planning to test US F-18 Hornet fighter at the same facility apparently in March as the alternative option to Rafale-M fighter. The Boeing F-18 is a proven carrier based multi-role fighter for the US Navy and has performed strike operations from way back to 1991 Gulf War.While the Indian Navy operates two squadrons of MiG-29K onboard its sole aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya, the Russian aircraft is facing issues of maintenance and spare parts availability.The DRDO’s LCA-M is still in the development stage with two single engine demonstrator fighters being flight tested from INS Vikramaditya and the Goa based shore based test facility for providing inputs to the final twin engine deck based carrier fighter in future. According to Aeronautical Development Agency, the first flight trial of the indigenous twin engine fighter is expected before 2026 and induction into Indian Navy before 2031.While the decision on which fighter will spearhead IAC-1 will be based on the flight trials, fact is that Rafale-M is lighter and smaller in airframe to F-18 and packs a bigger punch than its American counterpart in terms of longer range air to air missiles and air to land missiles. Naval Aviation experts also say that it will be require structural modifications to the IAC 1 to fit F-18 into the lift to cart the fighter from hanger to the flight deck above due to its comparatively larger airframe.As the IAC -1 is expected to commissioned as INS Vikrant on August 15, 2022, the 75th year of Indian independence, by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, there is a strong possibility that the Indian Navy may ask the French manufacturers of the aircraft to lease four to five Rafale -M in 2022 so that the aircraft carrier is made operational. India already has a maintenance cum flight training facility of Rafale at Ambala air base. The Naval aviators will be trained at INS Hansa.
