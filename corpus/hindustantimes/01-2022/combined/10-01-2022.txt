He was rushed to a hospital, where he succumbed to injuries, police said.“We later arrested the father, Ajmer Singh, and booked him for murder,” the DCP said.Police said Paramjeet lived with his parents in the Wazirpur slum colony. His father is a daily wager and his mother a homemaker. Singh was left paralysed after a road accident about 14 years ago, the police said.His sister Rekha lives with her husband elsewhere in north-west Delhi. For the past few days, his mother was staying at his sister’s home.“On Saturday, Rekha visited Paramjeet only to find him injured. She asked him about the injuries and learned that their father had returned home in an inebriated condition on Saturday night and beat him with a stick,” said Rangnani.Rekha rushed him to Deep Chand Bandhu Hospital where doctors declared him dead. The hospital authorities subsequently informed the police upon which the father was arrested from the neighbourhood itself.It remained unclear if the father regularly thrashed the bedridden man or it was a one-off incident, police said.This is the second case of filicide in the national capital in the span of three days. On Thursday, a five-year-old boy was beaten to death by his father for playing mobile games instead of studying in south Delhi’s Khanpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/paralysed-man-beaten-to-death-by-drunk-father-in-delhi-101641839372704.html

He discussed the issue with the supporters who backed his decision to quit the Congress and join the SP.Interacting with the supporters, Imran Masood said only the Samajwadi Party is capable of defeating the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Uttar Pradesh polls.Acknowledging that the Congress has given him honour and respect, Imran Masood said in the prevailing political situation, the BJP would have a direct contest with the Samajwadi Party in the assembly elections.Imran Masood also said the party leadership will take a decision on fielding candidates for the seven assembly seats of Saharanpur district and he would work to ensure their victory.Imran Masood had contested the UP assembly elections from Muzaffarabad constituency in Saharanpur in 2007 as an independent and defeated Jagdish Rana.

Akhtar is a close aide of Imran Masood.The speculation of Imran Masood joining the SP surfaced months ago.Earlier in October 2021, he said the party (the Congress) is not capable of fighting alone against the ruling BJP and it should form an alliance with Samajwadi Party for the upcoming elections.“First, we have to think are we capable of fighting alone against the BJP in Uttar Pradesh and the answer is ‘no’. Then, definitely, we should ally with the Samajwadi Party to defeat the BJP. Honestly, if we have to fight in Uttar Pradesh then we have to fight together,” he had added.Elections for the 403 assembly constituencies in Uttar Pradesh will be held in seven phases starting February 10, the election commission has said. The polling in Uttar Pradesh will be held on February 10, 14, 20, 23, 27 and March 3 and 7.The counting of votes will take place on March 10.Masood, supporters booked for violating Covid normsFormer MLA Imran Masood and 300 of his unnamed supporters were booked by the local police for amassing a large crowd of his supporters without taking permission from the authorities amid the enforcement of the model code of conduct, the police said, according to a PTI report.Saharanpur’s city superintendent of police Rajesh Kumar said Masood and his supporters were also booked for violating various anti-Covid guidelines.No one in the crowd at Masood’s residence was wearing any mask or following the social distancing norms, he said, according to the same PTI report.An FIR has been registered against Imran Masood and over 300 of his unnamed supporters under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Pandemic Act, Kumar said, the news agency added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-polls-imran-masood-consults-supporters-confirms-he-s-joining-samajwadi-party-101641838171444.html

10-01-2022||Pune||Pune-based NCL reported mutations in Omicron variant in November last year||PUNE The city-based National Chemical Laboratories (NCL) which has been studying the sewage and drainage outlets for SARS-CoV-2 samples for detection and genome sequencing had reported the first mutation in Omicron variant from a sample collected back in November last year from its own sewage treatment plant (STP).Through drain samples, the lab is helping the civic body identify the areas reporting an early surge of Omicron cases which can further help plan isolation and containment zones.Studying samples through the wastewater as the virus shreds off the body’s system through excretion and then through the drainage and sewage can be earlier detection of the samples as most RT-PCR samples are tested only after symptoms are reported or after close contacts.Dr Ashish Lele, director at the NCL said, “The studying of wastewater in the population helps understand various viruses which could be circulating in the community and fact can also help understand diseases like polio which are assumed to be eradicated. It helps in earlier detection as the virus could begin shedding off even before the person starts showing symptoms and so it helps in early detection. However, it also depends on multiple factors like floating population, migration and others.”The NCL has reported the first mutation in the Omicron strain based on a sample from its own Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) at the NCL-Phytorid plant which had a high viral load when the sample was collected on November 22, 2021. The sample shows one mutation in the Omicron variant.The sample shows Omicron one week before the institute has reported the first Omicron variant case in the swab samples, in the first week of December 2021.The institute had also reported one-two mutations in the Omicron variant which was specifically reported in the stream at Vitthalwadi stream on samples collected on November 26, Bopodi stream on November 30 and Erandwane stream on December 3 sample.The institute had also flagged off a spike gene mutation in the Delta variant from the samples collected in between October and December 2021 samples. The institute study has also clearly stated that the viral load in the January samples is much higher than the ones found in October, November or December last year. The STP samples are being studied from 30 canals and drain and also 12 STP’s and each sample is studied about twice a week.However, clarifying the mutation, Dr Lele said, “Mutations are a natural process and it should not be alarming as the mutations are not of concern. We have found that most of the strain is similar to the ones already published and so only a few minor mutations are noted which is not concerning and needs further study.”“We are studying the wastewater samples and sending the report to the civic body every week to help them plan for containment or surveillance accordingly,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/punebased-ncl-reported-mutations-in-omicron-variant-in-november-last-year-101641837451281.html
10-01-2022||Mumbai||HC asks petitioners how it can interfere in state decision which benefits public||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday sought to know from a petitioner who has filed a public interest litigation (PIL) against a government circular permitting only ‘fully vaccinated’ persons to travel on local trains and visit malls and workplaces whether the HC could interfere in a public scheme in which more than 75% of the population has participated. The HC held that as vaccination is a sort of weapon to fight Covid which minimises the chances of getting hospitalised, how can it be expected to interfere. The court asked the petitioner to respond within a week’s time. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Makarand Karnik, while hearing the PIL filed by activists Feroz Mithiborewala and Yohan Tengra, was informed by advocate Nilesh Ojha for Tengra that the circular issued by the state government in August 2021 violated citizens’ fundamental right to equality by discriminating between vaccinated and non-vaccinated persons and therefore the circular should be set aside and directions should be issued to the authorities to permit non-vaccinated persons to travel on local trains and visit malls and workplaces. Last month, chief secretary of state Debashish Chakrabarty said that the state had acted on reasonable restriction under parens patriae (power to protect persons who are unable to act on their own). However, advocate Ojha argued that while the CS himself had failed to get vaccinated claiming that was his choice, how could the common man be forced to do the same.The bench however said, “The state government says it has the responsibility of looking after the entire population of Maharashtra and it has to devise a policy to protect the majority of the population from Covid-19. Vaccination is a sort of weapon in the fight against Covid-19. None says if anyone is vaccinated, he or she will be immune to Covid-19 infection in future.” While Ojha stressed that most of the hospitalised persons were either fully vaccinated or had received one dose, the bench said, “These are steps for the fight against Covid. There are people who have contracted Covid after wearing masks, vaccination and physical distancing. However, the idea behind vaccination is that it will act as a shield against future infection. If the state has taken a policy decision, which it is entitled to take in the larger public interest, will that be a ground for us to say that the policy should be interfered with?” The court asked the petitioners to respond to its query and posted hearing of the PIL to January 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-asks-petitioners-how-it-can-interfere-in-state-decision-which-benefits-public-101641837391451.html

The court issued notices to the 29 individuals and corporate groups seeking their reply in the case by the next date of hearing, which is fixed as February 3, 2022.The bench comprising Justice MK Gupta and Justice YK Srivastava passed the order while hearing a petition filed by Manoj Kumar Pundir and six others. The petitioners are elected members of the apex council (governing body) of the UPCA. According to the petitioners, 24 individuals and 5 corporate members were illegally inducted as “life members” of the UPCA without following the due procedures and processes as per the recommendations of the Lodha Committee and the Supreme Court judgment of 2018 in this regard. The petitioners stated that some of the members of the apex council relinquished office after the 2018 Supreme Court judgement for having attracted “disqualification” by virtue of having served the UPCA for more than nine years. However, such “disqualified men” were made members of ‘board of directors’, through the backdoor, as they could not become members of apex council having served the UPCA for more than nine years.The petitioners alleged that the apex council was formed after the 2018 judgment of the Supreme Court to properly manage the cricket association in the light of recommendations of Lodha Committee. However, board of directors, the parallel body, was added in the constitution of UPCA to regain control over the functioning of the cricket association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/allahabad-hc-seeks-reply-from-govt-bcci-and-upca-101641837331357.html

He also alleged that the BJP’s strategy was to complicate polls and misuse government machinery to win them.He further alleged that the BJP crushed the future of farmers and the youth while claiming that the real development work for the state and its people was done by the previous SP government.

So, our appeal to all the protesting workers and who are on strike is to join back duty from tomorrow,” said Parab.For the last over two months the MSRTC workers and their several unions are protesting for their various demands, an action committee of the unions was formed earlier to have a conversation with the state government. But apparently, the main demand of merging the MSRTC into state government was diluted, according to the workers.Sanjay Munde, a driver from Pune MSRTC division, who is also leading the strike for independent workers, said, “All the 22 workers union representatives who attended the meeting are not participating in the current strike and we all will not join back duty. They are just conducting discussions and want to bring back workers to duty, but till our main demand of merger is not fulfilled no one will join back in Pune division and even in rest of the state.”The state transport department, meanwhile, has initiated hiring contract drivers to start the bus operations and accordingly the process has been started at all the divisions in the state.In the MSRTC Pune division, a total of 1,300 employees out of the 4,200 have resumed work. Whereas show cause notices to 69 workers have been sent and after three rounds of inquiry hearing, they would be dismissed from work if they don’t join back duty. The Pune division has suspended 488 workers out of which 66 workers have joined back. Still, the number is less to start back the bus operations in Pune division in full capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sharad-pawar-anil-parab-fail-to-get-msrtc-employees-to-give-up-on-strike-101641836671011.html
10-01-2022||Pune||Life imprisonment for man who raped, killed 16-year-old in 2012 in Pune||PUNE A 29-year-old man was sentenced to life in prison for rape and murder of a 16-year-old girl in Pashan in 2012. The conviction was awarded by a district judge on January 8, almost 10 years after the incident. The convicted man, who was 19-years of age at the time of the incident, was identified Akash Natha Koli, a resident of Bhegade chawl in Kokate lane of Pashan. He was convicted under Sections 302 (murder), 376 (sexual assault) read with 511, and 404 (dishonest misappropriation of property possessed by deceased person at the time of his death) of the Indian Penal Code. A fine of total ₹20,000 was levied upon him by the court. The victim was a Class 10 student who had moved to Pune in August 2012 and was walking home from tuition on September 8, 2012 around 6pm when she was killed. Her body was found near central government quarters in Pashan the next day with her school belongings lying around her. The judgement was made by district judge MM Deshpande in the presence of Assistant public prosecutor Pushkar Sapre and Subhash Nikam, deputy superintendent of police at Criminal investigation department (CID). Assistant sub-inspectors Kamlakar Gaikwad and KR Renuse, along with havaldar Nilesh Pukale helped the prosecution in the trial that went on for 10 years. “After having considered the submissions of the accused persons and their learned counsels and having considered the submission on behalf of the prosecution and considering the fact that the accused has committed murder of a 16-year old minor girl who is a student of Class 10. She had a bright future ahead and therefore, leniency cannot be shown against him. Therefore, this court is of the opinion that following order would meet the ends of justice,” read a part of the order passed by the judge. It was shortly after this case that the Protection of children from sexual offence (Pocso) Act came into existance. Therefore, sections of the specially formulated law could not be invoked in this case. While the statement of nodal officer Datta Angre confirmed the call records, the statement of medical officer Dr Urmila Dhondiram Mundhe confirmed sexual assault and murder. In June 2016, Dr Mundhe who conducted the post mortem was examined and cross-examined. She confirmed that there were six stab wounds on the girl’s body caused by a sharp object which is suspected to be a divider, an equipment with sharp points used for geometrical measurements by school students, that was found near her body. While the girl was found to have died by asphyxiation, the medical officer claimed that the injuries were consistent with the divider that was found lying near the girl’s body. “The prosecution in the case examined 19 witnesses and the case is based on circumstantial evidence. Accused used to stare at the victim and other girls passing by the road and used to pass comments for which he was repeatedly warned by surrounding people. On her way back from tuition, he stopped her midway and proposed to her but after she denied him, he dragged her to the spot of the incident and raped her and thereafter murdered her,” said APP Sapre. The medical officer’s report found wounds that were suggestive of sexual assault and around 25 laceration wounds on her body including six on her stomach. The officer, however, confirmed that the girl died of suffocation. “He gagged her mouth and suffocated her to death while assaulting her. Then he used a compass to check if she was dead and stabbed her with it. He took her phone, destroyed her SIM card, and started using her phone when his battery died out,” added APP Sapre. The phone was found in his possession during his arrest. Two witnesses in the case submitted that the boy was reprimanded for making sexual gestures at another girl months before the murder. The girl had moved to Pune only weeks before the murder. Unbeknownst to her, the man, who was 19-years of age back then, kept track of her for weeks before approaching her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/life-imprisonment-for-man-who-raped-killed-16-year-old-in-2012-in-pune-101641836551327.html

10-01-2022||Mumbai||Fewer tests lead to lower caseload, positivity rate down by one per cent||Mumbai After recording around 20,000 Covid cases for four days in a row, Mumbai witnessed a fall on Monday at 13,648 due to the fewer tests conducted in the city. In the past 24 hours, 59,242 tests were conducted against an average of 70,000 tests earlier last week. The test positivity rate (TPR) fell by one per cent as Monday recorded 23.03 per cent TPR. Five deaths were reported on Monday taking the toll to 16,411, while the overall case tally reached 9,28,220. Meanwhile, both experts and senior officials of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said that the ongoing week will play a key role to determine the further course of action.Suresh Kakani, the additional municipal commissioner and in charge of public health in the BMC, said that with nearly 60,000 tests conducted in the last 24 hours, the Covid graph has started to show a downward trend.“An adequate number of tests were done in the last 24 hours, which showed a decreased positivity rate. But we are not getting carried away because we need to be sure first whether this downward trend is just a one-day phenomenon or the numbers have seriously started to decline. Also, the rate of hospitalisation is something that we are concerned about and we need to see if the bed occupancy level rises throughout this week,” said Kakani.Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the Maharashtra Covid task force, said that the number of actual cases in Mumbai could be higher than the reported figures as many citizens are taking the rapid antigen test at their home and getting themselves treated privately.“While the numbers suggest that we are inching towards a plateau, we also have to consider that the laboratories in Mumbai are overwhelmed with the samples and have already reached a saturation level. Instead of focusing on the numbers, we will have to concentrate on other key factors like bed occupancy, doubling rate and patients that require oxygen and ventilation for treatment,” said Dr Joshi.Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the national and state Covid task force, said that it’s quite normal to record a lower number of infections on Mondays because usually fewer tests are conducted on Sundays.According to the BMC, Mumbai has a capacity of conducting one lakh tests per day and laboratory experts have said that they are in the process of scaling up the resources.“At present, we are conducting 10,000 to 15,000 tests per day and at the same time, we are working towards ramping up our resources so that we can do at least 50,000 tests per day,” said Chandrashekhar Mani, vice-president (Technology) of Thyrocare laboratories.Kakani also mentioned that the BMC is monitoring all the laboratories closely and it will send notices to the ones that fail to produce reports within 24 hours.“Mumbai has a capacity to conduct one lakh RT-PCR tests regularly. If we take antigen tests, the numbers can go higher, but we are only sticking with RT-PCR for accuracy. We have already told the laboratories to expedite their resources so that the daily test figures can also be expedited this week,” Kakani said.Besides this, 27,214 patients were discharged on Monday and the recovery rate of the state stood at 87 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fewer-tests-lead-to-lower-caseload-positivity-rate-down-by-one-per-cent-101641836010920.html

10-01-2022||Chandigarh||On mission inoculation, HP’s frontline warriors brave vagaries of weather||Himachal Pradesh became the first state to fully vaccinate 100% of its eligible population against Covid last month. Now, the health workers are on a mission to vaccinate those in the age group of 15 to 18 years. Despite adverse weather conditions in the state, the vaccinators have stepped out in snow and cold temperatures to inoculate teenagers. The upper regions of Shimla, Rohru, Jubbal, Theog and Chopal experienced intermittent spells of snow while the minimum temperatures plummeted. “It began snowing in the morning and soon, the roads were laden with five inches of snow. When our vehicle got stuck, I, and along with my team members, walked till Barthatha village in Jubbal to vaccinate the youngsters,” said a health worker Jai Kala. “Children were delighted to see us. They thought the teams wouldn’t reach owing to snowfall,” she added. “For us, vaccinating the entire population is the priority. Teams are facing problems with mobility. I personally talk to the team members to motivate them. They are the backbone of vaccination drive,” said Shimla chief medical officer Surekha Chopra. Vaccinators also earned appreciation from Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya, who tweeted a video clip of health workers walking in snow to inoculate the young population. He appreciated the health workers by saying, “Nadi, registan ho ya barf ka toofan, humari health army lakshya sadhnay mein tatpar hai. (Whether it’s a river, a desert or a snow blizzard, our health army is ready to achieve its targets).” “We too want to spend time inside our cosy homes along with our family members in this harsh winter, but at the same time we realise that the war against the lethal virus has not got over yet,” said another health worker, Padma from Kaza. Chamba chief medical officer Dr Kapil Sharma said the health authorities have been facing challenges due to bad weather. “We had to cancel drives at some places due to fresh snowfall as it would have been difficult for children to reach the venues. The health teams, however, with the support of district administration and school management, are working hard to carry out the inoculation drive,” he added. Nearly 90,000 health workers, including Ashas, are deputed on the vaccination drive. High-altitude regions in Chamba, Shimla, Sirmaur, Kullu, Kinnaur, Lahaul and Spiti and Mandi district have received snow. Conditions are more difficult for the health workers in the tribal districts of Lahaul and Spiti and Kinnaur. “On Saturday, we had to cancel the sessions due to relentless snowfall. But the teams have high morales and we have requested the civil administration in Kaza to provide more 4X4 vehicles for vaccination drive,” said Padma. “Our team visited Hikkim, the highest motorable village where minimum temperature is minus 18 degrees Celsius,” he said. The health authorities have targeted to vaccinate 700 children in Kaza medical block. The recent spells of snow have slowed down the vaccination pace in Himachal, which had vaccinated 90,000 children on the first day when the drive was launched on January 3. HP government has a target to vaccinate about 3.57 lakh youngsters in the age group of 15-18 years. As many as 4,259 educational institutions would be covered under this campaign, which includes 2,801 government, 1,402 private and 56 other facilities. “The weather has slowed down the pace and added new challenges. Mobility is a big issue while the threat of natural disasters like avalanches is another. Due to snow, people are unable to visit the centres for vaccination,” said Hemraj Bhairwa, director, National Rural Health Mission. Himachal government’s general administration department will be deputing state helicopters for ferrying vaccination team to the snowbound regions, it has been learnt.

10-01-2022||Lucknow||Sangam city’s two key roads to meet world-class standards||Two prominent roads of the Sangam city would soon be transformed into world-class roads. The roads will be beautified under Prayagraj Smart City Project: Thornhill Road and Sarojani Naidu Road, for which Prayagraj Development Authority (PDA) is planning to spend around ₹27 crore, officials said. The highlight of the beautification project will be that the authorities will not cut any trees down for road widening. In addition, the project will feature features such as ethnic lampposts and the synchronization of the colours of the buildings on either side of the road, they added. “Keeping in view the rich heritage of the city and with an aim to give an ethnic look to these two roads, PDA would be developing Sarojini Naidu Marg and Thornhill Road in such a way that every facility on these two roads would be of world-class standards. We plan to widen these roads, provide a skating track, vending zones, unique areas for morning walkers, benches for people to sit in peace, e-charging points, bollards at specific points, and more as part of the beautification effort,” said Arvind Kumar Chauhan, vice-chairman of the PDA. The official said that the most important feature would be that they have decided not to bring down any trees but would rather plant more trees on the sides of these two roads. “As the two sides of these two roads have a thick cover of adult trees, we have given a lot of thought to how to protect these trees and still go ahead with the beautification work,” he explained. All buildings on these two roads would be painted the same colour as those on Sardar Patel Road. Moreover, the walls of the government buildings, located on these roads, would be painted with murals showcasing the rich heritage of the city and the legacy it carries with it. Both sides of the roads would also have smart street lights, a proper drainage system and parking zones for two and four-wheelers etc. Sarojani Naidu road starts in front of Prayagraj Municipal Corporation office and after crossing All Saint’s Cathedral, extends up to Muir Road. Likewise, Thornhill road starts at Indira Gandhi statute (near New Cantonment) and extends up to Dhobhighat crossing. About ₹17 crore is estimated to be allocated for the development of Sarojini Naidu Road, which is around 2 km long, while around ₹9.7 crore will be allocated for the development of Thornhill Road, which is around 2.5 km long, the officials said. A Singapore-based company has prepared a detailed project report (DPR) for the development of these two roads.

Who can forget the flamboyance of Rohan Kanhai and Brian Lara or the silken touch of David Gower or Zaheer Abbas or the wristy stroke play of Mohd Azharuddin up against the wily leg spin and flippers of Shane Warne or the tearing pace of Allan Donald and the clever variations of Michael Holding? The acrobatic fielding of Jonty Rhodes, the razor-sharp reflexes of Eknath Solkar or the almost impregnable wicketkeeping skills of Allan Knott are etched in the memories of all connoisseurs of the game forever. What we conveniently overlook are the so-called silent sentinels of cricket without whose support the stars of the game would not have shone the way they do. My attention was drawn to these unsung heroes of the game by the recent news of the death of Yashpal Sharma, the middle order Indian batsman who was a part of the 1983 World Cup winning side. Skipper Kapil Dev acknowledged that India would never have made it to the finals had Yashpal Sharma not played the match-winning innings of 89 against the English side in the semi-finals. Another great Indian batsman who belonged to this category was Mohinder Amarnath, whose dogged defence against the fury of Imran Khan won the admiration of the Little Master, Sunil Gavaskar. Mohinder Amarnath would come into the pavilion at the end of the day in the Test matches against Pakistan with the body full of bruises sustained while facing the pace of Imran Khan and Wasim Akram. Unfortunately, the world remembers swashbuckling Kapil Dev, the stylish Gundappa Vishwanath and the prolific Sunil Gavaskar from that era while overlooking these silent sentinels. This is true for other countries, too. Pakistan’s Mudassar Nazar, West Indies’ Larry Gomes, and Sri Lanka’s Roshan Mahanama also belonged to this elite class of cricketers. What is interesting to discover is that life, too, has interesting parallels to this cricketing oddity. All of us would agree that there are very few people around who are blessed with a breath-taking talent. Most of us can only aspire to be like those stars. We work our way through the muddles of life somehow, with a lot of grit and determination even though we might lack that one splendid talent. This does not make us incomplete. This does not deter us to give up the challenges that confront us. We must learn to respect these “workhorses” just as we learn to eulogise the “stars”. Happiness and contentment do not depend upon the share of talent that we are born with. Cricket is well and truly a microcosm of life! gulbaharsidhu@rediffmail.com The writer is a Jalandhar-based consultant psychiatrist||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/salute-the-spirit-of-silent-sentinels-behind-the-stars-101641835232473.html
10-01-2022||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh polls: BJP first off the blocks, set to launch door-to-door campaign||Two days after the election commission (EC) banned political rallies and road shows in view of a surge in Covid-19 cases, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is all set to begin a massive door-to-door campaign for the Uttar Pradesh polls. The people connect will begin on Tuesday. Several party teams, each limited to five people as mandated by the election commission, will visit each household falling under 1, 74, 000 booths across the state, UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh said after a meeting of the party’s 24-member election committee at the state headquarters in Lucknow on Monday. The BJP is the first political party in Uttar Pradesh to announce its revised poll campaign plan after the EC directive. Panna pramukhs (head of a page on the voters’ list), a concept first introduced by Union home minister Amit Shah in Gujarat in 2007, would also be part of the door-to-door campaign, party leaders said. This means that the campaign by the five-member teams would also include ministers, senior leaders and party functionaries. Virtually everyone in the BJP, including chief minister Yogi Adityanath, is now a panna pramukh as part of the party’s plan to ensure the mass connect campaigns get the desired push. The 35 million (3.50 crore) plus beneficiaries of government schemes that BJP says are present in the state would be part of the target audience of the door-to-door contact campaign for the Uttar Pradesh polls.A pamphlet prepared by the party with the catchline “Poori hui har aas, ghar ghar hua vikas (all wishes fulfilled, development reaches each home)” would also be distributed.All-women teams would connect with women. Several other teams of the party’s foot soldiers would undertake “samajik sampark (social contact)” involving a wider audience.“There are an estimated 35 million plus beneficiaries of various government schemes in UP,” the state BJP chief said, adding that the party would also distribute face covers and sanitisers. Until January 15, when the election commission would consider a review of its ban order, door-to-door contact would be the only direct campaign format available before the political parties, a first of its kind experience both for the campaigners as well voters. The party also plans to deploy “LED raths” in all 403 assembly segments after the festival of Makar Sankranti on January 14, BJP leaders said. These raths with a couple of BJP cadres on board would be equipped with large TV screens and apprise voters of the government’s achievements, a party leader added.However, many in the BJP said the campaign format has been an old feature of the life and times of any veteran party hand. “Since the Jan Sangh (BJP’s predecessor) days, we used to take out prabhat pheris (morning rounds), and campaign on foot for social causes. So, this medium of door-to-door contact is like reliving those days when we would go about chanting “tera vaibhav amar rahe maa, hum din chaar rahe na rahein (may your glory remain eternal Mother India whether we remain or not),” said party veteran and Lucknow mayor Sanyukta Bhatia.

10-01-2022||Patna||Chirag’s party to go solo for Council polls in Bihar||Amid rumours of a possible alliance with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) for future elections in Bihar, the LJP (Ram Vilas) faction led by Chirag Paswan has put on hold any such plan till a firm view emerges in the parliamentary party.“We have decided to go solo. There are several big parties in the state but only we have the courage to go alone,” Chirag told reporters on Monday. “The LJP (RV) president has made it clear that any talks of an alliance will not take place at least till the Bihar Legislative Council elections are over,” said party’s spokesperson Ashraf Ansari.Elections for 24 seats of the Bihar Legislative Council are set to be held in a couple of months and parties have already started negotiations for seats. The current strength in the 75-member Legislative Council is 51. The 24 MLC seats, which fell vacant in June last year, have not been filled due to the delay in conducting the panchayat polls.In November last year, LJP (RV)’s state parliamentary party had sent a proposal to the party’s national president Chirag Paswan, suggesting forming an alliance for the MLC polls following a dismal performance in the recently held by-polls for two assembly seats and equally poor performance in the 2020 assembly elections.LJP at present has no representation in either house of Bihar. Its lone MLA switched over to the JD(U) and following division in the party, LJP (Ram Vilas) has only one MP in Lok Sabha in the form of Chirag Paswan whereas the other LJP, the LJP (National), led by union minister Pashupati Kumar Paras, has five MPs, including himCong, RJD may move past bitternessAfter bitterness during the by-polls for two assembly seats last year, allies Congress and RJD might again join hands for Council polls, sources said.“It is in the interest of both of us, especially after results of the by-polls,” said a Congress leader who did not wish to be named. 
10-01-2022||Patna||Bihar CM tests Covid-19 positive; state reports 5 deaths||Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar tested positive for coronavirus on Monday, his office said in a tweet from its official handle, even as the state reported five deaths and 4,737 new cases of Covid-19 in the last 24 hours, taking the number of active cases up to 20,938, according to a health department bulletin. “On the advice of doctors, he (Kumar) has isolated himself at his residence” the CMO tweet said. The CM had tested negative on the rapid antigen detection (RAD) kit on Monday morning, but later tested positive on the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a confirmatory test for Covid-19, said sources. Earlier, deputy chief ministers Tarkeshwar Prasad and Renu Devi had tested positive for the virus. Among the members of the state cabinet to have tested positive are Ashok Choudhary (building construction department), Amarendra Pratap Singh (agriculture), Sunil Kumar (excise and prohibition), Santosh Kumar Suman (SC/ST welfare) Shahnawaz Hussain (industries) and Mukesh Sahni (animal husbandry department). Ashwini Kumar Choubey and Nityanand Rai are among the union ministers from Bihar to have tested Covid-19 positive. Kumar had earlier embarked on the Samaj Sudhar Abhiyan, a social reforms campaign, from Motihari in East Champaran district on December 22. He was, however, forced to abort it midway after his tour to Aurangabad on January 4 as Covid-19 cases began to rise in the state. Of the five Covid-19 deaths in the state during the last 24 hours on Monday, three were reported from AIIMS and one each from the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH) and the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS). Among the three Covid-19 deaths at AIIMS was a six-year-old girl with severe brain disease. The other two casualties at the institute were of a 50-year-old patient who underwent a stomach surgery and was suffering from kidney disorder, besides a 72-year-old cancer patient. A 21-year-old road traffic accident victim who tested positive for Covid-19 died at the IGIMS. Bihar had last added close to 5,000 Covid-19 cases in a day during the peak of the second wave of the pandemic in May last year. On Sunday, the state reported 5,022 new Covid-19 cases. On Sunday, the state also reported 27 new cases of Omicron on the genomic sequencing test at the IGIMS. The total number of cases of Omicron, has a high infectivity rate, has now gone up to 28 in Bihar. Earlier, on December 30 last year, a 26-year-old resident of Patna’s Kidwaipuri locality was the first in the state to test positive for the Omicron variant of Covid-19. The result, however, did not reflect on the national health portal on Covid-19, as the same was done through ‘S’ gene target failure (SGTF) kit, which is indicative of Omicron, while the genomic sequencing test is a confirmatory test. 
10-01-2022||Patna||Bihar man who claimed he took 12 Covid jabs on the run||The 84-year-old man from Bihar’s Madhepura district, who has claimed to have taken 12 shots of Covid-19 vaccine since the vaccination began last year, has gone absconding since a police team reached his house on Sunday to arrest him, police said. Days after the man, Brahmadev Mandal, made the claim on January 5, medical officer of Puraini primary health centre (PHC) in the district lodged an FIR (first information report) against him on January 8.Mandal, a retired employee of postal department, is a resident of Orai village. His wife Nirmala Devi alleged he was being harassed by police. “Police are behaving with my husband as if he is a dreaded criminal,” she said.Devi, though, maintained her husband had managed to take multiple jabs of the vaccine. “It benefitted him in curing several ailments,” she said.Mandal had even showed the local media a paper on which he had jotted down the date and time of the vaccines he was administered.On January 8, medical officer of Puraini PHC Dr Arun Kumar lodged an FIR at Puraini police station against Mandal under sections 419 (cheating by impersonation), 420 (cheating and dishonesty) and 188 (disobedience of order promulgated by government) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).Deepak Chandra Das, station house officer (SHO) of Puraini police station, said, “Police visited his house on Sunday evening, but he was not there. He will be arrested soon.” Though local health officials declined to comment on any loophole that Mandal would have exploited to possibly get multiple jabs, residents of his village said that in vaccination camps, health workers would just collect copies of identity proof (Aadhaar card) of beneficiaries and administer the jabs. “They update data only hours later at the nearest primary health centre, after which we get notifications on our phones. It’s possible that after the second jab for Mandal, the system would have rejected data for the subsequent shots he actually managed to take in the vaccination camps in villages,” one of the village residents said, wishing not to be identified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-man-who-claimed-he-took-12-covid-jabs-on-the-run-101641834090833.html
10-01-2022||Mumbai||Days after schools shut down, worries surface about Class 10 & 12 preliminary exams||MUMBAI: Barely had Dhruvi Patel, 16, started attending offline classes since the first week of October than the Maharashtra state government recently decided to shut down in-person classes, pushing schools and junior colleges once again into online mode and leaving students like Patel in a lurch. Patel has attended school online for nearly 17 out of the past 19 months and had just begun enjoying her time back in the classroom.Patel, a Class 10 student of St Paul’s Convent, Dadar east, said, “Since I was in Class 9 in 2020, most of our assignments and exams were conducted online which hampered our writing habits. In the last two months, we were slowly getting back to it and looking forward to the preliminary exams but now our school is not sure if physical exams can be held.”Schools that were shut down in March 2020 were reopened for offline teaching for Classes 5 to 12 in rural areas and Classes 8 to 12 in urban areas on October 4, 2021. In December, the state school education minister also announced the dates for SSC (Class 10) and HSC (Class 12) board exams to be held over March and April this year in physical mode.However, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the city and state has forced the school education department to shut down offline learning for all Classes except 10 and 12. “Most students have only now started submitting writing assignments and in order to prepare them for the board exam, they need to be able to write two-and-a-half-hour papers. Therefore, the preliminary exam is important,” said the principal of a Vile Parle school.Since Monday, several colleges in the city have started offline preliminary exams for their Class 12 students, especially since Class 12 exams are scheduled to begin with oral exams from February 14. This move however has invited flak from students and parents.Chitra Sharda, mother of a Class 12 student of Mithibai College, questioned, “At least 12 students in my son’s batch have tested positive for Covid in the last one week and several others are complaining of Covid symptoms at present. The college is insistent on in-person exams because the government notification says they are allowed. Why are our children to put up with the risk of physical classes while all other batches have been moved to the online mode?”Many schools and junior colleges are currently feeling helpless as more and more staff is contracting the virus. “Our preliminary exams are scheduled from January 17 and we don’t have enough staff at present to conduct physical exams. Students are on study leave so we plan to wait and watch for another week before taking a call on the exams,” said Rupa Roy, principal, Balmohan Vidyamandir, Dadar. She added that their last resort will be to hold preliminary exams online where students will have to submit answer sheets online. “We had done this in 2021 and might do it again. The health and safety of staff and students is of the utmost importance to us so we won’t do anything to jeopardise the same,” she added.Rajesh Pandya, vice-president of the Teachers Democratic Front (TDF) said that their organisation has approached the state education department for a clarification on preliminary exams. “We are requesting the authorities to release a notification stating that no physical exams will be held at a time when the state and city are recording a high number of Covid cases. With no official notification in place, schools are forcing teachers to attend physical school, endangering the lives of teachers and their respective families,” said Pandya.

Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu both were present at her joining. Malvika is a computer engineer.Her induction has triggered a revolt in the party, with sitting Moga Congress MLA, Dr Harjot Kamal, claiming that he will either contest the polls as an independent or join another political party, if denied a party ticket. Many of his aides, including Moga mayor Nitika Bhalla, have threatened to resign from the party, in support of Dr Kamal. Channi was to meet the MLA, but changed his schedule after a crowd assembled outside his house.“I have been betrayed. You must take revenge. I will fight independently if the party refuses to give me the ticket from Moga. I am fully confident that I will fight and win from here,” Dr Kamal told the gathering of his supporters. Sources in the district Congress committee said the defeat of his wife, Rajinder Kaur, in mayoral polls in Moga municipal corporation in 2021 had lowered his standing in the party.Sidhu, Channi back MalvikaWhen queried on Malvika’s ticket from Moga, Channi and Sidhu said in one voice, “Now, is there any need to say anything?” “Dr Harjot Kamal is my brother. He will be adjusted somewhere else, if there is any need,” said Channi.Sidhu termed her inclusion as a ‘game-changer’. “Her affiliation with the party will change the wave in the adjoining and nearby constituencies. It is an honour to be affiliated with this family,” he said, “It is rare for the party president and the CM to visit someone’s house together, but the Sood family has been accorded the honour and they deserve it.”Channi added, “Sonu Sood himself is an ideology. He has brought laurels for Punjab on a global level. Society needs givers...the affiliation of this family with the Congress is a good omen.”Covid norms, MCC protocols violatedCovid safety norms and protocols related to the model code of conduct were violated at both places. Around 100-odd persons were present at Malvika’s house during her induction, while MLA Dr Kamal also addressed a large gathering at his house. There was hardly anyone who was wearing a mask, with social distancing not followed. The Election Commission of India has prohibited political rallies, road-shows, street-corner meets and processions till January 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sonu-sood-s-sister-joins-cong-moga-mla-revolts-101641833550801.html
10-01-2022||Mumbai||Third wave may peak by month-end or 1st week of Feb: Tope||Mumbai State public health minister Rajesh Tope said that the third wave may peak by January-end or the first week of February before beginning to taper. The daily Covid positivity numbers dropped to 33,470 on Monday, compared to 44,388 on Sunday. This was mostly due to reduced testing as 1,73,806 tests were conducted on Sunday, compared to 2,02,932 the previous day. Mumbai led the tally with 13,648 cases, and of the eight deaths reported in the state, it accounted for five. Meanwhile, 31 Omicron cases were found in the state, of which the highest number was from Pune at 28, followed by Pune rural at two and Pimpri Chinchwad at one. So far, a total of 1,247 Omicron cases have been reported in the state. After a two-hour meeting with Mansukh Mandaviya, the union minister for health and family welfare, Tope addressed the media and sought to allay fear over the virus. He added that of the people testing positive for the virus, only a minuscule needed oxygen support or intensive care. Of those testing positive, around 85 per cent were asymptomatic. He added that the home quarantine period had been fixed at seven days.Tope also said that the number of active Covid cases in Maharashtra was 1.73 lakh. However, of these, just 1,711 (one per cent) were in the ICU, and 5,400 (two per cent) were on oxygen support. “The rest of them, or 13 per cent, are patients with mild and moderate symptoms. There are no deaths on a large scale or demand for ICU beds or oxygen,” said Tope. Only 38,850 ICU and 1.34 lakh oxygen beds were occupied. Maharashtra had 16,000 ventilator beds, and just 700 of them were occupied, indicating a minimal load on the infrastructure.Of the 523 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants that had been approved, 404 were functional and had been tested, and the others will be commissioned soon.While the state has announced that a lockdown will be imposed in auto mode when the demand for medical oxygen touches 700 metric tons (MT) a day and when 40 per cent of beds are occupied, the oxygen requirement for both, Covid and non-Covid patients were just around 250 MT.“We told the minister that there is no huge stress on the infrastructure,” said Tope, adding that they had been asked to focus on testing, tracing, treatment, Covid-appropriate behaviour and vaccination. The state will also work on boosting vaccination numbers and adopt an aggressive strategy for it. So far, 89 per cent of the target beneficiaries in the state have been given the first dose of the vaccine, while vaccination has been completed for 60 per cent. The numbers had to be improved in Aurangabad district, where they were lower.Referring to the state’s decision to close down educational institutions till February 15, Tope said he had discussed this with Balram Bhargava, Director General, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Bhargava had advocated more curbs if the positivity rate crossed 10 per cent, while this was at a higher 15.5 per cent in Maharashtra.“The third wave is here,” said Tope. “The spike will not be permanent. Perhaps, this rise will persist till January-end or the first week of February, and then begin to taper. This is based on what experts have been saying based on the experience globally… the curbs can be done away with when the cases start declining,” he explained, asking parents, students and stakeholders to take the decision “in the right spirit.”District collectors have been told to give home isolation kits containing multi-vitamin and paracetamol tablets, masks, and sanitisers. Asymptomatic patients will also be sensitised on precautions to be taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/third-wave-may-peak-by-month-end-or-1st-week-of-feb-tope-101641833370876.html

To incentivise employees to return to work, the state government assured them not to take any action against nearly 50,000 employees that are still on strike. The government has also promised that suspended or terminated employees will be considered for withdrawal of action once the transport services are back on track. The MSRTC employee union has also asked the employees to return to work and stated that they would continue to ask for their demands while on duty. Earlier, the Maharashtra government had also announced a hike in salaries by 41 per cent and a raise on their basic pay. “I am happy that the employees’ unions are positive about the appeal made by the government. We should all safeguard the interest of the corporation and should not forget that our commitment is towards the passengers. I have requested the workers to resume work immediately. The MSRTC has been going through a financial crisis because of the pandemic despite the fact that the employees have been given a pay hike up to 41%. The government was positive about the demands of the employees,” said Pawar.Pawar also said that the merger of the MSRTC as a government entity was a matter of sub-judice. “The court-appointed committee is working on it and the state government will act on it according to the court order. The state government has already clarified its stand. There is no point talking about it since the matter is sub-judice,” he said.Further, the employee union on Monday raised the demand of inclusion of the corporation again to the state government and raised the salary on par with the seventh pay commission.“We had a detailed discussion today with Sharad Pawar and Anil Parab. The strike has been ongoing for more than two months and we are happy with the discussions that happened today. Our demands will be considered by the state government. I request all the employees to return to work and we would continue discussions with the government regarding our demands.” said Sandip Shinde, member of MSRTC employee union. MSRTC had earlier stated that they suffered an accumulated loss of Rs.12,000 crore due to lockdown, which eventually delayed the salaries of employees.State transport minister Anil Parab said that the employees should report to work without any fear and there will be no action taken against them. “I had made an appeal to the employees on strike on three occasions in the past as well. 50,000 striking employees have been issued show cause notices. We would not initiate any action against them if they resume work immediately. The employees’ unions have demanded the pay scale to be raised on par with the seventh pay commission recommendations applicable to the state employees. The demand will be positively looked into once everything in MSRTC gets streamlined. The employees have also pointed at the difference between the proposed pay hike and the two agreements done with the employees. An amicable decision will soon be taken,” said Parab.About 96,000 employees of the corporation across the state went on a strike from October 27, 2021 demanding a hike in payment and inclusion of the corporation in the state government.The MSRTC, one of the largest state transport bus services in India, is the only affordable transport service for people particularly residing in rural Maharashtra and has a fleet of nearly 18,000 buses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pawar-urges-msrtc-employees-to-return-to-work-says-no-action-will-be-taken-against-them-101641831750746.html

The remaining part of the tunnel works will be done without the boring machine.The parts of the TBM, the BMC had purchased from China in 2020 and had arrived in India in April 2020. After assembling the boring machine, the BMC had started work in January 2021 and now the other side between Marine Drive to Priyadarshini Park will be taken up.Addressing the breakthrough ceremony via video conferencing, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday said that the Mawla tunnel work is going on smoothly despite many challenges. He said that by accepting these challenges, the BMC has continued its vigorous journey towards fulfilling the dreams of Mumbaikars. “I would also like to express complete support and cooperation of the state government for the completion of the project,” he added. Others present at the event also included Guardian Minister of Suburban Mumbai, Aaditya Thackeray, City’s Guardian Minister Aslam Shaikh and Mumbai Mayor Kishori PednekarA BMC official from the Coastal Road Department said, “We are under preparations for completing the 1.4 km tunnel on the Priyadarshini Park to Marine Drive stretch and works on the other side of the tunnel will start by April 2022 and we aim to complete it by December 2022. The time taken in the second side will be lesser considering now we know the soil and strata of the area.”It will operate 25 metres below the surface at Girgaum and 75 metres below the surface at Malabar Hill. The width of each tunnel will be 12 metres, with two lanes – each 3-3.2 metres wide – one emergency lane. The BMC claims to have completed above 20% of the work for the Coastal Road Project and has set a deadline of July 2023 to complete the entire project.Meanwhile, the construction work of the ₹12,700 crore coastal road was started in October 2018, and since then the project has been headlining for environmental issues. In July 2019, the Bombay high court (HC) put a stay on the project citing that it needed to have environmental clearances. The coastal road project was originally planned between Nariman Point and Kandivali, claiming it will ease traffic for those travelling between north and south Mumbai. However, now there is a question whether there should be a coastal road or a sea link beyond Versova to connect to the suburbs. The state is yet to take a call on it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/tunnel-works-partially-completed-for-mumbai-coastal-road-bmc-101641831450676.html

10-01-2022||Lucknow||Parties launch digital poster wars as UP braces for polls||LUCKNOW ‘Dus March’ (March 10), the date for UP poll results, is the main theme for the digital poster wars launched by most political parties, especially the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its main rival Samajwadi Party (SP). The parties, in a somewhat poetic manner, are claiming their turn to form the next government in the state on that date.The social media is abuzz with the digital campaigns amid the Election Commission’s ban on political rallies, public meetings, yatras and nukkad sabhas till January 15 coupled with no publicity through hoardings or wall writings throughout the entire model code of conduct (MCC) period.The digital posters are made and shared extensively by the parties, their leaders, cadres, and supporters in the general public on social media.Sample these:UP minister and government spokesperson tweeted a poster: “10 March, phir Yogi-raaj (CM Yogi Adityanath’s rule again from March 10).” The poster shows Yogi Adityanath and Sidharth Nath Singh together sitting among a large crowd.The BJP, on its official twitter handle, posted: “Raaj tilak ki karo taiyaari, Dus March ko phir aa rahey hain bhagwadhaari (Prepare for coronation as the saffron-clad are returning). The digital poster shows Yogi in his saffron robe while the crowd to which Yogi is waving has been changed to greyscale (black and white) to emphasise the saffron colour.A Samajwadi Party MLA, considered close to party chief Akhilesh Yadav, posted a poster on his Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook accounts stating, ““Dus March, UP recharge (with Akhilesh’s face dominating the poster),”Samajwadi Party spokesperson IP Singh, who had booked a “return air ticket” for chief minister Yogi Adityanath from Lucknow to Gorakhpur, shared two posters. One declares Akhilesh as saying: “Dus March ko aa raha hoon, 300 unit free bijli laa raha hoon (I am coming on March 10 with 300 units free power). On January 1 Akhilesh had announced a poll promise of 300 units free power to all domestic power consumers and free power for irrigation to farmers. The other poster by IP Singh says: “Dus March, Yogi saaf (Yogi will be wiped out on March 10).”On the other hand, the UP Congress’ digital poster on its official social media states: “Dus March...hogi mahilaaon ki jeet, UP mein shuru hogi nai reet (women will win on March 10 and harbinger new tradition). The Congress post has a picture of party’s national general secretary and UP in-charge Priyanka Gandhi Vadra superimposed on the map of UP, signifying the women-oriented poll promises that Priyanka made.The Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), in its tweet, shared its national president Jayant Chaudhary’s poster, saying: “10 March...taarikh tay ho gai hai...ku-shaasan ka hoga ant, su-shaasan lekar aayenge Jayant (Jayant will bring in good-governance, the bad governance will end on March 10).

The third accused Vishal Kumar Jha (21) was sent to judicial custody. The lawyers representing the three accused argued that they were innocent and were falsely implicated in the case and claimed that the Twitter accounts of their clients were hacked. It is pertinent to note that during interrogation by the Delhi police, Bishnoi had also claimed that he was handling Shweta Singh’s Twitter account. Countering their claims, the Mumbai cyber police informed the court that the accused got an OTP every time someone asked them to allow access to Twitter handles, thus, they were fully aware of what they were doing. The police also revealed that the accused were using Protonmail in order to hide their identity. Cops are also checking if the accused were using VPN (Virtual Private Network) to ensure that their location was not traced and trying to find a connection to the Sulli Deals matter. Singh and Rawat used more than 10 Twitter accounts each, the police said. Investigating officer Inspector Maushmi Patil sought more time from the court claiming that a lot of data is stored on the four mobile phones and laptops seized from the accused, analysing which was taking a lot of time. However, the defence lawyers opposed the police’s plea for extension of police custody claiming that the main accused has been arrested by Delhi police and their clients are students and first-time offenders. After hearing both sides, the court remanded Singh and Rawat to police custody till Friday and sent Jha to judicial custody.Jha has tested positive for Covid and has been admitted to Kalina quarantine centre, the police said. Bulli Bai was uploaded on an open-source host platform GitHub on December 31, 2021. On January 1, the app’s content was promoted on Twitter, where morphed images of more than 100 Muslim women were published in an attempt to “auction” them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bulli-bai-two-accused-in-police-custody-till-friday-101641823350014.html

Start marking districts according to their poll dates for achieving 100% vaccination here 10 days prior to the voting dates in these districts. Make a detailed plan for executing this new policy by today evening,” Adityanath told officers concerned at the Covid-19 review meeting.He said the state so far had administered 21.39 crore Covid vaccination doses. While 13.47 crore people got their first doses, 7.91 crore were fully vaccinated (two doses). Till Sunday, 24.22 lakh adolescents in age group of 15-18 were given their first dose.The CM said: “Experts say that the new variant of the Covid virus is not as virulent as before and is less harmful. It is not a big threat to those who are vaccinated. There is no need to panic, rather the need of the hour is safety and alertness,” he emphasised.The chief minister directed officials to ensure that physical presence of employees should not exceed 50% in government and private offices (excluding essential services) and encourage introduction of work from home. In case any employee in private sector tests Covid positive, then the employee should be sanctioned seven-day leave, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-announces-new-vax-policy-in-sync-with-election-dates-101641819149971.html

10-01-2022||Mumbai||Employee arrested for stealing ₹40L from dry fruit shop||Mumbai The LT Marg police arrested a 38-year-old dry fruit and sweets shop employee in south Mumbai for allegedly stealing over ₹40 lakh since 2017.The incident came to light after the shopkeeper noticed in CCTV footage that the accused, Ritalal Mahato, pocketed the cash paid by the customer instead of keeping it in the cash counter.Mahato is a native of Jharkhand and came to Mumbai five years ago. He started working at Sapan Papadwala and General Store in the Bhuleshwar area in 2017. He used to make sweets in the shop, which supplied sweets and dry fruits to smaller shops in the vicinity, said police sub-inspector Vinod Pawar of the LT Marg police station. Mahato was also assigned a job to deposit money in the employer’s bank account. He did not deposit all the money in the employer’s account and kept some aside and deposited the same in his personal accounts, said the police officer.Mahato also stole money at the shop. In November, the employer noticed in the CCTV camera that Mahato kept ₹5,000 in his pocket after collecting from a customer who purchased dry fruits from the shop and paid in cash, said Pawar. The employer then also checked his bank account and found that some money is missing. He then started inquiring with the people at his shop and found that the accused might not have deposited all of the money.When Mahato was confronted, he stopped coming to work and switched off his phone.The shopkeeper then gave a written complaint to the LT Marg police station. “We conducted an inquiry and found that there were four bank accounts in the name of the accused and transactions of ₹31 lakh were done in last four years,” said the police officer who is part of the investigating team.Mahato was nabbed from Kalbadevi area on Sunday morning and was produced in the court and remanded to police custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/employee-arrested-for-stealing-rs-40l-from-dry-fruit-shop-101641815429566.html
10-01-2022||Chandigarh||Six of terror module held for Pathankot army camp blast||Punjab Police on Monday busted a terror module backed by the International Sikh Youth Federation (ISYF), a banned terror outfit working at the behest of Pakistan’s ISI, with the arrest of six of its operatives in connection with grenade blast at Pathankot army camp on November 21 last year. Also read: Ex-SC judge to head panel to probe security lapse during PM’s visit to Punjab, rules top courtThe Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar police recovered six hand-grenades, a pistol, a rifle along with bullets and magazines from them, Punjab director general of police (DGP) VK Bhawra said in a release. Those arrested have been identified as Amandeep, alias Mantri, Gurwinder Singh, Parminder Kumar, Rajinder Singh, Hapreet Singh and Raman Kumar, all from Gurdaspur district. In two instances unidentified persons had hurled hand-grenades in Pathankot, one near Chakki Pull on November 11, 2021, and the other outside Triveni Dwar of the army’s at Pathankot cantonment on November 21. Separate cases were registered in this regard at the Pathankot division 2 and division 1 police stations, respectively. In the statement, DGP Bhawra said that the accused admitted that they were directly in touch with the self-proclaimed chief of ISYF (Rode) Lakhbir Singh Rode and his aides, Sukhmeetpal Singh, alias Sukh Bhikhariwal, and Sukhpreet, alias Sukh, for planning terrorist attacks. “The recovered hand-grenades, arms and ammunition were pushed in from across the border by Lakhbir Rode and the six accused had been tasked with attacking identified targets which were mainly police and defence establishments and religious places,” he said, adding that the accused persons have also confessed to having lobbed hand-grenades twice in Pathankot. SBS Nagar senior superintendent of police Kanwardeep Kaur said that the case has been registered under sections of the UAPA, Explosives and Arms Act at the city police station. The police said that the role of Lakhbir Rode was also found in the killing of Balwinder Singh at Bhikhiwind on October 16, 2020, besides the recovery of the tiffin IED, RDX, arms and ammunition from his relative Gurmukh Singh Rode in Jalandhar in August 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/six-of-terror-module-held-for-pathankot-army-camp-blast-101641813329408.html
10-01-2022||Chandigarh||Akali leader Majithia gets interim protection from arrest in Punjab drugs case||Shiromani Akali Dal leader and former Punjab minister Bikram Singh Majithia, 46, on Monday got interim protection from arrest in the drugs case registered against him by Punjab Police in Mohali on December 20. Also read: Ex-SC judge to head panel to probe security lapse during PM’s visit to Punjab, rules top courtThe order was passed by the Punjab and Haryana high court bench of justice Lisa Gill. The detailed order is awaited. However, lawyers associated with the case said that he has been directed to join the probe and police have been told not to arrest him till the next date of hearing. Majithia was booked by Punjab Police under sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, including Sections 25 (punishment for allowing premises), 27 (A) (whoever is financing any activities pertaining to narcotic drugs) and 29 (party to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence). Majithia’s whereabouts are not known since. On December 24, a Mohali court had dismissed Majithia’s plea. The plea had termed the FIR an “election stunt” and alleged that the government has changed three Punjab Police chiefs in three months to get this FIR registered. The Bureau of Investigation has also seen three departmental heads change, it said. The plea also accused Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu of indulging in “unwarranted propaganda” and deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa of demonstrating “intense hatred” towards Majithia. The plea said the STF report, which is the basis of the FIR, was either superseded or merged with the subsequent report of a state government committee. In all drug cases registered, trials have been concluded with the acquittal of some accused and the conviction of others. None of the accused made any reference of the petitioner, it said. Punjab Police, in its response, had said that the government machinery was used for the benefit of drug cartels during the Akali regime in the state. Majithia was a key minister in the Akali government and it was during the SAD term that the offences of drug trade had taken place, the police submitted, adding that without his custodial interrogation, the case could not be cracked and “backward and forward linkages” can’t be established. The SIT also said incriminating material had come on record against Majithia. A sealed cover report was also given to the court. The SIT denied allegations of political vendetta and stated that the FIR had been registered on the basis of prima facie evidence. The statement of Harpreet Singh Sidhu, the STF head, who had submitted the 2018 report in the high court on the “role” of Majithia, which became the basis of the FIR, has been recorded, along with that of former deputy director, Enforcement Directorate, Niranjan Singh, who had summoned Majithia in 2014 in connection with money-laundering allegations in the drugs trade. The STF report was based on a note prepared by Niranjan Singh, the police told the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/akali-leader-majithia-gets-interim-protection-from-arrest-in-punjab-drugs-case-101641812188980.html
10-01-2022||Pune||Monday Musings: Two years into Covid pandemic, how much have we learnt?||Whether the Omicron is mild as compared to the Delta variant of coronavirus, or, cases in the third wave will cross the tally of the second wave? There are no clear answers yet even as the pandemic will complete two years by this month-end, the period health machinery has taken to be better prepared.At the local level in the Pune district, the magnitude of surge looks bigger than what we saw between February and May last year even as fatalities at this point, and hopefully in the coming days too, are fewer. It took more than 45 days for the virus to infect over 4,000 persons in a day from around 200 cases daily during the second wave. This time, within 20 days, the daily caseload went up from 200 to 4,200.Considering that it may take just two more weeks – by moderate estimates – for Pune tally to peak, the daily caseload may grow drastically. Going by the early analysis reported in HT on January 9 based on the data provided by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), the number of those who require hospitalisation, intensive care unit ( ICU) beds or ventilators is almost proportionate to overall numbers irrespective of the vaccination status.If we anticipate a higher number of cases and expect on a positive note less than five per cent requiring hospitalisation, yet, the hospital beds may fall short when the city’s tally will hit the peak and remained plateau for some time.For this, people need to behave more responsibly.By not adhering to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour or acting irresponsibly by contributing to crowding, people have already forced the government in Maharashtra to impose restrictions. Two years ago, when most of us were unaware of how the virus spreads and the health infrastructure too wasn’t as ramped up as it is today, the government was left with no option but to go ahead with the blanket lockdown.The government in Maharashtra has been considerate in not shutting down businesses as it takes away livelihoods. What the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government needs to learn is to bring in more coordination among various departments. Those who were critical of the government for imposing night restrictions need to understand it was to raise an alarm even though everyone knows such measures do not actually prevent cases from rising. Various governments in the past have started with night curfew before gradually increasing the restrictions.Last year, if some people were hoping that a vaccine will soon restore life as we knew it, it was wishful thinking. The vaccine has been an effective shield against the virus as it reduces the intensity of the attack. What we need now is to effectively handle the situation rather than contribute to the spread of the virus.However, there’s still some hope, determination, and reassurance as the country is better prepared this time will soon complete one year to its national vaccination drive and has now started inoculating the third dose.On the administration’s part, the response to deal with the pandemic has improved after learning from the past experience. It has kept the health machinery on standby. The jumbo hospitals have been reopened and vaccination centres have increased. All we hope now is that with coordinated efforts among people, administration and politicians in power, the journey from here on will be smoother even as the virus stays for now.

10-01-2022||Mumbai||Minor scare as aircraft pushback tractor catches fire at Mumbai airport||NEW DELHI: An aircraft pushback tractor, also called ‘tug’, briefly caught fire at Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) on Monday morning. The incident took place at around 10.45am when the tractor was about to be attached to an A320 aircraft that was being prepared for departure to Jamnagar as flight AI-647. The blaze was quickly extinguished by airport fire services personnel and no damage to the ground staff or to the aircraft was reported. “In a video, the aircraft appears closer [to the fire than where it was]... It was a good 20 feet or more away from the equipment that caught fire. The aircraft was not connected to the tractor,” said an airport official who was present on the spot when the fire broke out.An Air India spokesperson later said, “The fire was brought under control immediately. The cause of the fire is being ascertained.” When asked about whether the fire caused any damage, the airline’s spokesperson said, “No injuries, no damage to anything else was reported. We are checking with the airport ground handler (Air India Airport Services Ltd) for more information.”Aviation safety expert Mohan Ranganathan said, “Even if a tow tractor is connected to an aircraft, it will be ahead of the nose of the aircraft, not right under it. So, as long as the airport fire services respond immediately and reach the spot on time, they should be able to handle the situation well. Moreover, any airline is supposed to have a hand-operated fire extinguisher near the aircraft in case of an emergency. There can be a concern when such a [fire] situation happens while an aircraft is being pushed backwards.”According to flightradar24, the Swedish service that displays real-time commercial aircraft flight-tracking information, the Air India plane was scheduled to take off at 11.50am but eventually departed after a delay due to the incident, at 12.04pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/minor-scare-as-aircraft-pushback-tractor-catches-fire-at-mumbai-airport-101641809788416.html
10-01-2022||Chandigarh||BKU (Ugrahan) rejects Rajewal’s appeal to contest Punjab elections||The Bharti Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan), which has the largest support base of farmers in Punjab and holds sway in the Malwa belt, on Monday announced that it will not support the Balbir Singh Rajewal-led Samyukt Samaj Morcha (SSM) in the Punjab assembly elections. Also read: Breach in PM Modi’s security: Ex-SC judge to head panel to monitor probeRejecting the appeal by Rajewal, BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Ugrahan said at a press conference in Chandigarh that his organisation will not contest the Punjab elections next month nor will it support or oppose the SSM and any other political party.“We used to oppose leaders of the BJP during the days of agitation against the three farm laws. Now, with the repeal of the laws we are not opposing any party, which also includes BJP,” added Ugrahan.The Punjab assembly election will be held on February 14 and the counting of votes will take place on March 10. Ugrahan said that his organisation will, however, take part in a meeting convened by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) on January 15 to discuss the issue of farm bodies taking the poll plunge along with other pending demands of the farmer outfits after the repeal of the three farm laws on November 19. On Sunday, Rajewal had appealed to all farm bodies to stand united for the elections after eight farm organisations unequivocally opposed the entry of farmers into politics. Rajewal also clarified that the SSM will go it alone and not form an alliance with the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for the Punjab elections. His announcement came after a meeting of key constituents of the SSM, formed on December 25 with 19 of the 32 farm organisations that were part of the SKM. The SSM chief said that a committee has been formed to look into aspects of forming an alliance with Haryana farmer leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni’s party, the Samyukt Sangharsh Party, and said, “For alliance with (farmer leader) Chaduni’s party, we have formed a committee that will look into different aspects related to it.” “This election would be different. The people of Punjab are with us. This is an agitation to save Punjab from political corruption,” Rajewal added. ‘ELECTIONS DIVIDE PEOPLE, AGITATIONS UNITE’ Justifying the decision not to contest, Ugrahan said it was the learning they had from leaders like Bhupinder Singh Mann and Ajmer Singh Lakhowal, who joined politics but did not do any good for farmers or any other section. Mann remained a Rajya Sabha member and Lakhowal, chairman of the Mandi Board, a Punjab government body. “The agenda for people is not decided by political parties or its leaders, as they take directions from the corporate houses. I reject Rajewal’s plea that he would correct the system by being part of it,” Ugrahan added. “Elections divide people and agitations unite them, as they help in building people’s movements. If we enter politics then who would lead the protests, where would our supporters go,” said Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan, general secretary, BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan). He added that they will not sit at home during the polls, but will work in the field, asking people to vote wisely and independently.

10-01-2022||Delhi||DDMA rules out lockdown; dine-in services in restaurants likely to be prohibited||NEW DELHI: The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has decided against imposing a sweeping lockdown in the Capital amid rising Covid-19 cases, but said that some additional restrictions could kick in without causing any “disadvantage” to the public. Dine-in facilities at restaurants are likely to be prohibited in the coming days, but takeaways will be allowed, according to sources. The decision not to impose a lockdown was taken at a meeting of the DDMA on Monday.“All present in the DDMA meeting agreed that the trends in terms of rising positivity, hospitalisation and deaths were worrying. To mitigate these trends, further restrictions without creating disadvantage to the people are likely to be imposed. No lockdown will be imposed,” a senior official told HT. Delhi has been seeing a high number of daily Covid-19 cases – 22,751 single-day infections were reported on Sunday with a positivity rate of 23.5% – but with relatively low hospitalisation and faster recovery. More than 10,000 people recovered from the coronavirus disease just on Sunday. Also, only around 1,800 beds in dedicated Covid-19 hospitals were occupied on Sunday even though the Capital had over 60,000 active cases. Authorities in Delhi, including chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, have called on the public to avoid panicking over the current Covid-19 situation. The DDMA reviewed the latest situation on Monday and held extensive discussions with experts, eventually deciding to opt for some additional curbs and not a Capital-wide lockdown. Delhi’s lieutenant governor Anil Baijal chaired the DDMA meeting that was attended by CM Kejriwal, ministers, top officials and experts. On Sunday, Delhi reported 17 Covid-related deaths - the most number of fatalities in a day since June 16 last year. Delhi’s Covid-19 positivity rate on December 28 was less than 1%. The test positivity rate is now the highest since May 9 last year when it had touched a high of 21.67%. During the last Covid wave, about 20,000 single-day cases were reported in Delhi on May 7. At that time, there were 341 Covid-related deaths, while 20,000 hospital beds were occupied. On January 8, Delhi reported 20,000 infections, but there were only seven deaths while 1,500 beds have been occupied by Covid-19 patients. In a briefing on Sunday, Kejriwal said there would be no need for a sweeping lockdown if everyone wears a mask. “We don’t want to impose a lockdown and neither do we have plans to do so. We want that the wave subsides with minimum curbs. We don’t want to hamper anyone’s livelihood,” the Delhi CM said. Authorities have imposed curfews on weekends and nights, and have advised privately-run offices to ensure that at least 50% of their staff are working from home. All Delhi government employees have been asked to work remotely, except those engaged in essential and emergency services, such as fire brigade services, prison, water supply and health. Shops inside malls and at marketplaces are operating on an odd-even basis between 10am and 8pm. Currently, dining services at restaurants and bars are capped at 50% seating capacity on weekdays, and only takeaways are allowed during weekends. On weekdays, one weekly market in a zone is allowed to open, while local authorities have been asked to take steps to ensure crowd management. Only 20 people are allowed to attend weddings and funerals.The DDMA also discussed the seating capacity for Delhi Metro trains and buses. Currently, 100% seating capacity in Metros and buses is allowed. The DDMA discussed whether the seating capacity should be reduced to 50%. It was also discussed that economic and travel restrictions imposed in Delhi should also cover the National Capital Region (NCR) to prevent widespread rise in Covid-19 cases. The graded response action plan spells out four levels of economic restrictions that come into force at different positivity rates. The lowest level of alert is classified as yellow alert, which came into force when the positivity rate breached 0.5% and stayed above it for two consecutive days. The highest level of alert is classified as red alert, which comes into force if 5% positivity rate breached and stayed there for two consecutive days. Experts backed the DDMA’s decision. Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital, said drastic restrictions may not bring any further benefits because the existing restrictions including weekend curfew are already designed to restrict the movement of individuals and appear to have helped slow down the spread of the disease. “The poor need work and food. Health services also get affected due to curfews, which may have an effect on overall health condition of the people,” Dr Kishore said. Traders had earlier appealed to the DDMA to not impose more curbs. The chamber of trade and industry had written to the DDMA, requesting that no additional restrictions or lockdown be imposed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/tackling-covid-19-ddma-rules-out-lockdown-additional-curbs-set-to-kick-in-101641805948831.html

Meanwhile, since the beginning of the vaccination drive in the country in January last year, Madhya Pradesh has so far administered 10.56 crore doses. On Sunday, Madhya Pradesh reported 2,039 new Covid-19 cases, which took the state's infection tally to 8,01,326, while one more fatality raised the death toll to 10,537, as per official data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-starts-giving-precaution-dose-to-eligible-people-bhopal-collector-takes-jab-101641799740552.html
10-01-2022||Lucknow||‘Qissagoi, books or digital mediums, it’s all about storytelling!’||For dastaango Himanshu Bajpai story-telling is a passion for life. He has been using diverse mediums to tell different tales.Never in his wildest dreams did he think that his love for the city and its lifestyle will one day earn him his first Sahitya Akademi Yuva Puraskar in Hindi. He has been selected for his maiden book Qissa Qissa Lucknowwa — Lucknow Ki Awami Qisse. The author says that the announcement came as a surprise for him as he has never applied for it, nor anyone ever discussed something about it with him. “Mere like qissa, baat-se-baat nikhalne ki vidha hai. Mera maksad hai ki qisso ke zariye Lucknow ka ek chehra bane. The book is a compilation of anecdotes which I have heard, some I have researched while some I have conceived,” Bajpai adds. To take his tales to a larger audience Bajpai has used a number of mediums. “As dastaango I know my limitations, I can reach to a limited audience only so that’s more the reason I came up with this book. It worked well and actually reached far-off places. In four years it already has four reprints,” he says. Bajpai’s dastaans have a lot of Urdu usage but he prefers calling the language Lakhnavi zubaan. “People can think whatever they want but Hindi and Urdu ek hi zabaan hai jo do vidha mein likhi jaati hai. I have never differentiated between the two and have grown up hearing them as one language. For me it’s Lakhnavi zubaan or one may say Hindustani zubaan.” Bajpai has done PhD on Munshi Nawal Kishor Press which he says that someday will feature in the form of a book. “But for before that I have some other ideas in mind that I am working on and again it has to do with Lucknow. I am no historian and so all the tales I tell reflect the society, characters and also touches a fraction of our history,” says Bajpai as he dedicates the feat to his mentor and historian late Yogesh Praveen. When the country was in lockdown, he went digital and started the series Kaa se Kittab Talks on his channel which had Ashutosh Rana, Naseerudin Shah, Swara Bhaskar, Pankaj Tripathi, Devdutt Pattanaik as guests. “I am a scholar kitabo ki ahemiyat pata hai hume so that’s’ more the reason why I work on it in a contemporary way so that today’s youth can relate with the content. With the lockdown and no gatherings, I went digital. For the series Ka…. I have a heart-to-heart talk with people from different fields but are avid readers…kitaboon ka apna sansaar hai.” Bajpai continues to have his main focus on his passion of dastaangoi. “It’s tough to make a livelihood by writing. Dastaangoi is my profession, it helps me to earn my bread and butter. During pandemic I wrote a dastaan on the river Ganga, Rani Laxmibai, Durgawati, Ahaliyabaai, Tulsidas and now I am working on 1857 Mutiny and Lucknow’s role in that.” Differentiating between dastaangoi and qissagoi he tells, “Dastaangoi is a definite art form which has its own grammar, boundary and tradition whereas qissagoi can be a way of storytelling.” His dastaan featured in OTT series Sacred Games while in 2020 he was part of Dastaan-e-Khusro organised by Harvard University besides performing at Rastrapati Bhawan (2020).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/qissagoi-books-or-digital-mediums-it-s-all-about-storytelling-101641798568086.html
10-01-2022||Kolkata||Unrestricted gatherings blamed as Bengal registers highest Covid cases so far||KOLKATA: From an average of around 500 daily cases in the last week of December, the Covid-19 infections in West Bengal crossed 24,000 on Sunday, the highest it has reported since the first case of the disease was detected in the state in March 2020.Experts have said the Christmas gathering at Kolkata’s Park Street may have been a super-spreader while warning the worst is yet to come. At a meeting held by the state health department, doctors recently warned West Bengal could face a daily count of 30,000-35,000 cases during the peak of the third wave.“As the new variant spreads 3-5 times faster, the cases would increase manifold in the coming days. This time, we may expect 30,000-35,000 cases every day when the peak hits. Hopefully, the surge would not persist beyond April 22,” a doctor was quoted as warning at the meeting.The state on Sunday registered 24,287 cases. The daily count shot up to 4,157 when the peak of the first wave hit the state in late October 2020. The second wave was worse, as the daily cases touched 20,846 in mid-May when it peaked.Kolkata registered 8,712 cases, the highest among districts in the state, on Sunday. North 24 Parganas, the second most populous district in the country after Thane in Maharashtra, recorded the second-highest cases (over 5000).“While Kolkata is the epicentre, districts adjoining the mega city like North 24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas, and Howrah are also witnessing a huge surge. In all these districts, the daily count of cases has touched four digits. In the rest of the districts, even though there has been a surge, the figures are still within the three digit range,” said a health department official.Kolkata recorded the second-highest positivity rate of 57.9% among all districts in the country for the week starting January 2. Lahaul and Spiti in Himachal Pradesh registered over 61% positivity rate. Kolkata’s weekly positivity rate was 23.4% between December 24 and 31.The weekly (January 2-8) positivity rate of New Delhi was 18.8%. In Mumbai, it was 26.90%, and in Chennai 15.36%.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee said she would request all with folded hands to wear masks and sanitise their hands to check the spread of the virus while directing the police to strictly enforce Covid-19 safety norms.Manas Gumta, the general secretary of the Association of Health Service Doctors, said the surge in Kolkata cannot be attributed to international flights as the city had direct flights from only one “at risk” country – the UK – unlike Delhi and Mumbai. “The present surge was triggered primarily by the huge gatherings at Park Street and in other parts of the city in restaurants and malls on Christmas and New Year without any regard for Covid-19 protocols.”While cities such as Mumbai, Delhi, and Bengaluru were imposing curbs to restrict gatherings on Christmas and New Year, no such curbs were in place in Kolkata. On the contrary, the state government relaxed the night curfew from 11 pm to 5 am between December 24 and January 1.The cases started doubling every day from December 28. While the state registered around 400 cases on December 27, a week later, on January 3, the daily count shot up to over 6,000. On January 9, it crossed the 24,000-mark. On January 2, the government imposed restrictions by closing down schools and colleges while allowing only 50% workforce in offices and putting a 50% cap on trains and metro. Direct flights from the UK were stopped and those from Delhi and Mumbai were allowed to land only three days a week.“But the damage was done by then... While relaxing rules during Christmas and New Year certainly played a major role as we can see cases have shot up particularly in Kolkata and its surrounding districts, the political campaigns and arrival of pilgrims ahead of the Ganga Sagar Mela were also a major factor. People too were to be blamed as they dropped their guard and engaged in revelry,” said Sukumar Mukherjee, a member of an expert committee set up in 2020 to advise Banerjee on pandemic-related matters.The Calcutta high court has allowed the mela to be held from this week with restrictions. Elections to four civic bodies were also being held as per schedule on January 22. Political meetings have been allowed with 250 people.Also Read | Markets shut as Covid count in Bengal reaches an all-time high“While the first surge hit around Durga Puja in 2020 when shopping and festive preparations were in full swing, the second surge followed in May 2021 after the eight-phase assembly elections were held. So, it would not be right to say that the state government had no idea as to what would be the outcome of rules relaxed for Christmas and New Year,” said a doctor at a state-run hospital, who did not want to be named.Top officials, including the health secretary, did not take calls or respond to messages for comments on the surge .Santanu Sen, a ruling Trinamool Congress lawmaker and former president of the Indian Medical Association, said West Bengal, unlike Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled states did not hide the actual figures. “That is why we know what is happening exactly. It is true that Christmas celebrations were a factor but people become relaxed over the past few months. The state government is taking all steps keeping in mind both lives and livelihoods.”At a recent meeting, Banerjee said: “If we shut down train services, people would criticise us, and if we allow trains people board the compartments in large numbers. What are we supposed to do? How long can we suspend livelihoods? This has been going on for three years, affecting development and financial growth.” She has directed police to handle the situation strongly. “Some people are not paying heed to warnings and still not wearing masks. A section of people put on the mask before entering a restaurant as they would not be allowed without it. They remove the mask the moment they come out on the road.”BJP leader Samik Bhattacharya blamed the government for the surge in the cases. “The government has no regard for the lives of people. It only engages in cheap politics and publicity. The civic elections should be postponed as the cases are rising fast,” said Bhattacharya.Banerjee has warned that if cases continue to shoot up, more restrictions could follow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/unrestricted-gatherings-blamed-as-bengal-registers-highest-covid-cases-so-far-101641797068251.html
10-01-2022||Delhi||From 2,716 to 22,751: How Covid-19 cases spiked in Delhi in first 9 days of 2022||Delhi is among the regions in India which have been badly affected by a resurgent coronavirus disease (Covid-19) wave. The national capital has seen its daily Covid-19 tally making records in the wake of the spread of the highly-mutated Omicron variant.The Covid-19 cases have been riding steadily in Delhi since the first day of the year (when it reported 2,716 cases) and reached 5,481 on January 4. The number, however, nearly doubled the next day when the daily tally reached 10,665.In the next five days, the tally more than doubled and reached 22,751 on January 9, with a test positivity rate of 23.53 per cent. The city also reported 17 deaths, most fatalities in a day since June 16 last year.In a slight relief, the hospitalisation rates have been far slower in comparison, indicating that the Omicron-led infection is milder in comparison to the one unleashed by the Delta variant during second wave in April last year.Nearly 88 per cent of all hospital beds in Delhi were vacant as on Sunday, according to state government data.The city, at present, has over 14,000 beds reserved for Covid-19 patients, of which a little less than 2,000 are occupied.This has led chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to say that there is no need to panic.“During the last Covid wave, 20,000 single day cases were reported on May 7, 2021, but there were 341 deaths and 20,000 hospital beds were occupied,” Kejriwal said on Sunday. “Delhi reported 20,000 cases on January 8, but there were only seven deaths and 1,500 beds are occupied.”He also said that the Delhi government doesn’t plan to impose a lockdown if everyone follows Covid-19 appropriate behaviour.Delhi is currently under ‘yellow alert’, as per the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP). Under this, a night curfew has been announced from 10pm to 5am, which restricts all non-essential movements. The Delhi government also implemented a weekend curfew from 10pm on January 7 to 5am on January 10 to check the further spread of Covid-19 after a meeting of Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA).Another DDMA meeting will take place on Monday to discuss the Covid-19 situation with experts and top officials, and to decide if the national capital needs more restrictions to check the spread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/from-2-716-to-22-751-how-covid-19-cases-spiked-in-delhi-in-first-9-days-of-2022-101641783804972.html
10-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi’s AQI remains in ‘satisfactory’ category||Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) remained in the “satisfactory” category on Monday at 100 after heavy rainfall and thunderstorms for two days. A clear sky with moderate fog was expected in the city, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. The minimum temperature was likely to be 9 degrees Celsius and the maximum 17 degrees Celsius.The mercury plunged to 15 degrees Celsius on Sunday; four notches below normal. It was the lowest recorded so far this winter. The minimum temperature was 13.8 degrees Celsius.A rainy weekend pushed the air quality to the “satisfactory” zone for a third straight morning. The city’s 24-hour average AQI was 69 on Sunday.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.Delhi’s pollution levels were expected to start rising from Monday with a likely drop in wind speed on Tuesday and Wednesday. “From Monday onwards, air pollutants will gradually start to get accumulated in the air in the absence of rainfall and relatively moderate ventilation,” said the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-aqi-remains-in-satisfactory-category-101641783026489.html
10-01-2022||Mumbai||Mumbai’s daily Covid tally may be higher, say experts||After recording a massive and consistent spike since the last week of December, Mumbai’s daily caseload has hovered between 19,000 and 20,000 cases over the past four days. The number of tests conducted in the city too, has remained consistently between 67,000 and 72,000. While this may present a picture of a stabilising third wave driven by the Omicron variant, experts warn that the numbers may be far higher that what is being officially reported. The reasons? On the one hand, an increased reliance on home test kits that allows no official supervision on positive cases, and on the other hand, asymptomatic persons who are not undergoing any tests at all.Though the daily caseload has risen by nearly 44% since December 31, the city on Sunday recorded 19,474 cases which is a 4% decline over the previous day’s 20,318 cases. Even the number of tests conducted — 68,249 — was down by 2,770 from Saturday, official figures showed. As a result, the daily test positivity rate (TPR) declined, too. In fact, TPR (a function of the number of positive cases per tests conducted) has steadily declined since last week, from 29.90% on Thursday to 28.90% on Friday, 28.60% on Saturday and 28.53% on Sunday. Experts said that TPR is no longer the most reliable indicator to judge the spread of the pandemic as a large number of people with less severe symptoms are choosing not to get tested and many are opting for home self-testing kits.Hospitalisation rates, however, must be tracked as they indicate the extent of the disease burden of the third wave, experts said. In the last one week alone, the Covid-bed occupancy has gone up to 21% from around 15% a week back.Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force member Dr Shashank Joshi said that Mumbai’s wave seems to have flattened with daily cases between 19,000 to 20,000. “But the true picture is difficult [to judge] due to the wide use of unreported rapid tests,” he said.“We need to focus on the other criteria like doubling rate, hospitalisations, patients needing oxygen, ventilator and intensive care. The variant is circulation is highly transmissible, therefore test positivity is likely to be higher,” said Joshi said.As many as seven self-test kits have been approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research including Coviself by Mylab, CoviFind by Meril Diagnostics, PanBio by Abbott among others. These kits are affordable for the middle class, and range anywhere between ₹250 to ₹350.“We have witnessed a jump of almost 700% sales of our self-test kit in Mumbai in the last one week. Self-test kit is turning out to be highly beneficial given the massive increase in cases because people can get tested quickly and immediately isolate themselves,” said Hasmukh Rawal, managing director and co-founder of Mylab Discovery Solutions, a Pune-based firm that manufactures Coviself. According to reports, nearly 500,000 such kits have been sold in Mumbai in the past week.Chemists in Mumbai have been selling anywhere between 300 to 400 self-testing rapid antigen kits daily. “Every chemist has been reporting a high demand, but it seems to have slowed down since the past two days, as the panic is settling down,” said Hakim Kapasi, a member of the Andheri Chemist Association, an umbrella body of more than 400 chemists in the Mumbai suburb.Even so, over the past four days, self-test kits have reported around 3,000 positive results on average every day in Mumbai based on what has been uploaded to the ICMR portal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-daily-covid-tally-may-be-higher-say-experts-101641776797268.html
10-01-2022||Delhi||Delhiwale: Change, for the good||Yesterday was Sunday. But the Sunday Book Bazar was closed — no thanks, Omicron!Whenever the pandemic situation eases, you have to visit the book bazar. For decades the weekly market for used books unfolded along the pavement of Daryaganj. Its long run abruptly ended in 2019 after the Delhi high court declared the area a no-hawking zone. Much chest beating followed. The bazar was relocated weeks later to nearby Mahila Haat exhibition ground. The new location intensified the feeling of loss. In the old bazar, you covered a mile by walking from one stall to another, with books laid out on the pavement. In Mahila Haat, you have to move in circles in a much smaller area. Not all the familiar booksellers would be seen. The crowd too dwindled (because of the pandemic, plus unawareness about the relocation).The market’s best days were over.And then things reversed.In the gap between the second and third wave of Covid-19, the bazar valiantly overcame the double setback of banishment and pandemic. The crowd gradually returned, along with the best booksellers. In the previous week’s Sunday, this reporter grabbed six Virginia Woolf hardbounds, circa 1940s, for a mere 200 rupees.This story, however, is not for bibliophiles, but for all citizens, including those who find books a bore. You ought to visit the bazar to witness its evolution in real time. Here you shall experience firsthand how a city’s cherished heritage recoils from the change thrust on it, how that unique heritage eventually embraces the change, and, in turn, transforms that very change. The new bazar is a microcosm of this long journey. Lounging in Mahila Haat on a Sunday no longer makes one homesick for the old Sundays of Daryaganj. One might even grudgingly accept that whatever happened was for good. The exhibition ground is a far superior site to browse books. You no longer have to worry about the traffic. The best thing, which was impossible to imagine in Daryaganj, is the lawn tucked on one side of Mahila Haat. Late in the afternoon, many book hoarders are seen lounging cross-legged on the grass, going through their catches of the day. Some lie down lazily, surrounded by their new acquisitions. This little patch of green briefly becomes Delhi’s best book-friendly park.Then there’s one more joy of the bazar before you head home—the crispy Ram laddoos of vendor Som Veer who sets up his stall outside the market gate. They are super-tasty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-change-for-the-good-101641775292605.html

Under the new policy, all government liquor vends have been shut down and the city has been divided into 32 zones, and licences are being allotted on a zonal level. 849 vends are being opened through a tendering process. Each new store, according to the policy, will have at least 500 square feet area with a walk-in facility.According to officials aware of the matter, the East MCD has sealed eight shops and sent notices to 70, the SDMC has sealed six shops and sent notices to 22 and the north civic body has sealed 10 shops and sent notices to 21.EDMC mayor Shyam Sunder Agarwal said the action was initiated after complaints from various sections society that liquor shops were coming up near residential colonies, schools or religious institutions. He added that violations of provisions of the Master Plan 2021 and other bylaws have been found following which the civic body took appropriate action.On Monday, the BJP – which has been ruling the three MCDs for the past 15 years – organized a chakka jam protest against the new excise policy, blocking traffic across the city, and demanded its immediate roll back.The BJP claimed that the government was opening liquor shops illegally near schools and religious places. However, deputy chief minister rubbished the allegations, saying the BJP was protesting against the policy since the party was hand in glove with the liquor mafia. Sisodia said the new policy has plugged the theft of ₹3,500 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/till-dec-31-civic-bodies-sealed-24-liquor-shops-gave-notice-to-more-than-100-101641775003802.html

From him, two stolen scooters were recovered,” said Rangnani.Earlier, three women constables seized 156 quarters of illicit liquor in Keshav Puram even as similar actions were pursued by their colleagues in Model Town and Bharat Nagar.In Ashok Vihar, a woman constable recovered a minor girl allegedly kidnapped and in Bharat Nagar another policewoman pinned down an alleged snatcher.Tejaswini began in north-west district on July 10 last year. Under the initiative, women constables and head constables were tasked with handling “women earmarked” beats such as JJ clusters, certain residential areas, malls and markets, schools and colleges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/womenspecific-beats-paying-off-delhi-police-101641772972341.html

Now, complainants will receive messages about any arrests in their cases, about change in investigation officers (IOs), the filing of charge sheets and closure reports,” said Biswal.In order to avail this facility, the complainants will now be required to mandatorily submit their mobile phone numbers and an email id -- if they have one.Biswal said these updates will be sent to the complainants in nearly real time.“If an accused is arrested in a case, the SMS to the complainant will go out as soon as this development is uploaded on CCTNS (police network). If there are more arrests, there will be separate SMS sent for each arrest,” said the officer.Ever since the upgrade was activated on New Year’s Day, 4,654 messages have been sent to complainants regarding registration of FIRs and 4,807 messages for arrests made in connection to the cases registered by them. Another 1,485 messages have been sent to them for information about submission of the final reports.In all, 11,376 such automatically generated messages have been sent so far, said Biswal.This is not the first attempt to device such a mechanism to bridge the information gap between the police and the complainants. “A few years ago, an app was designed in which the IOs would make the updates about any development in the investigation. But such entries were done manually, and was a cumbersome process that only burdened the officers,” said Biswal.Until the latest upgrade kicked in, the complainants would receive information only about the registration of an FIR in their cases. This led to several problems.“Many times, complainants would go about telling the public that the police were doing nothing in the case when even charge sheets in their cases were already filed. They would meet senior police officers to complain about inaction in their cases when the accused were already arrested. This upgrade will get rid of such problems,” said Biswal.There were also occasions when the police would hold a press conference about an arrest, but the complainant in that case remain oblivious to the development, he said.Biswal said that this upgrade came after the police commissioner Rakesh Asthana asked the crime branch to ensure that complainants are regularly updated of the various stages of the investigation into their cases.Now, complainants will not need to visit the police station just to enquire about the case status. They will not need to regularly call the investigators for information. “If an IO is changed, goes on leave or is transferred, the complainants will also be alerted of such developments and be provided with the contact details of the new investigator,” Biswal added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/tech-upgrade-to-help-citizens-get-regular-updates-on-police-plaints-101641772555398.html
10-01-2022||Chandigarh||Haryana doctors’ strike likely to hit medical services in state on Jan 11||While Haryana logged over 5,000 coronavirus cases on Sunday, medical services in the state are likely to be hit as government doctors are scheduled to hold on Tuesday a statewide strike against their three pending demands. At least 3,000 doctors under the banner of Haryana Civil Medical Services Association will shut out-patient departments (OPDs) services at all government hospitals on January 11 and all medical services, including Covid and emergency duties, on January 14, state president Dr Jasbir Singh Parmar said. They are demanding hiring of specialist doctors, stopping direct recruitment of senior medical officers and revision of the postgraduate policy. Earlier, the doctors were scheduled to observe a similar strike on December 13, but postponed it after a meeting with health minister Anil Vij, who had assured them that all their issues will be resolved. Dr Parmar said since there was no solution till December 31 as assured by the minister, the doctors are bound to go on a strike against the “insensitive” government. “In a recent meeting with state officers last week, we were assured again that our demands will be met and asked to cancel the strike considering the pandemic. Later, our core-committee meeting was held and we decided that as there is no seriousness shown towards our demands. We are not willing to bother the public and if there is any untoward incident, the government will be responsible for it,” he added. On Friday, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had ‘hoped’ that the doctors will not go on a strike. “Health Minister has chaired a meeting with them and I think the solution will be out very soon,” Khattar had told the reporters. Haryana adds 5,166 new infections to its tallyHaryana on Sunday recorded 5,166 fresh Covid infections (including 13 Omicron cases), pushing the total active cases tally to 18,298. According to the health bulletin, 41,109 samples were tested in past 24 hours out of which 5,166 new cases were detected with Gugugram reporting the highest 2,338 new infections. As per the data, Faridabad recorded 878 new cases, Panchkula (418), Ambala (420), Karnal (181), Rohtak (158) and Sonepat (146). At least 13,223 patients across the state are in home isolation. Meanwhile, health minister Anil Vij said that 980 medical officers (Haryana Civil Medical Services Group-A) will be recruited soon. He said an advertisement has also been issued in this regard. Vij said out of these 980 posts, 270 are of general category, 472 of SC category, 80 of BC-A category, 25 of BC-B category, and 133 of EWS category.31 more staffers at PGIMS tests positiveThirty-one staff members of Rohtak’s Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS) have tested positive on Sunday, taking the total number of infections among employees to 107 in just four days.PGIMS spokesperson Dr Varun Arora said 15 staffers were found infected on January 6, 16 on January 7 and 45 on January 8.“Of these 31 new cases, 11 are doctors. We have been collecting samples of the staff as a precautionary measure and many of them are testing positive,” he added. Meeting of jail inmates, their families suspendedThe biweekly meeting between prisoners and their family members have been suspended in Haryana prisons, said jails minister Ranjit Singh Chautala. Interacting with mediapersons in Sirsa, he said the government has decided to suspend ‘physical mulaqat’ of all prisoners lodged in various jails in the state due to rise in Covid cases. “We will resume the physical meetings of inmates after the situation improves. We have also directed the jail officials and other employees to come out of jail, if needed,” the jail minister added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-doctors-strike-likely-to-hit-medical-services-in-state-on-jan-11-101641772525407.html

10-01-2022||Chandigarh||Private vet colleges’ fee hike: Haryana ACS orders inquiry amid differing stances||Nearly three years after a committee set up by the Haryana government recommended hike in tuition fee of private veterinary colleges, three additional chief secretary (ACS)-rank officers of the animal husbandry department have taken as many divergent positions on the new fee structure, according to official documents. Initially in his October-22 order in 2019, the then ACS (animal husbandry and dairying department) Sunil K Gulati had refused to agree with recommendations of the three-member panel that director general, animal husbandry, had set up on March 22, 2019, to review the fee structure. Later, Raja Sekhar Vundru, who is now an ACS-rank officer, dealt with the issue while posted as principal secretary (animal husbandry). Vundru, in a seven-page order on December 16, 2020, upheld the fee structure that the committee had recommended on July 29, 2019. And now, in a latest spin, Ankur Gupta when posted as ACS (animal husbandry) appointed retired IAS officer OP Langayan on December 23, 2021, to conduct preliminary inquiry against three officials of directorate of animal husbandry who had recommended fee hike. ACS Gupta’s order says that the preliminary has been ordered on two complaints of Dr Sandeep Kumar Gupta, a senior scientist of Lala Lajpat Rai University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences (LUVAS), Hisar. “I have received the government’s order to hold inquiry into the fee hike issue in question. Very shortly, I am going to issue the notices,” said Langayan, IAS (retd), when contacted. Contentious committeeThe state government had received a request in February 2019 to review the fee structure. A three-member committee was set up on March 22 to review the fee structure of private unaided colleges offering bachelor of veterinary sciences and animal husbandry degrees. According to a March-22 order of director general (animal husbandry and dairying), the state government had directed to review annual fee structure of private colleges offering bachelor of veterinary science and animal husbandry degree programmes. A committee comprising three officers of the directorate — OP Chhikara, joint director (administration), Pardeep Chauhan, credit planning officer, and Kuldeep Singh, account officer — was set up. The panel was asked to review fee structure of degree programme of International Institute of Veterinary Education and Research (IIVR), Bahu Akbarpur, Rohtak/private institutions in the state. As per the official records, the panel submitted report on July 30, recommending “fee structure of private veterinary college/IIVR is required to be reviewed”. The tuition fee structure committee recommended for 2019-20 batch of students was ₹3.49 lakh (state quota), ₹5.75 lakh (management quota) and US $88,000 (NRI quota). Divergent stands“I have gone through the fee structure of IIVER, Bahu Akbarpur, Rohtak, decided by the state government of Haryana from time to time and the proposed review of the same recommended by the committee, and I do not agree with the recommendations of the committee,” then ACS Sunil K Gulati had stated in his order on October 22, 2019. His order further stated that the state government must not lose its sight over the previous decision of the committee headed by ACS (animal husbandry) which on December 15, 2016, modified the fee structure and mentioned that “fee structure, if considered necessary, will be reviewed after every two years on the basis of price index prevailing at that time.” ACS Gulati pointed out that perhaps the present committee did not go into the depth of the matter inadvertently. After ACS Gulati demitted office, the matter was taken up by Raja Sekhar Vundru, principal secretary (animal husbandry). According to an order on December 16, 2020, by Vundru, a petition was filed in the high court, seeking direction to Haryana government to increase the annual fee for BVSc and AH courses as approved by the competent authority. The high court had disposed of the petition and “set aside the order dated 22.10.2019 regarding fixation of fees” and directed Haryana government to “pass a fresh order after hearing the petitioner”. “After having heard the petitioner ...and after careful considerations of all relevant matters, the petition is accepted. The fee structure as fixed by the department committee dated 29.07.2019... stands upheld...,” ACS Vundru ordered in December 2020. However, a year later, ACS (animal husbandry) Ankur Gupta on December 23, 2021, issued an order, appointing retired IAS officer OP Langayan to conduct the preliminary inquiry. “The governor of Haryana is further pleased to appoint dean, college of veterinary sciences, LUVAS, Hisar, as presenting officer in this inquiry,” the order says, directing Langayan-led panel to submit the inquiry report to the government at the earliest. 
10-01-2022||Chandigarh||Heavy rains bring back waterlogging woes in Haryana||Heavy rains have lashed most parts of Haryana in the past couple of days and led to waterlogging in several urban and rural pockets of the state.As per the reports from the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Haryana received 18mm rain in the past 24 hours. Maximum 49mm rainfall was reported in Gurugram, followed by 30mm in Jhajjar district, 29mm in Yamunanagar, 26mm in Mahendergarh, 22mm in Faridabad, 21mm in Panchkula, 20mm in Ambala, 18mm in Sonepat, 17mm in Kaithal, 16mm each in Kurukshetra and Karnal and 15mm in Jind.Residents of several northern and southern districts faced problems of waterlogging while farmers struggled to protect their crops from the water retention. Rain boon to wheat, bane of mustard, veggies Agricultural experts have termed the winter rains at this stage a boon for the wheat, but advised the farmers to protect their crop from waterlogging. As per experts, rain at this stage will improve photosynthesis, resulting in better growth of both the early and lateral varieties of the wheat. The rain has also resulted in a drop in temperature, which is in favour of the crop. The wheat crop requires temperature below 22°C and favourable cold conditions are helping to gain required growth of the plant of both early and lateral varieties. Also, the farmers need not irrigate the crop for the next couple of weeks, they added.Karam Chand, deputy director, agriculture, Kaithal district, said as of now, there were no reports of damage to the crop or waterlogging. He, however, advised the farmers to avoid irrigation for the next couple of days. Farmers said excess rain is bad for the mustard and vegetables. “The mustard crop is in maturing stage, but the rain has flattened most of the crop and this will affect the yield,” said a farmer, Nirmal Singh, of Indri of Karnal district. Even in an advisory to the farmers, IMD Chandigarh had asked them to withhold irrigation in mustard crop due to possibility of rain till January 10. Also, farmers said that the rain has affected the harvesting of vegetables. “Now, the prices of potato have increased to ₹1,000 per quintal from the last month’s ₹600. But now, we are unable to harvest the crop due to rain,” said Rajiv Kumar, a farmer from Shahbad in Kurukshetra district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/heavy-rains-bring-back-waterlogging-woes-in-haryana-101641770845247.html
10-01-2022||Delhi||Weekend rain gives city wettest Jan in 27 yrs, season’s lowest max temperature||The wettest January in Delhi for 27 years, the lowest daytime temperature so far this season and the cleanest air in over 80 days – a host of weather records tumbled in the national capital on a cold, wet, overcast Sunday.The day saw the city receive 5.4mm of rainfall between 8.30am and 5.30pm, after 41mm rain the previous day, taking the total precipitation in Delhi for the month to 63.6mm -- the most in January since 1995, when the city received 69.8mm of rainfall in the entire month.Delhi also saw the maximum temperature fall to just 15 degrees Celsius on Sunday – four below normal and the lowest so far this winter.A rainy weekend also meant Delhi’s air stayed in the ‘satisfactory’ zone for a second straight day. The city’s 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) improved to 69, according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) daily 4pm bulletin, after Saturday’s reading of 91.Till this weekend, Delhi had never seen a satisfactory air day in January, at least since CPCB started the AQI in 2015, making this spell even rarer.This was also Delhi’s cleanest air day since October 19 last year, when the AQI was also 69.The AQI in the Capital improved from 397 on Wednesday, to 258 on Thursday, 182 (Friday), 91 on Saturday, and then 69 on Sunday.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.Data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) showed that Safdarjung, Delhi’s base station received 8.4mm of rainfall in the 24 hours till 8.30am on Sunday. In the next nine hours, the city added another 5.4mm of rain.RK Jenamani, scientist at IMD, said a western disturbance brought Delhi over 50mm of rainfall in two days, and kept the city’s maximum and minimum temperature barely a degree apart for two consecutive days, an unusual occurrence.While Delhi’s maximum and minimum on Sunday was 15 and 13.8 degrees Celsius respectively, it was 16.4 and 15.2 degrees respectively on Saturday – a difference of 1.2 degrees.“This has been the most intense western disturbance so far this winter and while a majority of the rain usually occurs on one day, this time around, we have seen it spread out consistently over nearly two days. This has kept Delhi’s maximum and minimum almost together and there has been no difference between the night and day temperatures,” Jenamani said.The last time Delhi had a lower maximum was on Wednesday, when similar conditions and rain led to a daytime temperature of just 15.7 degrees Celsius.The IMD says the impact of the western disturbance over Delhi will abate by Sunday night, with moderate fog expected over the duration of next week.While the maximum is expected to be around 17 degrees Celsius on Sunday, the minimum is forecast to drop to 9 degrees.“This western disturbance has brought moisture, which will lead to moderate fog in the next few days. Isolated parts may even record dense fog. The minimum is also expected to start dropping once again and could touch 6 degrees Celsius by January 14,” Jenamani added.City’s air quality may get worse from today: SafarIn terms of air quality, Delhi’s pollution levels are expected to start rising from Monday onwards, with a further drop in wind speed forecast for Tuesday and Wednesday.“The AQI has improved further due to Saturday’s rain causing wet deposition of particulate matter, while Sunday’s rain spells with relatively high winds are likely to continue causing further improvement of air quality. From Monday onwards, air pollutants will gradually start to get accumulated in the air in the absence of rainfall and relatively moderate ventilation,” said the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), a government forecasting body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/weekend-rain-gives-city-wettest-jan-in-27-yrs-season-s-lowest-max-temperature-101641768736470.html
10-01-2022||Noida||Farmers refuse to give up land for phase 2 works of Noida international airport||A majority of the farmers have rejected the district administration’s proposal of acquiring agricultural land for works proposed in phase two of the Noida International airport at Jewar.The district administration set up camps in Ranhera village to seek the consent of farmers to officially begin the land acquisition process for expansion and development of the airport project. While two runways are already being built in phase one of the project, a third runway and other supporting facilities have been proposed in phase two of the project. “A majority of the farmers are against the administration’s plan because we demand higher compensation, which is four times the existing circle rate, and better rehabilitation schemes. We also demand that our houses in villages should not be demolished. If that will not happen, then we will not part with our land. To register our protest, we have refused consent in the form given to us by the administration,” said K P Singh, a farmer from Ranhera. A total of 475 farmers from Nagla Hukam Singh have refused to give their consent while 20 farmers from the same village and 12 from Mundhera (an extension of Ranhera) village gave their consent to give their land for development. The administration started taking the consent of the farmers at the camps from January 7.Land from six villages -- Karauli Bangar, Dayanatpur, Kureb, Ranhera, Mundhera and Nagla Hukum Singh-- falling under the project area will be used for setting up the third runway, and a commercial maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) of aircraft centre for the project.The state government has handed over 1,334 hectares in Jewar to the Yamuna International Airport Private Limited (YIAPL) -- a 100% subsidiary of Zurich Airport International AG, which has been incorporated as a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to develop the Noida international airport -- last year. According to the concession agreement, the government has to provide 1,363 hectares to the subsidiary adjacent to the existing airport site for the third runway and further expansion.“If the administration will not accept our demands, we will not let the government take our land and demolish our villages,” said Dinesh Kumar from Mundhera village.According to the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, the government offers four times of the existing circle rate in rural areas and twice the circle rate in urban areas for land taken for development. “Why should we accept two times of the circle rate as compensation, which is against the rules?,” asked Singh.Additional district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar Balram Singh said, “We will follow laid down rules to handle any situation arising in the land acquisition process.” 
10-01-2022||Noida||1,150 fresh Covid infections emerge in Gautam Budh Nagar||Gautam Budh Nagar reported 1,150 fresh cases of Covid-19 on Sunday, taking the tally of active cases to 4,613.

Lucknow reported 1,115 cases on Sunday, taking the total active cases to 3,653. Noida still has 30% more active cases than Lucknow. As of now, there are five districts with over 1,000 active cases-- Gautam Budh Nagar, Lucknow, Ghaziabad, Meerut and Varanasi.During the second wave of Covid-19, the peak of which was witnessed in April-May last year, 1,822 cases were reported in the district in a day on May 5--the highest single day tally in Gautam Budh Nagar.With the current daily cases almost reaching the same levels as was witnessed during the peak of the second wave, officials have starting taking more preparations to deal with the surge in Covid cases in the district. While Noida Covid hospital in Sector 39 and Kailash hospital in Sector 27 were the only notified centres for Covid treatment, the health department has now allowed Jaypee hospitall to admit Covid patients. Yathartha hospital too will be given permission to operate as a Covid treatment facility by Monday, said officials. “Since there has been a rise in the number of people requiring hospitalisation, we have allowed a few more hospitals to provide Covid treatment. There are at least ten other hospitals which have applied to operate as Covid healthcare facility. The applications are under consideration as we still don’t have that many cases yet,” said Dr Sunil Sharma, chief medical officer. So far, 68,291 people have tested positive in Gautam Budh Nagar on the back of 1,788,122 tests conducted since the start of the pandemic. Meanwhile, as the precautionary dose for healthcare workers (HCWs), frontline workers (FLWs) and those over 60 with comorbidities will start from Monday, 105 sessions have been created across the district for the vaccination drive. These include 30 centres for the precautionary booster dose—24 for all three categories and six centres only for the FLWs. The six centres for FLWs are at the three development authorities as well as Vikas Bhawan, collectorate and police lines, all three in Surajpur.

10-01-2022||Noida||Ghaziabad achieves 100% first dose mark||The district on Saturday completed administering the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine to 100% of its targeted population. Officials said their target now is to increase the second dose coverage and the precaution dose for frontline workers, healthcare workers and senior citizens having co-morbidities, and also vaccinate as many children in the 15-18 years age group. The drive in the district started on January 16 last year and the first dose coverage has been achieved in less than a year. Of the total 2,702,167 beneficiaries identified in the district for the vaccination programme, the administration has administered the first dose to 2,708,975 beneficiaries. The increase in the number of first doses administered than the targeted population is because of the floating population in Ghaziabad. Of the different categories of beneficiaries, the district has completed administering the first dose to all its frontline workers (31,280 doses administered out of the targeted 22,579), healthcare workers (29,095 doses given against the target of 25,824 beneficiaries) and those in the 18-45 years age group (1,891,428 doses out of the targeted 1,813,074). “The overall 100% target for the first dose has been achieved. A large number of beneficiaries in the 45+ age group, which includes a majority of senior citizens, have been left out of the first dose vaccination. We have tried with finding such persons with the help of voters’ list and sent our teams for door-to-door campaign. But they have not turned up so far. We again request senior citizens to come out and take their first vaccine dose,” said Dr GP Mathuria, nodal officer for Covid vaccination. The district has covered 68.74% of the total beneficiaries with the second dose, with 1,862,201 beneficiaries completely vaccinated. “We are now focussing on increasing the second dose coverage. We are also focussing on administering the precautionary dose to frontline workers, healthcare workers and senior citizens with co-morbidities and ramping up the vaccination drive for children,” Dr Mathuria added. Uttar Pradesh has a target of vaccinating 1,401,400 children, of whom 234,488 children are in Ghaziabad. According to the data available on the CoWIN till 6pm on Sunday, the district has completed administering the first dose to 73,473 children so far while the precaution doses will be administered to eligible beneficiaries from Monday. The district has a target of administering the precautionary dose to 68,815 beneficiaries with comorbidities in the 60+ age group. Overall, in Uttar Pradesh, 3,754,400 such beneficiaries will start getting their doses from Monday. “We have opened some online slots for booking precaution doses but beneficiaries falling under this category also have the option of walking into the facility and getting registered on the spot. Those who have received Covishield or Covaxin as their first and second doses will get the same vaccine as precaution dose. The vaccine will not change,” said Dr Mathuria. Meanwhile, the UP government is also considering personnel who will be deployed for poll duties as frontline workers. The model code of conduct came into effect on Saturday after the Election Commission of India announced the schedule for assembly elections in five states, including Uttar Pradesh. “The precaution dose will be administered from January 10 onwards. In the wake of the elections, we are considering every such personnel who will be assigned poll duty as a frontline worker. We will start administering precaution doses to people, who have been assigned election duty, if they complete nine months from the date of their second dose,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s additional chief secretary (health). In Ghaziabad, about 18,897 personnel have been identified who will be deputed for poll duties or poll-related works.

10-01-2022||Chandigarh||Flight services resume at Srinagar airport as weather improves||Normal life resumed to a large extent in Kashmir and flights operated normally at the Srinagar International Airport on Sunday following improvement in wet weather conditions in Jammu and Kashmir after five days of rain and snowfall. However, the Srinagar-Jammu National Highway was still closed for traffic.Officials said that flights landed early at the Srinagar airport as the weather improved by and large across the Valley.“After a full day of snowfall and no operations, first flight lands at our airport on Sunday,” said the Srinagar airport in a tweet.It said that since January 4, as many as 268 flights were cancelled of which 134 cancellations were from Srinagar only. “The passengers of all those flights are being accommodated now. The new bookings will open after clearing the backlog,” airport officials said.In the evening, Srinagar airport officials said 28 flights operated while five were cancelled. The traffic on the Srinagar-Jammu Highway was yet to resume owing to the closure of the 270-km road due to snowfall and landslides at multiple places.“The road is still closed after landslides had blocked it at Shaitan nullah, Ramsu and Cafeteria Turn.

10-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: This January already wettest since 2017||Just nine days in, January this year has already become wettest since 2017, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).After 95mm rain since January 6, the city recorded another 22.1mm on Sunday, taking the month’s total so far to 117.1mm. This is highest since 2017 when 132mm rain was received in the month.According to IMD, the normal amount of rain in the first nine days of January should be just 5.5mm, making the current figure more than 20 times above normal.The all-time highest record for January is 166.6mm, which was recorded in 1983. Speaking about the recent rain spells, IMD Chandigarh director Manmohan Singh said, “Two strong western disturbances (WD) affected the region one after the other, along with a confluence of moisture-laden winds from the Arabian Sea, which led to a lot of rainfall. During winters, mostly WDs are responsible for rainfall and it’s hard to predict their intensity.”With the WDs now gone, relief from rain is likely from Monday onwards. But dense fog and a drop in night temperature is on the cards.“Due to WDs, the minimum temperature had stayed on the higher side and winds had kept haze from forming, but now dense fog can be expected,” Singh said.Visibility can drop below 200 metres, especially in the early morning hours, for the next three to four days.Day temperature drops by 8 notchesMeanwhile, the latest rain spell brought city’s maximum temperature down from 21°C on Saturday to 13.2°C, almost eight notches below normal. The minimum temperature also reduced from 13°C to 11.1°C, but was six degrees above normal. With the rain likely to stop from Monday, the day temperature is expected to go up, but the night temperature may drop further. Singh said cold wave conditions could also be expected in the coming days. A cold wave is declared in the plains when the minimum temperature goes below 4°C, or is 10°C or below and also 4.5 notches lesser than the season’s normal for two consecutive days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhthis-january-already-wettest-since-2017-101641760892143.html
10-01-2022||Chandigarh||Shorter route to airport: GMADA speeds up land acquisition in Mohali||Having expedited the work on the shorter route to the Chandigarh International Airport, via Phase 11, the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) is likely to complete the land acquisition by March.The around 3-km stretch will allow commuters from Chandigarh and Mohali to head to the airport via the road in front of Bawa White House, instead of taking the longer route via Airport Road.This will bring down the 18km distance from Tribune Chowk, Chandigarh, to the airport in Mohali by nearly 3.5km.At present, commuters have to head all the way to the T-junction near Indian School of Business, after passing by Bawa White House, to turn left towards Airport Chowk, where they again have to turn left towards the airport.“The 164-foot-wide road is part of the Mohali Master Plan. We will soon be issuing a notice under Section 11 of the Land Acquisition Act, inviting objections from landowners. Thereafter, we expect to complete the acquisition process by March. The acquisition rates will further determine the total cost of the project,” said a senior GMADA official, dealing with the project.The authority will be acquiring 18 acres in villages Kambala, Kambali and Rurka for the project, which is expected to take a month to complete after the tender is allotted.Kharar-New Chandigarh road hits hurdleOwing to payment issues, the deadline for the 8km Kharar-New Chandigarh road has been pushed from January 31 to April 15.Work on the 200-foot-wide road, starting in New Sunny Enclave and ending in Mullanpur, began in October 2020. Once set up, it will reduce the distance between Kharar and Mullanpur to 20km. Currently, commuters have to travel via Chandigarh or Kurali to reach the township.GMADA chief engineer Davinder Singh said, “There are some minor payment issues, which will be sorted soon and the road should be ready by April 15 this year.”

10-01-2022||Chandigarh||U-19 World Cup: India’s Harnoor Pannu keen to emulate idol Shubman Gill’s performance||Watching the highlights of the 2018 U-19 World Cup at a hotel room in Georgetown, Guyana, Harnoor Singh Pannu hopes to emulate the performance of his idol Shubman Gill, who led India to victory. The opener is currently in the West Indies awaiting the completion of the mandatory quarantine period, ahead of U-19 World Cup starting on January 14. “Gill paaji was outstanding in 2018. I have been his fan since then. I have been watching him play for Punjab and love his technique and approach,” says 18-year-old Pannu, who hails from Chandigarh. The India team, which is chasing its fifth title going into the 14-team event, is led by Yash Dhull. The final is on February 5. While an Indian win would only be affirmation of the junior talent available in the country, the team under coach Hrishikesh Kanitkar are wary of late slip-ups after losing the 2016 final to West Indies and the 2020 title clash to Bangladesh. Pannu enters the tournament following brilliant performances in the recent U-19 Asia Cup victory in the UAE, where he emerged player of the series. Though he scored only five runs in the final against Sri Lanka, Pannu aggregated 251 runs in the tournament, which included a century (120) against the UAE in the opening game. “Playing in my first international tournament helped me gain confidence. The pitches were good and my mental preparation also helped. I like going after the bowlers and playing attacking shots. I have been told to carry on playing my natural game by the team management. The Asia Cup will definitely help me prepare for the World Cup,” said Pannu, who has consistently been an opening batsman. The preparatory camp organised at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru ahead of the Asia Cup was a fan moment for him, where he met Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman. The junior players also got to interact with Rohit Sharma. “Rahul sir and Laxman sir were very encouraging and wished us luck. Meeting them in person was a different experience altogether. Then, Rohit sir had a brief chat with the team. The pep talk was fantastic,” says Pannu, who is also being monitored by Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises ahead of the player auctions. Cricket runs in Pannu’s family. His grandfather Rajinder Singh played Ranji Trophy for Punjab and father Birinder Singh was a Punjab U-19 player. Pannu spent his initial years in Jalandhar, where his father, a presenter with All India Radio, trained him. “My father installed practice nets at an empty plot near our house. My brother Jasnoor and I would bat for hours,” says Pannu, who moved to Chandigarh as a teenager to train under his uncle, former cricketer Harminder Singh Pannu. In 1989, his uncle Bhupinder Singh Junior was Player-of-the-Tournament in the inaugural U-19 Asia Cup in Dhaka. “Cricket is in our blood. We grew up hearing stories of Kapil Dev and Sachin Tendulkar and were told about the importance of playing in the Ranji Trophy. It was disappointing not to have any U-19 tournament last season due to Covid. There was a lot of uncertainty. I was relieved to get to play U-19 cricket this season,” says Pannu. Jasnoor has been a member of the Punjab U-19 team. “I feel fortunate to have so many cricketers in the family. I want to take the legacy forward.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/u19-world-cup-india-s-harnoor-pannu-keen-to-emulate-idol-shubman-gill-s-performance-101641760044410.html

Several rabi crops like wheat, potato and mustard have been damaged. The maximum losses have been reported from the Naneola-Naggal belt along Hisar Road in Ambala-1 block, officials said. Gurjant Singh alias Goldy, the outgoing sarpanch of Batrohan village, said that it might take around a week to drain the stagnant rainwater and urgent help is needed from the administration.“My wheat crop spread across 30 acres, and around 200-300 acres in the village, remain submerged in water. Unlike paddy that needs excess water; even a day of waterlogging will damage the wheat crop,” Singh said. Tejveer Singh, a farmer from Panjokhra village, said that there has been damage to wheat crop in villages like Kaira, Chourmastpur, Patron and Batrohan and to potato crops in Mohra, Mohri, Kesri Shahpur, Durana and Mardo Sahib.“Mustard crops were also damaged in almost every village where it is grown, as it needs very less water at this point of time,” Tejveer said. Meanwhile, to ascertain the damage, the agriculture department has issued a toll-free number 1800 180 2117 for farmers with crop insurance.Deputy director of agriculture, Girish Nagpal, said, “After this, a survey will be conducted and the process will be carried out accordingly by the insurance company executives.

10-01-2022||Chandigarh||PU senate approves reservation roster for recruitment of assistant profs in constituent colleges||The Panjab University (PU) senate on Saturday approved the reservation roster for the recruitment of assistant professors at the varsity’s constituent colleges.  PU has six constituent colleges in Sikhwala (Sri Muktsar Sahib), Balachaur (SBS Nagar), Nihalsingh Wala (Moga), Dharamkot (Moga), Mokham Khan Wala (Ferozepur) and Guru Harsahai (Ferozepur). There are 83 sanctioned posts in these constituent colleges and the reservation roster has been prepared as per the guidelines and related instructions regarding the reservation policy followed by the Punjab government for the recruitment. According to recommendations of the committee, which were approved by PU senate, all these posts of assistant professor should be advertised in one go for the proper implementation of the roster. Also, it had recommended that these posts be advertised as “centrally managed posts” as posts of assistant professors in PU constituent colleges and not for individual constituent college. The posts of assistant professors will be inter-transferrable within the constituent colleges and assistant professorsfrom the constituent colleges will not be transferred to PU main campus or any of the regional centres. During the senate meeting, senator Rajat Sandhir suggested that each constituent college should be treated as a single unit for reservation rather than clubbing of all colleges for preparation of the roster. The syndicate had in 2020 approved the recommendations of a varsity panel that was constituted to prepare the roster in consonance with the directions of the University Grants Commission (UGC). The draft roster prepared by the varsity was approved by the panel in its meeting on January 29 in 2020.Meanwhile, the university senate deferred the resolution proposed by the former senator Dr Dalip Kumar to amend the regulation 3 (pages 46-48) of PU calendar volume I, 2007. The offices at Panjab University (PU) will function with 50% staff strength from Monday due to spike in Covid-19 cases. The varsity issued an order on Sunday stating the remaining 50% staff will work from home under the instructions of their controlling officers. However, officers of the level of office superintendent and above will attend the office daily.
10-01-2022||Chandigarh||Mohali’s Pancham Society: After 15 years, 448 flat allottees gets ownership rights||In a major relief to around 448 flat allottees of Pancham Cooperative Society in Sector 68, the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) has after 15 years issued a notification giving them ownership rights, with the builder finally clearing pending land dues to the tune of ₹15 crore.As per the notification, GMADA will only recover the principal amount of ₹4.46 crore proportionately from each member, which means each allottee has to pay around ₹45,000 to 1.20 lakh depending on the floor of the flat, as penal interest accumulated over the years has been completely waived off .GMADA will now directly deal with the individual members and give them no dues certificates after they pay the outstanding amount. The Resident Welfare Association of the Pancham Society will be the interface between the members and GMADA.Earlier, the owners were unable to sell the flats, as they did not have ownership rights. GMADA had allotted the land to the society in 2000 and possession of flats was given in January 2006.At the time of possession of flats, the members were asked to pay an additional amount of ₹1.15 lakh for HIG flats and ₹72,000 for HIG super. The allottees paid the amount to the builder, who was to further pay it to GMADA, but the latter failed to do so. As a result, the ownership rights were held up. As per records, Pancham Society was to pay ₹4.49 crore as land dues to GMADA in 2005. With addition of interest, the figure rose to ₹7.79 crore in October 2006 and is now estimated to be around ₹15 crore.In 2012, GMADA had issued a public notice regarding resuming land of Pancham Society, and in the same year, 225 members filed a writ petition in the Punjab and Haryana high court against GMADA, registrar of the society and secretary housing. In 2019, the court ordered the registrar that recoveries be made from all those found guilty in various inquiries.Vineet Malik, area councillor, said the credit of ownership right goes to MLA Balbir Singh Sidhu. “It is a welcome step as we have been fighting for ownership for more than a decade.

10-01-2022||Chandigarh||Ludhiana| Cong splurges on hoardings ahead of polls, Oppn dubs it ‘ ₹19-cr scam’||Ahead of the Punjab assembly elections, the ruling Congress had installed hoardings advertising government schemes, and featuring chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi across the city – a move which drew the opposition’s ire. Slamming the Congress for misusing public funds, the opposition has termed the move as a “ ₹19-crore scam, where the outdoor media advertisement contractor was given an undue monetary benefit.” Former councillor and Bhartiya Janata Party local bodies cell in-charge Inder Aggarwal said, “In the budget, the MC had reduced the income from advertising from ₹23 crore to ₹15 crores, citing the losses suffered by the advertisement contractor due to the pandemic. Later, under the revised budget, the advertisement budget was reduced to a mere ₹4 crore.” “While the government is hounding the public for taxes, the contractor is getting favours , strangely at a time when the fund-starved MC is trying to take a ₹100 crore loan to carry out developmental works across the city,” he said. The advertisements had been displayed on over 170 unipoles, and other media at all main roads and major intersections across the city, including Mall Road, Ferozepur Road, Bharat Nagar Chowk, Chandigarh Road, Haibowal, Jagraon Bridge, Gill Road, BRS Nagar, and Rajguru Nagar among other places. These hoardings promote the recent decisions taken by the ruling party, including waiving off pending power arrears for consumers with connections up to 2KW, reducing water tariff for residential buildings, and reducing the power tariff among other welfare schemes. The advertisements also portray the CM as an “Aam Aadmi” as he is seen with beneficiaries on the hoardings, which also have promotional slogans such as Ghar Ghar Vich Challi Gal, CM Channi/Punjab Sarkar Kare Masle Hal (All households are discussing how CM Channi and the Punjab government resolve issues). MC officials blame government Meanwhile, the MC officials said that the state government had directly roped in the contractor for advertisement through the state public relations department and the MC was in no way involved. The MC has to recover the advertisement charges from the contractor as per the outdoor media advertising contract, and the budget had also been reduced by the state. Mayor Balkar Sandhu said ,”The annual income under advertisement contract was ₹23 crore. But the MC had approved ₹15 crores as income under the advertisement head, while approving the annual budget, as ₹8 crore relief had been provided by state government, citing the pandemic, and the contractor had surrendered 50% of the media. But when the budget was sent for approval from the state government, the government further reduced it to ₹4 crore only, perhaps due to some error. The MC has now sent a revised budget to the state government for approval wherein the income has again been increased to ₹15 crore.” Govt hoardings removed after MCC comes into place Soon after imposition of the model code of conduct, the administration and municipal corporation initiated the laborious process of removing political hoardings from the city, including those advertising government schemes and other illegal political hoardings.However, the private hoardings of leaders such as cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, MLA Sanjay Talwar, SAD Ludhiana west candidate Maheshinder Singh Grewal among others were still seen installed in different areas. MC officials said the private hoardings are categorised as paid advertisement and information regarding the same will be shared with the election commission.MC additional commissioner, Aaditya Dachalwal said, “Government hoardings have been removed as the model code of conduct has been imposed. The department has sought details of paid advertisement from the contractor, and the same will be shared with the election commission. The paid advertisement media in the city have to be shared equally between the parties as per the norms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhianacong-splurges-on-hoardings-ahead-of-polls-oppn-dubs-it-19-cr-scam-101641758305212.html
10-01-2022||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | Vet Varsity issues advisory to protect dogs from dip in mercury||Swaran Singh Randhawa, director, Veterinary Clinics of Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University shared some preventive strategies to save dogs from ill effects of extreme cold. He advised not to leave dog outside in winter for long durations and avoid walking along with dogs in the early mornings or late evenings. When the environment temperature is below the lower critical limit, dogs cannot maintain their body temperature and suffer from hypothermia. Ventilation should be good enough to minimise odours, ammonia level and cold drafts, humidity between 30 to 70 per cent. Animal age, breed, hair coat and overall health status all determine the sensitivity of dogs to cold weather. Make sure that dog has been placed in a warm spot in house with well carpeted floors. Do not keep pets too close to heat sources to avoid burns and put all heaters and lamps out of their reach. Avoid alcohol and chocolates because they are toxic for dogs, even in small amounts. Groom dog regularly during the winter, to keep them properly insulated. Groom at least two times a day and avoid bathing before a fortnight. Dogs with thin to absent hair coats have less ability to retain heat and cannot tolerate low temperatures well. Randhawa said dogs can dehydrate just as quickly in the winter as summer, so provide plenty of fresh lukewarm water. Application of petroleum jelly can avoid cuts and cracks in dogs’ paws. Give raisins to dogs during winters can cause renal failure. Antifreeze being sweet in taste, dogs readily licks or drinks it but even a small amount of this antifreeze can be fatal for dogs. Like people, dogs seem to be more susceptible to illness in the winter. Puppies and geriatric dogs need more attention. Maintain an exercise regimen for dogs, especially those suffering from arthritis. Keep them warm and take them to a veterinarian if any suspicious symptoms are seen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-vet-varsity-issues-advisory-to-protect-dogs-from-dip-in-mercury-101641757945395.html

He also added that the SSM will release its first list of candidates this week.Rajewal’s announcement came after meeting key constituents of the SSM, a political arm of farmers, which was formed on December 25 after 19 of 32 farm organisations that were part of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) came together. The SKM, after a protested that stretched for a year, forced the Centre to repeal the three farm laws on November 19. Rajewal, considered to be inclined towards an alliance with the AAP, was reported to have been offered a key role if he joined hands with the party, said, “The AAP has fielded corrupt candidates, and they are selling party tickets.” The constituents of SSM have issued an appeal to all farm organisations to join the platform. “We appeal to all farm bodies to stand united for the polls, as they were during the agitation against the three farm laws,” said Prem Singh Bhangu, an SSM leader. Apart from Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU), Ugrahan, the farm body that has the largest support base in the state, there are five farm bodies which are indecisive; eight farm bodies have unequivocally opposed the entry of farmers into politics.  Answering a query in the press conference, Rajewal said he had also issued an appeal to long-time associate Joginder Singh Ugrahan, who leads BKU (Ugrahan), to support the SSM. “I am sure he will accept my appeal,” he added.The SSM decided to clarify its stance after BKU (Charuni) that Gurnam Singh Charuni heads announced that it would name its candidates on Sunday, but has now agreed to wait.

10-01-2022||Chandigarh||To check smuggling, 3 Punjab central jails to have full body scanners by July||JALANDHAR: To curb smuggling of drugs and mobile phones into state jails, the Punjab prisons department will install full body scanners in central jails by July this year. After getting the government nod, the department has sent a requisition to the Punjab Police Housing Corporation (PPHC) for the procurement of body scanners. There are 25 jails, including nine central prisons, in the state, having 18,470 prisoners against the total capacity of 23,776, according to the statistics released by the National Crime Records Bureau in 2020. Additional director general of police (jails) Praveen Kumar Sinha confirmed the development and said: “We have plans to install body scanners in three central jails in the first phase with a budget of around ₹ 6 crore sanctioned by the state government. “These will be low-intensity X-ray machines to be installed at the entrance points to enhance the detection of banned materials into the jails.”He said Punjab would be the fourth stage to implement this project after Delhi, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh. “Physical frisking has limitations as we have to respect the religious sentiments and privacy of people. We need to use technology to counter such challenges. The names of three jails where body scanners are to be installed in the first phase will be announced soon. The process to get a clearance from the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in Mumbai also underway,” he added. According to the National Crime Records Bureau data of prisons for the year 2020, there are 5,289 undertrials and 1,046 convicts related to the NDPS Act, the highest in the country, in Punjab jails. The Punjab jail department had recovered 1,086 mobile phones from various jails of the state in 2019 and 1,500 in 2017, the data reveals.A senior official familiar with the matter said despite strict checking in the jails, inmates still managed to smuggle mobiles, SIM cards and drugs into prisons even as the connivance of jail officials can’t be ruled out. Hardcore criminals, especially gangsters, use phones for making extortion calls or run drug smuggling rackets from the jail, the official said.

Besides mobile phones, the jail authorities have been recovering other banned items, including cigarettes and tobacco, from inmates. Officials cite foggy weather as one of the reasons behind the illegal activity. “Taking advantage of low visibility, miscreants throw mobile phones and other banned items inside the jail,” said a senior jail official, who didn’t wish to be named. The high-security prison remained in the news due several jailbreak incidents and running of drug and weapons smuggling rackets by some inmates in the past a few years. In July last year, the state government had appointed Border Security Force (BSF) officials as superintendents of five high-security jails of Punjab, including Amritsar jail. The Amritsar jail is among a few other jails of the state being guarded by the battalions of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF).“The rear outer wall of the jail is attached with a farm land. There is no way along the wall for patrolling or deployment of security guards. Miscreants have been using this wall for throwing of mobile phones inside the jail,” said another official. Overcrowding of inmates and lack of staff are other reasons behind the poor implementation of the security in the jail. “We have around 3,300 inmates against the capacity of 2,200. The prison is working with around 70% of the sanctioned staff strength. Overcrowding and inadequate staff is another hurdle in protecting the jail,” one of the officials said. Around two weeks ago, the prison had shifted around 100 inmates to the newly constructed Goindwal Central Jail in Tarn Taran. The officials of Amritsar jail said more inmates should be shifted in the new jail to decongest the high-security prison. They said the surging cases of Covid-19 can also impact the inmates’ health in the coming days. Jail superintendent Surinder Singh said he took the charge on January 1. “We have launched a special drive to clean the prison. The inmates who are being caught with mobile phones are being handed over to the local police for their further interrogation,” he said.He said there is no possibility of bringing any banned item inside the jail from the main entrance. On Saturday, as many as 16 inmates were booked after 17 mobile phones, five chargers and a headphone were recovered on the jail premises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/recovery-of-70-cellphones-in-10-days-exposes-security-chinks-in-amritsar-jail-101641756863972.html
10-01-2022||Chandigarh||SGPC opposes naming Sahibzadas’ Shaheedi Diwas as ‘Veer Bal Diwas’||AMRITSAR: The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), the apex gurdwara body, on Sunday raised an objection over the term ‘Baal Veer Diwas’ given to 10th Sikh Master Guru Gobind Singh’s Chhote Sahibzade (younger sons) by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Reacting to the move, SGPC president Harjinder Singh Dhami said: “Their martyrdom day cannot be called ‘Baal Veer Diwas’ as it is not according to the Gurmat (Sikh principles). Sahibzades have a tall stature in the Sikh religion. This term is not appropriate for martyrs. The PM may have taken this decision in haste, without consulting the Sikhs.” “We give respect to the sentiments of the Prime Minister but limiting the martyrdom of Chhote Sahibzade to ‘Baal Veer Diwas’ by adding the term ‘Baal’ does not match with the feeling of the martyrdom and Sikh traditions,” he said while speaking over phone.“Sacrifice of the Sahibzade of the 10th Guru is as big as that of the big warriors keeping in view of the Sikh history, principles and traditions. In the Sikh history, Sahibzade are called ‘Babas’ to give them due respect,” he said. “As Sikh traditions, beliefs and concerns are unique in nature, any decision in relation to them should be taken under the guidance of the Akal Takht. The decision may have come from the intention of giving respect to Guru sahib, but it cannot be considered as one recognised by the Panth”, he said, adding, “We will write to the PM in this regard”.Meanwhile, radical Sikh body Dal Khalsa said the state has no right to meddle in religious affairs of Sikhs. “Arbitrary decision by the PMO is going to set a wrong precedent,” reads a statement issued by radical Sikh body Dal Khalsa.Sikh history should be depicted in perspective: Jathedar Endorsing the SGPC stand, Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh said: “The move deserves to be hailed but name is wrong, as it does not represent the Sikh sentiments.” Addressing devotees during the celebrations of Guru Gobind Singh’s birth anniversary at Takht Patna Sahib on Sunday evening, he said: “We want the entire world to be taught the great history of Sahibzadas’ supreme sacrifice, but it should be as per Sikh sentiments.”“The Sikh organisations are there to co-operate with the government in taking the decisions concerning the Sikhs. So, the government should have consulted with them first. The Sikh history should be depicted in Sikh perspective,” he added.Damdami Taksal hails move However, some Sikh organisations have hailed the PM’s move. “The PM’s announcement is commendable and is a big effort to make the world aware of the unparalleled martyrdom of the 10th Guru and his sons,” Baba Harnam Singh Khalsa, chief of Damdami Taksal, a Sikh seminary. Akal Purakh Ki Fauj chief and former SGPC member Advocate Jaswinder Singh said: “Irrespective of the nomenclature, it is an opportunity for the Sikhs. Now, it is up to the Sikhs how they grab this opportunity.”

10-01-2022||Chandigarh||Sidhu launches digital campaign for assembly polls||Chandigarh: Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu on Sunday launched his party’s digital campaign for the assembly polls, a day after the Election Commission declared the schedule for it and banned public rallies till January 15 amid a surge in coronavirus cases. Sidhu said his party has already been emphasising on the importance of digitisation and maintaining a virtual interaction with the electorate, and asserted that the Punjab Congress has the highest digital footprint amongst the political parties. “Till January 15, directions are very clear that you will have to campaign digitally, through WhatsApp whatever it is,” Sidhu said, adding that he had addressed 40 to 50 rallies before the poll code came into the being. “We hope that things will change after January 15 and in case, if things go worse, then what cannot be cured has to be endured. We will have to pass through this litmus test. Life has to be given importance,” he said. “In Bengal, we saw big rallies, we were repenting and we were repairing rather than preventing and preparing. I think the Congress Party has taken the first initiative of preparing and with that preparedness we will be preventing,” he said. Asked when his party will announced candidates, Sidhu said this will be done very soon. “We are at it. Even today, the screening committee meeting is going on. We will take our decisions after careful thinking,” he said. On his “Punjab model”, Sidhu said it is not a personal or self-serving model. “It is the model of the people of Punjab. It is a tailor-made solution for the issues prevalent in Punjab which are created after intensive research conducted on the state and its functioning. This model brings the power back in the hands of people of Punjab for their own prosperity and growth,” he said in a statement. “The real stakeholders of the Punjab model are its people and the PPCC is soon going to pave the way for the people of Punjab through a WhatsApp service to provide their inputs for the Punjab model and seek clarifications,” he said. He said the “Punjab model” will not only bring the constitutional powers back to panchayats and urban local bodies, it will also aim at creating a “digital Punjab” where over 150 government services, permits and approvals will be made available to people on their doorstep. He said building a capable and accountable state is the key to reducing poverty. “Political leaders are the prime drivers, setting the objectives for the governance system. Today, Punjab needs a governance reform, which translates public issues into policies with a poverty reduction strategy,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhu-launches-digital-campaign-for-assembly-polls-101641756203936.html

Police said that the gang of at least 12 members, which mainly operated from Delhi and Rajasthan, sold around 100 infants over the past seven years. The suspects, who were arrested on Sunday, were identified as Veena and Pooja, police said, adding that the gang sold babies aged anywhere between 10 days and two months. According to police, the gang used to target pregnant women from the economically weaker section and convince them to sell their children. After buying newborns for an amount ranging between ₹50,000 and ₹1 lakh, the gang members would sell them to issueless couples in different states for a hefty price up to ₹7 lakh, police said. The Gurugram police have, so far, rescued two infants and arrested five members of the gang. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said the gang has admitted that they have sold over 100 children in the past seven years in Delhi, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh. “We are trying to trace the parents of the stolen infants and also checking cases of missing or stolen infants in these years. The gang members have revealed that a few biological parents who were unable to raise their children due to financial crisis sold babies to them,” he said. The gang members would identify those couples who were in need of children and those who were ready to sell them, Sangwan said, adding that in some cases they also stole newborn babies from hospitals and later sold them. “The gang has also sold infants with the consent of the parents, but it is illegal. We will book the biological parents as well as the parents who bought the kids. Raids are being conducted in Delhi and Rajasthan’s Alwar to arrest other members of the gang,” Sangwan said. During questioning, the gang members have revealed that in some cases, they promised issueless couples to get babies at a cheaper cost through surrogacy and collect sperm and later contact them with fake certificate after a year with a baby, police said, adding that they also used to get fake medical records of a surrogate mother. Sangwan said they are investigating if any medical staff or a doctor was also involved in the case. As the surrogacy procedure costs somewhere between ₹15-20 lakh, many childless couples were lured by the gang’s offer, he said. The incident had come to the fore on Friday night after a taxi driver drove three persons, including two women, travelling in his vehicle with two stolen female infants to DLF Phase 3 police station, and helped police bust the interstate child trafficking gang. The stolen infants were handed over to the Child Welfare Committee and efforts are on to trace their parents, police said.

She said the video was shot by a bystander at the airport.State Department’s Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs (SCA), in a tweet on Saturday, said: “We are deeply disturbed by reports of an apparent attack on a Sikh cab driver at J.F.K. airport, captured on video last week. Our diversity makes the U.S. stronger, & we condemn any form of hate-based violence.“We all have a responsibility to hold perpetrators of hate crimes accountable for their actions, no matter where such crimes occur”.The state department’s reaction came after the Indian Consulate General in New York termed the assault on the Sikh taxi driver as “deeply disturbing” and said it has taken up the matter with US authorities and urged them to investigate the violent incident.“The assault against a Sikh taxi driver in New York is deeply disturbing. We have taken up the matter with US authorities and urged them to investigate this violent incident,” Consulate General of India in New York tweeted on Saturday.In the video posted by Twitter user Kaur, the person can be heard allegedly using expletives against the Sikh individual.

More than 50% of these cases were reported from the residential societies falling under the primary health centres of Chanderlok, Tigra and Wazirabad, health officials said, adding that the test positivity rate in the district also jumped from 4% on January 1 to 20% on Sunday. Before Sunday, the active case tally was over 8,000 on May 21 last year when Gurugram had 10,287 such cases.

10-01-2022||Lucknow||Mayawati tells partymen to celebrate her birthday by helping Covid-hit people||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati has called upon her party workers to celebrate her 66th birthday on Saturday (January 15) at home in view of the implementation of the model code of conduct (MCC) after the Election Commission of India (ECI) announced the schedule for assembly elections in five states, including Uttar Pradesh, on Saturday and surge in the Covid-19 cases across the state. The BSP celebrates Mayawati’s birthday as “Jankalyankari Diwas”. Usually, the birthday bash of the party chief used to be a big occasion for party workers. “The usual pomp and show of the birthday celebrations will be missing this time as the party has decided to keep it a low-key affair due to the enforcement of the MCC and sudden rise in Covid cases,” said a BSP leader familiar with the development.In a meeting of party leaders and office bearers on Sunday, Mayawati told them to follow the Covid protocol and poll code guidelines during the electioneering for the assembly polls. The party leaders, office bearers, workers and supporters will celebrate her birthday with their family members in their homes, she said. “The party workers should assist the poor and impoverished people who have to suffer due to the Covid pandemic,” Mayawati said.The BSP chief is likely to release the 17th edition of her book “A Travelogue of My Struggle Ridden Life and BSP Movement” at the party’s state unit office on the occasion. “The travelogue will generate self-respect among the party supporters and guide them to take the movement launched by the BSP forward,” she said. In the meeting, Mayawati also reviewed the preparations on the 58 assembly constituencies located in eleven districts of west UP in which polling will be held in the first phase on February 10. The party has finalised the candidates on the majority of seats and the candidates have been made in-charge of the respective assembly segments. The name of the candidates will be released with the notification of the first phase polling by the ECI on January 14.In the 2017 assembly polls, out of these 58 west UP assembly seats the BJP had bagged 53 seats, BSP two while the Samajwadi Party and the Rashtriya Lok Dal had won one each. The BSP was the runner-up on 30 assembly seats while the SP was on second position on 15 seats. The Congress was runner-up on five seats and the RLD on three seats.Mayawati told party leaders that west UP was a forte of the BSP and that the party will regain its lost ground in the upcoming assembly election by bagging maximum seats. “The organisation has been overhauled up to booth level. The party candidates will use digital medium, social media as well as organise door-to-door campaigning to reach out to the voters and inform them about the policies of the BSP,” she said.
10-01-2022||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh assembly polls: Most parties yet to start declaring candidates||The Samajwadi Party (SP), usually the first to name its candidates in previous polls, has changed its strategy and is keeping its cards close to its chest this time just as most of the state’s other main political parties, barring the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), are also yet to declare their nominees for the seven-phase Uttar Pradesh assembly polls that will begin on February 10.The two national parties, the BJP and the Congress, have always declared nominees after the poll notification and this time looks to be no different.On the other hand, the BSP has already named over 100 candidates and party chief Mayawati on Sunday held a meeting in Lucknow to finalise the rest of the tickets.As for the Aam Aadmi Party, its district president Mahendra Singh said: “Our party has declared 210 tickets so far and more will be named in the days to come.”Congress spokesperson Ashok Singh said, “We always declare tickets after the notification. The party is likely to begin declaring candidates in a day or two.”As for the BJP, senior party leader and deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said, “The Central Parliamentary Board of the party declares candidates, and the process will begin soon.”The SP had declared its first list of candidates for 2017 state elections as early as March 2016 and for 2012 in April 2011.To be sure, by the time the election commission notifies the polls, the party continues releasing lists and amending them. For the 2017 polls, the then SP state president Shivpal Yadav had declared the party’s first list in March 2016 and more subsequently. But after the Yadav family feud turned intense and Akhilesh Yadav became the national president of the party while sacking Shivpal, the party scrapped all the previous lists. It then declared the actual list post-notification after allying with the Congress. But this time, the SP chief has not declared any candidates so far.The SP always deployed the early declaration strategy to give the candidates maximum possible time to project themselves in their respective constituencies and do most of their warm-up campaign before the election code of conduct came into force.So, why is it different this time?Declaring the candidates early had been the strategy of the party founder and the then national president of the party, Mulayam Singh Yadav. But, this time it is Akhilesh Yadav who is taking the party into the polls, just as in 2017 when he eventually became the party chief. Till December 2016, the situation was different. Mulayam was the party’s national president and Akhilesh’s uncle Shivpal Yadav was the state unit chief. Shivpal had declared the first list of party candidates in early 2016. Amid the Yadav family feud later that year, the party saw parallel lists of candidates, one by Shivpal and the other by Akhilesh. In January 2017, when Akhilesh became the SP national president and Naresh Uttam Patel the state president, the party scrapped all of Shivpal’s lists and even those of Akhilesh went.The party later declared candidates for 311 seats and its alliance partner Congress declared candidates on 114 seats.Akhilesh has junked the headstart strategy, opting instead for a “sure-footed approach”, said a senior SP leader.In a meeting last month with the party’s district and assembly constituency presidents, Akhilesh went to the extent of asking them to keep their ears close to the ground to check whom the BJP and the rival parties are going to field and also prepare a list of party’s probable winnable candidates. This directive came even though SP had closed its process of inviting applications from the aspiring candidates for each of the seats in September 2021.The SP leader also said that another factor that led to delaying the candidates’ declaration was the alliances that the party was making.“Soon the party and its alliance partners will begin declaring candidates,” said SP national secretary and spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary.The SP has allied with Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) and Mahan Dal for the western UP region, with the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) and Janwadi Party (Socialist) for eastern UP areas and Akhilesh’s uncle Shivpal Yadav’s Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party-Lohia (PSP-L) for the Yadav belt.

10-01-2022||Other||Gurugram: Hospitals asked to share data on oxygen demand||As part of preparing the district oxygen plan, the oxygen management committee on Saturday asked all Covid-19 hospitals to provide details such as the number of beds, their oxygen demands, and the distributors they are getting the life-saving gas from. Officials said that this will help them prepare an estimate for the amount of oxygen the district needs, and accordingly, augment supply to ensure there is no shortage of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) amid the third wave of the pandemic.According to health department data, there are 105 Covid-19 hospitals and health care centres in the district.On January 5, Gurugram deputy commissioner Yash Garg formed a five-member oxygen management committee consisting of Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and district administration officials and tasked them with the responsibility of formulating a district oxygen plan containing key information such as the average oxygen requirement of the district, individual requirement of the hospitals, and current availability.“On Saturday, we circulated an online document to all Covid-19 hospitals in the district seeking information on the number of Covid-19 beds, their oxygen demands, and the distributor they are getting oxygen from. We want to have an updated data so that there is a rough estimate ready, based on which we can make preparations and ensure the district is prepared to deal with any kind of situation,” said Vishram Kumar Meena, additional deputy commissioner, who is also one of the five members of the committee.Meena said that the oxygen plan has not been updated since June last year.As per the officials, during the second Covid-19 wave in April-May last year, the city’s daily oxygen requirement was as high as 60 metric tonnes, and currently, the oxygen demand is less than six metric tonnes per day.According to the data from the district administration, 11 oxygen plants were set up in government health centres and hospitals following the second Covid-19 wave and cumulatively they can produce around 4,150 litres of oxygen per minute. “The committee has so far identified seven oxygen filling stations in Gurugram alone, besides the ones in Faridabad, Bhiwadi, and Panipat that are also supplying oxygen to hospitals in Gurugram. We are in the process of identifying more such filling stations. The existing oxygen supply is higher than the city’s peak demand during the second Covid-19 wave,” said Siddharth Khandelwal, assistant town planner, MCG, and another member of the committee.On Saturday, the committee members inspected four oxygen filling stations in Manesar to take stock of the existing oxygen supply and assess ways through which it can be further augmented. They also held a meeting with the five authorised oxygen cylinder distributors in the city.“We conveyed to the distributors that we will not disrupt their supply system in any manner and would only be helping them with streamlining it and ensuring that the cylinders are supplied in an organised manner. For this, data sharing is being carried out,” said Meena.
10-01-2022||Mumbai||Mumbai records 19k cases, but actual numbers may be higher||Mumbai: After recording a massive and consistent spike since the last week of December, Mumbai’s daily caseload has hovered between 19,000 and 20,000 cases over the past four days. The number of tests conducted in the city too, has remained consistently between 67,000 and 72,000. While this may present a picture of a stabilising third wave driven by the Omicron variant, experts warn that the numbers may be far higher that what is being officially reported. The reasons? On the one hand, an increased reliance on home test kits that allows no official supervision on positive cases, and on the other hand, asymptomatic persons who are not undergoing any tests at all. Though the daily caseload has risen by nearly 44% since December 31, the city on Sunday recorded 19,474 cases which is a 4% decline over the previous day’s 20,318 cases. Even the number of tests conducted — 68,249 — was down by 2,770 from Saturday, official figures showed. As a result, the daily test positivity rate (TPR) declined, too. In fact, TPR (a function of the number of positive cases per tests conducted) has steadily declined since last week, from 29.90% on Thursday to 28.90% on Friday, 28.60% on Saturday and 28.53% on Sunday. Experts said that TPR is no longer the most reliable indicator to judge the spread of the pandemic as a large number of people with less severe symptoms are choosing not to get tested and many are opting for home self-testing kits. Hospitalisation rates, however, must be tracked as they indicate the extent of the disease burden of the third wave, experts said. In the last one week alone, the Covid-bed occupancy has gone up to 21% from around 15% a week back.Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force member Dr Shashank Joshi said that Mumbai’s wave seems to have flattened with daily cases between 19,000 to 20,000. “But the true picture is difficult [to judge] due to the wide use of unreported rapid tests,” he said. “We need to focus on the other criteria like doubling rate, hospitalisations, patients needing oxygen, ventilator and intensive care. The variant is circulation is highly transmissible, therefore test positivity is likely to be higher,” said Joshi.As many as seven self-test kits have been approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research including Coviself by Mylab, CoviFind by Meril Diagnostics, PanBio by Abbott among others. These kits are affordable for the middle class, and range anywhere between ₹250 to ₹350.“We have witnessed a jump of almost 700% sales of our self-test kit in Mumbai in the last one week. The self-test kit is turning out to be highly beneficial given the massive increase in cases because people can get tested quickly and immediately isolate themselves,” said Hasmukh Rawal, managing director and co-founder of Mylab Discovery Solutions, a Pune-based firm that manufactures Coviself. According to reports, nearly 500,000 such kits have been sold in Mumbai in the past week. Chemists in Mumbai have been selling anywhere between 300 to 400 self-testing rapid antigen kits daily. “Every chemist has been reporting a high demand, but it seems to have slowed down since the past two days, as the panic is settling down,” said Hakim Kapasi, a member of the Andheri Chemist Association, an umbrella body of more than 400 chemists in the Mumbai suburb. Most test kits have a mechanism by which the suspected patient can intimate their positive status on a mobile application, which is then sent to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) portal, and thereafter to the local bodies — but this is optional. The onus is on the user to responsibly update their positive result on the app. As a result, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation cannot accurately capture the number of positive cases detected on home kits.Even so, over the past four days, self-test kits have reported around 3,000 positive results on average every day in Mumbai based on what has been uploaded to the ICMR portal. Between August 1, 2021 and January 7, only 89,326 self-test positive reports in Mumbai were intimated on the portal. “We don’t have any control on reporting of the results of self-testing,” said Mumbai’s executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare. “We have been adding the positive reports that we come to know to our everyday tally,” she said. What’s more, the changing presentation of the disease means that many city physicians have started prescribing tests only in cases where patients have symptoms that persist beyond three days and are likely candidates for hospitalisation or for the monoclonal antibody cocktail drug. Dr Bakul Parekh, a paediatrician from Ghatkopar saw 200-odd patients in the past 10 days, but prescribed RT-PCR tests only for four of them. This hasn’t stopped him from treating his other patients as though they were Covid-positive, he said.“In a surging pandemic, any case of flu-like symptoms should be considered as Covid-19 unless proven otherwise,” said Parekh. “There is no point in testing a patient if the line of treatment does not change with a positive result. Since my patients are children, I start them on symptomatic treatment immediately, and ask them to be isolated from the elders and those with co-morbid conditions in the family. All the children have recovered within three to four days,” he said. “There is no point in unnecessarily burdening the patients as well as the laboratories,” he said. Physician Dr Jalil Parkar from Bandra’s Lilavati Hospital too has been prescribing tests only in cases where the symptoms don’t subside and the patient is a likely candidates for hospital admission. “At a time, there are four to five people in a family who have symptoms. This is because the current wave is driven by the Omicron variant which is highly transmissible. But how many people will you put through the tests when most of them have symptoms like fever, cough and cold, which subsides within five days?” he asked. According to Parkar, some patients prefer testing with or without a doctor’s prescription. “I put my patients on paracetamol and other symptomatic treatment, watch them for three days and if symptoms don’t subside, I write the test just in case they need hospitalisation. But most recover by then,” he said. Eom/js||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-records-19k-cases-but-actual-numbers-may-be-higher-101641753203807.html
10-01-2022||Chandigarh||Ludhiana DC office goes without water supply for nearly a week||The deputy commissioner's office’s water supply has been disrupted for over a week, after leakage in one of the underground pipes contaminated the water. The water shortage has affected around 200 employees working in different departments at the DC office. The crisis has been compounded due to the elections, due to which most of the staff is attending work despite the weekend. While there was no drinking water on the premises, the staffers could not even use the toilet. “We have to visit either the district court complex or the building of the additional deputy commissioner (development) to use the facilities. It is not the first time that a snag has taken place. We need to find a permanent solution to the problem,” the staffer said. The contractor supervising the work, requesting anonymity, said that the pipe had cracked due to the water pressure, which was a recurring issue. “We have repositioned the pipe, and hopefully the DC office will have water by Monday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dc-office-goes-without-water-supply-for-nearly-a-week-101641745102660.html

Mohali will witness a multi-cornered contest as in the current political scenario, the BJP and the Captain Amarinder Singh faction are also in the picture, apart from the Congress, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD).AAP has declared former mayor and real estate baron Kulwant Singh as its candidate, while other parties have yet to declare their candidates. Both the Congress and the AAP have put up hoardings and banners all over the city. In the hoardings, the Congress is highlighting its achievements of the past five years, while the AAP is urging for “One chance to Kejriwal this time”.Sitting Congress MLA Balbir Singh Sidhu, who has won the seat three times in a row since 2007, is once again eyeing the ticket from Mohali. On Friday, Sidhu inaugurated his election office in Sector 79 and took a dig at his opponents.Challenging his opponents, he asked them to counter him anywhere on the development work carried out in Mohali during his tenure. The people of Mohali should compare the 10 years of mayorship of Kulwant Singh, versus 10 months of work under the Congress-ruled MC, which has changed the face of Mohali and has catapulted it to 81st rank from 164th under the Swachh Bharat Survey, he said.On the other hand, Kulwant is regularly holding public meetings with people. On Friday, during his public meeting, he said with the formation of the AAP government in Punjab, corruption will be curbed and the people of Punjab will be given corruption-free, public-oriented administration. Mohali would see an all-around develop and “atrocities being committed by the present leaders” would also be taken into account, he said.From the BJP, former president of the Mohali Industries Association, Sanjeev Vashist, is eyeing the ticket from Mohali and has put up banners and posters all over the city and is also addressing public meetings. 
10-01-2022||World||First round of US-Russia security talks ends amid war fears||Diplomats from Russia and the US wrapped up their first round of high-stakes talks over the Kremlin’s sweeping security demands amid the threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine that’s provoked the worst tensions since the Cold War.Thw two sides scheduled separate briefings for later Monday after a full day of negotiations between US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov in Geneva. Both sides had expressed caution about the outlook for the negotiations before they started.Russia is insisting on legally-binding guarantees of a halt to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization enlargement and an end to the alliance’s military presence in eastern and central European nations that joined the bloc since 1997. The U.S. has dismissed that as unrealistic, offering instead to curtail missile deployments and exercises in the region.Russia has amassed more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine, prompting warnings in Washington and Kyiv of the risk of an incursion into the ex-Soviet neighbor. The Kremlin denies it’s planning to attack, but says it’s responding to increased NATO activity on its borders and the threat of a Ukrainian offensive against Russian-backed separatists in the eastern Donbas region. Ukraine has rejected accusations of any planned invasion. The US and its allies have threatened to impose punishing sanctions on Russia if it invades. The talks in Geneva were the first of three sets of negotiations taking place this week. There will be Russian consultations with NATO in Brussels on Wednesday and discussions in Vienna under the framework of the 57-nation Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe a day later.Over the weekend, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had played down the possibility of any immediate “breakthroughs.” Presidents Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin decided last month to make a major diplomatic push to resolve their differences. Russia, which in 2014 annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and fomented a standoff in Donbas which has claimed 14,000 lives so far, is fiercely opposed to the NATO ambitions of Ukraine and another ex-Soviet state, Georgia.The US and its European allies are discussing a range of retaliatory measures if Putin does invade Ukraine, including cutting off Russia from Swift, the international payments system, limiting Russian banks’ ability to convert currencies and imposing export controls on advanced technologies used in aviation, semiconductors and other components, as well as computers and other consumer goods in more extreme scenarios.But concern among some big European nations about economic fallout raises the risk of a split with the US on how strongly to hit Russia with sanctions if it stages aggression against Ukraine, according to people familiar with the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-round-of-us-russia-security-talks-ends-amid-war-fears-101641832209913.html
10-01-2022||World||Afghan envoy to China quits after 6 months of no pay, leaves hand over note, keys to embassy's cars to successor||Afghanistan's ambassador to China left a colourful resignation note for his post-Taliban takeover successor on Monday -- revealing that staff had not been paid for months and that a lone receptionist had been left to answer phones.Javid Ahmad Qaem took to Twitter to detail how he had to scrape cash from the embassy's bank account to pay staff after the Taliban seized Afghanistan last August."Since we did not receive salaries from Kabul for the last six months, we assigned a committee from within the diplomats to solve the financial issues," Qaem wrote in a letter to Afghanistan's foreign ministry dated January 1 but posted to social media on Monday.Still, he left some funds for his successor."As of today, 1st January 2022, there is around $100,000 left in the account."He did not say where he was going next.In a portrait of a barely functioning embassy, Qaem's letter revealed he had left the keys for the embassy's five cars in his office and that a lone local hire had been assigned to answer queries after all the other diplomats left.Many of Afghanistan's embassies are in diplomatic limbo, run by staff still loyal to the Western-backed government toppled by the Taliban.Several Afghan diplomats have abandoned their Beijing postings since the fall of Kabul, Qaem wrote, calling his resignation "the end to an honourable responsibility" in an accompanying Tweet."I believe when the new person assigned, Mr Sadaat, arrives to Beijing, there will be no other diplomat left," the letter said, adding that China had been "well-informed".Diplomatic limboIt was not immediately clear of the whereabouts of his successor, or who had appointed him, and no immediate comment from Taliban officials in Kabul.The Afghan embassy in Beijing appeared open as usual on Monday afternoon, with the internationally recognised Afghan tricolour raised and two security guards outside.Qaem, who has served as ambassador since November 2019, had expressed concerns about the Taliban in media interviews shortly after China hosted a visiting delegation in July.Weeks later, the Taliban captured Kabul and formed a new Islamist government.Since then, Afghanistan has been plunged into financial chaos, with inflation and unemployment surging.China has provided millions to Afghanistan in aid since the takeover and the new regime sees Beijing as a crucial source of investment.The Taliban have not appointed new representatives to most missions, however, and their government is not recognised by any nation.Beijing is not the only Afghan embassy that has seemingly fallen into chaos.Police were called to the country's embassy in Rome last week when a sacked Afghan diplomat attacked the ambassador after claiming to have been appointed to replace him, the mission said.The Taliban's foreign ministry in Kabul said the diplomat still had a valid contract and his termination was illegal.There has also been a diplomatic standoff at the UN, with representatives of the former and current regime both claiming Afghanistan's seat.Late last year the UN Security Council indefinitely postponed making a decision on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-envoy-to-china-quits-after-6-months-of-no-pay-leaves-hand-over-note-keys-to-embassy-s-cars-to-successor-101641821651969.html
10-01-2022||World||Covid-19: Chinese capital on alert as partly-locked down Tianjin’s cases jump||China’s first community-based Omicron outbreak has partially locked down the northern city of Tianjin and put officials in neighbouring Beijing on high alert with health authorities tracking down cases from the same transmission chain to the central province of Henan.At least 21 more cases of Covid-19 were reported in the port city of Tianjin, some 130km and a 40-minute high-speed train ride away from Beijing, for Sunday, the national health commission (NHC) said on Monday, taking the total number to 40.At least two Omicron cases were confirmed on Sunday (for Saturday), health authorities said. It wasn’t clear if there were more cases of the highly transmissible Omicron variant among the 41 officially confirmed cases.Worryingly for the government, the Tianjin outbreak has been linked to two Omicron cases reported on Monday in the city of Anyang around 400km away in Henan province.Coming weeks ahead of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, the new outbreak will further test China’s “dynamic Covid” policy, which means stamping out the smallest number of cases with mass testing and lockdowns.Announcing a partial lockdown in Tianjin, city authorities have said the general public should not leave Tianjin unless it is essential to do so as health officials carry out nucleic acid tests on nearly 14 million residents of the city.Tianjin’s mass testing scheme, which is expected to be completed by the end of Monday, is part of its effort to “resolutely prevent the virus spreading to other provinces, regions and cities, especially Beijing”, the city government said in a letter to residents.Those who need to leave must obtain official permission and test negative for the virus within 48 hours of their departure, the local government added.Schools and university campuses have been closed, and Beijing-bound trains from Tianjin have been cancelled; road checkpoints have been set up to check vehicles before being allowed to enter the capital.“Tianjin’s experience with controlling and treating the Omicron variant will provide invaluable experience for other regions to fight the epidemic,” Zhang Boli, from the Chinese Academy of Engineering was quoted as saying by state media on Monday.Zhang added that the Tianjin outbreak showed that the proportion of young among the infected group, especially primary and secondary school students, was relatively high, and authorities should be vigilant about it.On Monday, Tianjin launched an emergency response mechanism to guarantee the supply of daily necessities.According to the Tianjin municipal bureau of commerce, local authorities have mobilised major wholesale suppliers, supermarkets and vegetable markets to add inventory in order to cope with the market demand for meat, eggs and vegetables.Across the mainland, there were 97 new local cases for Sunday, the NHC announced on Monday, besides 100 imported cases.In the northwest, Xian - whose 13 million residents have been in lockdown since December 23 - reported 15 new local symptomatic cases on Monday, down from 30 on Sunday.Xian has recorded more than 2,000 Covid-19 cases during the current outbreak.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases on the mainland had reached 103,776 by Sunday with the death toll at 4636.China has so far administered over 2.9 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines until Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-chinese-capital-on-alert-as-partly-locked-down-tianjin-s-cases-jump-101641819569717.html
10-01-2022||World||Pope backs Covid immunisation campaigns, warns of ideological misinformation||Pope Francis on Monday condemned "baseless" ideological misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines, backing national immunisation campaigns and calling health care a moral obligation.Francis spoke in his yearly address to the diplomatic corps accredited to the Vatican, sometimes called his "State of the World" address because it is a broad survey of the global situation.His words to diplomats from nearly 200 countries marked the closest he has ever come to a de facto backing of vaccine mandates, which have become controversial in Italy and other European countries."We have realised that in those places where an effective vaccination campaign has taken place, the risk of severe repercussions of the disease has decreased," he said."It is therefore important to continue the effort to immunise the general population as much as possible".Francis, who dedicated about a fifth of his six-page address to the pandemic, warned against ideological statements regarding vaccinations."Sadly, we are finding increasingly that we live in a world of strong ideological divides. Frequently people let themselves be influenced by the ideology of the moment, often bolstered by baseless information or poorly documented facts," he said."Vaccines are not a magical means of healing, yet surely they represent, in addition to other treatments that need to be developed, the most reasonable solution for the prevention of the disease," he told the diplomats gathered in the Vatican's frescoed Hall of the Benedictions.By saying that "health care is a moral obligation" in the context of a speech supporting vaccinations, Francis appeared to be responding to Catholics and other Christians, particularly in the United States, who say they have a religion-based right of conscientious objection to vaccines.Francis, who is fully vaccinated, called for a global political commitment "to pursue the good of the general population through measures of prevention and immunisation".He renewed his appeal for the equitable distribution of vaccines to poor nations, saying that "monopolistic rules" regarding patents should be put aside for the greater good.Francis also reiterated his defence of migrants, saying each country should accept as many as possible and that responsibility for their integration should be shared.On climate change, he said the results of last year's COP26 summit in Glasgow were "rather weak in light of the gravity of the problem" and hoped that action on global warming could be consolidated at COP27 planned for Egypt in November.He repeated calls for dialogue in areas of conflict or crisis such as Lebanon, Ukraine and Myanmar as well as his call for a ban on the possession of nuclear weapons.The Vatican, the world's smallest state, has diplomatic relations with 183 states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-backs-covid-immunisation-campaigns-warns-of-ideological-misinformation-101641818391058.html

However, the IS has operated in Afghanistan since 2014, carrying out dozens of horrific attacks and most often targeting the country's minority Shiite Muslims.Afghanistan is among the countries with the most unexploded land mines and other ordnance from the country's decades of war and conflict. When the ordnance detonates, the victims are often children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-explosion-kills-9-children-in-eastern-afghanistan-101641814921228.html
10-01-2022||World||Kazakhstan unrest: Here’s a timeline of the central Asian nation’s worst crisis||More than 160 people, including children, have died and more than 8000 have been detained in Kazakhstan over the past one week amid massive protests.Starting Wednesday, Almaty, the country's biggest city and former capital, was subject to an internet blackout that has finally been lifted with services resumed on January 10.The Kazakh protests that began on January 2 due to a hike in fuel prices have turned into one of the worst unrests faced by the country since its independence.Also Read | Explained: How Kazakhstan protests started and the bigger pictureThe Russian-led bloc has provided President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev with 2,030 troops and 250 pieces of military hardware. Kazakhstan's Committee of National Security says the situation in the country is under control now, with ‘terrorist hotbeds' neutralised, according to a Reuters report.Here’s a timeline of the recent crisis:January 3 - Thousands protested in Zhanaozen, Aqtau, Mangystau, Nur-Sultan, and other cities across the central Asian nation. A rise in oil prices will affect the price of everyday commodities like food, they complained. About three people were detained by police.January 4 - Tear gas and stun grenades were used to drive hundreds of protestors out of the main Almaty square. Over 20 demonstrators were arrested across the country, while eight police officers were killed. To appease the protesters, the government announced that some price caps would be restored on LPG.January 5 - A nationwide state of emergency was announced by the authorities after government buildings were stormed by demonstrators and protests turned violent. Almaty's city hall and president's residence both caught fire on Wednesday, according to Interfax.Also Read | Here are some of the biggest protests Kazakhstan saw in the past decadesThe same day, the Kazakhstan government resigned following violent attacks, while videos were released of people shouting "Old man, go away!” directed towards former president Nursultan Nazarbayev, reported news agency Reuters.January 6 - Armenia's prime minister announced that Russian-led ex-Soviet troops will be sent to quell Kazakh protests following the president's appeal for assistance."Almaty was attacked, destroyed, vandalised, the residents of Almaty became victims of attacks by terrorists, bandits. Therefore it is our duty... to take all possible actions to protect our state," said Tokayev on his television appearance.January 7 - The government said order has been “mainly restored”. Security officers accused protestors of killing 13 police officers and injuring 353. Tokayev permitted security in the country to “fire without warning”. More than 4,400 people were arrested and 26 demonstrators killed.January 8 - The Kazakhstan government blamed foreign-backed terrorists for the unrest and announced the arrest of former counterintelligence and anti-terror agency chief, Karim Masimov, for attempted overthrow of the government. This day saw a major drop in protests.Watch Now | Watch: Chinese president Xi Jinping lends support to Kazakhstan govt amid unrestJanuary 9 - For a second day in a row, the streets of the protest epicentre Almaty were eerily silent, except for sounds of occasional gunshots. It seemed to be a result of the arrival of Russians and the bloody shutdown of demonstrators by Kazakh security. The Kazakh presidency reported 160 deaths and 5800 detentions on Sunday. Property damage worth 170 million euros has also been quoted, including banks, vehicles and public buildings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kazakhstan-unrest-here-s-a-timeline-of-the-central-asian-nation-s-worst-crisis-101641810135989.html
10-01-2022||World||Singapore says 30% Covid-19 deaths in 2021 were fully vaccinated||Fully vaccinated individuals accounted for 30 per cent of Singapore’s total Covid-19 related deaths last year, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said in Parliament on Monday.The minister said that Singapore last year registered 802 deaths due to the coronavirus, out of which 247 were fully vaccinated people.Most of the vaccinated individuals, who died from Covid-19 related complications, had received non-mRNA vaccines, according to crude incidence rates of deaths provided by Ong.Ong provided the crude incidence rates based on type of vaccination: 11 deaths per 100,000 for those vaccinated with Sinovac, 7.8 per 100,000 for Sinopharm, 6.2 per 100,000 for Pfizer-BioNTech and 1 per 100,000 for Moderna."Be mindful, we are calculating this based on quite a small sample of 247 deaths… These rates are only indicative since they do not account for other factors which can affect mortality such as the age and timing of vaccination," Channel News Asia quoted Ong as saying in the House.The remaining 555 people who died from Covid-19 last year were not fully vaccinated.Although the unvaccinated represents a "small proportion" of Singapore's population, those deaths accounted for 70 per cent of the total Covid-19 deaths last year, Ong said.The Ministry of Health (MOH) has managed to vaccinate "well over 90 per cent" of every eligible age group over the past months, he said."We are especially happy to see that amongst seniors aged 60 to 69, and 70 and above, 96 per cent and 95 per cent have been fully vaccinated respectively," the minister said.As for those aged 12 to 19 years old, 95 per cent are fully vaccinated, said the minister, while response has been "good" and operations have been "smooth" for vaccinations among younger children aged five to 11."At this time, only the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine is authorised for use in ages below 18 years. We will continue to monitor closely the availability of other vaccines, including non-mRNA vaccines that are approved for use in children," Ong assured the House.Singapore's booster programme is "gathering pace", with about 46 per cent of the population having received their boosters (third injection), said Ong."We have recently brought some 900,000 individuals aged 18 to 29 into the booster programme, of whom 700,000 are already eligible to receive their boosters today," he said.The MOH has also set a validity period for full vaccination status of 270 days, to send "a strong signal to our population".However, it is "still too early to tell" whether there is a need for further booster shots, he said.Israel is the only country that has authorised a fourth dose for non-immunocompromised individuals.Meanwhile, the current Covid-19 safe measures will only be tightened as a "last resort" when Singapore's healthcare system is under heavy strain, Ong said."It is the (multi-ministry task force’s) hope that we can ride through the Omicron wave with the current safe management measures."If we have to tighten the restrictions, it will be as a last resort when our healthcare system is under severe pressure," he said, in response to questions on whether stricter rules will be put in place.Citing Singapore's experience with the Delta wave last year, Ong said that even after it subsided, authorities had refrained from "being too jubilant" and over-relaxing restrictions."That would have been a mistake," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-says-30-covid-19-deaths-in-2021-were-fully-vaccinated-101641805590022.html

10-01-2022||World||US, Russia open high-stakes talks on Ukraine||Top US and Russian diplomats kicked off crucial talks Monday on soaring tensions over Ukraine, amid fears of a Russian invasion of its pro-Western neighbour.US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and her Russian counterpart Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov opened their meeting at the US mission in Geneva at 8:55 am (0755 GMT), a State Department spokesperson said.A convoy of black vehicles with Russian diplomatic plates had arrived shortly before, and was ushered through the large iron gates under a billowing US flag.The two diplomats had already met informally in the Swiss city on Sunday evening, with Ryabkov afterwards telling the Interfax news agency the conversation was "businesslike" and "difficult".The United States and Russia have set firm lines with Washington warning of the risk of confrontation and Moscow ruling out concessions.The talks start a week of diplomacy in which Russia will meet with NATO and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) officials, with the US trying to reassure European allies that they will not be sidelined.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken stressed Sunday that Russia had to choose between dialogue and confrontation, warning on CNN that there would be "massive consequences for Russia if it renews its aggression on Ukraine."Since late last year, Russia amassed tens of thousands of troops at the Ukrainian border, drawing Washington into a Cold War-style stand-off.President Vladimir Putin's government is insisting NATO must never grant membership to ex-Soviet Ukraine, which is pushing to join.Ryabkov told Russian news agencies Sunday that his country had ruled out making any concessions at the talks, even as Washington said many of Moscow's demands were non-starters.'Avoid confrontation' Blinken however insisted that there was a possible "path of dialogue and diplomacy to try to resolve some these differences and avoid confrontation."A senior White House official indicated Saturday that Washington could be prepared to discuss with Russia the possibility of both sides reining in the deployment of missile systems and the size and scope of military exercises.Blinken warned though that any positive outcome from the talks would rely in part on Russia's willingness to stand down from its aggressive posture, which he likened to "an atmosphere of escalation with a gun to Ukraine's head.""So if we're actually going to make progress, we're going to have to see de-escalation, Russia pulling back from the threat that it currently poses to Ukraine," he told CNN.The talks come after Putin and US counterpart Joe Biden met in Geneva last June and agreed on regular "stability" talks between Sherman and Ryabkov.In two phone calls to Putin, Biden has warned of severe consequences if Russia invades Ukraine.Measures under consideration include sanctions on Putin's inner circle, cancelling Russia's controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany or, in the most drastic scenario, severing Russia's links to the world's banking system.Russia insists it was deceived after the Cold War and understood that NATO would not expand.Instead, the US-led alliance welcomed in most of the former Warsaw Pact countries and the three Baltic nations that were under Soviet rule.Russia has put intense pressure on Ukraine since 2014 after a revolution overthrew a government that had sided with the Kremlin against moving closer to Europe.Russia seized the Crimean peninsula and backs an insurgency in eastern Ukraine in which more than 13,000 people have died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-russia-open-high-stakes-talks-on-ukraine-101641804800733.html
10-01-2022||World||Developing countries at risk of 'economic turbulence': IMF||Emerging economies should gird for possible rough times as the US Federal Reserve prepares to raise interest rates and world economic growth slows because of the Omicron variant of Covid-19, the IMF warned Monday.The International Monetary Fund, which is scheduled to release updated economic forecasts on January 25, said that for now global economic recovery from the ravages of the pandemic should continue this year and next.But "risks to growth remain elevated by the stubbornly resurgent pandemic," IMF economists Stephan Danninger, Kenneth Kang and Helene Poirson wrote in a blog post.The highly contagious Omicron strain has spread like wildfire around the world since mid-December, causing record numbers of new Covid cases in the latest wave of the global health crisis.Omicron, which seems to cause less severe disease than previous strains of the coronavirus, is causing countries to reinstitute health measures that hamper economic growth."Given the risk that this could coincide with faster Fed tightening, emerging economies should prepare for potential bouts of economic turbulence," the economists said, as these countries are also confronting elevated inflation and substantially higher public debt.The Fed has signalled that it will raise key interest rates sooner and more aggressively than it had planned, in order to counter rampant inflation in the US that is hitting US households and consumption -- the engine of economic growth in America.Higher interest rates mean financing costs for some emerging economies with dollar-denominated debt will rise.These countries are already lagging behind in the global economic recovery and thus less able to absorb added expenditure."While dollar borrowing costs remain low for many, concerns about domestic inflation and stable foreign funding led several emerging markets last year, including Brazil, Russia, and South Africa, to start raising interest rates," the IMF said.Quicker Fed rate hikes could rattle financial markets and cause tighter financial conditions on a global scale, the blog says.The risk is there will be a slowing of demand and trade in the US, as well as capital flight and a depreciation of the dollar in markets of emerging countries.The IMF recommended that emerging economy nations "tailor their response based on their circumstances and vulnerabilities."And central banks that are raising interest rates to fight inflation should engage in "clear and consistent communication" so people better understand the need for price stability, the international lender said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/developing-countries-at-risk-of-economic-turbulence-imf-101641804957484.html
10-01-2022||World||Covid-19 hospitalisations spike across provinces in Canada||While the risk of hospitalisation from the Omicron variant of Covid-19 is lower than that for Delta, the fact that it’s extremely transmissible is driving up admissions because of the sheer volume of cases, Canada’s chief public health officer has said.In a series of tweets on Sunday as hospitalisations spiked across several provinces, Dr Theresa Tam said one of the key concerns was that while surveillance and recent studies indicates the risk of hospitalisation from Omicron was lower compared to Delta, “sudden acceleration” caused by the variant “with an enormous volume of cases is driving up severe illness trends”.The current daily case counts, she pointed out, were 400% higher than the peak for the third wave of the pandemic in Canada, when on average 8,730 cases were reported daily in mid-April last year. Given this scenario, she added that it was “not unexpected we’ll see further increases in hospitalisation trends”.Her remarks came as provinces like Quebec and Ontario reported high hospitalisation numbers. Quebec set a new record with 2,436 on Sunday, while Ontario had 2,419.The rapid spread of Omicron has also led to the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) being called in to assist health authorities. Members of the military were rendering help in the remote First Nations territory of Bearskin Lake in northern Ontario, where half the population has been infected.Defence minister Anita Anand has also said that 200 CAF personnel have been deployed at vaccination centres in Quebec, as it ramps up its drive to deliver boosters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-hospitalisations-spike-across-provinces-in-canada-101641800788306.html
10-01-2022||World||China detects more Omicron cases as cities tighten restrictions||China reported more cases of the highly transmissible Omicron coronavirus variant on Monday, with authorities on high alert over flare-ups in major cities just weeks ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympics.The emergence of the fast-spreading variant is yet another test of China's zero Covid strategy, with authorities already battling several outbreaks -- including in Xi'an where 13 million city residents were in their third week of lockdown.Fears grew about a cluster of infections in the northern city of Tianjin, which was linked to two Omicron cases reported Monday in the city of Anyang around 400 kilometres (250 miles) away."The general public should not leave Tianjin unless essential to do so," city officials said in a statement Sunday.Those who need to leave must obtain official permission and test negative for the virus within 48 hours of their departure, it added.Schools and university campuses have been closed, and trains into Beijing from Tianjin have been cancelled.Road checkpoints have been set up for vehicles entering the capital.Tianjin -- just 150 kilometres from Beijing -- has already ordered the testing of all 14 million residents.Another 21 cases were reported in the city Monday, although the strain of virus wasn't confirmed.Footage from state broadcaster CCTV showed masked people in Tianjin's Nankai district queueing for virus tests on Sunday from medical workers in white hazmat suits.Gu Qing, director of the Tianjin Municipal Health Commission, told reporters at the weekend that the new cases are "mainly students and their parents who go to the same nursery and school."Henan outbreak The world's most populous nation -- where the coronavirus was first detected in late 2019 -- slowed the spread of the virus to a trickle through its zero Covid strategy, which includes targeted lockdowns, border restrictions and lengthy quarantines.While China's total reported cases are far lower than other virus hotspots such as the United States and Europe, there is widespread concern about the impact of Omicron.Authorities in the city of Anyang in central Henan province also announced the testing of all residents -- more than five million people -- over the weekend.The city on Monday reported two Omicron cases linked to the Tianjin cluster.Henan reported 60 new cases Monday but did not break down the tally by variant. The provincial capital Zhengzhou has closed schools and kindergartens, and stopped restaurants from accepting dine-in customers.Before the latest cluster, China had reported just a handful of Omicron cases, all linked to imported infections.Authorities are especially wary of major outbreaks ahead of the Winter Olympics, which Beijing will host from February 4-20.The global event will coincide with the busy Lunar New Year holidays over which millions of people travel across the country.mjw/rox/qan||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-detects-more-omicron-cases-as-cities-tighten-restrictions-101641796180330.html
10-01-2022||World||Two years, 5.5 million deaths later, Beijing stonewalls on virus origins||More than two years ago, the Chinese Communist Party regime confirmed the first coronavirus case on December 8, 2019, in Wuhan. The WHO debated about the spread of virus in the following month (on January 23) whether to declare the outbreak, with 557 cases in China, as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The decision was postponed by the Emergency Committee despite the seriousness of the situation, to January 20, 2020. The WHO declared it a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 but by that time the virus has circled the earth many a times.Today, the world is facing the third or fourth wave of the virus with over 307 million cases and over 5.5 million deaths. The rapidly mutating virus has played havoc with both the world economy and society at large with many a child believing that the computer at home is actually a school and many a student haven’t seen what a college cafeteria or library looks like. Those beyond sixties are facing the worst home isolation because of which suffering from depression and general apathy. The anti-coronavirus vaccines, developed at a fantastic pace by global scientists, are now being questioned with omicron variant afflicting even those who already had the virus infection of Delta variant and were double vaccinated or even with a booster dose.While the pandemic has changed the world for all time to come, the world with all the UN, WHO and a plethora of agencies have not been able to fix accountability of China, where the origins of virus indisputably lie. The Canadian military officers who attended the Military Games in Wuhan in October 2019 have come out saying that the city was a ghost town during the games and many of the participants were afflicted with Covid-19 like symptoms like fatigue and breathlessness. According to news reports, Iranian participants even lost their lives after the infection in Wuhan games.Twenty-four months later, none of the global powers have been able to push the Chinese regime to come up the first victim of the virus on ground zero in Wuhan and the role of the Wuhan Virology Lab in spreading the deadly disease. The WHO, under China supported DG Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. like its parent UN continues to remain a talk shop with discussions in Geneva and New York but without any firm outcomes. It was as if the disease appeared from the sky and afflicted the globe without any one being responsible for it. The famed US intelligence is also far from forthcoming on the origins of the disease, clearly showing their lack of penetration in the communist regime ruling China. The Bamboo curtain clearly outstrips the Iron curtain when it comes to transparency. And it is quite evident that none of the power blocs, be it NATO or the ASEAN, are willing to question a rising military superpower in China for the fear of a nig stick retaliation. Australia under Prime Minister Scott Morrison had the temerity to stand up and ask for investigation on the origins of virus in China but the result was Beijing imposing sanctions on Canberra. Former World War II rival Japan and the EU are more worried about economy than how to stop the virus through Chinese patient zero. It clearly shows that Beijing has something to hide but even the US, the biggest military and economic power today, cannot force it to cough up the truth. The less said about the UN the better.
10-01-2022||World||Sri Lanka on the verge of bankruptcy as inflation rises to record levels: Report||Sri Lanka is facing a deepening financial and humanitarian crisis that could lead it to bankruptcy in 2022 as inflation rises to record levels, said a media report.Earlier, on August 30 last year, the Sri Lanka government announced a national financial emergency after a steep fall in the value of the country's currency which caused a spike in food prices.Writing in Colombo Gazette, Suhail Guptil said, Sri Lanka is continuously facing twin deficits, that is, fiscal deficit and trade deficit during a major part of the last decade. Since 2014, the foreign debt level of Sri Lanka has been on the rise and reached 42.6 per cent of GDP in 2019.Guptil explained that the cumulative foreign debt of the country was estimated at USD 33 billion in 2019, which puts a huge burden on the country for debt servicing.After this, several credit rating agencies including Standard and Poor's, Moody's and Fitch downgraded Sri Lanka's credit rating to B from C, which makes it difficult to obtain funds through International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs), Guptil said.The financial crisis in Sri Lanka is primarily caused by a low growth rate, currently at four per cent and huge debt service repayment obligations and the situation is worsening.As of November 2021, available foreign currency reserves were just USD 1.6 billion while in the next 12 months, the government and private sector of Sri Lanka will have to repay an estimated USD 7.3 billion in domestic and foreign loans, including a USD 500 million international sovereign bond repayment in January 2022, the report said.It further added that one of the most pressing problems for Sri Lanka is its huge foreign debt and debt service burden, in particular to China. It owes China more than USD 5 billion in debt and last year took an additional USD 1 billion loan from Beijing to wean off its acute financial crisis, which is being paid in installments.It is estimated that the foreign currency reserves of the country would completely deplete by January 2022 and it would need to borrow at least -USD 437 million for necessary payments. The major problem facing the country now is how to manage foreign debt service of USD 4.8 billion being due during February-October 2022, the report said.Inflation hit a record high of 11.1 per cent in November and escalating prices have left those who were previously well off struggling to feed their families, while basic goods are now unaffordable for many.After Rajapaksa declared Sri Lanka to be in an economic emergency, the military was given the power to ensure essential items, including rice and sugar, that was sold at set government prices - but it has done little to ease people's woes.The former central bank deputy governor, WA Wijewardena warned that the struggles of ordinary people would exacerbate the financial crisis, which would in turn make life harder for them. The World Bank estimates 500,000 people have fallen below the poverty line since the beginning of the pandemic, Guptil said.Guptil further stated that in an "attempt temporarily to ease the problems and stave off difficult and most likely unpopular policies", the government has resorted to temporary relief measures, such as credit lines to import foods, medicines and fuel from its neighbouring ally India, as well as currency swaps from India, China and Bangladesh and loans to purchase petroleum from Oman."The Sri Lankan government also plans to settle its past oil debts with Iran by paying them with tea, sending them USD 5 million worth of tea every month in order to save "much-needed currency".Moreover, Colombo has decided to close three overseas diplomatic missions from December 2021 to cut down expenditure in the face of the ongoing financial crisis and dollar crunch. However, these measures will provide only short-term relief and the loans will have to be paid back at high-interest rates, adding to Sri Lanka's debt load, Guptil added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lanka-on-the-verge-of-bankruptcy-as-inflation-rises-to-record-levels-report-101641789154026.html
10-01-2022||World||China: Xi Jinping appoints top Xinjiang police officer as Hong Kong PLA chief||A former senior paramilitary officer posted in Xinjiang has been appointed as the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) garrison chief in Hong Kong, the latest sign of Beijing taking an increasingly hardline stand on security in the financial hub.Major General Peng Jingtang was the deputy chief of staff of China’s paramilitary police force, the People’s Armed Police, national broadcaster, CCTV said in a report late on Sunday night, adding that his appointment was signed into order by Chinese President Xi Jinping.Peng was previously also chief of staff of the armed police force in Xinjiang, where western countries and international rights groups say Beijing is committing genocide against the minority Uighur community.China has denied the allegations, denouncing the charges as part of a smear campaign.Broadcaster CCTV quoted Peng as saying that he would in his new appointment work with all members of the garrison to follow the command of the ruling Communist Party and Xi, and resolutely defend national sovereignty and security interests.Hong Kong, a special administrative region, returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise that wide-ranging individual rights would be protected.Pro-democracy activists and rights groups, however, say freedoms have been eroded, in particular since China imposed a new national security law after months of at times violent protests in 2019.Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997, and a mini-constitution, called the Basic Law was created under the “one country, two systems” principle; it gave the city more freedoms than the mainland, including freedom of speech, and which are supposed to remain intact until 2047.Last March, China approved sweeping changes to Hong Kong’s electoral system, tightening Beijing’s control over the city and cutting down democratic representation in the legislature.In December, Xi told Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam that the city is developing in the right direction and heaped praise on her work, two days after an election installed Beijing’s loyalists in the financial hub’s legislature amid a low turnout.“In the past year, Hong Kong has consolidated the situation in which the city turned from chaos [during the 2019 social unrest] to peace, and has continued to develop in a positive direction,” Xi Jinping was quoted by official media as telling Carrie Lam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-xi-jinping-appoints-top-xinjiang-police-officer-as-hong-kong-pla-chief-101641794307811.html
10-01-2022||World||Myanmar's deposed leader Aung San Suu Kyi sentenced to 4 more years in prison||A Myanmar court on Monday sentenced Aung San Suu Kyi, the country's deposed leader, to four more years in prison after she was found guilty of illegally importing and possessing walkie-talkies and violating coronavirus disease (Covid-19) restrictions.In December last year, Suu Kyi was convicted on two other charges for incitement and breaching Covid-19 rules while campaigning and was awarded a sentence of four years.However, this got halved to two years and the 76-year-old Nobel Peace Prize laureate was allowed to serve her term under house arrest in the capital city of Naypyidaw.Monday's charge of possessing walkie-talkies stems from when soldiers raided Suu Kyi's residence on the day of the military coup on February 1, 2021, allegedly discovering the contraband equipment, according to news agency AFP.Right after Suu Kyi's government was ousted by the junta, Myanmar witnessed widespread protests against the military rule with security forces resorting to mass detentions and bloody crackdowns. More than 1,400 civilians have lost their lives.Suu Kyi is also on trial in nearly a dozen cases that carry combined maximum sentences of more than 100 years in prison. The ousted leader has denied all these charges.On the other hand, Suu Kyi's supporters have said that the charges are contrived to legitimise the military’s actions and prevent her return to politics.The military junta has not yet issued a statement on Suu Kyi's sentence but pointed out that she was being given due process by an independent court led by a judge appointed by her own administration.The junta has also refused to disclose the location where she will be detained. Suu Kyi's trial in Naypyitaw has been closed to journalists and lawyers are not allowed to speak to the media or public.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmars-deposed-leader-aung-san-suu-kyi-sentenced-to-4-more-years-in-prison-101641791335101.html

Our security forces have been engaging with violent mobs who were committing brazen acts of terror."Life was steadily returning to normal in Almaty Monday, AFP correspondents saw, with public transport visible on the city's roads for the first time since the violence began.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kazakhstans-largest-city-almaty-back-online-after-clashes-blackout-101641788351208.html

10-01-2022||World||‘Get out! Get out!’: Harrowing tales of escape after fire hits building in NYC||A malfunctioning space heater sparked a fire that filled a high-rise Bronx apartment building with thick smoke Sunday morning, killing 19 people including nine children in New York City’s deadliest blaze in three decades.Trapped residents broke windows for air and stuffed wet towels under doors as smoke rose from a lower-floor apartment where the fire started. Survivors told of fleeing in panic through darkened hallways, barely able to breathe.Multiple limp children were seen being given oxygen after they were carried out. Evacuees had faces covered in soot.Firefighters found victims on every floor, many of them in cardiac and respiratory arrest, said Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro. Some could not escape because of the volume of smoke, he said.Some residents said they initially ignored wailing smoke alarms because false alarms were so common in the 120-unit building, built in the early 1970s as affordable housing.More than five dozen people were hurt and 13 were hospitalized in critical condition. The fire commissioner said most of the victims had severe smoke inhalation.Firefighters continued making rescues even after their air supplies ran out, Mayor Eric Adams said.“Their oxygen tanks were empty and they still pushed through the smoke,” Adams said.Investigators said the fire triggered by the electric heater started in a duplex apartment on the second and third floors of the 19-story building.The flames didn't spread far — only charring the one unit and an adjacent hallway. But the door to the apartment and a door to a stairwell had been left open, letting smoke quickly spread throughout the building, Nigro said.New York City fire codes generally require apartment doors to be spring-loaded and slam shut automatically, but it was not immediately clear whether this building was covered by those rules.Building resident Sandra Clayton said she grabbed her dog Mocha and ran for her life when she saw the hallway filling with smoke and heard people screaming, “Get out! Get out!”Clayton, 61, said she groped her way down a darkened stairway, clutching Mocha in her arms. The smoke was so black that she couldn’t see, but she could hear neighbors wailing and crying nearby.“I just ran down the steps as much as I could but people was falling all over me, screaming,” Clayton recounted from a hospital where she was treated for smoke inhalation.In the commotion, her dog slipped from her grasp and was later found dead in the stairwell.About 200 firefighters responded to the building on East 181st Street around 11 a.m.Jose Henriquez, an immigrant from the Dominican Republic who lives on the 10th floor, said the building's fire alarms would frequently go off, but would turn out to be false.“It seems like today, they went off but the people didn’t pay attention,” Henriquez said in Spanish.He and his family stayed, wedging a wet towel beneath the door, once they realized the smoke in the halls would overpower them if they tried to flee.Luis Rosa said he also initially thought it was a false alarm. By the time he opened the door of his 13th-floor apartment, the smoke was so thick he couldn't see down the hallway. “So I said, OK, we can’t run down the stairs because if we run down the stairs, we’re going to end up suffocating.”“All we could do was wait,” he said.The children who died were 16 years old or younger, said Stefan Ringel, a senior adviser to they mayor. Adams said at a news conference that many residents were originally from the West African nation of Gambia. Many survivors were brought to temporary shelter in a nearby school.The drab, brown building looms over an intersection of smaller, aging brick buildings overlooking Webster Avenue, one of the Bronx’s main thoroughfares.By Sunday afternoon, all that remained visible of the unit where the fire started was a gaping black hole where the windows had been smashed.“There’s no guarantee that there’s a working fire alarm in every apartment, or in every common area," US Rep. Ritchie Torres, a Democrat who represents the area, told the AP. "Most of these buildings have no sprinkler system. And so the housing stock of the Bronx is much more susceptible to devastating fires than most of the housing stock in the city.”Nigro and Torres both compared the fire's severity to a 1990 blaze at the Happy Land social club where 87 people were killed when a man set fire to the building after getting into an argument with his former girlfriend and being thrown out of the Bronx club.Sunday's death toll was the highest for a fire in the city since the Happy Land fire, other than the Sept. 11 terror attacks. It was also the deadliest fire at a US residential apartment building in years. In 2017, 13 people died in an apartment building, also in the Bronx, according to data from the National Fire Protection Association.That fire started with a 3-year-old boy playing with stove burners and also spread because the door to an apartment that lacked a closing mechanism had been left open. It led to several changes in New York City, including having the fire department create a plan for educating children and parents on fire safety.Sunday’s fire happened just days after 12 people, including eight children, were killed in a house fire in Philadelphia. The deadliest fire prior to that was in 1989 when a Tennessee apartment building fire claimed the lives of 16 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/get-out-get-out-harrowing-tales-of-escape-after-fire-hits-building-in-nyc-101641786263569.html

10-01-2022||World||Myanmar's Suu Kyi to hear junta court's verdicts in delayed cases||A Myanmar junta court on Monday is expected to deliver verdicts on ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi in several delayed cases, the latest in a slew of judgements which could see her jailed for decades.The Nobel laureate has been detained since February 1 when her government was forced out in an early morning coup, ending Myanmar's short-lived experiment with democracy.The generals' power grab triggered widespread dissent, which security forces sought to quell with mass detentions and bloody crackdowns in which more than 1,400 civilians have been killed, according to a local monitoring group.Suu Kyi, 76, is facing a catalogue of accusations, and on Monday is set to hear the verdicts for allegedly importing and possessing walkies-talkies illegally, and for breaking coronavirus rules.The walkie-talkie charges stem from when soldiers raided her house on the day of the coup, allegedly discovering the contraband equipment.But under cross-examination in court hearings, members of the raiding party admitted they had not possessed a warrant for the raid, according to a source with knowledge of the matter.Verdicts for these cases have been repeatedly delayed.If found guilty on Monday, Suu Kyi faces a maximum of six years in prison.It will add to penalties the court gave her in December when she was jailed for four years for incitement and breaching Covid-19 rules while campaigning.Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing cut the sentence to two years and said she could serve her term under house arrest in the capital Naypyidaw.'Fear tactic'December's ruling drew international condemnation, and the Myanmar public reverted to old protesting tactics of banging pots and pans in a show of anger.Manny Maung, a Human Rights Watch researcher, said another conviction Monday would deepen nationwide discontent."The announcement of her last conviction resulted in one of the highest days of social media interactions from inside Myanmar, and deeply angered the public," she told AFP."The military is calculating this (the cases) as a fear tactic but it only serves to direct more anger from the public."Journalists have been barred from attending hearings, and Suu Kyi's lawyers have been muzzled from speaking to the media.Under a previous junta regime, Suu Kyi spent long spells of house arrest in her family mansion in Yangon, Myanmar's largest city.Today, she is confined to an undisclosed location in the capital, with her link to the outside world limited to brief pre-trial meetings with her lawyers.Besides Monday's cases, she is also facing multiple counts of corruption -- each of which is punishable by 15 years in jail -- and of violating the official secrets act.In November, she and 15 other officials, including Myanmar's president Win Myint, were also charged with alleged electoral fraud during the 2020 elections.Her National League for Democracy party had swept the polls in a landslide, trouncing a military-aligned party by a wider margin than the previous 2015 election.Since the coup, many of her political allies have been arrested, with one chief minister sentenced to 75 years in jail, while others are in hiding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmars-suu-kyi-to-hear-junta-court-s-verdicts-in-delayed-cases-101641781793927.html
10-01-2022||World||Ahead of talks with Russia, US rules out breakthrough, issues warning||WASHINGTON: As the United States and Russia prepare for crucial bilateral talks on Monday in Geneva, the first in a series of dialogues the two countries will have under different formats this week, Washington has reiterated its warning of “massive consequences” if Russia invades Ukraine, rejected Russian proposals about a change in the NATO’s engagement with allies and partners in eastern Europe, and lowered expectations by ruling out any breakthrough in talks. But the US has also emphasised the importance of diplomacy, opened the door for dialogue on reviving the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty that bans the deployment of medium-range nuclear missile in Europe and Russia, pointed out that Russian actions were leading to precisely the outcomes that Moscow sought to prevent, and expressed willingness to address Russia’s legitimate concerns on a reciprocal basis. On Monday, US deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman will meet her Russian counterpart, deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov, for bilateral talks under an extraordinary session of the Strategic Stability Dialogue in Geneva. On Wednesday, Brussels will host a NATO-Russia council meeting for the first time since 2019. And then, on Thursday, the 57-member Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) — of which both Russia and the US are members — will meet for a broader discussion on European security. These meetings between the US and Russia come in the wake of phone conversations between US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin in December meant to address the crisis in Ukraine. In television interviews on Sunday at home, when asked about consequences if Russia moved into Ukraine, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said, “We’ve been working in tremendous collaboration with European partners and allies and beyond to make it very clear that there will be massive consequences for Russia if it renews its aggression, by which I mean economic, financial and other consequences, as well as the NATO almost certainly having to reinforce its positions on its eastern flank near Russia, as well as continuing to provide defensive assistance to Ukraine.” While the US has ruled out any direct military involvement, Blinken said that these would include measures that had not been undertaken in the past. At the same time, Blinken kept the door open for dialogue and diplomacy. “I think there’s a way forward through dialogue, through diplomacy, to address whatever legitimate concerns Russia may have provided Russia also addresses our concerns,” he said. Also Read: Explained: How Kazakhstan protests started and the bigger pictureWhen asked to elaborate, the US secretary of state said, “Well, look, we’ve had in the past agreements that have addressed concerns on both sides, for example, the deployment of intermediate nuclear forces in Europe. There was a treaty... There may be grounds for renewing that. Similarly, there are agreements on the deployment of conventional forces in Europe on things like the scope and scale of exercises that, if adhered to reciprocally, that is, Russia makes good on its commitments which it’s repeatedly violated, then there are grounds for reducing tensions, creating greater transparency, creating greater confidence, all of which would address concerns that Russia purports to have.”Separately, on Saturday, a senior US administration official, while addressing possible overlapping areas, clarified what was not on the table, saying, “We have also seen reports of other things the US is open to discussing, like troop numbers or elements of force posture in NATO countries. I want to be clear that this is not on the table.” Observers believe that the fundamental gap between the two sides stems from Putin’s clear objective of seeking to restore a wider arc of influence over regions that were once a part of the Soviet Union — a proposition that the US and the NATO have categorically rejected.
10-01-2022||World||Covid-19: Chinese city tests 14 million people||Tianjin, a port city of 14 million near China’s capital Beijing, began mass testing on Sunday after a cluster of 20 adults and children tested positive for Covid-19 including at least two with the highly transmissible Omicron variant.Epidemiologists told state media that containing the Omicron variant in Tianjin, considered a “gateway” to Beijing will be the “first real” battle against the variant on the mainland.With less than a month left for the Winter Olympics, the discovery of a potential Omicron cluster near Beijing would have sent alarm bells ringing in the capital, some 130km away from Tianjin.The source of the cluster outbreak remains unknown and there’s a possibility of a spillover, they said.The Tianjin municipal government said the two cases were not linked with the imported Omicron case detected last December in the city. “Among the 20 infected people, 15 are children aged between 8 and 13. The cases are concentrated in Tianjin’s Jinnan and Nankai districts,” the tabloid, Global Times reported.The other infections are mainly students and their family members related to a daycare centre and a primary school. “The Tianjin outbreak poses risks to Beijing and the upcoming Winter Olympics, because of the large number of commuters working and living in the two cities,” the report said, citing an unnamed immunologist.Tianjin residents have been advised to remain home to be available for the mandatory nucleic acid testing.100k march in France against vaccine rulesA mandatory order would not be the most efficient way to encourage those not vaccinated against Covid-19 to get the shot and that plans to toughen health pass conditions were already yielding results, French government spokesman Gabriel Attal said on Sunday.People in France already have to show either proof of vaccination or a negative test to enter restaurants and bars and use inter-regional trains. But with Omicron infections surging, parliament is debating legislation that will drop the test option.More than 100,000 people across France protested on Saturday over what they say are government plans to further restrict the rights of the unvaccinated, days after French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to “piss off” those refusing the jab. Meanwhile, several thousand protesters marched in Brussels in Belgium on Sunday to oppose anti-coronavirus regulations, as European governments mull tighter rules in the face of the Omicron wave.Sigrid Kaag, who is set to become the first female finance minister of the Netherlands, said she has tested positive for the coronavirus, a day before the official swearing in ceremony on Monday.A Cypriot scientist defended his assertion that a new strain of Covid-19 exists that combines characteristics of the Delta and Omicron variants. Other scientists have speculated that Leonidos Kostrikis’ findings are a result of laboratory contamination. But he told Bloomberg in an emailed statement that the cases he has identified “indicate an evolutionary pressure to an ancestral strain to acquire these mutations and not a result of a single recombination event”.Australian state marks its highest death countAustralia’s most populous state, New South Wales, recorded its highest number of daily deaths on Saturday. The home to Sydney and a third of Australia’s 25mn people reported 16 deaths from the coronavirus in the previous day.UK minister supports reduced isolation periodReducing the self-isolation period for people who test positive from seven days to five would help British employers that have been hard hit by absences, education minister Nadhim Zahawi said on Sunday||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-chinese-city-tests-14-million-people-101641781070325.html

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director-general, said on January 7 that Omicron is hospitalising and killing people, just like previous variants.Also Read| Omicron mild or less severe? What latest observations experts have madeTwo more new variants - IHU and Deltacron - have emerged that have led to renewed concerns across the world. However, health experts have pointed out that both variants do not pose a threat at the moment.Here are the latest updates on Covid-19 from across the world:> Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said on Sunday that the country might see 2-4 million people getting infected in the ongoing Covid-19 wave as cases have nearly quadrupled over the past week compared to the previous one.> Another new variant of Covid-19 Deltacron has been detected in Cyprus. According to media reports, it has a similar genetic background to the Delta variant and some of the mutations from Omicron. However, experts have said that Deltacron is not something to be worried about at present.> In the United Kingdom, education minister Nadhim Zahawi has said that reducing the isolation period to five days from seven would be “helpful” for managing rising staff absences in schools and businesses. He is the first minister to request a cut in the isolation period.Also Read| Cyprus finds Covid-19 infections that combine Delta and Omicron> Scores of people in Belgium’s capital city Brussels protested against Covid-19 rules on Sunday. According to the police, as many as 5,000 protesters chanted “freedom, freedom!” and brandished banners denouncing what they called a “vaccine dictatorship”. No major incident of violence was reported but the police arrested over 40 protesters for carrying fireworks and projectiles.> Another European country, the Czech Republic, saw widespread protests against mandatory vaccination for citizens above 60 and over age group along with people employed in police, firefighting and medical services. In Prague, protesters questioned the effectiveness of current vaccines and rejected the administration of doses to children.> The Covid-19 task force in Nepal has announced a set of rules such as restrictions on gatherings, shutting down schools and making vaccination cards compulsory at public places to prevent the surge in cases.> The total number of Covid-19 cases in Africa have topped 10 million including 231,157 deaths, according to data released by the Africa Centres for Disease Control on Sunday. Daily cases have been surging in the continent due to Omicron and the overall vaccination rate is low due to poor access to doses and hesitancy among people to take the jab.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protests-against-curbs-new-variant-detected-latest-on-covid-across-the-world-101641775526064.html

A full day of talks was to follow Monday."I think that tomorrow we won't waste any time," Ryabkov said, adding that he "never loses optimism."The United States and Russia had set firm lines ahead of the high-stakes security talks on Ukraine, with Washington warning of the risk of confrontation and Moscow ruling out concessions.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Russia to steer away from aggression and choose the diplomatic path as the Kremlin, facing strong pressure to pull back troops from the Ukrainian border, demands wide-ranging new security arrangements with the West.For her part, during her initial talks with Ryabkov Sherman "stressed the United States' commitment to the international principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the freedom of sovereign nations to choose their own alliances," the State Department said in a statement.Ahead of the talks, Ryabkov told Russian news agencies that Moscow was "disappointed" with signals coming from Washington and from Brussels, where NATO and the European Union are based.The talks with the United States kick off a week of diplomacy during which Russian officials will meet representatives of NATO and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), as Washington tries to assure European allies they will not be sidelined."There's a path of dialogue and diplomacy to try to resolve some of these differences," Blinken told US news channel CNN on Sunday."The other path is confrontation and massive consequences for Russia if it renews its aggression on Ukraine. We are about to test the proposition about which path President (Vladimir) Putin is prepared to take."'Gun to Ukraine's head'Since late last year, Putin has amassed tens of thousands of troops at the Ukrainian border and demanded guarantees that NATO will not expand further eastward.The Kremlin is insisting NATO must never grant membership to ex-Soviet Ukraine, which is pushing to join.The United States says many of Moscow's proposals are non-starters.Blinken warned that any positive outcome from the talks would rely in part on Russia's willingness to stand down from its aggressive posture, which he likened to "an atmosphere of escalation with a gun to Ukraine's head"."If we're actually going to make progress, we're going to have to see de-escalation," US President Joe Biden's top diplomat said.Russia could otherwise face severe economic and financial consequences, "as well as NATO almost certainly having to reinforce its position near Russia as well as continuing to provide assistance to Ukraine", he told ABC television on Sunday.Putin met Biden in Geneva in June and agreed on regular "stability" talks between Sherman and Ryabkov. Previous rounds were held in the Swiss city in July and September.'Massive' retaliationIn two phone calls to Putin, Biden has warned of severe consequences if Russia invades Ukraine.Measures under consideration include sanctions on Putin's inner circle, cancelling Russia's controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany or, in the most drastic scenario, severing Russia's links to the world's banking system.Russia insists it was deceived after the Cold War and understood that NATO would not expand eastward.Instead, the US-led alliance welcomed most of the former Warsaw Pact countries and the three Baltic nations that were under Soviet rule.On Sunday in an interview for Russian news agency TASS in Geneva, Ryabkov accused NATO of trying for decades to "push back" Russia."So NATO should pack up and return to the borders of 1997," Ryabkov said.Russia has put intense pressure on Ukraine since 2014 after a revolution overthrew a government that had sided with the Kremlin against moving closer to Europe.Russia seized the Crimean peninsula and backs an insurgency in eastern Ukraine in which more than 13,000 people have died."It is very likely that we will encounter the reticence of our US and NATO colleagues to really perceive what we need," Ryabkov said Sunday.In spite "of the threats that are constantly formulated against us... we will make no concession," he said, adding it would "amount to acting against the interests of our security".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-russia-kick-off-difficult-talks-on-ukraine-101641772401941.html
10-01-2022||World||19 dead, including at least 9 children, after fire breaks out in NYC apartment||At least 19 people died and dozens were injured when a fire tore through a high-rise apartment building in New York City on Sunday, its mayor said, in one of America's worst residential fires in recent memory.Both the New York Times and CNN sourced unnamed officials as saying that nine children were among the dead."We know that we have 19 people who are confirmed dead, as well as several others in critical condition," Mayor Eric Adams told CNN, adding that 63 people had been wounded."This is going to be one of the worst fires in our history," he said.At least 200 firefighters responded to the blaze, which broke out mid-morning on the second and third floors of a 19-story building on East 181st Street, several blocks west of the Bronx Zoo.Neighbors spoke of seeing residents desperately waving from floors, apparently trapped and unable to escape."It was chaos," George King, who lives directly adjacent the building told AFP."I've been here 15 years and it's the first time I've seen something like this."I saw the smoke, a lot of people were panicking. You could see that no one wanted to jump from the building. People were waving from the windows," he added.The cause of the fire was not immediately clear.The injured were taken to five hospitals; many suffered from cardiac and respiratory arrest, the New York Times reported.The blaze comes just four days after a fire in Philadelphia killed 12 people, including eight children, in a three-story public housing building.In New York, there were fears of a growing toll."The last time we had a loss of life that may be this horrific was a fire which was over 30 years ago, also here in the Bronx," said Fire Marshal Dan Nigro, quoted by NBC News.Flames quickly engulfed much of the structure, and Nigro said the smoke was so dense as to be "unprecedented."Photographs and video posted on social media showed flames and thick black smoke billowing out of a third-story window of the brick building as firefighters operated on a nearby ladder."This is truly a tragedy," said Adams, adding that many residents had been displaced."This is really a horrific day for us," he said.In December 2017, 13 people were killed in a blaze in an apartment building in the Bronx in New York City's deadliest fire in 25 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/19-dead-including-at-least-9-children-after-fire-breaks-out-in-nyc-apartment-101641762915182.html
10-01-2022||India||Decoding the multilayered Amazon-Future-Reliance legal drama||New Delhi: US-e-commerce giant Amazon and India’s Reliance Industries have been locked in a fierce battle for the future -- almost literally. At stake is control over India’s retail business estimated to reach $ 1.3 trillion by 2025 , setting off a spate of legal wrangles between Amazon and the Future Group. The see-saw legal battle between Amazon and Future have witnessed several challenges and decisions by judicial and quasi-judicial authorities in India since 2019. What is at stake?Future Retail has 1,800 retail stores across 400-plus cities and towns across India. Amazon, which intended to deliver products in select cities within two hours of a customer ordering them, looked at Future’s stores as intrinsic to its plan. Any alliance between Future and Amazon would have given the latter a massive advantage in consumer experience. Similarly, for Reliance, a deal with Future Retail would have established it firmly as India’s largest retailer with a presence in smaller cities and towns almost overnight, also helping the Mukesh Ambani-led company in last-mile access for its eCommerce delivery to small towns. The deal with Future Retail would have also given Reliance the leadership position in the online and offline retail segments How did the tussle begin?Kisore Biyani, who emerged as an uncrowned king of retail after setting up India’s first hypermarket retail store chain, Big Bazaar, in 2001, was under huge economic stress by 2019. Debts were piling up for the Future Group and it was at ₹12,778 crore in 2019. India’s leading credit rating agency ICRA also placed a negative rating on the Future Group. Pushed against the wall, Biyani inked a deal with Amazon to sell 49% of its unlisted entity, Future Coupons, for more than ₹1,500 crore. The long-term business agreements handed to Amazon the right to buy into flagship Future Retail after a period between three and 10 years, by exercising a “call” option. This stipulation authorised Amazon to exercise the option of acquiring all or part of Future Coupon’s stake in Future Retail within 3-10 years of the agreement. Such options are typically in a regulatory grey area -- allowing foreign entities the opportunity to hold stakes in sectors in which they wouldn’t normally be allowed to under the rules. For instance, in this case, foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail is barred. The deal also provided Amazon the Right to First Refusal, and a non-compete clause — barring Future’s dealings with potential competitors of Amazon, which included Reliance, Walmart, Google, SoftBank, Alibaba, Naspers, eBay, Target, Paytm, Zomato, Swiggy, among others. It also prohibited Future from selling a stake to anyone engaged in online or offline retail in food, non-food and retail. In November 2019, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) also approved Amazon’s proposed acquisition.The Covid-induced lockdown in 2020 worsened Future’s position in the market and by April 2020, Future Retail’s sales declined by about 75% from normal levels, adding enormous pressure on working capital flows.With the outlook looking grim for Biyani , Reliance entered the fray in May-June 2020 and positioned itself as a serious suitor for Future Retail. Biyani entered a deal with Reliance Retail, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries, in August 2020. The new ₹24,713 crore deal envisaged Future selling its retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing units to Reliance. The acquisition covered Future Retail, Future Lifestyle and Future Consumer. Biyani retained manufacturing and distribution of consumer and fashion products, Future Group’s partnership in insurance with Generali and its textile partnership with NTC.Amazon fires first salvo Aggrieved by the Future-Reliance deal (which effectively ended its hopes of having any stake in Future Retail), Amazon approached the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) in October 2020 filing an emergency arbitration case. Alleging violation of a non-compete clause and a right-of-first-refusal pact it had signed with the Future Group, Amazon asked SIAC to restrain Future Group from selling its assets to Reliance. SIAC, in its order on October 25, 2020, found favour with Amazon’s plea for the interim relief and issued a restraining order against Future, putting the Future-Reliance deal on hold. SIAC held that the deal could not go through until it finally decides the matter. Armed with the SIAC ruling, Amazon wasted no time in writing to Sebi, CCI and stock exchanges against the Future-Reliance deal, which was awaiting Sebi’s approval . The Delhi high courtFuture Group went to the Delhi high court against Amazon, imploring the court to restrain the US-based e-commerce major from writing to Sebi, CCI, and other regulators about SIAC’s order. Future contended this amounted to interfering with its agreement with Reliance. While the arguments before the single-judge bench of the Delhi high court proceeded, CCI approved Reliance Retail’s deal with Future on November 20, 2020 despite Amazon’s protest.A single-judge bench, in December 2020, declined to grant Future Retail’s plea to restrain Amazon from writing to the statutory authorities and regulators about the arbitral award. However, the judge made some prima facie observations -- that the August 2020 board resolution of Future Retail, approving the deal with Reliance was not invalid or void as claimed by Amazon, and that Amazon’s representations to statutory authorities and regulators was “based on incorrect assertions”.These observations by the single judge led to Amazon moving the division bench in the Delhi HC in January 2021, demanding reversal of the order. Meanwhile, on January 20, 2021, Sebi also cleared the Reliance-Future Retail deal, prompting Amazon to move the high court for enforcement of the SIAC ruling. This petition also asked for detention of Kishore Biyani and other directors of Future Group, besides attachment of their assets.Future Group defended its position by that Amazon’s deal was not with Future Retail but with Future Coupons, and that therefore, Future Retail was not bound by the arbitration. Second, that India’s Arbitration Act did not recognise the mechanism of emergency arbitration awards.In the meantime, the Future-Reliance deal received conditional approval from Sebi and the stock exchanges. Following approval from CCI and no objection from Sebi, Future approached NCLT, Mumbai, on January 26, 2021 seeking the tribunal’s approval to hold its shareholders meeting on the scheme of amalgamation with Reliance. On February 2, 2021, the high court affirmed the validity of the SIAC’s emergency award and ordered status quo, throwing g a spanner in the Future-Reliance deal. Future challenged this order before a division bench of the high court the very next day. On February 9, 2021, the division bench stayed the single-judge order, giving a go ahead to the Future-Reliance deal. The division bench held that Future Retail had no agreement with Amazon and therefore, the latter had “prima facie” no reason to stall the deal. It added different agreements have been signed between the three disputing entities — FRL, Amazon and Future Coupons Private Limited (FCPL) and hence, the doctrine of “group of companies” cannot be invoked.The Supreme Court Amazon moved the top court against the order of the HC division bench, questioning the maintainability of Future’s petition before the Delhi high court. Asserting that SIAC’s Emergency Arbitrator (EA) order was an enforceable and valid order, its petition also termed the HC division bench order of revoking the single judge’s decision of February 2 on blocking the deal “illegal and arbitrary”. Admitting Amazon’s appeal, the Supreme Court on February 22, 2021, restrained NCLT from finally approving any amalgamation scheme (with Reliance) proposed by Future as it set about to examine the validity of the SIAC’s emergency order. Meanwhile, the single-judge of Delhi HC, which had in February passed a short interim order, delivered a detailed order on March 18, not only upholding SIAC’s order but also directing for attachment of properties of Biyani and other director of the Future Group. The single-judge bench also issued show-cause notice to Biyani and other directors as to why they should not be sent to prison, as sought by Amazon in its enforcement application.This order was taken to a division bench in HC by Future, which managed to secure a stay from the larger bench yet again. Amazon subsequently took this stay order to the Supreme Court, which asked all other courts to hold their hand until it delivered a final ruling of the SIAC’s interim order on stopping Future’s deal with Reliance. On August 6, 2021, the SC bench, headed by justice Rohinton F Nariman, ruled that the Future Group is bound by the SIAC’s emergency award and that it was enforceable under the Indian arbitration law. It further held that the appeals filed by Future against a single-judge bench before the division bench of the Delhi HC. Future then challenged the March 18 order of the single judge afresh, in the apex court. Meanwhile, the single judge in Delhi high court took up enforcement proceedings on August 17 and gave Future four weeks to obtain a stay order from the Supreme Court, failing which, it said, the coercive order on attachment of properties of the Biyanis shall revive.On September 9, 2021, the Supreme Court took up Future’s appeal against the single judge order and restrained the Delhi high court from passing any adverse directive against Future’s deal with Reliance or on attaching the assets of Future’s chairman and directors.While staying the enforcement proceedings before the high court, a bench, headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, also directed that no statutory authority in the country should give its final approval to any scheme facilitating the Future-Reliance deal for the next four weeks. The bench noted that the interim order was being passed with the consent of both Future and Amazon to strike a balance between their competing interests. Fixing the case for the next hearing after four weeks, the top court also took note that Future’s plea was also pending before SIAC for vacating its interim stay. Another setback for Future at SIAC:The application by Future to lift the interim stay on its ₹24,713-crore deal with Reliance was rejected by SIAC on October 21, 2021. Significantly, SIAC further held that Future Retail was also a party to the ongoing arbitration between Amazon and Future Coupons in the dispute over the sale of its assets to Reliance Retail. Future Retail contended that it should be excluded from arbitration proceedings because it is not a party to the dispute between its promoter Future Coupons Pvt Ltd and Amazon. The tribunal declared that orders set out in the EA Award were correctly granted and that Future has not demonstrated that circumstances have materially changed to justify any change to the EA Award. After the dismissal of Future’s application, SIAC set down the arbitration case for a detailed hearing and final judgment.Back to courts: Future Retail moved the Delhi high court yet again seeking a stay on SIAC’s adverse order as well as for a nod to proceed with shareholders’ and creditors meeting for its proposed asset sale to Reliance. The high court on October 29 issued notice on Future’s petition fixing the case for a hearing on a later date but declined to stay SIAC’s interim order in the meantime or pass any other interim order. After the high court’s refusal to stay SIAC’s order, Future moved the Supreme Court on November 8, 2021, seeking permission for a meeting of its shareholders and creditors. The appeal contended that SIAC’s order would lead to grave and irreparable harm if Future was not able to proceed with the disputed transaction. Amazon, too, filed a fresh application in the top court for restraining all authorities, including NCLT, from allowing any measure that may facilitate the Future-Reliance deal till the matter is finally decided by the top court. On November 11, 2021, the Supreme Court took up Future’s fresh petition along with Amazon’s plea, and suggested all parties hold their hand until the final determination of the dispute by the court in the second round.The latest twist: Matters took a surprising twist on December 17 when CCI, India’s anti-trust regulator, suspended its nod to Amazon’s 2019 investment in Future Coupons, potentially denting the e-commerce giant’s attempts to block the sale of Future Retail to Reliance. Entertaining a plea by the Future Group, CCI held that Amazon had misled the commission to believe, through false statements and material omissions, that the combination and its purpose were the interest of Amazon in the business of Future Coupons. CCI found that Amazon had not disclosed details of the shareholder agreement at the time of acquisition and its purpose was to acquire strategic rights over Future Retail and to have a “foot in the door” in Indian retail. CCI put its prior approval to the combination in abeyance, giving Amazon 60 days to give notice for the combination, post which the Commission would “examine the combination afresh.” Amazon was also imposed a penalty of ₹200 crore for suppressing material facts at the time of seeking CCI’s nod. CCI’s order came as a shot in the arm for Future, which went to SIAC’s Delhi seated tribunal, asking for termination of the arbitration proceedings on the ground that the very foundation of Amazon’s case was removed after suspension of the approval by the anti-trust regulator. SIAC, however, decided to go ahead with hearing the main arbitration case, whose itinerary had already been fixed. It said that the new application by Future would be heard after the arguments in the main case. This prompted Future to move the Delhi high court, seeking a stay of the arguments in the main arbitration case before SIAC until its application on terminating the arbitration altogether was not decided. While a single-judge bench of HC on January 4 declined to suspend the ongoing arbitration proceedings, a division bench of the HC stayed till February 1 the proceedings before SIAC by an interim order on January 5. Meanwhile, Amazon on January 8 filed an appeal before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal against the CCI order suspending an approval to its 2019 deal with Future. NCLAT is expected to hear Amazon’s appeal later this week.And so, with a spectrum of proceedings still pending before the Supreme Court, Delhi high court, NCLT, NCLAT, CCI and SIAC, the battle between Reliance and Amazon rages on.
10-01-2022||India||PM security breach: Lawyers say getting calls to stop SC probe||Some Supreme Court lawyers received an anonymous, pre-recorded call from a group claiming responsibility for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s security breach at Punjab and warning of dire consequences should the apex court take up the case. The call was received my some of the lawyers in the morning, at around 10.40 am, the same time when the court was hearing a public interest litigation on the matter, and decided to set up a committee to look into the breach. After several lawyers complained of receiving the call ,not once but twice during the day, the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association (SCAORA) wrote to Supreme Court Secretary-General Virender Kumar Bansal seeking appropriate action as this was a breach of privacy with some of the lawyers who received the call suspecting that their mobile phones containing sensitive data could have possibly been hacked. One of the lawyers addressed a complaint to the Delhi Police Commissioner of Police to initiate a probe against the person behind the calls and referred a copy of the complaint to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) as well.SCAORA in its letter said, “Several members of SCAORA received an anonymous, automated pre-recorded call from number +447418365564, once at approximately 10.40 am and another call at 12.36 pm on January 10 fastening responsibility for Prime Minister Modi’s security breach during his visit to Punjab on January 5 on Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) from US, wherein it was stated that SFJ is responsible for blocking PM Modi’s cavalcade at Hussainwala flyover in Punjab.”The Sikhs for Justice is a banned separatist group based in the US which seeks secession of Punjab from India. Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, an attorney at law in the US is considered to be the face of SFJ.The timing of the call corresponded to the moment when the Court was hearing the PIL filed by NGO Lawyers Voice demanding steps to avert similar security breaches in the future. It also sought action against those responsible for the situation when PM Modi’s cavalcade was left stranded on the flyover for about 20 minutes.The letter went on to state that “the caller further warned the Supreme Court judges to refrain from hearing the PIL filed by NGO Lawyers Voice seeking probe into the security breach on the ground that the SC has not been able to punish the culprits of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.”SCAORA President and senior advocate Shivaji Jadhav said, “Our demand is that the person responsible for these calls be identified and appropriate action be taken against such person. There is a genuine concern among the advocates-on record (AoR) in the Supreme Court that the sensitive data on their mobiles could be hacked. We are also worried about the privacy of our members and any enquiry or investigation from the top court will be welcome.”Advocate Nishant Katneshwarkar was one among many lawyers in the top court who received the calls. He said, “I got a call from +447418365564 and the display screen showed the call to be from United Kingdom. It was a recorded message, which was repeated a little after 12.30 pm.” He confirmed that the content of the call was the same as indicated in the SCAORA letter.Another lawyer Deepak Prakash practicing in the Supreme Court reported the incident to the Delhi Police in a written complaint addressed to Commissioner of Police Rakesh Asthana. “The said callers have claimed themselves to be a group from the United Kingdom and are calling from untraceable numbers +447418365564 which are registered under the name of “Likely Sales”. The said callers have categorically stated as follows “What did the SC do for the 1984 riots...nothing”.”Terming it to be a “serious criminal act” committed by an anti-national group, Prakash stated in his complaint, “The said calls are terrifying and have created fear in the AoR fraternity, who have been warned of dire consequences by the said group. Strict action must be taken immediately, failing which might lead to threat to the majestic powers of the Supreme Court and huge outbreak of riots, compromising on the national security and interest of the nation.”SCAORA also requested the SC Secretary General to take immediate action as the incident amounted to violation of privacy of the AoRs . “Their (lawyers’) registered mobile numbers are out in public domain and have been compromised as all confidential data and sensitive information pertaining to cases before the Supreme Court and banking details are stored on their mobile phones and the miscreants may misuse the sensitive data, if the mobile phones are hacked,” its letter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-security-breach-lawyers-say-getting-calls-to-stop-sc-probe-101641839251596.html

10-01-2022||India||Odisha orders 500,000 Omicron test kits, says it’s the 1st state to place order||BHUBANESWAR: The Odisha government has placed an order to procure 5 lakh Omicron testing kits, OmiSure, as the Covid-19 variant tally in the state crossed 100-mark with 28 more fresh cases reported in the state. Girish Krishnamurthy, CEO and managing director of Tata Medical and Diagnostics Ltd. on Monday said Odisha is the first state in the country to order the Omicron test kits. As OmiSure specifically identifies Omicron without the need for sequencing, it will help the government to combat the spread of the new variant of concern in the state, he said. OmiSure is the only test kit approved by the ICMR for RT-PCR detection of the Omicron variant. It targets 3 genes with a single tube, fully multiplexed assay in a unique design that identifies simultaneous S-gene Target Failure and S-Gene Mutation Amplification. The state government’s order for a large number of Omicron testing kits came as director of health services Bijoy Mohapatra said Odisha may witness the peak in Covid-19 cases by the end of January. Mohapatra said that a high number of Covid-19 cases have been recorded in four to five districts of Odisha while there is the presence of Omicron in all districts. As Delhi and Maharashtra are likely to witness a peak by January 15, Odisha may witness a peak after 10 to 15 days, he said. On Monday Odisha had reported 4,829 new infections in the last 24 hours, its single day high in last 7 months. Meanwhile, the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation warned that a fine of ₹500 will be imposed on people violating Covid-19 guidelines. “Cases of Omicron variant of the virus are rising. People need to be more careful. Violation of Covid-19 guidelines will attract a penalty of ₹500,” the BMC said in its notification on a day Bhubaneswar reported 619 cases. The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation said all markets in the city will be to decentralised and vendors will be asked to sell at designated places with social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-becomes-first-state-to-order-omicron-testing-kit-omisure-101641838532624.html
10-01-2022||India||Piyush Goyal to raise large trade deficit, market access with South Korea||NEW DELHI: Commerce minister Piyush Goyal and South Korean trade minister Han-koo Yeo are expected to focus on updating a bilateral trade pact during their meeting on Tuesday as part of efforts to address a trade deficit and market access issues.The Indian side has been pushing for a review of the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) finalised in 2009 to bridge its high trade deficit with South Korea. Goyal raised similar issues with his South Korean counterpart during their last meeting in October. “The discussion will focus on addressing the large trade deficit, market access issues and non-tariff barriers faced by Indian exporters,” a commerce ministry statement said ahead of Tuesday’s meeting. The discussions will also focus on investment-related issues, it said. The meeting is expected to boost India-South Korea trade relations in an “equitable and balanced manner to the mutual advantage of both countries”, it added. The meeting is expected to pave the way for the review of the CEPA, an official said, requesting anonymity. South Korea is an important trade partner for India and the two sides signed the CEPA in Seoul on August 7, 2009. The pact was operationalised from January 1, 2010. The trade deal committed the two sides to lowering or eliminating import tariffs on a wide range of goods over a period of eight years, and it helped expand opportunities for investments and trade in goods and services. South Korea was to phase out or reduce tariffs on 90% of Indian exports while India was to phase out or cut tariffs on 85% of South Korean exports, the official said. The CEPA helped enhance trade and economic ties between India and South Korea, with annual bilateral trade reaching $21.5 billion in 2018, and crossing the $20-billion mark for the first time, according to official data. However, bilateral trade slipped due to the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020. Trade between the two countries was worth $16.9 billion during January-December 2020. South Korea’s total foreign direct investment to India up to September 2020 was about $6.94 billion. It is one of the key investors in India and several Korean companies have participated in the “Make in India” initiative that includes a production linked incentive (PLI) scheme, the official said. There are still potential areas for enhanced cooperation, such as manufacturing, food processing, electronics, biotechnology and research and development, he added. The South Korean side has also pointed to difficulties faced by its firms in entering India following a decision by many companies to shift from China in recent years. Despite these problems, 66 South Korean firms entered India amid the pandemic, taking the total number of companies with a presence in the country to more than 800.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/piyush-goyal-to-raise-large-trade-deficit-market-access-with-south-korea-101641837871111.html
10-01-2022||India||Making sense of the advance GDP estimates||The National Statistical Office (NSO) released the first advance estimates of GDP for 2021-22 on January 7 and put the number at 9.2%. This is 30 basis points – one basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point – lower than the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) December 2021 projection of 9.5%. Beyond the headline number what do the latest GDP estimates mean for the economy at large? Here are three charts which put this in perspective.The consumption challengePrivate consumption accounts for more than half of India’s GDP. It is here that economic recovery faces its biggest challenge. While overall GDP is expected to be slightly higher than the pre-pandemic level (2019-20) in 2021-22, Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) will continue to remain below the 2019-20 level. What has been the trajectory of PFCE in the post-pandemic period?A review of half-yearly and quarterly GDP aggregates – quarterly GDP numbers are available till September 2021 and we can estimate GDP in the second half of 2021-22 from the first advance estimates – can provide an answer.Overall GDP came back above pre-pandemic levels in the second half of the last fiscal (October 2020-March 2021). However, PFCE did not share this recovery and was 0.1% less than the pre-pandemic PFCE level in the corresponding period. To be sure, PFCE did go above pre-pandemic level in the quarter ending March 2021. However, this was more a result of pre-pandemic PFCE level being lower because of pandemic-related worries – PFCE annual growth in March 2020 was just 2%, the lowest since June 2012 – than a sharp rise in consumption demand in the March 2021 quarter.The second wave of Covid-19 – it peaked on May 9 in terms of seven-day average of daily new cases – inflicted a major shock to PFCE once again, which contracted by 11.9% below pre-pandemic levels in the quarter ending June 2021. This disruption percolated into the second quarter of 2021-22 as well, with PFCE showing a deficit of 3.5% vis-à-vis pre-pandemic levels in the quarter ending September 2021. The latest advance estimates show that PFCE will cross pre-pandemic levels on a half-yearly basis for the first time in the second half of 2021-22. While the advance estimates project a 1.7% growth over pre-pandemic levels in the second half of 2021-22, the impact of the third wave might generate headwinds for these prospects.If some private sector estimates are to be believed, economic activity was losing momentum even before the third wave erupted. “While the economic impact of the Omicron wave in 4QFY22 could be lower than previous waves, the activity momentum in 3QFY22 was much lower than our expectation. This has led us to revise downwards our FY22E real GDP forecast by 80bps to 9.0%YY, largely due to weaker 3Q activity”, a research note by Samiran Chakraborty Chief Economist India at Citi Research said.Employment-intensive services continue to sufferIf one looks at the Gross Value Added (GVA) statistics in the latest advance estimates, only one sub-sector of the services sector is expected to remain below pre-pandemic levels. This is the trade, hotel, transport, storage and communication subsector of the economy where the GVA component in 2021-22 is expected to remain 8.5% below the pre-pandemic level. This subset of the service sector not being able to regain pre-pandemic levels could have played a major role in the lag in private consumption demand. This particular sector had a share of 18.5% in total employment in 2018-19, the largest among major subsectors outside agriculture, as per data from the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS). The performance of this important subsector could actually end up being worse than what the advance estimates project because of disruption from the third wave of Covid-19. “The adverse growth impact of the third wave should be more muted than previous waves, but services will still take a larger hit”, a Nomura Research note issued on January 10 said.Surge in nominal growth: positive fiscal shock but adverse terms of trade shock to farm incomesAmong the most important takeaways of the latest GDP numbers is the fact that at 17.6%, nominal GDP growth is going to significantly exceed the budgetary projection of 14.4%. Coming weeks before the Budget, this is good news on the fiscal front as a higher than expected nominal GDP also means higher than expected tax collections. Nominal GDP exceeding the budgetary projection will be a first under the current government, as was pointed out in an HT analysis in December 2021.While inflation-driven higher nominal GDP growth is good news for fiscal math, it is bad news for the purchasing power of those dependent on farm incomes. This is because the current surge in inflation is mainly driven by non-food items. The divergence in inflation in food and non-food items is evident in the GVA numbers as well. While nominal growth component (nominal minus real GVA growth) for agricultural and non-agricultural GVA was 2.9 and 2.8 percentage points respectively in 2020-21, this difference has increased to 5.2 and 10 percentage points for 2021-22. The sharp rise in nominal growth differential between agricultural and non-agricultural economy also means that the former will find it difficult to afford the same basket of the latter’s commodities for the same amount of real output. This means that rural tailwinds to the larger economy are likely to weaken going forward.
10-01-2022||India||HT This Day: Jan 11, 1951 – Zamindari Abolition Bill Passed||LUCKNOW- At 5 p.m. today the U.P. Assembly passed the Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Bill after struggling with it for two years, six months and four days. Cries of 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ and 'Kisan Mazdoor Raj Ki Jai' rang out from the Congress benches but the zamindar members, as was not unexpected, staged a walk-out as a protest against the passage of the Bill after Nawab Jamshed Ali Khan, their leader, had made a brief statement with the special permission of the Chair. Thirteen members belonging to all sections participated in today's final debate in this House on the Bill. Pandit Pant, who preceded the Revenue Minister Thakur Hukam Singh, proudly declared that this measure ensuring justice to all classes of people in the State was superior to the agrarian legislation in even Communist countries. He was obviously replying to the Socialist firebrand, Mr Raja Ram Shastri, who during an impassioned oratorical feat had declared that the Bill would not achieve its proclaimed object of zamindari abolition but would only consolidate feudalism and stem the kisan revolution. Mr Shastri had also said that the kisans would soon be disillusioned and would rise and really end zamindari. Pandit Pant in his speech revealed that compensation to the zamindars might be paid only in the shape of bonds "considering present-day conditions." The Bill, it may be mentioned, states that compensation will be paid in cash or bonds or partly in cash and party in bonds as may be prescribed. He said the Government's desire was to enforce the measure on Republic Day but it depended on the President whose assent to the measure had to be secured. The Centre was being posted with copies of the Bill from time to time and the Government hoped for the President's assent before January 26. PAYMENT OF COMPENSATION Here are the other points which the Chief Minister made: " The Socialists are against compensation and the collection of 10 times the rent from the kisans for conferring on them bhumidhari rights. When the zamindari abolition resolution was passed by this House on August 8, 1946 nobody voiced against compensation. So compensation has to be given. Who will pay? Not the big zamindars who are losing their land. Not the townfolk who are not in the picture. Only the kisans whose rents will be halved after acquiring bhumidhari rights and who get the rights over the land have to pay. And nowhere has it been stated that the kisans must pay. If they pay their rents will be halved. If they do not they will continue to pay the same rent and will not be evicted from their lands though they will not enjoy the transfer rights. The landless labour will become the common owner of the uncultivated land in the village. I challenge anyone to produce a better Bill conferring better rights on the kisans. SYMPATHY WITH ZAMINDARS "My sympathies are with the zamindars who will be deprived of their standard of living they had been enjoying. But they should realize that people sacrifice their lives for the nation. For their material losses the Zamindars will gain in spiritual stature.  I appeal to them not to do anything which would leave a bad taste in the mouth. I pray that with the help of all the measure will be successfully enforced soon and the people of the State live a life of affectionate brotherhood and with peace and plenty for all." Other speakers from the Congress benches were Mr Jagannath Prasad Agarwal, Prof. Krishen Chand and Mr R. N. Upadhyaya. The Revenue Minister who spoke for hardly five minutes (he began his speech at 4-55 p.m. and had to end it at the 5 p.m. deadline) thanked all for their help to him in getting through this gargantuan piece of legislation. Because he had forgotten to include the Press in the list of officials and non-officials and colleagues who had been with him at the job, he specially called them, regretted the omission and expressed his gratitude to them for all they had done during the past two and a half years. P.T.I. adds: The Bill will now go for the second time to the Upper House for the consideration of one amendment made in the Assembly. After the Bill is passed by the Upper House on January 15, it will be sent to the President for his assent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-this-day-jan-11-1951-zamindari-abolition-bill-passed-101641837182032.html
10-01-2022||India||Nagaland civilian killings: SIT submits preliminary report to state govt||The Nagaland government’s special investigation team (SIT) to probe the December 4 Oting killings has submitted a “preliminary report” to the state government on January 8, a police officer said on Monday, a day when hundreds joined a two-day 70-km walk seeking repeal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act. “We have submitted a preliminary report because investigation is still going on, but we are trying to expedite the process,” a member of the Special Investigation Team investigating killing of 13 civilians in Oting village of Mon district said, asking not to be named. This person added that the final report should be ready soon.HT learns that at least 50 people including local eye-witnesses and security personnel were examined. Although the SIT was given a month’s time to complete its investigation, people who are aware of the matter said expert reports from the ballistics and laboratories are still awaited and therefore, the probe team submitted a preliminary report. The person cited above refused to divulge findings of the preliminary report , and declined comment on whether SIT has indicted army personnel for killing villagers.On December 4, six villagers were killed by the army in an ambush that went wrong and targeted the wrong people (it was based on intelligence that spoke of insurgents taking the same route); soon after the villages (miners returning from work) were killed, other villagers surrounded the security personnel and torched their vehicle, resulting in the latter opening fire, killing seven more. A 14th person was killed in an attack on an army camp the following day. The Union government has said the army mistook the miners for insurgents; the army has expressed regret for the incident and launched its own inquiry. . Meanwhile, residents started a 70-km walk on Monday from Dimapur, the state’s commercial hub, to the state capital Kohima seeking repeal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act 1958 (AFSPA). Demand for repeal of AFSPA, which gives sweeping powers to the security forces, a long-standing demand in the northeastern state has grown since the incident at Oting. “We cannot allow AFSPA to continue to be enforced in Nagaland. Oting massacre will not be the last unless AFSPA is removed in toto,” said Kevitho Kera, one of the organizers of the march. The walk, which started from Dimapur on Monday morning and will end with submission of a memorandum to the Governor seeking repeal of the Act. “We remember the victims of Oting as we walk… And also all the victims of other past atrocities,” Kera said.On the constitution of a high-level committee by the Centre to examine the withdrawal of the AFSPA from Nagaland on December 26, he said, “We cannot keep on waiting for these reviews. A government which truly cares for its citizens have ways to immediately get it (AFSPA) repealed.” The high-level committee is expected to submit its recommendations within 45 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagaland-civilian-killings-sit-submits-preliminary-report-to-state-govt-101641837032409.html
10-01-2022||India||Trials of Rafale fighter jet’s naval version kick off in Goa||The French-origin Rafale-M fighter jet on Monday kicked off a demonstration to showcase its capability to take off from an angled ski-jump and prove its compatibility with Indian Navy’s aircraft carriers at a shore-based test facility (SBTF) at INS Hansa, the naval air station in Goa, officials familiar with the matter said.These fighters are embarked on the French Navy’s nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle. The Rafale-M is a variant of Rafale fighters that operate from land bases. The Indian Air Force has also ordered 36 Rafale-B and Rafale-C fighter jets. SBTF is essentially an aircraft carrier setting on the ground where fighters use the ski-jump to takeoff and are recovered by arrestor wires or STOBAR (short takeoff but arrested recovery) in navy parlance.The navy is looking at buying more deck-based fighter jets to operate from its sole aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya and the Indigenous Aircraft Carrier (IAC) Vikrant, which is currently undergoing sea trials. The Rafale-M demonstration of capability is expected to be carried out over the next two weeks and will be followed by a similar demonstration by the US-origin F-18 fighters in the next three to four months, the officials said.The F-18s operate from American supercarriers such as USS Nimitz and USS Ronald Reagan, with the US Navy accounting for a fleet of more than 600 such fighters.India has a requirement for 57 deck-based fighters for its carrier operations. But the figure is being revised, the officials said. A prototype of the naval version of the light combat aircraft landed and took off from INS Vikramaditya in January 2020 in a significant step towards India developing its own deck-based fighters. But the fate of that project is unclear.The Indian Navy currently operates Russian-origin MiG-29K fighters from INS Vikramaditya, a second-hand carrier bought from Russia.Aircraft carrier Vikrant, the largest warship to be built in the country, on Sunday set sail for crucial sea trials ahead of its scheduled induction into the navy later this year.Vikrant has put India in a select league -- only the US, the UK, Russia, France and China have the capability to build aircraft carriers.China operates two aircraft carriers — CV-16 Liaoning and CV-17 Shandong. It is building a third carrier as it expands its footprint in the Indian Ocean Region.Vikrant has an indigenous content of 76%. It will be the fourth aircraft carrier to be operated by the Indian Navy -- first Vikrant (British origin) from 1961 to 1997, INS Viraat (British origin) from 1987 to 2016 and INS Vikramaditya (Russian origin) 2013 onwards.

Those who follow Sanatan Dharma are welcome at the ghats. These are not picnic spots.”Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Kashi unit of Bajrang Dal were named in the posters.Commissioner of police, A Satish Ganesh identified the two workers as Nikhil Tripathi Rudra and Rajan Gupta.“A notice was served under 107/16 of CrPC for breaching peace on Friday. Both of them were produced before the court of ACP in reserve police lines (On Saturday). Both of them submitted bonds worth ₹5 lakh each. Thereafter, they were released from the court,” the commissioner said.Later, Tripathi, who was the Bajrang Dal convenor in Kashi, said he had resigned from his post. “I have resigned... But I am still an active member of Bajrang Dal. I will keep working for the Hindutva as a Hindu activist,” he said.“This is not a request. This is a warning,” said Tripathi, accepting that the posters had been put up by them. He said that the Bajrang Dal workers would stage a demonstration if people don’t stop using the ghats as a picnic spot.The Kashi unit of VHP denied any knowledge of the posters. Executive member, Kashi region, Anurag Trivedi, said the ghats were public spaces and nobody could be stopped from entering them.VHP worker Rakesh Ranjan Tripathi reiterated Trivedi’s stand saying everyone was free to visit the ghats.Lallu Yadav, senior Samajwadi Party worker echoed those sentiments and said that this is against the Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb of Varanasi.

On January 9, the Ministry of Defence’s (MoD) issued an order for the immediate stoppage of collection of the vehicle entry fee by Cantonments. However, the PCB has clarified that it is not an entry fee that is being charged, but a vehicle entry tax. PCB chief executive officer (CEO) Amit Kumar, in a public notice issued on January 10, says: “It is clarified to the general public that the vehicle entry fee from vehicles running in PCB area has been discontinued from January 7, 2022. However PCB levies a vehicle entre tax, since June 30, 2001 which is not discontinued”. Kumar said, “It is the entry fee which has been abolished and not the entry tax. This needs to be understood by citizens. The tax is being collected as per the notification of the central government and we will continue collecting it as per the central government’s directions. Ahmednagar and Aurangabad cantonment boards are already collecting the tax fees like us, as per the law.” The PCB is currently undergoing its worst financial crisis and faces a current fiscal deficit of over ₹600 crore. The PCB is yet to get ₹459 crore in dues from the state government. Former PCB vice-president Manzoor Shaikh said, “Vehicle entry fee ended in all cantonment board areas across the country and PCB is not an exception. If funds are not there with the PCB, the central government is the final authority and it will take necessary steps to fund the board and bail it out. Vehicle entry tax has been a very exploitative form of tax recovery and must end.” Azim Gudakuwala, a social worker from Kolsa Galli said, “It is the order of the central government and it is abiding by all the cantonments. Vehicle entry fee and vehicle entry tax are the same and all cantonment boards are accepting the order, so why not PCB? The PCB administration is now collecting tax illegally.” Advocate Netraprakash Bhog said, “The administration is not above the government of India and have to follow the order of the government as VET and VEF is the same. IThe VET must be abolished as it is illegal as per the new order.”The Ministry of Defence’s (MoD) issued an order dated January 7 ordering immediate stoppage of collection of vehicle entry fee by cantonment boards across India. PCB has been earning revenues of between ₹15crore- ₹20 crore annually from vehicle entry tax. The Director General of Defence Estates Office under the Defence ministry stated in its order: “It is observed that collection of vehicle entry fee by cantonment boards by installing barricades or nakas (collection kiosks) does not conform to the government’s initiative towards smooth movement of goods and traffic and impedes the efforts towards the ease of living and ease of doing business.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vehicle-tax-by-other-name-still-unjust-in-pcb-say-residents-101641836136161.html

The passenger bus was on its way from Balasore district on Sunday morning when it came across the lone tusker at Tikapada village in Rasagovindpur area of Mayurbhanj district.Angry tusker attacks passenger bus in Odisha's Mayurbhanj district on Sunday morning. Passengers had a miraculous escape. pic.twitter.com/683IlLZf0BA villager who saw the wild elephant rushing and recorded the incident on his mobile phone said, the elephant damaged the glass pane of the bus, but no passenger was injured. “We thought the tusker would turn the bus turtle. It took everyone by surprise,” said the villager in Rasgovidnpur.In another incident, a herd of elephants went on a rampage through houses, paddy fields and a fire department vehicle after an elephant calf fell in an unused well in a village of Mayurbhanj.A herd of five elephants was passing by Sureidihi village under Rasgovindpur range of the district when the elephant calf fell on late Saturday night.By the time the forest officials and fire services team could launch the rescue operation, the herd of angry elephants started rampaging through homes.Though the calf was unhurt in the 5-feet deep well, the forest department personnel were unable to rescue it for several hours as the herd guarded it zealously not allowing anyone to come near the well.“We had to wait patiently for several hours till the herd went to a nearby pond to have water when we filled up the unused well with water so that the calf could float to surface,” said Baripada divisional forest officer Santosh Joshi.In September last year, a journalist of a TV channel in Odisha and a disaster rescue personnel were drowned to death while trying to rescue an elephant stranded in the swirling waters of the Mahanadi.

The Rafale-M is a variant of Rafale fighters that operate from land bases. The Indian Air Force has also ordered 36 Rafale-B and Rafale-C fighter jets.SBTF is essentially an aircraft carrier setting on the ground where fighters use the ski-jump to takeoff and are recovered by arrestor wires or STOBAR (short takeoff but arrested recovery) in navy parlance.The navy is looking at buying more deck-based fighter jets to operate from its sole aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya and the Indigenous Aircraft Carrier (IAC) Vikrant, which is currently undergoing sea trials.The Rafale-M demonstration of capability is expected to be carried out over the next two weeks and will be followed by a similar demonstration by the US-origin F-18 fighters in the next three to four months, the officials said.The F-18s operate from American supercarriers such as USS Nimitz and USS Ronald Reagan, with the US Navy accounting for a fleet of more than 600 such fighters.India has a requirement for 57 deck-based fighters for its carrier operations. But the figure is being revised, officials said. A prototype of the naval version of the light combat aircraft landed and took off from INS Vikramaditya in January 2020 in a significant step towards India developing its own deck-based fighters. But the fate of that project is unclear.The Indian Navy currently operates Russian-origin MiG-29K fighters from INS Vikramaditya, a second-hand carrier bought from Russia.Aircraft carrier Vikrant, the largest warship to be built in the country, on Sunday set sail for crucial sea trials ahead of its scheduled induction into the navy later this year.Vikrant has put India in a select league -- only the US, the UK, Russia, France and China have the capability to build aircraft carriers.China operates two aircraft carriers — CV-16 Liaoning and CV-17 Shandong. It is building a third carrier as it expands its footprint in the Indian Ocean Region.Vikrant has an indigenous content of 76%. It will be the fourth aircraft carrier to be operated by the Indian Navy -- first Vikrant (British origin) from 1961 to 1997, INS Viraat (British origin) from 1987 to 2016 and INS Vikramaditya (Russian origin) 2013 onwards.

10-01-2022||India||Pro-Kannada activist, literateur and poet Champa dies at 82||BENGALURU: Noted poet, activist and one of Karnataka’s loudest pro-Kannada voices, Chandrashekar Patil, better known by his pen-name Champa, 82, died this morning in Bengaluru. Born in Hattimattur village of Haveri district, he attained fame as a revolutionary writer and was fondly called as Champa. The literateur was also a key activist who was among the many who led the Gokak agitation for the cause of Kannada and has been a strong voice against any imposition of Hindi in the southern state. “His contribution to Kannada language and Karnataka is immense. He was at the forefront of Gokak and many other movements for the cause of Kannada and Karnataka. He strongly advocated Kannada to be the medium of instruction in education,” Basavaraj Bommai, the chief minister of Karnataka said on Monday. Champa was a professor of English at Karnatak University, Dharwad and editor of ‘Sankramana’, a Kannada literary publication. He has also served as the head of Kannada Development Authority and Kannada Sahitya Parishat. “I am deeply saddened by the news of the death of Kannada poet, artist, playwright, revolutionary Chandrashekar Patil who became famous as Champa. The land has lost the voice of a senior pro-Kannada person. I pray that God will grant peace to him and strength to his family to bear the loss,” BS Yediyurappa, senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former chief minister, said. In 2017, he was part of a forum that brought together warring groups from Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to fight the imposition of Hindi by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led union government. “Language struggle cannot be done in isolation,” Champa said at the time. “I am saddened by the death of Prof Chandrashekar Patil who was a born fighter against injustice, inequality and dictatorship. I am part of his family and fans in this time of grief,” Siddaramaiah, former chief minister and leader of the opposition said in a post on Twitter. Bommai has said that the last rites will be conducted with full state honours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prokannada-activist-literateur-and-poet-champa-dies-at-82-101641824130126.html
10-01-2022||India||India expects ‘constructive dialogue’ with China to resolve friction in Ladakh sector||NEW DELHI: India is expecting “constructive dialogue” with China at the next round of military talks to cool military tensions in eastern Ladakh, officials familiar with the matter said on Monday. Indian and Chinese military commanders will hold the 14th round of talks to defuse border tensions at the Chushul-Moldo meeting point on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) on January 12. The talks come at a time when frontline soldiers are deployed eyeball to eyeball at friction points on LAC. The Indian side is looking forward to constructive dialogue to resolve the remaining friction areas along LAC where the two armies have been locked in a standoff since May 2020, the officials said. The remaining friction areas include Hot Springs and Depsang. The 13th round of military talks between India and China hit an impasse on October 10, with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) not agreeing to suggestions made by the Indian Army. “The fact that both sides are engaged in talks is a positive sign. It may take time but the dialogue will lead to a mutually acceptable resolution,” said former director general of military operations Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd). India and China have continuously hardened their stance on LAC going by increased military activities on both sides of the boundary, infrastructure development, surveillance and combat manoeuvres by their armies in the midst of the ongoing border standoff. The Indian Army’s activities in the sector are in response to PLA actions and counter measures have been taken to stay ready for any contingency, as previously reported. Despite two rounds of disengagement at friction points on LAC last year, the two armies still have 50,000 to 60,000 troops each and advanced weaponry deployed in the Ladakh theatre. PLA did not agree to suggestions made by the Indian Army at the 13th round of talks on October 10. The Indian Army said it made constructive suggestions for resolving the remaining areas but the Chinese side was not agreeable and also did not provide any forward-looking proposals, while China accused India of unreasonable and unrealistic demands in an unusually aggressive statement. PLA carried out tank drills across LAC after the October 10 talks reached an impasse, and the Indian Army launched airborne drills in eastern Ladakh last November to validate and showcase its rapid response capabilities. In the Ladakh sector, outstanding problems at Hot Springs and Depsang are yet to be resolved. The Indian Army’s patrolling activity has been affected in Hot Springs (Patrolling Point-15) and PLA’s forward presence in Depsang has also hindered access of Indian soldiers to routes including the ones leading to PP-10, 11, 11-A, 12 and 13. The 12th round of military talks led to disengagement of forward deployed troops from Gogra, or PP -17A, in early August 2021. No progress has been made after that.

Deputy commissioner of police (crime branch) Chinmay Pandit said they are yet to identify the alleged JeM contact in Nagpur. Or figure out why he backed out at the last minute.“In the absence of any local support, Shaikh moved around the city using Google maps,” Pandit said. He did take some photographs and videos of his targets from a distance during the three-day trip, and sent them to his handler across the border.From all available indications, the information that Shaikh was able to gather wasn’t considered adequate by his Jaish handlers to plan an immediate attack.Shaikh, a class 10 pass out who works as an electrician, was arrested in December 2021 by security agencies from Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama district.The information about Jaish’s contact in the city emerged recently when a team of Nagpur crime branch travelled to Jammu and Kashmir and interrogated Shaikh.Shaikh told them that his handler assured him that he will get logistics support in Nagpur but that didn’t happen, said Pandit.It was also revealed during the interrogation that JeM planned a “fidayeen” attack on the installations. The JeM operative was sharing details of the targets with his Pakistani handler while in Nagpur, a second police officer said.Shaikh, who checked into a hotel at Sitabuldi in the West Nagpur area, took an auto-rickshaw on July 14 and reached Badkas Chowk, adjacent to the RSS headquarters building with the help of Google Maps. His target was to conduct surveillance of six lanes connecting the RSS headquarters. However, after observing police patrolling and a huge presence of security forces deployed in the area, he did not dare to enter the lanes. The Pakistani handler wanted the operative to ‘go closer’ and collect more images of the ‘deep interiors’ of RSS headquarters at Mahal and the Hedgewar Smruti Bhavan at Reshimbagh. The operative could not move closer as tight security rings around these places had forced him to abort the plan, the second officer cited above said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaish-contact-in-nagpur-pulled-out-of-mission-to-reccee-rss-hq-at-last-minute-101641822569981.html

10-01-2022||India||‘Pity that vice chancellor can’t write two sentences properly’: Kerala governor||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala governor Arif Mohammad Khan, who has an uneasy relationship with the Pinarayi Vijayan government over autonomy of universities, on Monday came down heavily on Kerala University vice-chancellor Prof. VP Mahadevan Pillai, saying he could not even write two sentences properly.“My head hung in shame. Pity the V-C can’t write two sentences properly… This university is one of the oldest in the country,” the governor told reporters without taking names, referring to a brief letter written by the vice chancellor to him that has been widely circulated on social media.A controversy erupted in Kerala after the university vice-chancellor declined the governor’s recommendation to consider conferring Kerala University’s honorary D.Litt on President Ram Nath Kovind. Khan was upset that the vice chancellor didn’t put the proposal before the university syndicate for consideration, and reportedly took the decision on instructions from the ruling party.“He told me some people were not interested in the idea. When I insisted, he said some syndicate members. When I asked did he call a meeting of the syndicate, he said no. Then I told him to write the reason on a paper and give it to me,” said the governor, adding he was shocked to read the letter written by the vice-chancellor.Kerala University VC Prof Mahadevan Pillai was not available for his comments. But state higher education minister R Bindhu said D-Litt proposal never came to her or the government and she has no idea why the VC was not willing. She refused to give a reply to the governor’s charges saying she did not want to drag the controversy. Khan continued. “Not only writing, he can’t converse properly. Whatever I asked, he failed to give a proper reply. After the letter, I feel ashamed to look at the face of others. I feel pity, this is one of the oldest varsities of the country,” he said.The governor made it clear that he did not want to resume working as chancellor.“The CM sent me three letters to requesting me to take up the position. He reiterated that there is no political interference. But I am firm with what I said,” he said adding he was aware of protocols and other limitations as he became a legislator and union minister at a young age. He also reiterated his charge that Kannur University VC’s re-appointment was “improper” and he was forced to sign in the appointment letter. Relations between the government and governor soured after the re-appointment of Kannur Vice Chancellor Prof Gopinath Raveendran. The governor sent a strongly-worded letter to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on December 8 in which he said he was really pained over the “dipping standard” of higher education sector and blamed “brazen political interference” for this. He asked the government to take up the chancellor’s post if political interference continued. Prof Gopinath Raveendran was re-appointed vice-chancellor of Kannur University for four years in November last year after the government issued a notification and appointed a selection committee to select the new V-C. But the government insisted on his re-appointment.

Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Monday said that action will be taken against all those violating Covid-19 restrictions without discrimination. He said that an FIR has been registered against at least 30 members who had participated in Congress padayatra for the Mekedatu project. “Whoever violates the Covid rules, whether a common man or a big leader, there is no differentiation. Action will be taken in a uniform way according to the law,” Bommai said. “The Congress party has shown its tradition by abusing the additional district collector who had come to do his duty. He has tainted the padayatra which is a means of Satyagraha. The Congress is not doing a padayatra but a march to quench its thirst for power,” Dr K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s minister for health, family welfare and medical education said in a post on Twitter. The statement came a day after Shivakumar was seen taking out his anger against district officials who had come to take the Congress president’s Covid-19 swabs after he undertook a massive rally that was attended by thousands of people. “If I have any problem, I will tell you. Bloody fellows, they are blackmailing me. They can’t blackmail me. Please go and tell your health minister to play with kids, against those who come from outside (abroad) to the airport. Why should I get tested? Ask him (health minister) to get tested,” Shivakumar is heard saying in a video that has gone viral online. Shivakumar and the Congress had disregarded all warnings by the BJP government and Ramanagara district authorities over the rally at a time when Covid-19 infections in the state had breached the five-figure in a single day on Sunday. Karnataka now has nearly 50,000 active cases and the padayatra as well as other political activities have exacerbated the risk of spread of infections in a state where restrictions have already crippled lives and livelihoods. Siddaramaiah, the leader of the opposition in Karnataka, who started the march on Sunday has decided to take the day off after feeling unwell, raising fears if he is infected. People aware of the developments add that Shivakumar is apprehensive of tests as it could scuttle his padayatra by which he aims to get some control over the Congress party in the state and assert his influence over the Old Mysuru region or Vokkaliga heartland. “I am fit and fine. You cannot compel me. I know the law of this land. You tell your home minister. I am perfect. Their health may be off... the HM or CM. I will not give any test and I have no need for it. I have walked 15 kms with all this pushing and pulling, have I stumbled? I will not do any test,” Shivakumar said, adding that he “never expected this from the chief minister”. Shivakumar had earlier justified going ahead with the padayatra claiming that the government were fudging Covid-19 infections to instil fear in people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-lashes-at-karnataka-congress-chief-over-refusal-to-get-covid-19-test-101641813449417.html

10-01-2022||India||Goa minister, another MLA quit BJP||PANAJI: Goa minister Michael Lobo and lawmaker Pravin Zantye on Monday quit the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday, taking to four the number of legislators from the party to have quit since December 17 even as the state head into assembly polls on February 14.Lobo, who is expected to join the Congress, said he was upset with the functioning of the party, especially the manner in which the grassroots-level workers are treated.A vocal member of chief minister Pramod Sawant’s cabinet, Lobo is the third Christian lawmaker after Alina Saldanha and Carlos Almeida to have left the BJP citing changes in the party’s functioning following former chief minister Manohar Parrikar’s death in 2019. Christians account for a little over 25% of the state’s population.Lobo’s departure also indicates unease among the BJP’s Christian MLAs especially in the light of attacks on Christians in neighbouring Karnataka that has not gone unnoticed among the state’s minority population. Clergymen have referred to the attacks that took place over Christmas during religious gatherings in Goa.Lobo said the BJP no longer values the contribution of grassroots workers. “Many came to me to complain. There will be ups and downs in a party but there cannot be a `lock, stock, and barrel ‘ replacement of workers,” Lobo said. “I have been saying this for a long time but nobody was willing to listen. I felt we were sidelined.”Lobo said he is in talks with other political parties but yet to take a decision on his future plans.Lobo’s resignation came a day after Congress leader Digambar Kamat said the former was in touch with the party leadership induction into the party.State BJP chief Sadanand Shet Tanavade said Lobo’s departure would not make any difference to the party. “All this time he was only physically present in the party. We considered him as having left. We did not dismiss him out of deference to his long contribution to the party.”Jatin Naik, a political analyst, said Lobo’s departure will weaken the BJP in the politically-significant Bardez taluka, which sends seven lawmakers to the 40-member state assembly. “The BJP is on the back foot and with this development, the party’s ability to win a simple majority on its own is significantly diminished.”Lobo, who represented the Calangute constituency, plans to field his wife from the neighbouring Siolim constituency.Zantye, a cashew nut baron who represented the Maem constituency, is the son of Harish Zantye, a Congress Member of Parliament from North Goa from 1991 to 1996. He quit Congress after he was denied a ticket for the 2012 assembly polls and joined the BJP ahead of the 2017 elections.Zantye said he joined the BJP based on the assurances of Parrikar and that the party is not the same today. He blamed the government’s failure to restart mining and providing jobs in his constituency for his exit. “I will be joining the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP),” he added.The Congress emerged as the single-largest party in the state in 2017 with 17 seats in the 40-member assembly. But it was unable to form the government. The BJP, which won 13 seats, managed to form the government in with the MGP, the Goa Forward Party (GFP), and two independents. In 2019, 10 Congress lawmakers defected and gave the BJP a comfortable majority in the assembly.MGP has since quit the BJP-led alliance and has tied up with the Trinamool Congress. The GFP is now a Congress ally. And 26 of the 40 legislators elected in 2017 are no longer with the party on whose ticket they contested that election..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-minister-lobo-quits-bjp-ahead-of-expected-entry-into-congress-101641800248362.html

"The question is if an inquiry is held, what will be its scope. If you want to take disciplinary action against officers what remains for this court to look into?" it said.The court also told the central government that the show cause notice issued by it to Punjab officials "is self-contradictory". "By constituting a committee, the Centre seeks to enquire if there was a breach of Special Protection Group (SPG) Act and then it holds Punjab Chief Secretary and Director General guilty," it added.The court further asked both central and Punjab governments not to go ahead with their inquiries in the matter.On January 5, PM Modi was scheduled to visit Ferozepur district; however, the trip was cut short and his address had to be cancelled after his cavalcade was stopped on a flyover due to farmers' protest.

Despite this new surge, the travel sentiment remains strong,” said Rikant Pittie, the co-founder of the online travel firm EaseMyTrip.Pittie added the current customer trends shows a strong emphasis on safety and hygiene. “...customers are now starting to choose places that (follow)... high safety standards and which are following Covid-19 protocols.”Pitte said customers were yearning to travel once the restrictions are lifted. “Even with new variants, restrictions and limitations, the travel industry is expected to grow further in the coming year as industry stakeholders and travellers are gradually adapting to the evolved travel norms.”Rating agency ICRA cited the rising infections and added passengers are apprehensive about air travel and also some state governments have imposed restrictions on it. It added there was a limited impact of the new Covid-19 variant on travel in December 2021. “The average daily passengers for the week beginning December 27, 2021, was 3.4 lakh compared to 3.7 lakh and 3.6 lakh during the week beginning December 20, 2021, and December 13, 2021,” said Rajeshwar Burla, vice president and group head, Corporate Ratings, ICRA.Cleartrip, another online travel company, said the travellers were looking for flexible travel options that have them covered in case there is a sudden change in regulations due to the new variant.“As a result, we are seeing a higher interest in our products -- EzCancel that offers a 100% refund on cancellations and Flexifly which enables consumers to change plans. Customers buying Flexifly VAS have doubled since November while EZCancel is also seeing a spike,” said Prahlad Krishnamurthi, chief business officer, Cleartrip.Cleartrip has reported an increase in modification and cancellation of existing bookings over a couple of weeks as travellers are adjusting their plans due to revised advisories. Krishnamurthi said in 2022, the domestic flight trends were looking very strong compared to 2021. “Metro destinations are on track to exceed 2021 numbers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/surge-in-covid-19-cases-halts-revival-of-travel-industry-101641785666849.html

Parts of Himachal Pradesh, which have been seeing snowfall the past few days, may see more heavy snow or rain in the coming days, it further said.Meanwhile, heavy rain lashed Delhi on Sunday, which led the minimum temperature to settle at 13.8 degrees Celsius, seven notches above normal.Also Read | Delhi’s AQI remains in ‘satisfactory’ categoryThe weather department said the city received 8 mm rainfall in the last 24 hours as recorded at 8.30am, while the relative humidity recorded at 5.30pm was 95 per cent.On Saturday, Delhi recorded its highest rainfall in a day for January in 22 years, yielding the city's best air quality in over two months even as the minimum temperature settled at 15 degrees Celsius, eight notches above normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rain-snowfall-bring-in-cold-in-north-india-what-is-the-reason-behind-it-101641785261855.html

10-01-2022||India||Breach in PM Modi's security: Supreme Court to hear petition today||The Supreme Court on Monday will hear a petition seeking a court-monitored investigation into the alleged security breach during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Punjab last week. The Prime Minister's convoy had to spend 15-20 minutes on a flyover due to a blockade by protesters.A three-judge bench comprising Chief Justice NV Ramana, and Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli, will take up the petition. It was filed by an organisation named 'Lawyers Voice'.In the plea, the organisation has termed the incident during the Prime Minister's visit to Punjab's Ferozepur a "serious and deliberate lapse" on part of the state government. It has also demanded stern action against "erring" officials of the Punjab government.On Friday, senior advocate Maninder Singh, appearing from petitioner's side, argued in the top court that the breach in the Prime Minister's security is not an issue of state subject or law and order, and falls under Special Protection Groups (SPG) Act.It is the duty of the Centre, state and other local authorities to act in aid of the director of any member of the SPG, he also told the court, according to news agency ANI. "The issue of Prime Minister protection is a national security issue and comes under parliamentary purview," Singh also said.Singh also argued that it was a serious lapse on the part of the Punjab government to allow the PM's cavalcade to be stranded on the road causing an unacceptable security breach.On January 5, PM Modi was scheduled to visit Ferozepur district; however, the trip was cut short and his address had to be cancelled after his cavalcade was stopped on a flyover due to farmers' protest. Many leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have slammed the Punjab government, alleging that details of PM Modi's route were shared with unauthorised persons, which led to a blockade of the road by protesters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/breach-in-pm-modi-s-security-supreme-court-to-hear-petition-today-101641775530408.html

10-01-2022||India||Kathputli live: Musicians, puppeteers of Delhi colony to get digital viewers||These days a group of about half a dozen artistes of Kathputli colony — puppeteers, drummers, dancers – come together, wearing masks, to practise their art inside a small room made of aerocon. The room, its wall covered with black fabric, has a mobile phone on a tripod, microphone, an audio recorder, lights, and a laptop. The artistes are rehearsing for Kathputli Utsav, an online art festival to be hosted in February by the University of Manchester in the UK for the artistes of the colony.“The two-hour event will have performances, talks and panel discussions on the condition of artistes in India during the pandemic,” says Vijay Maitri, a community leader and a theatre artiste . “The online event will be beamed live from our colony to be seen live on a large screen at the university in the UK.Artistes here have been using technology to save their art and livelihoods during the pandemic.”Indeed, hundreds of performing artistes and craftsmen in Kathputli Colony, perhaps the country’s biggest community of performing artistes, have taken to technology in a big way in the past two years of the pandemic, organising online shows, workshops for children and making educational videos using puppets on various subjects, including Covid.When the pandemic struck, the artistes of the colony who used to perform at weddings, birthday parties, malls and restaurants struggled to make ends meet as shows dried up.In fact, Covid-19 was a double whammy for 2,800 families of the Kathputli colony, who, for over four years have been living in squalid conditions in a transit camp in Anand Parbat after their colony was demolished for DDA’s first in situ slum rehabilitation project. Displaced and out of work, they struggled to survive. “When the first lockdown happened, the situation was dire; many families here had nothing to eat. A few young artistes, who had some savings, collected money to help, and also approached non-profits across the city, which came forward to donate ration kits,” says Maitri.As part of the relief efforts, Maitri and his young team of volunteers also organized an online show on Zoom with the objective of getting people to contribute to the fundraising campaign they started on a crowdfunding platform. Over 100 people, says Maitri, watched the event live across the world and some of them contributed to the fund raiser. “That is when we realized that our artists can also do shows online to earn some money, ” says Maitri, an engineer-turned-social activist, who was born and brought in the Kathputli colony, where he came to live and work for the community after quitting his job with a multinational company. “ We started teaching young performers in the colony how to create live events on Zoom, Facebook, and Instagram.”The team also set up a makeshift studio in one of the rooms of the transit camp, to organise online performances. “We made a list of equipment we needed for live events-- speakers, microphones, lights, sounds mixers, cameras, and circulated it among our friends and well-wishers outside the colony on WhatsApp; they responded by donating many of this equipment, and we got going,” Maitri said.Many artistes have also turned their cramped one-room houses in the transit camp into a stage by using green or black fabric to cover walls and decorating the space with puppets and other handicrafts by local craftsmen.Vinay Bhatt, 26, a puppeteer, is one such artist. He often goes live on Zoom from his room in the transit camp and has so far done two dozen online shows and puppetry workshops. He says that until the lockdown he knew nothing about online shows, but he was trained by his friends in art circles outside the colony. One of his friends, he says, even gifted him a laptop and he got other equipment such webcam on Dariya Dil Dukaan , a gift economy forum on Facebook. Bhatt, who has studied up to fourth standard, has not only done several live shows but online puppetry workshops for a company providing Art Integrated Learning (AIL) for children and several educational videos using puppets on Covid and other subjects for various government and non-government organisations.“Online shows are not a replacement for physical shows because the artistes crave for the audience’s applause. In an online show, we perform for cameras, which get boring at times, but at least we are able to sustain ourselves financially and keep our art alive. Otherwise, our art and artistes may soon be forgotten without any kind of shows,” says Vinay Bhatt.And how much does he get paid for an online show? “ I used to earn about ₹7,000 for performing at a birthday party, but I get almost half the money for a similar online performance,” says Bhatt, who has also set up, Puppet Kala, which he describes as a ‘production house’ to help local artistes do online shows. His most recent online show, he says, was for a birthday party at an army officer’s house in the Delhi cantonment. “ While our income is nowhere close to pre-pandemic levels, but now I am confident that I can use all my experience and knowledge of various digital tools to sustain myself through the worst of times. I think every performing artist must learn technology,” he says.Agrees Santosh Bhatt, 50, another well-known puppeteer in the colony, who has done several online shows and workshops. He says before the pandemic hardly any artiste had a Paytm account, but now most receive payment for their online performances on online wallets such as Paytm or Google Pay. “ We were trained by young volunteers in using mobile wallets. While we are getting little money through online shows, at least we are getting newer audiences, which might help us revive our dying art,” says Santosh.Many Kathputli artistes, led by Maitri, are also collaborating with foreign artistes online. In October, for example, a group of drummers in the colony collaborated with artistes from Scotland, Jordan, Zambia, Kenya as part of a project by Tinder Box Collective, a community of young artists and musicians in Scotland. The project called ‘Samta Sessions’ aims to form an international collective of musicians, artists, dancers, puppeteers and community groups, in India, Kenya, Zambia, Scotland, Jordan, Nigeria and Ireland and create new opportunities for them.“It was a great experience creating music together with artistes from so many countries online. We hope it will also give us an opportunity to do more online and offline shows in these countries,” says Vinod Bhatt, a drummer.Maitri is now running a three- month fellowship for youngsters of the Kathputli colony in partnership with Pravah, an NGO. Under the fellowship, 10 youngsters are doing projects in mental health, education, digital literacy, among others in the colony.Rohit Bhatt, 21, is handling a project in digital literacy, helping the artistes in the colony organize online shows. “I go door to door training artistes in the use of the mobile phone for live shows. While youngsters here, though not very educated, are quick to learn, the older artistes find it difficult to use technology. But everyone is keen to adopt technology,” says Rohit. “We have so far trained over 100 artistes in creating online events on Zoom, Facebook and Instagram , and will train many more in the coming months. I firmly believe that technology can really help save our art. The pandemic made them hopeless, but technology is giving artistes a new hope.”

However, concerns over the mixing of contaminated waste and general municipal waste, as well as the lack of safety equipment among sanitation workers continue to remain a key concern among unions and organisations working with informal waste pickers.According to the health bulletin issued by the Delhi government on Sunday, more than 35,000 Covid-19 patients in Delhi were isolating at home.A senior official from the South Delhi Municipal Corporation’s (SDMC) sanitation department said that the under the third wave action plan, the civic body has deployed one vehicle for each of the 104 wards under the corporation to collect biomedical waste from homes with Covid-19 patients.“Duty charts for each ward have been released and a nodal officer has been deployed at the zonal level to coordinate the collection of biomedical waste. The collection is taking place according to the lists provided by the district surveillance officers,” he added.Chhail Bihari Goswami, leader of the House, North Delhi Municipal Corporation said the civic body is deploying auto-tippers to collect contaminated waste at the zonal level.Bir Singh Panwar, chairman of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) standing committee said a team of a public health inspector, area malaria inspector, a domestic breeding checker and sanitation worker have been deputed to collect biomedical waste from homes where Covid-19 patients are isolating.“An adequate number of personal protection equipment (PPE) kits, safety gear and yellow waste collection bags for contaminated waste have been provided to these teams. The collected waste will be taken to Swami Dayanand Hospital, where it will be incinerated,” he added.“The deputy health officer will share the details and addresses of Covid-19 patients with the sanitation inspector every day,” he said.Guidelines issued by the central anti-pollution body mandate that biomedical waste generated during the treatment of Covid-19 patients be treated and disposed off in accordance with the Biomedical Waste Management Rules (2016).Reports by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) showed that Delhi produced around 18.79 tonnes of Covid-related biomedical waste in May last year, amid the fourth wave of infections. This fell to 7.6 tonnes a day in June, as the fourth wave subsided. It dropped further to 3.55 tonnes a day the month after that.However, staffers and resident welfare groups have flagged concerns over the safety of frontline workers engaged in collecting biomedical waste from homes where Covid-19 patients are isolating.Chetan Das Chavaria, who heads the Akhil Bharatiya Mazdoor Parshad, a sanitation workers union, said waste collectors and sweepers are at the frontline of hygiene operations and face the risk of contracting the infection.“We cannot work from home. It is a 24-hour risk to our families too. The administration should at least provide safety gear and mark the home isolation houses separately,” Chavaria said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/biomedical-waste-a-concern-amid-soaring-covid-19-cases-101641773549464.html

10-01-2022||India||TMC leader Abhishek Banerjee cancels Goa visit in view of Covid-19 pandemic||KOLKATA: Trinamool Congress (TMC) national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee cancelled his Goa trip on Sunday in view of the rise in coronavirus infection across the country, party leaders said. Banerjee was supposed to leave Kolkata on Sunday for a three-day visit to Goa where the TMC will contest the upcoming assembly polls. The development came a day after Banerjee held meetings with bureaucrats and doctors in South 24 Parganas district and said that he personally feels that all religious festivals and elections should be put on hold for at least two months in the interest of public safety. “It is my personal opinion that saving lives and the society is more important. I cannot comment on verdicts passed by courts or orders of the election commission. I feel that everything can take place if people live,” Banerjee said on Saturday. Banerjee, who is the Lok Sabha member from Diamond Harbour in South 24 Parganas, also batted for some strict guidelines in view of the Ganga Sagar festival to be held in the district a week later. The guidelines he announced include wearing of two masks, control rooms in every gram panchayat area, mobile health check-up camps in certain pockets, 24-hour tele-consultation with doctors, isolation facilities and closure of markets for two consecutive days every week. The opposition parties targeted Banerjee since he made the statement two weeks before the elections at four municipal corporations in Bengal. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national vice-president Dilip Ghosh said, “If Abhishek Banerjee is so concerned about public safety, why isn’t the government postponing the civic body elections? These are tactics to mislead people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-leader-abhishek-banerjee-cancels-goa-visit-in-view-of-covid-19-pandemic-101641763224522.html
10-01-2022||India||Rajasthan govt prepares draft of right to health law, defines patients’ rights||JAIPUR: At the time Covid cases are surging again due to Omicron variant, the Rajasthan government has prepared a draft of the country’s first Right to Health Law that defines rights of patients, their attendants and healthcare providers and provides for a mechanism to redress grievances of the stakeholders, according to senior Rajasthan government officials. A senior Rajasthan government official familiar with the development said the bill will be introduced in the budget session of the state assembly, likely to start in March, after getting an approval of the state cabinet. A final draft will be prepared for cabinet consideration after consulting all stakeholders, the official quoted above said. Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot in 2021 budget announced that the state will provide right to health to all. He had also announced universal healthcare scheme worth ₹3,500 crore, under which every family in the state would get medical insurance benefits up to ₹5 lakh. According to officials, the right to health guarantees certain rights to people in government and private health institutions. “The Rajasthan government is already providing facilities such as free medicines and tests, Chiranjeevi health insurance of up to ₹5 lakh, etc. This law will ensure not just effective implementation but also rights to patients and their attendants,” he said. He said the bill provides for right of the patient or his attendant to know cost of treatment of certain disease, right to consult another doctor and seek discharge of the patient, if not satisfied with the treatment. The bill also makes it mandatory for hospitals to maintain secrecy of a patient’s health records and ensure informed consent in case of sharing of health records. “The aim is to ensure equity and affordable health care and treatment of patients with dignity and respect along with transparency in running health systems,” another senior official of the health department said. For this, the second official said the hospital will have to disclose to patients or their attendants about the disease, treatment adopted and about their right to take second opinion from other doctors. The official said another highlight of the proposed bill is human resource management in every government medical institution in urban and rural areas by way of health worker patient ratio. “It is usually seen that health staff is in excess in urban areas and inadequate in rural areas. The law will ensure that there is similarity of health staff vis-à-vis patients and the posts. For this, a transfer and posting policy would come into force, which would ensure that healthcare workers will have to work in rural areas,” he said. The official added that a similar policy is in place in Tamil Nadu since 1991, and has been successful in improving rural healthcare. A third official dealing with the right to health issue said the new law will provide for fixing prices of medicines and treatment even in private hospital, whose intake of patients is increasing every year. “The bill has provision to fix rates or packages, be it heart or liver transplant, even in private hospitals,” he said. The third official said the bill provides for block, district and state grievance and redress mechanism. “The government would constitute a state health authority to redress grievances and also issue standards for hospitals including pricing and basic facilities to be provided. A committee comprising elected representatives, locals, health and administration will be constituted at every level to redress grievances, be it related to behavior, infrastructure, medicines, treatment or mishap etc,” he said. The state government will also include provisions of laws such as Rajasthan Medicare Service Persons and Medicare Service Institutions Act, Rajasthan Epidemic Act etc in the RTH, the third official said. On Tuesday, chief minister Ashok Gehlot said that they were waiting for Central government’s rules under Clinical Establishment Act to have clarity on what all can be part of the right to health law. The rules will provide for minimum standards for all clinics and hospitals including the private ones. “The final touches to the bill would be given once the rules come. A draft is being prepared in consultation with stakeholders. “When the rules are notified, the state will launch the Right to Health in a proper manner,” said Gehlot. On why a right to health care Act, Dr Narendra Gupta, Rajasthan convener of Jan Swasthya Abhiyan (JSA) said the need to enact a right to health care has become more urgent and acute in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic which has caused havoc across the globe by infecting more than 257 million and 5.1 million deaths in a short span of time. In India alone, as per government records, about 3.5 crore people got infection and more than 4.6 lakh died. “Possibility of resurgence of this pandemic or of new pandemics is always there and it is high time that Right to Health Care Act is enacted to prevent citizens from catastrophic financial hardship in accessing health care,” he said. He added that health spending of India is about 3.5% of the GDP and of this 1.15% is public spending, which is along lowest spending by any country in the world barring the few countries in Sub Sahara Africa. People rights activist and RTI campaigner, Nikhil Dey, who had participated in the consultation over the bill, emphasised on implementation of Right to Health. “We had suggested putting the draft on public domain. The human resource policy and grievance redressal mechanism are most important aspect of the Bill. The rights and entitlement are pointless if there is no redressal mechanism for which there should be accountability law. The social audit should happen at all level be it at CHC or PHC,” he said. Secretary, Private Hospital and Nursing Home Society, Jaipur, Dr Vijay Kapoor, said all government schemes seem to be good as they are for welfare of people but government should also look after interests of hospitals. “Already the public sentiments are against doctors and medical fraternity is facing problem. Any new policy should not affect our working. Free working should be there for medical professionals,” he said. According to the NSSO 71st round survey carried out in 2017, nearly 50 million people every year either slide into poverty or fail to rise out of poverty owing to payments made by them for seeking health care. A large segment of this expenditure is on medicines, medical consultations etc. The 64th round of NSSO done in 2004 noted that out of pocket spending on health care was the second major reason for rural indebtedness and nearly a quarter of the patients self-medicate on falling sick owing to financial hardship, said Gupta. The Indian Constitution does not expressly recognise Right to Health as a fundamental right under Part III of the Constitution (Fundamental Rights). However, through judicial interpretation, this has been read into the fundamental right to life & personal liberty (Article 21) and is now considered an inseparable part of the Right to Life, legal experts have said. They added that directive principles of state policy enshrined in Chapter IV of Constitution make it mandatory for the state to protect people’s heath. 
10-01-2022||India||GenNext of Jarkiholi brothers in Belagavi prepare for poll plunge||In the last nearly two years, the powerful ‘Jarkiholi’s’ have turned into a force to be reckoned with as their sphere of influence transcends political ideologies, especially within the two national parties. The entry of Lakhan Jarkiholi, as the fourth member of the clan into the state legislature, however, is just the beginning as the next generation of the sugar barons now prepare to make their entry into active politics in the border district of Belagavi, about 505 kms from Bengaluru.For the brothers, people aware of the developments said, family comes before the party as it was demonstrated once again with Ramesh and Balachandra backing their brother (Lakhan) in the December 10 MLC polls that led to the defeat of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate in the district.Despite not being the progeny of any political lineage, the brothers have an absolute grip over the district and surrounding regions, and at least one of them (Satish) was instrumental in helping Siddaramaiah save his position as MLA by engineering a victory in Badami in 2018.Satish had slashed the BJP’s margins in the Lok Sabha bypolls last year, reinforcing his hold over the district where dynasts rule the roost.Now, the next generation is set for active politics as Priyanka and Rahul, daughter and son of Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) working president Satish Jarkiholi, and Amarnath and Santosh, sons of BJP leader Ramesh Jarkiholi are ready to take the poll-plunge imminently.“Both Rahul and Priyanka have trained since the past three years about social behaviour, public speaking, communication skills, problems on the ground, how the administration works, etc. I have given them each ₹1 crore to spend on social works per year by meeting people in villages and those who are in distress. Both have shown their capabilities and now they are ready to solve public grievances” Satish Jarkiholi said speaking to the Hindustan Times.The entry of subsequent generations into active politics is not new in a state and the country where dynasts keep as much power within their households, leaving little for other workers. Leaders like BS Yediyurappa, Siddaramaiah, HD Deve Gowda and several others in the state and country have their next of kin already in active politics and are gearing up for it.Rahul Jarkiholi already commands a significant fan base, people aware of the developments said. A qualified engineer in Aeronautics, Rahul has young followers in all 18 assembly constituencies in the district. It is being said that Rahul will replace his father Satish Jarkiholi at the Yamakanmardi assembly constituency, while Satish is likely to move to national politics next time around. MBA graduate Priyanka also attends public events and hears public grievances. She is getting popular among women.Among two sons of Gokak MLA Ramesh Jarkiholi, elder son Amarnath is the chairman of Belgaum District Co-operative Milk Producers’ Societies Union. The name of Amarnath did the rounds as one of the contenders to get a BJP ticket to contest Belagavi Lok Sabha by-elections held in April 2021.However, he played a defensive game by saying he would not contest if the party picks Mangala Angadi, widow of former Union minister Suresh Angadi. Another son Santosh is looking at the administration of the sugar factory.“It’s left to his (Amarnath) decision when to contest the elections and where. Every development will have its own time. We will wait for the proper time to launch him. We are not in hurry,” Ramesh Jarkiholi said.People aware of the developments said that the family is also considering the Raichur Lok Sabha seat to launch Amarnath, where the Valmiki community votes play a key role.“It looks like political power saturating in one family. Although we claim it is unhealthy for democracy, people love them. They are close to the people and address their grievances. People give them power according to the constitution. The attraction of youth towards the Jarkiholi family is the secret of their political success” said professor S M Peerjade from Abul Kalam Azad College, Gokak.According to Bhimappa Gadad, who was a strong contender against Balachandra Jarkiholi in the Arabhavi constituency during the last assembly elections, the Jarkiholi brothers have become so politically powerful now that they can control any political party. As far as Gokak and Arabhavi constituencies go, political parties are just for namesake, which is dangerous to democracy. Since the Jarkiholi brothers are playing a leading role in major political parties, opponents become weaponless and keep silent. Now, the next generation of the Jarkiholi brothers is entering politics that can snatch the opportunity of some more leaders. Gadag lamented, though, it was a ‘disease’ they were being elected constitutionally.“Saturation of political power in one family leads to dictatorship in a certain scale of the area. Centralization of power equipped with money and muscle strength has wide scope to keep followers intact. If four to five members of a family enter the legislature house, bureaucracy gets weaker and starts functioning in the interest of a particular family. This leads to control of the family on every authority. Because of all these factors” Ashok Pujari, a political rival of MLA Ramesh Jarkiholi of two decades, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gennext-of-jarkiholi-brothers-in-belagavi-prepare-for-poll-plunge-101641755546539.html

We oppose dam, want to preserve #Mekedatu & demand eco-friendly water methods. On Jan 14, 2022, we rights groups are uniting to protest the project. Our inspiration Medha Patkar will lead us,” Kannada actor and activist Chetan Kumar said on Sunday in a post on Twitter.“BJP/Congress/JDS want ₹9,000cr reservoir project that submerges 12,000 acres of forest in Mekedatu w/ Congress pushing for it via a padayatra. We oppose this environmentally-disastrous demand & all 3 opportunistic parties. We want dam project dropped immediately,” he added.The post comes on the same day the Congress party in Karnataka began their 10-day Padayatra towards Bengaluru to pressure the Basavaraj Bommai-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government to start work on the project.“We can never create 12,000 acres of Forest. Who are we to destroy. Bengaluru has no right to keep swallowing all natural resources , villages around. Use the 9000 crore to develop other urban areas of Karnataka. Brain-dead politics to build big dams,” Vinay Srinivasa, lawyer and activist said in a post.Mekedatu, which literally means Goat’s crossing in English, is situated around 100 kms from Bengaluru in Karnataka’s Ramanagara district.The Mekedatu issue has evoked emotions on both sides of the border as it is an extension of the century-old Cauvery river water dispute that has defined generations in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, two of India’s most industrious and progressive states.The long-winding legal battles have been used as a political currency in the past as well as an active tool to deflect attention away from other issues both sides of the border and irrespective of the party in power.The Cauvery river basin originates in Karnataka and flows through Tamil Nadu and Puducherry before it enters the Bay of Bengal. Of the total catchment area of 81,155 square kilometers, 34,273 kilometers is in Karnataka, 44,016 square kms in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry and about 2,866 sq kms in Kerala.Karnataka has maintained that the Mekedatu balancing reservoir-cum-drinking water project is to generate 400 MW of power and additionally utilise 4.75 tmcft of water for drinking and domestic needs in the state and particularly Bengaluru.The Siddaramaiah-led Congress government, soon after it came to power in 2013, announced the construction of the project which would cost ₹5,912 crore (now in excess of ₹9,000 crore) to help use the excess water to quench the thirst of surrounding districts, including Bengaluru.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/activists-plan-protest-against-mekedatu-project-under-patkar-101641755545296.html
10-01-2022||India||Bengaluru logs 9k new Covid cases out of state’s 12k||Karnataka on Sunday breached the five-digit mark for the first time since June last year as the state reported 12,000 fresh Covid-19 cases and four deaths in 24 hours, the health department said.Bengaluru topped Sunday’s charts with 9,020 new cases while the state test positivity rate (TPR) stood at 6.33%, sparking fears of more restrictions by the Basavaraj Bommai-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in the state.Sunday’s tally takes the active caseload in the state to just under 50,000, Dr K Sudhakar, Karnataka minister for health, family welfare and medical education, said in a post on Twitter.“Test positivity rate in Bengaluru stays around 10% as cases increase to 9,020 today. An increase of 27% over yesterday’s tally of 7,113. The Capital accounts for 75% of the state’s total cases,” Sudhakar said.The positivity rate in Bengaluru, the biggest contributor to the state’s covid-19 tally, is well over 10%. Karnataka accounts for 333 cases of Omicron, the new variant of the novel coronavirus. Strict restrictions like night and weekend curfews have already been imposed across the state to contain the growing number of Covid cases.However, DK Shivakumar, president of the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC), said that the BJP was making up numbers for political reasons.“They are showing higher numbers. No one is admitted to the ICU. They are doing it for political reasons,” he said.The Election Commission of India (ECI), too, has announced elections in five states from February 10. The polls would see more gatherings and movement of people as political parties carry out campaigning and rallies to mobilise support.Sudhakar has said that experts said that the third wave is likely to peak in mid-February, triggering more restrictions. Businesses and establishments in Bengaluru and other places have already expressed their objections to the restrictions that add to their mounting losses due to the pandemic-induced lockdowns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengaluru-logs-9k-new-covid-cases-out-of-state-s-12k-101641755544116.html
10-01-2022||India||Congress begins Mekedatu march despite Covid-19 restrictions||The Congress in Karnataka on Sunday began its 10-day ‘padayatra’ (march), demanding implementation of the Mekedatu project across the Cauvery river, despite the Covid-19 restrictions and opposition from the BJP.Thousands of people poured into Sangama in Kanakpura taluka in Ramanagara district to take part in the 100-km padayatra. Leaders of the Congress at the national, state, and district local levels landed at the venue which resembles a large fair with performers, loud speakers and huge stages to host the people who are in Ramanagara on the first day of the march.Apart from pressuring the Basavaraj Bommai-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government to initiate works on the contentious Mekedatu project, the padayatra is also an attempt by the Sonia Gandhi-led party to mobilise support ahead of crucial local elections in the state over the next few months and 2023 assembly polls.DK Shivakumar, the president of the Congress party in Karnataka, is hoping to find his footing and get some traction in his favour within an organisation torn between him and leader of opposition Siddaramaiah.“Only one aim - Mekedatu! And we are on the way to fulfil it!,” he said in a post on Twitter.The sea of blue hats continued its journey with leaders walking with their respective entourages.Though Siddaramaiah did begin his march, he was forced to leave after feeling unwell, according to reports.“Congress has undertaken politically motivated Mekedatu padayatra to fool the people. But you can’t fool the people again and again,” Basavaraj Bommai, the chief minister of Karnataka, said on Sunday.He added that the Congress was unable to submit a proper detailed project report during its five-year tenure.“Now as the assembly elections are approaching, they have taken out the padayatra with political motivation. A sense of guilt is haunting them as they had not done anything for implementing the project during their reign. So they are out to fool the people. This is a political padayatra,” the chief minister said.The BJP government has warned of action against the proposed march as it violates Covid-19 restrictions over a rise in infections across the state.“I pray with folded hands to the chief minister that he should withdraw the curfew. Take back the ban imposed by the DC (district collector). This struggle is for you as well since you also want to start the project and it is the duty of any political party to undertake such struggles,” Shivakumar told a local Kannada channel on Sunday morning.The Congress is hoping to repeat its 2010 march from Bengaluru to Ballari, about 320 kms, during the peak of the illegal mining scandal against then BJP minister and kingpin, Gali Janardhana Reddy, that eventually led to the collapse of the BJP’s first government in southern India and reduced the party to just 40 seats in 2013 as against 110 in 2008.The Congress is also trying to get various communities to back the march as part of its efforts to mobilise support, especially in the Old Mysuru region where it has a tough battle with the Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) and even the BJP which has steadily increased its footprint in the Vokkaliga heartland.However, not all sections lent support for the cause.Kannada actor Chetan Kumar expressed his reservations over the project and the harm it actually would cause.“BJP/Congress/JDS want ₹9,000cr reservoir project that submerges 12,000 acres of forest in Mekedatu w/ Congress pushing for it via a padayatra. We oppose this environmentally-disastrous demand & all 3 opportunistic parties. We want dam project dropped immediately,” the actor said in a post on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-begins-mekedatu-march-despite-covid-19-restrictions-101641755484707.html
10-01-2022||India||CBI files case against Tamil Nadu rights group for FCRA rules violation||Based on a complaint from 2014, the CBI has registered a case against Madurai-based Centre for Promotion of Social Concerns (CPSC) under the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 1976.The move comes at a time when the union ministry of home affairs removed 6,000 organisations, including Oxfam India, from the list of registered organisations under the FCRA from January 1.CPSC is a trust founded in 1981 and runs a programme unit called “People’s Watch” founded by well-known human rights advocate and activist Henri Tiphagne.People’s Watch is known for taking up cases of human rights violations such as custodial deaths, caste atrocities and extrajudicial killings, including representing the victims of the massacre in Thoothukudi district in 2018 where Tamil Nadu police have been accused of opening fire and killing 13 environment protesters.Tiphange, the executive director of People’s Watch, said CBI officials came with a search warrant to their organisation on Saturday to collect documents reviewed by their peers in 2012 and 2013.An FIR, a copy of which is with HT, was registered in Chennai on January 6, based on a complaint filed by the then director of the foreigners division (FCRA wing) in the Ministry of Home Affairs, AK Sinha in 2014.The complaint said the ministry conducted two inspections at CPSC in 2012 and 2014 and had found that after the suspension of FCRA registration, the organisation had withdrawn ₹28 lakh in July 2012.Another amount of ₹1.69 crore was withdrawn from 2008 to 2012 which did not tally with the available vouchers.Foreign contributions of ₹4454,000 were withdrawn in cash from 2011 to 2013 on 240 occasions.“The association used foreign contributions for a purpose other than for which it was received,” the FIR stated.The complaint added that People’s Watch was acting like a separate entity communicating directly with foreign contribution guarantee organisations and most of the vouchers and bills were not in the name of CPSC.The organisation has now been booked under sections 120-B r/w, 420 IPC, section 33,35 39, r/w 7, 8 and 13 of FCRA 2010.The FIR also added that in 2020, the then Tamil Nadu government (under the AIADMK) conveyed its consent to the CBI for investigation in the matter.Withdrawal and transfer of sums in the FIR were all legal under the law during that period (before an amendment to the FCRA), said Tiphange.“The FIR is coming 10 years later. It is based totally on falsehood,” said Tiphange.He said the details of the FIR relate to the period 2008-2012 on the basis of which there were three successive suspensions under the FCRA issued by the previous government.“After the third suspension order was given in 2013, we challenged that in the Delhi high court and in May 2014, the ministry of home affairs opened our bank account and said they have no problems in our functioning,” said Tiphange.“My simple question is—the so called FIR calls it a criminal case with offence of conspiracy and cheating. If that were true, relating to the period of the FIR , the ministry would not have allowed us to open the bank account. In 2016, once again we were forced to be closed. Our FCRA was not renewed and we went to court once again. It is pending in the Delhi high court.”Tiphange took to the social media to establish his position. “The union government believes that by intimidating us in these ways, we, the human rights workers, can be silenced,” he said during his Facebook live on Sunday.He took to Twitter to say that their FCRA account has been frozen for more than 2,500 days. “If this is not vindictiveness, what is it? We are willing to cooperate because of our trust in the rule of law.”
10-01-2022||India||Fresh case against actor Dileep, brother||The Kerala police crime branch on Sunday registered a fresh case against Malayalam actor Dileep, his brother and four others for allegedly threatening the investigating officer in the 2017 actor abduction and sexual assault case. The sensational case took a fresh turn after director Balachandra Kumar’s interview to a TV channel in December last year in which he claimed Dileep was in possession of tapes of the assault. He also submitted several audio tapes to the police. In one of the tapes, one person allegedly identified as Anoop, Dileep’s brother, can be beard talking about a conspiracy to kill investigating officer Baiju Paulose. The conservation allegedly took place in November 2017 at the actor’s house in Aluva in Ernakulam district, the crime branch has said in its FIR. In another audio clip, a muffled voice is heard talking about using a truck to run over Paulose. “We may have to look at another ₹one-and-a-half crore in this regard,” the voice was heard saying, the crime breach pointed out in the FIR. The new FIR has been filed against six Dileep, brother Anoop, another relative Suraj, and two others (Appu and Babu) and a man director Kumar addressed as the ‘VIP.’ Police also started a fresh inquiry to reveal the identity of the so-called VIP. The accused are charged under Indian penal code sections 116 (abetment of offence), 118 (concealing design to commit an offence), 120 B (criminal conspiracy) and 506 (criminal intimidation). A senior police official of the crime branch said all accused including Dileep will be questioned in a couple of days. Crime branch Additional Director of Police S Sreejith is supervising the investigation. After Kumar’s revelations, the Kerala government approached the Supreme Court last week with a plea to extend the trial for six more months. Kumar, a former friend of actor Dileep, claimed two weeks ago that the actor was in possession of the video of the assault on a woman actor and that he tried to influence many witnesses in the case. He also alleged that he had met the main accused in the case, Pulsar Suni, at the residence of actor Dileep in 2016 when he had gone there to discuss a film project. Later the prosecution moved a plea in the court to record Kumar’s statement under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The case relates to an incident in 2017 in which a woman actor was waylaid, kidnapped and sexually assaulted by a gang in Kochi while she was returning home after a shooting assignment. Six months after the incident, Dileep was arrested and made an accused in the case. Prosecution alleged that the attack was planned at the behest of Dileep to settle an old score with the woman. New allegations against Dileep and prosecution’s demand for a fresh probe surfaced at a time when the trial court’s six-month extension given by the Supreme Court is set to expire on February 16. Dileep was not available for his comment. But last week, he wrote to state police chief Anil Kant seeking Paulose’s removal. He said the officer was trying to influence film workers with whom he has uneasy relations and forcing them to depose against him. He said the controversial interview of director Balachandra Kumar was part of this plot and sought to examine call records of Paulose to buttress his charge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fresh-case-against-actor-dileep-brother-101641754823823.html
10-01-2022||India||High fever, shivering among common symptoms for children with Covid: Expert||High fever and shivering are the common symptoms found in COVID-19 infected children and adolescents in the age group of 11-17 years, informed Dr Dhiren Gupta, Paediatric Pulmonologist at Sir Gangaram Hospital in Delhi on Sunday.Speaking to ANI, Dr Gupta who has been treating COVID-19 infected children and adolescents said, "Children and adolescents between the age group of 11 to 17 years who are infected with coronavirus infection are witnessing high fever and shivering."According to the health expert, COVID-19 infected infants under two years of age are also witnessing high fever and shivering and some of them even require hospitalization."I have treated around nine infants infected with COVID-19, of which one required ventilation support. As is the case with other patients, infants required hospitalization because of high-grade fever," Dr Gupta said.He further informed that the severity of the infection in adults is lesser as compared to that of delta variant of coronavirus while the same cannot be said for the infants."As per my experience, babies with less than two years of age belong to a high-risk group and the infection severity in them is almost same as that of delta variant. While those in the age bracket of 11- 18 years are having more symptoms but their case is not as severe as that of the delta," he added.Speaking on the manifestations of the Omicron variant of COVID-19, the health expert said, "This time, we have found that the virus primarily affects the upper respiratory tract of the patient. Thus, the infection exhibits symptoms like cold, headache, nasal discharge and fever with shivering."Comparing the symptoms exhibited by coronavirus infection during the second wave to that of now, Dr Gupta said, "Contrary to the second wave, it is not very common for the Omicron patients to lose the sense of taste and smell. Only two to three per 10 patients are complaining about the loss of taste and smell. This also demonstrates that there is an overlapping between the clinical features of Omicron and delta."The health expert also stated that the Omicron symptoms in vaccinated and healthy people are less severe than those who are unvaccinated, especially with comorbidities."The patients who are taking some immunosuppressant, they're predisposed to the lung involvement, that is, pneumonia. Till now, I have come across three patients who have developed pneumonia. They required steroids for the treatment," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-fever-shivering-among-common-symptoms-for-children-with-covid-expert-101641751053611.html
10-01-2022||India||Despite Covid restrictions, Andhra getting ready for traditional cockfights||Ignoring a court ban, police restriction and latest threat of Omicron variant of coronavirus, people of coastal Andhra Pradesh are getting ready for cockfights - their traditional winter sports that involves large scale gambling running into rupees hundreds of crores.The blood-sport held for three days during Sankranti festivities starting Friday, involves a fight between two trained roosters fitted with razor-sharp blades and knives on their legs. The fight continues till one of the cocks faces death or backs off.More than 1,000 “baris” (arenas) are being readied for the cockfights in East Godavari, West Godavari, Krishna and parts of Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram. “More than 500 arenas are erected only in the two Godavari districts, which are known for the traditional games,” said V Raju, correspondent of a vernacular television channel from Eluru in West Godavari district.Like every year, the police have announced that stringent measures would be taken to prevent holding of cockfights, this year, too. West Godavari superintendent of police Rahul Dev Sarma said the police would use drone cameras this time to keep a tab on the cockfights during the Sankranti festival.He said the police had already seized thousands of cock knives tied to feet of fighting roosters and notices were served on the suspected cockfight organisers.On Thursday, the high court admitted a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking to impose curbs on the cockfights and asked the state government to submit details on the measures taken to prevent the bloody game. The petitioner pointed out that the high court had banned cockfights in 2017 and it was upheld by Supreme Court in 2018. “Yet, the cockfights have been going on every year, as the police have failed to implement the court orders,” he argued.According to official figures released by the state police department, as many as 1,006 cases pertaining to cockfights were booked, 4,072 people were arrested, an amount of ₹47.93 lakh was seized and 1,739 cocks were confiscated in 2021.“This is just an eyewash. The police make a lot of hungama a week before the commencement of the cockfights. But when the real cockfights begin on the night of January 13, the police quietly disappear from the scene,” Raju said.Everything is done rather openly. “Tents are erected with seating arrangements for thousands of people coming from different parts of the state and also neighbouring states like Telangana and Karnataka. From politicians to big businessmen to rich farmers to even NRIs, everybody takes part in cockfights,” he said.According to Ayyappa Swamy, a cockfight enthusiast from Bhimavaram, a major hub for cockfighting, more than ₹1,500 crore changes hands in these three days in the form of betting. “The betting ranges from ₹2 crore to ₹15 crore on each fight, depending on the people involved,” he said.Swamy said this year, the local political leaders are betting big money on the game. “It is the best way to mobilise funds for the coming elections. These leaders have spent huge money in the local body elections held last year and they have to get back their money through cockfights,” he said.The entire Godavari belt gets festive look during the Sankranti festival and hotels are packed with punters coming from different parts of the state. “During this season, it is very difficult to get a hotel room in Bhimavaram. Some big hotels charge not less than ₹10,000 per room per day,” Swamy said.The cockfights also provide a brisk business for liquor shops, eateries and fast food centres. There would also be make shift casinos for gambling and card games. “Even entertainment programmes like dances and singing are arranged for the visitors,” he said.What about Omicron scare? “Yes, definitely there is a threat, when there is a mass gathering of so many people for cockfights. But it is a sensitive issue connected to the emotions of the people. We are only requesting the people to follow the Covid-19 protocols and avoid mass gathering. It is for the revenue and police department people to enforce the rules,” said state director of health G Hymavathi.

Active cases have also risen to 34,902.The state also reported 30 deaths taking the total to 49,591, said the health department. After Maharashtra, Kerala reported maximum Covid-19 deaths in the country.At least 25,000 backlog deaths were added to the list as per the directive of the Supreme Court after last July.Though cases are on the rise in the state no rush is visible in hospitals and bed occupancy is less than fifty per cent in most of the hospitals. Experts said high vaccination rate (99 pc got double shots and 81 per cent received both) is the major reason for slight symptoms and many remain in quarantine in their homes.On Omicron front also cases are going up steadily, 333 now. First case of the new variant was reported on Dec 7 and numbers crossed 300 in a month’s time, statistics show.Experts said good vaccination rate will help contain the new threat of Omicron but they want people to ensure covid-appropriate behavior.

10-01-2022||India||KCR, Left meet leads to talk of realignment of anti-BJP forces||An impromptu meeting held by Telangana Rashtra Samithi president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao with national leaders of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Communist Party of India in Hyderabad on Saturday led to the talk of realignment of political forces to take on the BJP at the national level.KCR hosted lunch for CPI (M) national general secretary Sitaram Yechuri, Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, former Tripura chief minister Manik Sircar, CPI (M) politburo members Ramachandran Pillai, Balakrishnan and others at his Pragathi Bhavan residence.Later, he held a separate meeting with senior CPI leaders including its national general secretary D Raja, CPI parliamentary party leader and Kerala MP Binay Viswam, Kerala revenue minister Rajan, Telangana CPI general secretary Chada Venkat Reddy and state secretaries Palla Venkat Reddy and Kunamneni Sambasiva Rao.The CPI (M) leaders were in Hyderabad to attend the three-day meeting of the party’s central committee, while the CPI leaders were there to participate in the All India Youth Federation meetings.An official release from the chief minister’s office said the national leaders of the Left parties had made a courtesy call to the chief minister and they discussed with KCR various issues including the national political scenario and the development of Telangana.However, a senior TRS leader familiar with the development said the Left parties had sought the cooperation of the chief minister in consolidation of the anti-BJP forces in the country so as to get rid of the saffron party in the next general elections.“KCR discussed with them in detail the anti-people policies of the National Democratic Alliance government at the Centre, including paddy procurement issue, massive disinvestment in public sector undertakings, usurping of powers of the states which is against the federal spirit, misuse of central agencies to target BJP’s political rivals etc.,” the party leader said.The inherent weakness of the Congress party in various states and its inability to take on the BJP at the national level also came up for discussion at the meeting of the Left leaders with KCR. “They also discussed the need to consolidate all the like-minded parties to create an anti-BJP platform in the coming days,” the TRS leader said.While the Kerala chief minister tweeted that it was a fruitful interaction with his Telangana counterpart, CPI national general secretary Raja told reporters on Sunday that it was time all secular parties and organisations come together to resist the anti-people policies of the Narendra Modi government at the Centre and the communal politics of the BJP.Reacting to the meeting between the TRS chief and the national leaders of the Left parties, BJP state leader Bandi Sanjay said the communists had lost their relevance in the country. “It is ridiculous that KCR, who had once heckled the Left parties, invited them for lunch. The CPI (M) strongly opposed the formation of Telangana and it is unfortunate that the TRS is joining hands with anti-Telangana parties,” he said.All India Congress Committee spokesman Dasoju Sravan said KCR was luring the Left parties to realise his dream of playing a role in the national politics. “The communists have not been consistent in their stand towards the TRS. They took up agitations against KCR government’s policies and at the same time, supported the TRS in local body election. They should take cognizance of KCR’s covert understanding with the BJP for the last seven years,” Sravan said.
10-01-2022||India||Abandoned tiger cub develops cataract, rewilding prospects hit||The ambitious programme of the Kerala forest department to reintroduce to the wild an abandoned tiger cub named Mangala in Periyar Tiger Reserve suffered a jolt after it developed serious cataract, a senior official said adding that in the present situation, chances of releasing her in the wild are slim. HT had reported in June 2021 that the cub was around two months old when two forest guards on patrol duty had spotted her in November 2020. The hind legs were paralysed, she had issues with vision and had suffered some injuries. At the time, forest officials had told HT it was difficult for the cub to survive but the ramped up efforts to treat her. They named her Mangala since she was found near the Mangala Devi temple near Kumily (Idukki). Now, the forest department is planning to import a drug from the United States called Lanosterol, which experts said can help dissolve the cataract to an extent. An expert committee has been formed to study the future of the rewilding -- as the process of reintroducing animals to the wild in known -- in the prevailing circumstances, the senior official who did not want to be quoted said. “Its vision was blocked about 80 per cent at one point but after intense treatment, it came down to 60%. Chances of releasing it in the wild are ruled out in the present scenario. We are hoping against hope,” said the official. CChief veterinary officer Arun Zacharia however is still optimistic about the rewilding process. “When it was recovered in November 2020, it was staring at imminent death. Its hind legs were paralysed and its vision was poor. Mother usually abandons its cub in extreme situation. We brought her back to life and she has started showing wild instincts fast,” said Zacharia. He said Lanosterol was being imported because surgery was not possible. “The medicine is not used in India and we heard it is very effective in fighting cataract. We hope it will help regain its vision fast,” he said. Officials said cost of a 5 ml vial of Lanosterol is around ₹16,000. Intensive treatment and physiotherapy had restored her hind legs in six months. At one point, three veterinary doctors and three foresters were at her disposal and a physiotherapist was engaged to rectify her limp, he said. Now, 14-month old Mangala weighs a healthy 50 kg and is kept in a natural enclosure. Officials said her wilding lessons were on track and were planning to release her into the wild once she attained the age of two years. Now however, the process will be delayed. “We have created a small natural forest near her present enclosure and started releasing small prey to acclimatise her with wild surroundings. She has passed a least half of her lessons despite her poor sight. She has won many battles; we hope she will come out this malady also,” said the senior official. Rewilding is a tiresome process aimed at restoring wilderness areas and atmosphere.It includes connecting such areas and protecting or reintroducing key predators and prey. The most high-profile experiment to rewild tigers was in Madhya Pradesh, where two tiger cubs were found abandoned in the Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve in 2017. They were one and a half months old. The two cubs, however, did not become used to the idea of killing their prey and were eventually shifted to Bhopal’s zoological park in 2020.In Maharashtra, attempts to rewild cubs have not succeeded. The cub of tigress Avni, who was hunted down in November 2018, was not able to survive in the wild and had to be sent to a zoo. In Pench, a male cub had to be sent to a zoo as he was not able to survive in the wilderness. However, Malini, a tigress, adapted to the wild easily after being kept in an enclosure for several months.Much before her, a hand-reared orphaned cub was successfully re-introduced in the Panna Tiger Reserve in 2010 and it mated with a tigress from Bandhavgarh a year later, reviving the tiger population in the Madhya Pradesh reserve that had lost all tigers in 2008.

We have booked five cases against the people involved in the incident, under various sections of Indian Penal Code, including rioting, inciting communal passion and destruction of properties,” Atmakur inspector of police BR Krishnaiah told HT on Sunday.According to police, a group of people belonging to a community took up the construction of a place of worship at a disputed site at Thotageri in the town a few days ago. Following a complaint from another community, the municipal, revenue and police officials stopped the construction which had no permission.“On Saturday, the first group resumed construction of the religious structure and the second group tried to stall it. This led to a heated argument between the people of the two communities,” the police officer said.Meanwhile, a local leader representing a national party came there in supporting of his community and the rival group tried to attack him. In the process of fleeing the spot, his car collided with a two-wheeler, causing injuries to two youths. This led to further clashes between the two groups.“The agitated rival community attacked the police station with stones and sticks, on coming to know that the political leader was lodging a complaint with the police. They ransacked his car and set it afire. They also set fire to a couple of other vehicles belonging to the rival group,” the inspector said.On receiving information, Atmakur deputy superintendent of police Yerragunta Sruthi rushed to the spot with additional police forces to disperse the mob by carrying out baton charge. “But the agitators went on ransacking the police station and attacked the cops with stones.

10-01-2022||India||Pakistani boat captured off Gujarat coast, 10 crew members held||The Indian Coast Guard (ICG) apprehended a Pakistani fishing boat with ten crew members in Indian waters in the Arabian sea off the Gujarat coast, it said on Sunday.The boat, named ‘Yaseen,’ was intercepted by the ICG vessel ‘Ankit’ during the operational patrol on Saturday night.When the crew members of the boat failed to justify their presence in Indian waters after being questioned, the ICG ship apprehended it, the ICG said in a release.The boat tried to flee towards the Pakistani waters, but due to the quick response by the ICG ship, it was made to stop and apprehended, said the ICG.Around 2,000 kg fish and 600 litres of diesel were seized from the boat, the ICG said, adding that the boat is registered at Keti Bandar in Pakistan.The apprehended boat, with the ten crew members, is presently being towed to Porbandar for detailed investigation and joint interrogation, it said.“Indian Coast Guard ship ‘Ankit’ during an operational patrol at the Arabian Sea apprehended a Pakistani fishing boat ‘Yaseen’ along with 10 Pakistani crew, operating in Indian waters during the intervening night of January 8, 2022,” the ICG said in a release.During the initial boarding, PFB Yaseen registered at Ketibandar was found in possession of approximately 2000 kgs of the fish catch along with 600 litres of diesel, the ICG added.Sometimes, Pakistani fishing boats cross the notional international maritime boundary and enter Indian waters during fishing expeditions. There has also been a rise in cases of such boats being used to smuggle contraband drugs through the Gujarat coast.The Indian Coast Guard had on September 15 last year apprehended a Pakistani boat with 12 crew members in the Indian waters off the Gujarat coast.On December 20, a Pakistani fishing boat with six crew members on board and carrying 77 kg of heroin worth around ₹400 crore was apprehended in the Indian waters off the Gujarat coast by the ICG in a joint operation with the state Anti Terrorist Squad (ATS).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistani-boat-captured-off-gujarat-coast-10-crew-members-held-101641753984065.html
10-01-2022||India||Health staff, senior citizens to get 3rd dose of vaccine from today||High-risk heath and front line workers, and senior citizens with co-morbidities can from today walk into any vaccination centre for inoculation with a third precautionary dose, provided the second dose was taken nine months ago. They can also book a slot online through the government’s CoWIN portal. “The facility to get an appointment online for the precautionary dose was opened on Saturday on the CoWIN system, and it is always better to opt for it to avoid any sort of inconveniences later on,” an official said. “The walk-in option is always there.” “The eligible beneficiaries need not register again on the CoWIN platform for their third dose,” the official said, requesting anonymity. “They can simply book a slot of their third dose.”The central government has already issued detailed guidelines to all states and Union Territories, and conducted several meetings on how to implement the process smoothly. The third shot of Covid-19 vaccines will be of the same as the first two doses. “It will be a homologous third or precautionary dose,” VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, said at a recent briefing of the health ministry. “Those who have received Covaxin will receive Covaxin, and those who have earlier received primary two doses of Covishield will receive Covishield,” The policy could be reviewed as and when the government gets more information and data on other vaccines, especially on mixing of doses, Paul said. The third doses are part of the government’s next phase on coronavirus vaccinations, which comes at a time when the country is in the grip of a third wave driven by the highly transmissible Omicron variant. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 25 announced the opening of the phase, beginning with the first of the under-18 population – children between 15-18 – to get a shot from January 3. He also announced expanding the coverage to all health and front line workers, and citizens aged 60 years or above with comorbidities as these were at high risk of getting severe disease. This population group will be able to access the vaccination for precaution dose through their existing CoWIN account, the health ministry said. Eligibility of such beneficiaries for the precautionary dose will be based on the date of administration of second dose as recorded in the CoWIN system. The health ministry also directed private hospitals that function as covid vaccination centres across the country to vaccinate their staff eligible for the precautionary third dose within their hospital, and those eligible beneficiaries who are a part of armed or special forces will take within their system, as was previously done. This category of people needed the additional dose, experts said. “The immune compromised people, or those on such type of treatment or suffering from chronic medical condition that could weaken immunity are vulnerable, and need additional protection,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head, pulmonary medicine department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.
10-01-2022||India||Mumbai’s daily Covid count may be higher: Experts||After recording a massive and consistent spike since the last week of December, Mumbai’s daily caseload has hovered between 19,000 and 20,000 cases over the past four days. The number of tests conducted in the city too, has remained consistently between 67,000 and 72,000. While this may present a picture of a stabilising third wave driven by the Omicron variant, experts warn that the numbers may be far higher that what is being officially reported. The reasons? On the one hand, an increased reliance on home test kits that allows no official supervision on positive cases, and on the other hand, asymptomatic persons who are not undergoing any tests at all. Though the daily caseload has risen by nearly 44% since December 31, the city on Sunday recorded 19,474 cases which is a 4% decline over the previous day’s 20,318 cases. Even the number of tests conducted — 68,249 — was down by 2,770 from Saturday, official figures showed. As a result, the daily test positivity rate (TPR) declined, too. In fact, TPR (a function of the number of positive cases per tests conducted) has steadily declined since last week, from 29.90% on Thursday to 28.90% on Friday, 28.60% on Saturday and 28.53% on Sunday. Experts said that TPR is no longer the most reliable indicator to judge the spread of the pandemic as a large number of people with less severe symptoms are choosing not to get tested and many are opting for home self-testing kits.Hospitalisation rates, however, must be tracked as they indicate the extent of the disease burden of the third wave, experts said. In the last one week alone, the Covid-bed occupancy has gone up to 21% from around 15% a week back.Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force member Dr Shashank Joshi said that Mumbai’s wave seems to have flattened with daily cases between 19,000 to 20,000. “But the true picture is difficult [to judge] due to the wide use of unreported rapid tests,” he said.“We need to focus on the other criteria like doubling rate, hospitalisations, patients needing oxygen, ventilator and intensive care. The variant is circulation is highly transmissible, therefore test positivity is likely to be higher,” said Joshi said.As many as seven self-test kits have been approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research including Coviself by Mylab, CoviFind by Meril Diagnostics, PanBio by Abbott among others. These kits are affordable for the middle class, and range anywhere between ₹250 to ₹350.“We have witnessed a jump of almost 700% sales of our self-test kit in Mumbai in the last one week. Self-test kit is turning out to be highly beneficial given the massive increase in cases because people can get tested quickly and immediately isolate themselves,” said Hasmukh Rawal, managing director and co-founder of Mylab Discovery Solutions, a Pune-based firm that manufactures Coviself. According to reports, nearly 500,000 such kits have been sold in Mumbai in the past week. Chemists in Mumbai have been selling anywhere between 300 to 400 self-testing rapid antigen kits daily. “Every chemist has been reporting a high demand, but it seems to have slowed down since the past two days, as the panic is settling down,” said Hakim Kapasi, a member of the Andheri Chemist Association, an umbrella body of more than 400 chemists in the Mumbai suburb.Most test kits have a mechanism by which the suspected patient can intimate their positive status on a mobile application, which is then sent to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) portal, and thereafter to the local bodies — but this is optional. The onus is on the user to responsibly update their positive result on the app. As a result, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation cannot accurately capture the number of positive cases detected on home kits.Even so, over the past four days, self-test kits have reported around 3,000 positive results on average every day in Mumbai based on what has been uploaded to the ICMR portal. Between August 1, 2021 and January 7, only 89,326 self-test positive reports in Mumbai were intimated on the portal.“We don’t have any control on reporting of the results of self-testing,” said Mumbai’s executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare. “We have been adding the positive reports that we come to know to our everyday tally,” she said.What’s more, the changing presentation of the disease means that many city physicians have started prescribing tests only in cases where patients have symptoms that persist beyond three days and are likely candidates for hospitalisation or for the monoclonal antibody cocktail drug.Dr Bakul Parekh, a paediatrician from Ghatkopar saw 200-odd patients in the past 10 days, but prescribed RT-PCR tests only for four of them. This hasn’t stopped him from treating his other patients as though they were Covid-positive, he said.“In a surging pandemic, any case of flu-like symptoms should be considered as Covid-19 unless proven otherwise,” said Parekh. “There is no point in testing a patient if the line of treatment does not change with a positive result. Since my patients are children, I start them on symptomatic treatment immediately, and ask them to be isolated from the elders and those with co-morbid conditions in the family. All the children have recovered within three to four days,” he said.“There is no point in unnecessarily burdening the patients as well as the laboratories,” he said.Physician Dr Jalil Parkar from Bandra’s Lilavati Hospital too has been prescribing tests only in cases where the symptoms don’t subside and the patient is a likely candidates for hospital admission. “At a time, there are four to five people in a family who have symptoms. This is because the current wave is driven by the Omicron variant which is highly transmissible. But how many people will you put through the tests when most of them have symptoms like fever, cough and cold, which subsides within five days?” he asked.According to Parkar, some patients prefer testing with or without a doctor’s prescription. “I put my patients on paracetamol and other symptomatic treatment, watch them for three days and if symptoms don’t subside, I write the test just in case they need hospitalisation. But most recover by then,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbais-daily-covid-count-may-be-higherexperts-101641752847481.html
10-01-2022||India||Passengers opt for flexible air tickets amid Omicron scare: travel portals||NEW DELHI: The Omicron scare has halted revival of the travel industry for the period and passengers have started deferring their trips, travel portals said. They also mentioned that the travel demand has seen a slight drop and travellers are emphasising on hygiene and safety before selecting a destination.“The current customer trends showcase a strong emphasis on safety and hygiene, and customers are now starting to choose places that uphold high safety standards and which are following Covid-safe protocols. In 2021, we experienced a 400% jump in advance bookings for flight tickets for the year-end holidays; however, the dawn of the Omicron variant halted the travel revival that we expected for this period. Despite this new surge, the travel sentiment remains strong,” said Rikant Pittie, co-founder, EaseMyTrip.“Customers are yearning to travel once the restrictions are lifted. Even with new variants, restrictions and limitations, the travel industry is expected to only grow further in the coming year as industry stakeholders and travellers are gradually adapting to the evolved travel norms,” Pittie added.According to ratings agency ICRA, the rising infections due to Omicron variant could have some impact on the passenger traffic due to the passengers being apprehensive for air travel and also a few state governments imposing restrictions.“However, there has been limited impact due to the Omicron in December 2021. The average daily passenger for the week beginning December 27, 2021 was at 3.4 lakh when compared to 3.7 lakh and 3.6 lakh during the week beginning Dec 20, 2021 and Dec 13, 2021,” said Rajeshwar Burla, vice president and group head, corporate ratings, ICRA.While there is some softening in demand due to rising Omicron cases in the country, Cleartrip said that the travellers are looking for flexible travel options that have them covered in case there is a sudden change in regulations due to the new Covid-19 variant.“As a result, we are seeing a higher interest in our products - EzCancel that offers a 100% refund on cancellations and Flexifly which enables consumers to change plans. Customers buying Flexifly VAS have doubled since November while EZCancel is also seeing a spike in the adoption,” said Prahlad Krishnamurthi, chief business officer, Cleartrip.Cleartrip has seen an increase in modification and cancellation of existing bookings over the last couple of weeks as travellers are adjusting their plan due to revised advisories. Krishnamurthi said, “In 2022, the domestic flight trends are looking very strong compared to 2021. Metro destinations are on track to exceed 2021 numbers.”While Yatra.com said that it is too early to comment regarding summer travel, its spokesperson also said that travellers are more mindful of the destinations and properties they choose. “They are opting for travel and accommodation options following stringent procedures of safety and sanitisation measures at each touchpoint,” Yatra.com spokesperson reiterated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/passengers-opt-for-flexible-air-tickets-amid-omicron-scare-travel-portals-101641743483171.html

Many also have a sneaking foreboding that 2021 was merely a stage-setter for a more consequential 2022. While the best case scenario for 2022 is greater stability and fewer geopolitical tensions, there is a feeling that the region may yet again be beset by its well-known problems.

The commission has, after prolonged deliberations, recommended 47 seats for Kashmir and 43 seats for Jammu in the 90-member legislature to be formed in the newly constituted UT. The Kashmiri leadership is angry that of the seven additional seats, six were given to Jammu and only one to Kashmir. But some leaders in Jammu complain that the commission has founded its recommendations on the Census data of 2011, which according to them, was a greatly manipulated one.
10-01-2022||Today's||The Political Eye | A tale of two states, two elections, two men||Two decades ago, Narendra Modi wanted to become Gujarat’s chief minister (CM). As a powerful organisational functionary within the national unit of his party, with deep roots in Gujarati society, amid internal factionalism in the state unit, he believed he had a rightful claim to the position. But Modi knew that the only way he could offset the political stature and caste-based advantage of the then CM, Keshubhai Patel, was with New Delhi’s blessings. That is precisely what happened at the end of 2001, as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leadership – Atal Bihari Vajpayee and LK Advani; the latter was Modi’s primary benefactor – bet on Modi and parachuted him to Gandhinagar to neutralise the emerging anti-incumbency in the state.
