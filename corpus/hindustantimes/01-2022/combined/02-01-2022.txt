Additional staff will also be deputed for vaccinating people in the 15-18 age group. All these centres will get around 300 Covaxin doses per day.Officials said that the department is aiming to vaccinate more than 8,000 children on a daily basis. “Both online and offline services are available for booking slots at all these centres. People can pre-register the slots online. If slots are not available, all these centres can also allow walk-in beneficiaries. People need to carry valid identity cards as mandated by the government,” said Dr Neeraj Tyagi, district immunisation officer. According to the officials, most of the online slots for Monday have been booked. The 27 government centres comprises 22 schools and five government hospitals. A team of doctors and nurses will also be available at all these centres, to prevent any adverse event, said the officials.Several private centres will also start vaccinating people in the age group of 15-18 age group. Kailash Hospital in Greater Noida, Felix Hospital and Sharda Hospital in Noida are among the private centres with the maximum vaccination rate in the district, and these hospitals will start vaccinating people in the 15-18 age group from Monday. “We are among the few centres in Greater Noida, which has the Covaxin doses to be administered to the teenagers. Two sessions have been especially reserved for them. We will also have a paediatrician at the vaccination site for health checkups 24X7,” said Dr Ajit Kumar, spokesperson of Sharda Hospital. Felix Hospital has started a 24x7 vaccination drive for the teenagers and it will conduct free general health checkup for the children, and also their parents before the vaccination. “The vaccine, allowed by the government, is completely safe for the children, and their guardians should not hesitate in getting them vaccinated. Weighing the pros and cons, it is always better to have the children protected, rather than worrying about their well-being. Though the effects of the disease have been mostly mild among the children, it has also been seen that fully vaccinated people (who have been administered both the doses of the Covid vaccines) have had very mild symptoms even if they test positive,” said Dr DK Gupta, paediatirician and chairman of Felix Hospital. Meanwhile, another mock drill will also be conducted at five centres across the district on Monday and Tuesday, to check preparedness to handle an increase in paediatric cases at the government hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/over-115-000-teenagers-likely-to-get-covid-jab-in-noida-says-health-department-101641148107508.html

He retired in 2018 and joined AAP in December 2020.“Everything was being managed from Delhi, what to do, when to organise a press conference and so on. Here we couldn’t decide anything. So, I was feeling suffocated in the AAP and decided to join the Congress,” said Chauhan.Rajeev Mehrishi, media in-charge of Congress state unit, said Chauhan, a former inspector-general of police in Uttarakhand, and many others took membership of the Congress and stressed that the people of the entire state were suffering due to inflation, corruption and unemployment.Ganesh Godiyal, state Congress president, said Chauhan joining the Congress will definitely strengthen the party in the state.AAP leader SS Kaler said Chauhan was never interested in strengthening the party in the state as he had great expectations from the party which were not fulfilled. “So, he has chosen the easy way out and joined the Congress.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/in-setback-to-uttarakhand-aap-top-leader-anant-ram-chauhan-joins-congress-101641147744631.html

Several malls on MG Road, Sohna Road and Golf Course Road witnessed high footfall on Saturday and Sunday as people visited there for New Year celebrations but had to face problems due to the vaccination directive by the state government.According to a recent directive by the Haryana government, from January 1, public places such as malls, public transport, parks, religious places, and restaurants will be out of bounds for those who are not fully vaccinated.Akash Oberoi, president, MGF Metropolitan mall on MG Road, said that the government has passed the order but failed to spread awareness. “This notification has created a chaos. During the peak season, we have more people outside the mall than inside,” he said. Visitors alleged that the security guards at the entrance of the mall were not well trained to check the certificates. Rohan Shukla, a resident of Saket in Delhi who visited the mall, said that his group used same certificate to enter the mall and the guard could not even check the name and details. “Same certificate was used by four of us. It is waste of time standing at the entry gates,” he said. Another visitor said that it took him 30 minutes to enter the mall. “There were more than 50 people standing in the queue and no one was maintaining social distancing. It’s just an eyewash to show implementation of the vaccination directive,” said Nakul Tiwari, a resident of Gurugram’s Sector 10. Shop keepers at some malls said that in many cases, people did not update their vaccination certificates leading to chaos. They fear that their business will suffer on account of the fully inoculated rider. Aman Bajaj, one of the shop owners at the Metropolitan mall, said that people are unaware of the new directives and most of them don’t have their certificates handy. “This has hit our business badly. We accept the measures, but a little awareness would do the needful,” he said. The state government on Saturday also ordered that malls and markets would be allowed to open only till 5pm in five districts, including Gurugram, which have high Covid-19 caseload. “The extension of the deadline will be helpful for business, as the 6-8pm window is the peak time for customer inflow,” Bajaj said. Amit Kamboj, a shopkeeper at Metropolis mall on MG Road, said, “Most people in the 18-45 age group, who visit malls with friends and families, have not been fully vaccinated. But they should be allowed to carry their RT-PCR negative test report not older than three days.” Gurugram deputy commissioner Yash Garg said that they are implementing the government’s directives strictly to check the spread of Covid-19. “The number of cases are rising, and following Covid-19 protocols will help to remain safe,” he said, adding that people should wear a facemask and ensure social distancing at public places. The Haryana government on Saturday announced several restrictions in five districts, including Gurugram and Faridabad. The restrictions, which will be in place till January 12, include closure of cinema halls, theatres, and multiplexes in these five districts for 10 days.

The Haryana government on Sunday also issued directions for closure of in-person classes in colleges and universities till January 12. “The inter-department committees in the districts should be kept on alert so that their services can be utilised when required. The deputy commissioners must conduct a review of hospitals, oxygen plants and other medical equipment required to meet the situation,” Khattar said in the meeting. Following directions from Khattar, the Gurugram district administration on Sunday said that they are strictly imposing the Covid-19 guidelines and will penalise the violators. “As per the directions of the chief minister, this time not only individual violators but institutions will also face penalties. We are also reactivating the Covid control room for better coordination with hospitals, civic bodies and private agencies,” said Yash Garg, deputy commissioner, Gurugram. The officials said that an individual violator will be fined ₹500, while an institutional violator will attract a fine of ₹5,000.Besides, a key focus area on which the district administration is working is to streamline the home isolation system so that there is a better management of patients at home itself. “We are trying to ensure that a team of doctors is available for home patients, while counsellors can guide them and also reach them in case of hospitalisation,” Garg said.

The reading campaign is designed differently for each standard,” said Singh.He added that to gain a basic understanding and information about things, reading is a must.“This reading campaign will acquaint students with knowledge and in depth exposure to local things well.

02-01-2022||Lucknow||Prime Minister says Yogi government now plays jail-jail with criminals in Uttar Pradesh||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday hit out at previous governments in Uttar Pradesh, saying that gangsters and criminals used to play their own games in the state earlier but the Yogi Adityanath government now plays “jail-jail” with them.The Prime Minister was addressing a public meeting after laying the foundation stone for the Major Dhyan Chand Sports University in Meerut.“During previous governments, criminals used to play their games and the mafias used to play their own. Earlier, there used to be tournaments of illegal land grabbing. People making obscene remarks at daughters used to roam freely,” he said. The Prime Minister also said people living in Meerut and adjoining areas can never forget how houses used to be set ablaze here.“The result of these games played by earlier governments was that people were forced to leave their ancestral homes and there was an exodus,” the Prime Minister said.“Now, the Yogi government is playing ‘jail-jail’ with such criminals. Five years ago, the daughters of Meerut used to fear leaving their homes after evening. Today, the daughters of Meerut are bringing laurels to the entire country,” Modi said.Modi also referred to the infamous Sotiganj market of Meerut, which specialised in dismantling stolen cars and selling its parts.“There has been ‘the end’ to the game played with vehicles in the market. Real sports are getting encouragement in UP. The youths of UP are getting an opportunity to make their presence felt in the sports world,” he said.He also accused the previous governments of not making efforts to change the ‘narrow’ mindset towards sports. Modi said the sports world was marred by maladies like games of nepotism, casteism, corruption and discrimination earlier at every level, right from the training to team selection but now the situation had changed.The impact of the change was seen when the country’s athletes won many medals in Olympic and Paralympics, he said.Continuing his attack on previous governments, he said the sugar mills were sold at throwaway prices in UP earlier.“But during the Yogi government, new mills are being opened instead of plants being shut down. Those who were earlier in power used to literally make you hanker to get payments for sugarcane price,” he said.He also said the payment made to farmers during the Yogi government’s term was more than what was paid by the two earlier governments.The PM also mentioned that on Saturday lakhs of farmers from UP had got the money transferred to their bank accounts under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi and that it will benefit small farmers of this region.Laying the foundation stone of the state’s first Major Dhyanchand Sports University at Salawa in Meerut district, he anticipated that world class facilities in the university would help in creating international athletes and sports culture in the country.Stating that Meerut was the “karmsthali” of hockey legend Major Dhyan Chand, he said the Central government named the country’s biggest sports award “Khel Ratna” after Dadda (Dhyan Chand) and now first university of UP will be dedicated to him.He said the university would be set up using a budget of ₹700 crore and it would produce more than 1000 players.The PM said over 1,000 boys and girls will pass out as excellent sportspersons from this upcoming sports university in Meerut.“In other words, the city of revolutionaries will further strengthen its identity as the city of sportspersons,” he said, in an apparent reference to the 1857 revolt against the East India Company beginning in Meerut with its leader sepoy Mangal Pandey attaining an iconic status among the country’s freedom fighters.Modi said youths have the biggest responsibility of making a new India of the 21st century.“The nation would walk on the path on which the youths walk,” he said. The Prime Minister also said his government has connected sports with youths’ fitness and career. It has also introduced many policies with greater transparency, he said.Prime Minister Modi mentioned the sports goods manufacturing industry of Meerut. Meerut units are already exporting sports goods to over 100 countries, he said. This way, Meerut was “making local to global,” he added.He further said sports has been given equal weightage with other subjects in the new National Education Policy.Modi also remembered former Prime Minister and farmer leader the late Chaudhary Charan Singh. He mentioned how the Yogi government helped youths by distributing tablets and smartphones and providing them with record employment.Modi also interacted with national, international players and Olympians before addressing the gathering.He inspected stalls of sports goods which were manufactured in local units.Earlier, Modi arrived by road because of poor visibility for flying. He offered puja at historic Augharnath temple in Meerut cantt which played a vital role in the First War of Independence in May 1857 against British Raj. He, along with governor Anandiben Patel, chief minister Yogi Adityanath and deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, then visited Shaheed Smark and paid tribute to the martyrs of 1857. He also inspected an exhibition of paintings depicting the events of 1857 before heading to the venue of the main function at Salawa village.On his arrival, PM received a warm welcome from the people in Meerut and a huge crowd, chanting ‘Modi- Modi’, was seen along the side of the road.Accepting the greetings of the locals, he also waved back to the crowd while sitting inside his car.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/prime-minister-says-yogi-government-now-plays-jail-jail-with-criminals-in-uttar-pradesh-101641146904679.html

02-01-2022||Pune||Vehicles halting on narrow road make Chandni chowk a risky drive||PUNE While the stretch near Narhe on Mumbai-Bangalore highway has been the focus due to series of mishaps, the other part of the road between Chandni chowk and Wakad is also equally risky, according to regular commuters.At Chandni chowk, many vehicles halt suddenly to pick up passengers going towards Mumbai, posing risk to those driving from behind especially when the highway often witnesses vehicles passing at higher speed.On one hand the ongoing construction of the flyover at Chandni chowk has turned the road narrower, the halting of vehicles, many say, causes problem. At the same time, another stretch on the highway between Warje and Wadgaon is also risky as hawkers selling fruits and vegetables cause hindrance.“I stay at Katraj and go to work at Hinjewadi while passing through Highway. Every day I find vehicles suddenly halting near Chandni chowk or fruit sellers occupying part of the highway. Given that it’s a highway, and vehicles move at a particular speed, such hindrance has in the past turned deadly,” said Avinash Bhosale, an IT engineer.According to the data shared by Pune police, stretch between Bhumkar bridge and Navle bridge have reported 25 accidents in 2020 while part under Sinhgad road jurisdiction saw 20 mishaps and Warje police station recorded 33 accidents.Besides accidents, the congestion due to flyover work at Chandni chowk often leads to long queue of vehicles heading towards Mumbai. At the same time, despite various initiatives taken by National Highway Authority of India and police, the Highway near Narhe continues to be risky, as see last week when three persons were killed when a truck hurtled in reverse and run them over.“The major and higher number of accidents occur on the Navle bridge.The traffic police are not on duty to manage heavy traffic coming from all directions under Bhumkar bridge,” said Latika Kunwar, shop owner.The Navle bridge connects Mumbai-Bangalore highway and a left turn to the service road leads to Katraj witnessing such cases often. Abhijeet Shinde, a resident staying on that highway said, “Katraj has become an accident-prone area. Generally, the accidents occur majorly due to two reasons - one, due to bursting of the tyre of a vehicle coming from Bhumkar bridge and secondly the vehicles taking reverse on the bridge.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/vehicles-halting-on-narrow-road-make-chandni-chowk-a-risky-drive-101641145108721.html

At the rally, Sidhu praised the fact that women outnumbered men. “Punjab got a Scheduled Caste (SC) chief minister after 72 years. A new Punjab is emerging and Punjabis will write a fresh script in the new era because new people have come, while people like former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, who looted the state, are not to seen,” he told the rally. Sidhu alleged that the BJP was arm-twisting political leaders to leave the Congress by using central investigating agencies. “Our manifesto will not have 5,000 promises, but only a 13-point agenda, meant for the poor, the labourer and farmer, and not for the 1%, who are already elite people.”He launched an attack on the SAD, alleging that their workers spread lawlessness in the state. “Arvind Kejriwal is running a factory of lies, as he has failed to deliver in the national capital.” On the post-matric scholarship scheme, Sidhu alleged, “The rupees mutli-crore scam in the scholarship scheme for the SC students occurred under the Akalis between 2012-17 by creating fake colleges and admissions. If anyone from the Congress party committed wrong, then he should be punished as we will not defend him.”He added that the NDA government had failed to check runaway inflation, and on top of it was charging unjustified taxes. “I have chosen the Punjab Model with utmost care and for that reason it has accounted for the fact there is a huge population of Punjab, which are NRIs. They need to be valued. It is proposed that a single window clearance portal for NRIs be formed with access to property and land related work to weed out delays, harassment and additional effort,” Sidhu claimed.

The SAD would also be targeted, because it is ruling over the SGPC. What else was the mission of this conspiracy? It was meant to shake the foundations of these organisations, but with the grace of the Guru, the culprit could not succeed,” the jathedar claimed.SAD patriarch and former Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal said, “Dangerous conspiracies to install government stooges as “neo-Masands” in sacred gurdwaras are behind these events. These conspiracies are meant to weaken the Khalsa Panth and dilute its religious identity.” SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal alleged that a conspiracy was afoot to rob the state of its peace. Senior Akali leader and Rajya Sabha member Balwinder Singh Bhundar justified the lynching to death of the Golden Temple sacrilege suspect. Sirsa deceived party which gave it everything: BadalEven as the agenda of the meeting was sacrilege, Delhi-based Sikh leader Manjinder Singh Sirsa, who resigned as chief of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) and later withdrew it, remained the focus of speeches. “I have never named anyone publicly, but I would say that Sirsa deceived the party which gave him everything. His joining the BJP amounts to using bodies of 800 martyrs of the Kisan Andolan to further one’s political career. He should be ashamed,” Badal said. SGPC chief Harjinder Singh Dhami also expressed distress over Sirsa’s move.Sukhbir attacked farm leader Balbir Singh Rajewal. “Kisan organisations used to criticise us, even as we quit the Union ministry and later left the NDA alliance. Now, why is Rajewal inclined towards the BJP?”In the presence of Badals, the jathedar claimed, “Whenever I visit foreign countries, Sikhs complain that the SAD and the SGPC do not talk about an Independent Sikh state or rule. Is this the reason behind their weakening? If these organisations weaken, there will be a ban on recitation of ‘Raj Karega Khalsa’ (Khalsa will rule) under a new rule in the historic gurdwaras. At least, the SGPC is keeping the demand of the Khalsa Rule alive. With the dissolution of the SGPC, this demand will be crushed.” Opposing the recent arrest of Sikh youth Jagmeet Singh for secessionist activities, he said “Today, there is discrimination. We raise no objection if anyone talks about the Hindu Rashtra. However, we don’t accept the arrest of anyone for talking about Sikh Rashtra under sedition charges.” He added, “Is this not excess and tyranny? On the other side, calls are given to kill or eliminate a particular community openly. No action is taken.”“Parkash Singh Badal has said the SAD will abide by what the Akal Takht Sahib directs it do. The SAD has been raising its voice against excesses; it should raise this voice even today if Sikhs or Hindus or Muslims face any kind of excesses,” he added.

We currently send samples to ILS, Bhubaneshwar and it takes 45 days to get reports. I would request if you could also intervene so that we get the reports in 15-20 days,” state health minister Banna Gupta told union minister Mansukh Mandaviya in a review meeting chaired by the latter.Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Gupta said he has also requested the Centre to allow Covaxin to be administered to kids above 12 years of age besides allowing treatment of Covid-19 to be covered under the Ayushman Bharat scheme.“Earlier we thought, there would be a different vaccine for children under the age group of 15-18 years. But since it’s Covaxin that is being administered to them, it could be administered to those above 12 as well. It will help build their immunity,” said Gupta.There are 2.41 crore population above 18 years in the state eligible for vaccination, while an estimated 2.4 lakh of the population fall under the 15-18 category. In the 18 plus category, around 74 % have been administered the first dose and around 45 % have been completely vaccinated with both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine.The state has witnessed an exponential spike in fresh Covid-19 cases in the past week, with the state logging 1,007 cases on Saturday, out of which 495 cases were recorded in Ranchi alone, followed by Dhanbad and Jamshedpur which recorded over 100 cases on January 1.Despite the spike, the state is yet to officially record any case of the new variant Omicron.

02-01-2022||Patna||MG setu reconstruction gets fresh deadline, bridge to become fully operational by May-June||The long-awaited renovation of the eastern flank of Mahatma Gandhi Setu—the communication lifeline between north and south Bihar—is likely to jump the deadline yet again.. The Afcons infrastructure limited, the construction firm allotted the work to rehabilitate the 39-year-old cantilever bridge over the river Ganga by the Central ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH), was given the extended deadline till March this year to finish the project. However, given the pace of work and the recent upsurge in the Covid pandemic, officials of the state road construction department (RCD) said that the eastern flank of the bridge might become operational for traffic by May-June this year. RCD minister Nitin Nabin, who reviewed the progress on the ₹1,742 crore project last week, has categorically told the construction firm to complete the rehabilitation by May 15. “Approximately 95% of the work on span segment and 50% on pier caps have been done. We have stipulated the deadline to finish the project, after which there will be no further extension,” said Nabin, adding that penal action would be initiated in case of failure. RCD officials the minister had asked the firm to adhere to the latest deadline, as operation of the only western flank of the renovated MG Setu was resulting in perennial snarl-ups of heavy vehicles on Patna side. Union MoRTH minister Nitin Gadkari had opened the western flank of the reconstructed bridge for traffic in August 2020, while work to dismantle and renovate on the eastern flank took off in July the same year. The officials said that the reconstruction work, which started in June 2017, had already suffered many deadlines. “Originally the project was set to complete within two years from the start of the work. Accordingly, the western flank of the bridge was to become fully operational by November 2018. But it got delayed owing change in design and classification of materials used in the bridge,” said an RCD engineer deputed to supervise the project. An official of the Afcons Infrastructure said that the supply chain of materials was disturbed owing to the global impact of the pandemic. “Many parts of the steel fabrication for trusses are being imported from other countries. We are sure to hand over the project to the government within the deadline if the Covid pandemic does not take its toll on the supply chain yet again,” he said. 
02-01-2022||Patna||IGIMS begins genome sequencing of Covid-19 samples||PATNA: The Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) on Saturday started conducting genome sequencing, to check the strain of Sars CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, said its director Dr NR Biswas.“We have initiated the process to conduct genome sequencing tests for Covid-19 at our laboratory from January 1 on 24 samples we had collected. It will take a week from the extraction of the RNA to get the test result,” said Dr Biswas.The institute had conducted two trial runs on archived Covid-19 samples between May and November last year.“We found the Delta variant is around 70% of the 24 samples we tested in two rounds during the trial run. The remaining 30% contained virus of no significance,” said Dr Namrata Kumari, professor, and head of, department of microbiology, IGIMS.“We found Delta variant in the sample of a person with travel history of the United Kingdom that we had tested in the last week of November,” she added.After the trial run, the institute had to wait for funds from the state government to procure the reagents, which are costly, before running into a shortage of reagents.“It takes ₹13-15 lakh to run one test, which can accommodate a maximum of 96 samples at a time,” said people familiar with the test.“It will take 10 days to get the final result from the date of collection of the oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swab. The result will, however, depend on the quality and concentration of the DNA,” said Dr Kumari.Explaining the time-consuming process, she said, once the RNA is extracted through a polymerase chain reaction, it has to be converted into DNA and then the genetic material in the organism has to be fragmented to get it into the machine. Chips are used and sequencing is done after the genetic material is put in the cartridge. The machine throws out huge data, which has to be compared with the reference genome data, and then mutations of Delta or Omicron are picked up.This is the first time the institute is conducting genome sequencing with recently collected samples of Covid-19 amid the growing threat of the new variant Omicron across the world. The state reported its first case of Omicron on December 30 when a 26-year-old resident of Patna’s Kidwaipuri locality who returned from New Delhi after meeting his brother, with a travel history to the UK, tested positive for Covid-19. The youth has since recovered, said officials.The IGIMS is the only institute in Bihar to be a part of the Insacog (Indians SARS-CoV-2 consortium on genomics), a network of laboratories working on genomic surveillance of Covid-19, set up under the ministry of health and family welfare to study and monitor genome sequencing and virus variation of circulating strains of Covid-19 in India.The Insacog currently has 35 laboratories working on genome sequencing against 10 national laboratories when it was set up in December 2020.

As many as 75 of the 194 samples tested on real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) were positive on Sunday, while 12 had tested positive on Saturday,” said Dr Binod Kumar Singh, medical superintendent of the NMCH. Five of the 87 doctors and medicos positive at NMCH are hospitalised while the remaining are under home isolation, said superintendent Dr Singh.Two assistant professors, including one who recently returned from Andaman and Nicobar, at AIIMS-Patna, have also tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday, said its nodal officer Dr Sanjeev Kumar. Many doctors to test positive had attended the two-day 96th national annual conference of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) held in Patna between December 27 and 28. Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, speaker of the legislative assembly Vijay Kumar Sinha, health minister Mangal Pandey and education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary were among the political dignitaries to attend the valedictory function of the IMA. “On Sunday, we collected around 194 samples of students and doctors, presently residing in our hostels,” said Dr Hiralal Mahto, principal of the NMCH and also professor and head, department of microbiology at the medical college. “As many as 17 of the 80 samples tested on rapid antigen detection kits on Saturday are positive. Their samples, along with many others, have now been taken for RT PCR test,” said Dr Papu Kumar Saifi, a final year postgraduate student in the department of medicine at the NMCH. A health manager of the Guru Gobind Singh hospital in Patna City has also tested positive for Covid-19 for the fourth time. Patna has shown a sudden spurt in the number of Covid-19 cases, with 405 of the 749 active cases in the state, as per the government’s Covid-19 bulletin on Saturday.

Apart from the hotel management and architect courses all other professional courses saw a good round of admissions for this academic year.”Talking about the overall trend of students going for Pharmacy courses, one of the pharmacy college professors Shrikant Borate said, “Due to the pandemic there was high demand for various types of medicines and other medical equipment’s. Even the business of medical shops and pharmacy industry boomed in last two years, considering this a lot of students are now preferring to go for pharmacy courses after completing Class 12. This is the field which gives job opportunities in any situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/mca-and-pharmacy-courses-on-the-upswing-101641140303845.html
02-01-2022||Pune||Only electric buses to be allowed on ghat leading to Sinhagad fort in Pune from January 26||PUNE The next time you visit to Sinhgad fort on the weekend, you will have to park your private vehicle at the base of the fort and travel by a Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahandal (PMPML) electric bus to the top of the fort. The forest department is planning to stop private vehicles using the ghat section of the fort on weekends, as it causes traffic jams and congestion. Recently, the forest department and PMPML officials conducted a survey of the fort and if everything goes as per plans from January 26, this PMPML bus service will start at Sinhagad fort. There has been heavy rush of tourists visiting Sinhgad fort especially on weekends, causing long queues of vehicles in the ghat section of the fort. Hence, the state forest department had announced a ban on private vehicles on the ghat section on weekends. Instead, tourists will travel by the PMPML’s electric buses. “One of the trusts is ready to give their land for parking of buses and soon we are going to sign an MoU. In a survey done of the fort, we checked for charging stations and other technical things. If all the technical and other administrative things go as per plans in next 15 to 20 days, we will start electric bus service from January 26,” said Rahul Patil, deputy conservator of forests, Pune forest department division. Dattatray Zende, traffic manager of PMPML said, “For the last few days our trials of electric buses on the Sinhagad fort ghat section were going on and now a place has been finalised for buses to park. Also, the charging point stations at the top of the fort and other technical issues have been surveyed by senior PMPML officials. To give the historical details of the fort and share information, a guide will also be there in the bus on the way to the fort. Ticket fares for these electric buses has not yet been finalised.” “It is a good decision to stop private vehicles using the ghat section now people will only have to travel by PMPML buses. Long queues and traffic jams also affect the environment. People waste many hours just going to the fort,” said Kiran Pisal, a regular visitor to Sinhgad fort.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/only-electric-buses-to-be-allowed-on-ghat-leading-to-sinhagad-fort-in-pune-from-january-26-101641140003896.html
02-01-2022||Mumbai||Teenagers to get jabbed from Monday||Mumbai Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will begin inoculating 15 to 18-year-olds with their first dose from Monday. Initially, only Covaxin will be administered to teenagers across jumbo centres in Mumbai that are operated by the municipal corporation. Private hospitals that have a stock of Covaxin will also vaccinate this age group from Monday itself, civic authorities said.At the jumbo facilities, vaccination will be open between 9 am and 5 pm. Private hospitals with Covaxin stock may decide their own timings to remain open, civic authorities said.Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer from BMC’s public health department said, “At the start, we are vaccinating teenagers only at the jumbo centres, where dedicated booths will operate for this age group. Each jumbo centre has a minimum capacity to vaccinate 1,500 teenagers per day. We have about 3,00,000 vaccine doses in stock at present, so the shortage of doses will not be a problem. Based on the response in the first few days of the drive, more municipal hospitals will start vaccinating teenagers. We have identified about 900,000 beneficiaries in this age group.”BMC on Sunday evening took to social media with instructions for beneficiaries in this age group. The civic body said, “Children born before 2007 are eligible for jabs. They will be required to carry either their Aadhar card or their school identity card with them. Parents are requested to accompany their children, and BMC school students will be accompanied by their teachers. Both online and offline registration is available at the vaccination centres. Children must be registered on the Cowin portal, either through existing accounts of their parents, or self-made accounts.”Dr Gautam Bhansali from Bombay Hospital, who is the coordinator between BMC and private hospitals in the city said, “There are very few private hospitals with Covaxin stock at present. Those who have it in stock have been given detailed instructions for Monday’s drive.”5L in Thane eligible for jabAround 5 lakh in the age groups of 15 to 18 years are eligible to get vaccinated in Thane district from Monday onwards. Along with special vaccination centres for this age group, camps are being set up in some educational institutes across the district to make vaccination accessible to all. Thane Municipal Corporation itself has around 15 vaccination centres for those between 15 to 18 years of age. Among these, around 12 centers are in educational institutes. “For the convenience of adolescents, we have made provisions to vaccinate within their respective school or college itself. Taking prior appointment through Cowin application online is necessary to get vaccinated,” said Sandeep Malvi, Additional Commissioner TMC.Meanwhile, rural parts of the district have provided both online and offline vaccination facilities for adolescents from Monday onwards.“We have set up ten centres in rural parts of the district including two educational institutes. These centres will provide Covaxin doses, however, children must carry some identification proof and must not have any illness,” said Anjali Chaudhari, Immunization officer, Thane Zilla Parishad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/teenagers-to-get-jabbed-from-monday-101641139703839.html

02-01-2022||Pune||10K doses to be administered in Pune on Monday, day 1 of vaccinations for 15-18 age group||PUNE At least 10,000 doses are likely to be administered on the first day of vaccination for minors aged below 18 years, but above 15 years, at 40 vaccination centres earmarked by the PMC. However, even as minors prepare to take the vaccine, adults are still reluctant to come forward, says the data. Pune has the highest number of beneficiaries in the state who are yet to take their second dose. Starting from Monday, January 3, Pune will start vaccination of those aged 15-18 years across the state, with 250 doses reserved at each centre. The vaccination process will start at around 10 am. To avoid crowding at centres, the civic body has allowed 50% of doses to be reserved through the CoWin app and 50% through walk-in registration. Dr Suryakant Deokar, PMC immunisation officer said, “We have arranged for crowd management, howeverm we do request minors and parents not to crowd vaccination centres. We have dedicated 40 centres each of which will have 250 dose. Half of which are reserved for online beneficiaries and half for walk-in beneficiaries.”However, among adults, the response for vaccination is still lagging despite a rise in cases. In the past two weeks, there has been a spurt in the number of cases by almost three-fold, however Pune still has over 1.16 million people waiting to take their second dose of Covishield, which is the highest of any district in the state. In terms of Covaxin as well, Pune has 71,000 people waiting to take the second dose. Pune has reported 104% vaccination with regards to the first dose and 73% of the beneficiaries aged above 18 years of age have taken the second dose. In the past few days as there has been a rise in the number of new cases, the demand for vaccinations has also risen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/10k-doses-to-be-administered-in-pune-on-monday-day-1-of-vaccinations-for-15-18-age-group-101641137543279.html
02-01-2022||Pune||Pune’s Covid positivity rate shows a post-Christmas spike from 1% to 4%||PUNE Although genome sequencing of Covid samples have shown that 2% of samples collected from randomly have tested positive for the new variant, Omicron, a rise in cases is indicating that more samples need to be tested and to get a clearer picture. Since December 25, 2021, the district has seen a rise in the number of new Covid-19 cases from 200 a day to now close to 600. The positivity in Pune has risen from 1% to around 4% in the past few days. As cases rise, the number of tests conducted by the administration has not risen in proportion. Dr Ashish Bharti, chief health officer at Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) said, “We can collect as many swab samples as possible, however, we are limited by the capacity where we send our samples for testing, namely NIV, BJ Medical College and IISER, which are also loaded with testing samples and genome sequencing work. We will be requesting them to test more samples to increase the testing rate of the city as currently we are testing about 7,000-7,500 samples a day, which also includes samples collected and tested at private labs. We are reporting 100-125 more cases each day and our doubling rate is about three days as of now, which is worrisome.”Although Pune is not reporting as many new Covid-19 cases as Mumbai, the number of active cases is rising steadily in the district. As of December 22, Pune had 1,827 active Covid-19 cases. As of December 29, this figure stood at 2,053 which accounted for 14.60% of the total active cases in the state. On December 29, Mumbai reported 8,060 active cases which accounted for more than half the state’s active cases, which is about 57.31%. Pune saw a 12.37% rise in active cases in a week’s time and continues to be one of the five top districts reporting higher active cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/punes-covid-positivity-rate-shows-a-post-christmas-spike-from-1-to-4-101641137063133.html
02-01-2022||Pune||63% of total active Covid cases in district are from PMC limits||PUNE The number of active Covid cases in Pune district have increased within the last few days and most active cases have been recorded in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). As per the district Covid report issued on Saturday, almost 63% of the total Covid cases are from PMC. By Saturday the number of active Covid patients had crossed reached 2,070, while in the district there are 3,275 active patients. Of the total active patients in PMC 306 are hospitalised and 1,764 are in home isolation. This rise in Covid cases and active patients has the civic body on alert. After almost five and a half months, the daily positivity rate within the civic limits crossed the 4% mark. “For the past few weeks, the number of active patients in the city has been rapidly increasing. The number of active patients had dropped to 600 in the city and now we are witnessing a sharp increase. Within the span of a few days this number has crossed the 1,500 mark and is rapidly increasing further. We are alert and closely monitoring the situation,” said Muralidhar Mohol, mayor of Pune. Aundh, Baner, Kothrud, Bavdhan, Hadapsar, Mundhwa, Ahmednagar road, Kondhwa, and Wadgaon Sheri are areas from where Covid patients are being reported. As per directions from the state government, additional restrictions such as prohibition of gatherings of more than five people post 9 pm, a limit on attendees at cultural and social events and at weddings, have already been imposed in the city. Pune mayor Muralidhar Mohol has called a meeting on Monday with civic body officials to assess the situation. “Considering the increase in new Covid cases in the last five days I am conducting a meeting on Monday. Preparedness of the health system and PMC will be assessed. Though there is no huge spike like in Mumbai, in Pune, we are taking extra precaution. Along with preparedness of health infra, there will also be a discussion on solutions at the meeting,” said Mohol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/63-of-total-active-covid-cases-in-district-are-from-pmc-limits-101641136583304.html
02-01-2022||Mumbai||Citizens write to CM to address Worli fisherfolk’s concerns||MUMBAI Over 50 prominent citizens including architects, urban planners, academics, activists and a former Mumbai municipal commissioner have written an open letter to the chief minister and cabinet minister for environment, seeking their intervention in the growing conflict between the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and the fisherfolk of Worli-Koliwada in taking necessary steps to protect the latter’s customary rights.The fisherfolk since October 30 have blockaded construction of an interchange between the coastal road and the Bandra-Worli Sea Link, claiming that it would cut them off from their traditional fishing grounds and force closure of Cleveland Bunder, an artisan fishing port at Worli-Koliwada.The signatories of the public appeal include D M Sukhtankar (former BMC chief); Indira Jaisingh and Anand Grover (human rights’ lawyers and founders of the NGO, Lawyers Collective); Dr Surendra Thakurdesai (coastal geomorphologist); Rahul Mehrotra (professor of urban planning and design at Harvard University); Dr Amita Bhide (dean, School of Habitat Studies at Tata Institute of Social Sciences); and 45 others -- some of whom are affiliated with other educational institutes including IIT-Bombay, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Madras Institute of Development Studies, and Jawaharlal Nehru University.“We write this letter to express our concern about the wellbeing of the fisherfolk of Worli, who have been peacefully protesting for the past two months to protect their customary rights, and their right to livelihood. We are worried that a government that claims to be pro-people and pro-environment has allowed this injustice to continue, and has done very little to address the very legitimate demands of the community,” the appeal states. The fisherfolk’s primary demand is a span of 200 metre under the proposed interchange, as opposed to the BMC’s proposed span of 60 metre, which the fisherfolk say is not enough to ensure safe passage for their boats while venturing out into the open sea.“The MCGM has been insisting that increasing the distance between the pillars beyond 60 metre is technically not feasible. This is clearly disingenuous, since larger spans have already been provided for the navigation of boats in case of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link, and proposed by the MSRDC in case of the Versova-Bandra Sea Link,” the appeal states, adding that “Since work on the interchange has not yet commenced, it is still possible to execute a design change to increase the span as demanded by the fisherfolk. The least that the MCGM can do is to ensure that the livelihoods of citizens are not permanently lost in the pursuit of a project that is clearly not in the larger public interest. Protection of livelihoods and the safety of citizens is the responsibility of the civic authority, and this ought to be given higher priority than technical or monetary concerns,” the appeal states, adding that the fisherfolk’s protest must be seen as a legitimate defense of their fundamental rights, including their right to life and right to livelihood.Sukhtankar, former BMC chief who is among the letter’s signatories, told Hindustan Times that BMC must take the trouble to accommodate the fisherfolk’s requests. “It is not logical to say that a span of 200 metre is not feasible. It is. The fisherfolk’s grievances must be independently verified by a qualified body. The typical view of the bureaucracy toward such conflicts is that they are a nuisance, but in my view the BMC is obliged to resolve this issue and earn the goodwill of the Kolis, who are Mumbai’s first settlers. In a project that costs upwards of Rs12,000 crore, the government should not begrudge the little extra money it will take to do this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/citizens-write-to-cm-to-address-worli-fisherfolk-s-concerns-101641136415621.html
02-01-2022||Pune||PMC’s daily action on non-compliance of Covid norms in single digits even as cases spike||PUNE A sudden spurt in Covid cases in Pune notwithstanding, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has been lax in acting against those not complying with Covid-appropriate behaviour.During 11 days between December 18 and December 28, 54 citizens were fined for not wearing masks in public places and on public transport, according to statistics released by the PMC. Action against offenders are in single digits for all days, besides December 28, when 16 violators were fined. A total fine of ₹27,000 has been collected by the PMC during this 10-day period. Given that large crowds were seen in market areas the PMC action is negligible. The number of mask violations recorded by PMC during the second wave between March 1 and June 30, was a daily average of 107 cases. The daily average cases of mask violations have come down to four in December, as per PMC’s data till December 28. A total penalty of ₹65,260 has been collected from citizens for not wearing masks in December. There was a spike in daily Covid cases in PMC with 232 fresh cases on December 29, which includes four cases of the new Omicron variant. “We still have time to deal with the situation by increasing tests,” said Dr Sanjeev Wavare, PMC assistant medical officer of health, when asked to comment on PMC’s plan of action for the rising Covid cases. “The PMC is ready with better health infrastructure like adequate oxygen supply, ICU beds and ventilators. Covid care centres can be opened at any time,” he added. Dr Wavare noted that restrictions are already in place with 50% capacity for marriages and other gatherings, 9pm to 6am night curfew, and a ₹500 fine for violators of Covid norms. According to Dr Wavare, Covid cases are expected to rise but the rate of hospitalization will not be as high as it was during the second wave of COVID-19. “If the situation worsens with a higher number of cases and higher rate of hospitalization, stringent actions will be taken to curb it with increased restrictions, but it is premature to say anything right now,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmcs-daily-action-on-non-compliance-of-covid-norms-in-single-digits-even-as-cases-spike-101641136403134.html
02-01-2022||Mumbai||Pandemic hit anemia programme in schools, anganwadi centres||Mumbai: As the pandemic forced schools across the country to shut down, it wasn’t just learning that was disrupted — for almost half the students in Maharashtra their health was impacted too. Children and adolescents between six months to 19 years missed out on crucial iron and folic acid (IFA) supplements — distributed in schools and anganwadi centres — when they shut down on March 15 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The state public health department data indicates that while 12.7 million children and adolescents received their supplements in 2019-2020, in 2020-2021, the coverage dropped to 7.1 million, which is a 44% decline. Distribution of IFA tablets in government and government-aided schools and anganwadi centres is one of the key interventions to reduce the incidence of anemia— a condition in which the number of red blood cells or the hemoglobin concentration within them is lower than normal. While children between six months to 59 months get bi-weekly doses of IFA in syrup form, those between five to 19 get weekly supplements in the form of sugar-coated tablets. Anemia has serious health implications ranging from fatigue to worsened pregnancy outcomes. These supplements are distributed to toddlers and to school-going children, as part of the Anemia Mukt Bharat programme. Distribution of IFA supplements has been undertaken by states since 1970, but the Anemia Mukt Bharat initiative was launched in 2018 as a comprehensive approach that looks at six interventions including prophylactic supplements, behavioral change, provision of fortified foods in public health programmes among others. Schools across the state were shut down after the first case of Covid-19 was recorded in Maharashtra on March 11, 2020. In-person classes were opened for classes 5 to 8 in rural Maharashtra and classes 8 to 12 in urban areas in August 2020 but in a mix of in-person and online classes format. Classes 9 to 12 reopened in November, but all classes moved back to the online mode shortly after the second wave hit in February 2021. “The weekly IFA supplementation programme is mainly designed to be implemented in schools and anganwadi centres,” said Dr Ramchandra Hankare, deputy director of the state’s family welfare bureau. “Due to the pandemic and the lockdown, the distribution suddenly came to a standstill as children were confined to their homes. The programme did take a hit,” he said. According to the National Family Health Survey-5, nearly 69% children under 5 years of age are anemic in Maharashtra. More than 50% women and over 20% men in the age group of 15 to 49 years are anemic in the state. Maharashtra’s parameters were slightly better compared to Gujarat which has the highest prevalence of anemia among children under 5 years at 78%, but at par with states like Bihar (69%), Uttar Pradesh (66%) and West Bengal (69%). Given the high incidence of anemia in Maharashtra, the hit in the programme is damaging, experts said. “When setbacks happen, it takes such programmes a few years behind,” said Dr Usha Ram, head of the department of public health and mortality studies, International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai. Already behind the curve The state’s achievement in the IFA supplementation programme started in the 1970s, has been on the lower side even before the pandemic hit. The state has a target of administering these tablets to 8 million children between six and 59 months. In 2019-2020, the state’s IFA supplementation coverage in this age group was 39%, but fell to 27% in 2020-2021. Officials said that ASHA and anganwadi workers were roped in to home deliver supplements to achieve some target during the pandemic. Similarly, from the 8.2 million target in the age group of 5 to 9 years, the state reached 57% beneficiaries in 2019-2020, but only to 30% beneficiaries in 2020-2021. The IFA supplementation coverage in the 10 to 19 years age group (11.1 million) had a 42% coverage in 2019-2020, but it dropped to 22% in 2020-2021. Even the outtake of Albendazole, a deworming therapy, given twice a year to children and adolescents in between one and 19 years, has come down. Parasitic intestinal worm infestation is known to be a major cause of undernutrition leading to anemia. In 2019-2020, the state had 95.48% coverage of Albendazole tablets, which declined to 91% in 2020-2021. “As soon as the first wave receded, we involved ASHA and anganwadi workers to distribute the supplements at homes. We could reach out to many beneficiaries with this intervention,” said Dr Hankare, adding that the IFA supplementation coverage has improved considerably between April to November 2021 as adequate stock was supplied to districts and focus was re-directed to non-Covid activities. “Despite high incidence of anemia, the state’s low coverage of IFA supplementation programme prior to the pandemic has been concerning,” said Soumitra Ghosh, associate professor at the Centre for Health Policy, Planning and Management at Tata Institute of Social Sciences. “There is plenty of evidence that IFA supplementation programmes work. But the tablets should be given along with health education,” he said. According to Ghosh, the state should look at multi-sectoral strategies to implement the programme by involving various departments such as education and women and child health. “To overcome the shocks like the ongoing pandemic, the focus should not be simply on supplements, but also on a diversified, iron-rich diet. The public distribution system (PDS) should offer a variety of pulses and food grains and not just rice and wheat,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pandemic-hit-anemia-programme-in-schools-anganwadi-centres-101641133822900.html

AAP’s policy of giving ₹1,000 allowance to all the women of Punjab above 18, will prove to be a milestone in women empowerment. For this scheme, only ₹8,200 crore are required per year. If we can end the sand mafia, we earn ₹20,000 crore,” said Mann, in Dharamkot to hold a ally in support of AAP candidate Davinderjeet Singh Laddi Dhos.Mann added, “Leaders, who are talking about eradicating poverty directly, are outright liars. Poverty is not overcome by speaking and making promises. Poverty can be eradicated through good education and knowledge. If voted to power, the AAP government will ensure good education for your children and will provide opportunities and resources to move ahead in life.”Emphasising the importance of agricultural reforms, Mann added, “Farmers in villages adopt the method of farming by taking advice from each other. To really improve farming and production, we must adopt scientific methods. The AAP government, if and when formed, will provide help of agricultural experts, who will guide the farmers towards adopting new and improved scientific methods. We will recruit agriculture experts.”“You have given opportunities to the Congress, the Akalis, the BJP and Captain Amarinder Singh. They have only increased the problems of Punjab. Give only one chance to the AAP. We will save farmers, youth and businessmen and take Punjab forward,” he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cash-allowance-to-women-not-freebie-but-social-security-mann-101641132384081.html

These candidates claim that the state government was issuing false advertisements, claiming that 1,091 assistant professors had been recruited successfully.“The reality, however, is that the process has been halted and the issue is in Punjab and Haryana high court due to the failure of state government in putting up its case in a legally sound manner,” selected candidates have lamented.Nirbhai Singh, one of the candidates, said, “What is point of giving advertisements and installing billboards and banners for the recruitment process when our future still remains uncertain.” A section of applicants had filed a civil writ petition in the Punjab and Haryana high court, alleging that the question papers of Punjabi and Mathematics were leaked well before the exams were conducted from November 20-22. Others objected to additional five marks given to guest faculty.In complete contrast to the dilemma before the selected candidates, hundreds of guest faculty, already working as assistant professors in government colleges across Punjab, continue their protest against the state government for conducting these fresh recruitments. These teachers have been camping outside the house of higher education minister Pargat Singh in Jalandhar.Harminder Singh, president, Punjab Guest Faculty Assistant Professors’ Association, said, “The government is not serious about our demands. Some of us have been working in government college for 20 years, and now we find that we have no job security.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-govt-fooling-public-claim-those-selected-as-asst-profs-101641132022856.html
02-01-2022||Mumbai||Resident doctors await official response to their demands||Mumbai: While the New Delhi resident doctors on Friday called off their strike, Sunday witnessed the continuation of state-wide protests by their counterparts against the delay in the release of the NEET-PG counselling date. According to Central MARD, nearly 6,000 resident doctors from more than 20 medical colleges across Maharashtra participated in the protest on Sunday.The doctors are still waiting to hear from state officials regarding their additional demand for the recruitment of non-academic Junior Residents (JRs) equal to the number of residents in that particular college.Dr Hanumant Phad, general secretary, Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) said, “It has been three days of the state-wide strike and we were expecting a meeting but the state authorities or the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) have still not arranged any meeting to listen to our demands.”A member of MARD said three hospitals in Mumbai are thinking of considering the demands of the doctors. BYL Nair Hospital, LTMG Hospital, and KEM Hospital have issued a notification stating recruitment of non-academic junior residents.“ We had a meeting with our dean Dr Mohan Joshi on Sunday and he was positive regarding our demands. They have told us that they will approach DMER concerning the demand for the three colleges,” said Pravin Dhage, general secretary of Sion MARD.The resident doctors have also demanded that the prerequisites like form filling and document verification should be asked to be completed as soon as possible and release of the schedule regarding the same to avoid further delay in the process. Dr Mohan Joshi, dean of LTMG Hospital said “The resident doctors have demanded that the new batch of doctors should join immediately after the counselling, so there is nothing which we or the state government can do regarding the same. DMER will have to look into the matter.” Dr Avinash Dahiphale, president of Central MARD said that there is no communication from DMER yet. “We are trying to get in touch with the DMER director hoping that they will arrange a meeting on Monday to hear our demands.”Hospital authorities said that there was no impact on the emergency services or the Outpatient Departments (OPD), but they had to postpone some elective surgeries due to the strike. “In the last three-four days, we had to cancel almost 25-30% of the elective surgeries. I have tried to convince the resident doctors and we are hoping they will withdraw the strike on Monday,” Dr Mohan Joshi said.The hospital staff of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Nagpur said that since the OPDs were closed on Sunday, there was no major impact of the strike. Patients did not face problems since the emergency services were functioning normally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/resident-doctors-await-official-response-to-their-demands-101641131422844.html

02-01-2022||Mumbai||Witnesses being pressured by NCB, claims Malik||Mumbai Firing a fresh salvo at the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and Sameer Wankhede, its zonal director in Mumbai, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and Maharashtra minority development minister Nawab Malik charged that the agency was trying to manipulate papers in a case.Malik alleged that a senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Maharashtra was lobbying with the Union Ministry of Home Affairs to ensure that Wankhede was given an extension in his posting in Mumbai.“Now, to set things right with these fake cases, NCB officials are pressurising their own panchas (witnesses) to sign backdated panchanamas,” said Malik on Sunday. He played an audio clip wherein a panch called Maddy was purportedly called by an NCB official named Kiran Babu and asked to sign the backdated panchanama. When Maddy called Wankhede, he was told to go ahead and do the needful.“We feel there can be no greater farziwada (falsehood) than this. It was through farziwada that cases were registered against people. It was through farziwada that money was extorted from film personalities. When this farziwada was exposed, the NCB started the game of making people sign backdated documents,” charged Malik, while asking if senior NCB officials were involved in this.Malik questioned the NCB about the progress of the vigilance inquiry against Wankhede after allegations of extortion surfaced against him during the Aryan Khan case.Meanwhile, zonal director Sameer Wankhede of the NCB said, “It is a legal procedure and we record statements of witnesses and take their signature on the statement in each and every case before filing the chargesheet. The investigating officer called a witness to record his statement which is mandatory. There is nothing wrong with the mobile conversation and Kiran Babu, an investigating officer calling him as per the procedure.”“Most of the witnesses have become hostile and are scared to come in the court or give their statement because of Malik, who has been trying to malign the name of an agency for no reason,” said another NCB official, who does not want to give his name.The minister said that his son-in-law Sameer Khan, who was arrested in a drug-related case, and later released on bail, was being singled out and used to put pressure on him. The NCB has approached the Bombay High Court (HC) to cancel Khan’s bail.“My information suggests that lobbying is underway in Delhi… a senior BJP leader from Maharashtra is lobbying the MHA for an extension,” said Malik, adding that Wankhede had not been relieved despite his deputation in the NCB coming to an end in December 31. Malik claimed that NCB officials had pointed to lapses on Wankhede’s part, sent a negative report, and red-flagged his handling of cases. Despite this, some influential BJP leaders from Maharashtra were trying to get Wankhede an extension. He questioned if these leaders were involved in any wrongdoings.Meanwhile, BJP leader Mohit Bharatiya tweeted the screenshot of the copy of an email sent to Hemant Nagrale, Commissioner of Police, Mumbai, by a witness in a case registered by the NCB claiming a threat to his life. The witness has alleged that Malik had threatened him to speak out against the NCB to the media and claimed that he was offered ₹30 lakh for it, or asked to face “dire consequences.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/witnesses-being-pressured-by-ncb-claims-malik-101641130162536.html
02-01-2022||Mumbai||Cop attacked with chilli powder, iron rod; managed to nab gang member||Mumbai: Despite being attacked with chilli powder and iron rod, Vikrant Vedant, a constable from Kurar police station, successfully nabbed a robber, part of a notorious gang of four, with over 70 cases of thefts and robberies against them from Shivaji Nagar, Malad East on January 1 at 2am.According to police, constable Vikrant, who had a hair’s breadth escape in the attack, was on patrolling duty when he saw four accused travelling in a rickshaw. After suspicion, he followed the vehicle and asked the men to come out for checking which led to the attack. The cops informed that the four entered Mumbai to rob liquor stores post New Year’s eve.Constable Vikrant, who is currently admitted to a hospital narrated the harrowing details, “As soon as I came to approach them, four men including the rickshaw driver, tried escaping the spot. Sensing a foul play, I did not waste a second and caught one of them.” After being nabbed, the accused removed red chilli powder from his pocket and threw it at Vikrant. Another one allegedly picked up an iron rod and hit him on the shoulder and right arm. An injured Vikrant fell on the road but didn’t let go of the accused’s pants.Vikrant’s colleagues, after hearing the screaming, rushed to the spot, arrested the accused and admitted Vikrant to a nearby hospital. Upon searching the rickshaw, the police officers found tools for cutting shutters of shops and other housebreaking tools like a chopper, iron rods, rope and knives. The cops are now on the lookout for the other accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cop-attacked-with-chilli-powder-iron-rod-managed-to-nab-gang-member-101641129082409.html
02-01-2022||Pune||Corridor of accidents: Despite crashes, deaths things remain unchanged at Kharadi bypass||PUNE Earlier in December when two persons were killed and two others were injured as a speeding SUV rammed into a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) stop at Kharadi on Pune-Ahmednagar road, residents thought this would be used as trigger to bring changes in traffic. Weeks later, not much has changed on the ground, with several commuters flouting rules by driving through the BRT corridor, risking lives. “Cars and two-wheelers often enter the BTRS lane illegally. While there are traffic cops at the Kharadi bypass chowk, no one is penalised,” said a kiosk owner who sets shop at the chowk.Pune was among the first few cities in the country to introduce Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) in 2006 which looked to revolutionise public transport with dedicated bus corridors. However, with the random implementation of the project and no solution found on illegal encroachment into the BRTS lane, the project has become a corridor of accident. Traffic wardens have been deputed on the corridors to stop private vehicles from entering the lanes but the move has proved ineffective. “Soon after the accident on December 8, for the next three to four days we took action against 750 vehicles at Kharadi bypass. Fines have been increased from ₹200 to ₹500 for violation of no entry in the BRTS lanes. But it’s very difficult to keep a check on every vehicle entering the lanes,” said Rahul Shrirame, deputy commissioner of police (traffic).Speeding and drunk driving are the major causes of accidents in Pune in 2021. In the last two years, 34 persons have lost their lives in different accidents on Ahmednagar road between Yerawada to Kharadi, according to Shrirame.As many as 250 accidents took place in Pune last year. According to the data provided by Pune police, Kharadi bypass chowk is considered an accident-prone or black spot as it had recorded 10 accidents in 2020. Now, in 2022, nothing has changed. Last year, Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) had come up with a plan to install boom barriers at the BRTS corridors. Boom barriers are automated pivoted poles that are used to block pedestrians and vehicles from entering a particular lane. However, Pune Municipal Corporation is yet to install it. “The accidents usually take place early morning or at night when the roads are empty and vehicles are speeding through Ahmednagar road,” said inspector Asha Varle, who was on duty at Wageshwar crossroad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/corridor-of-accidents-despite-crashes-deaths-things-remain-unchanged-at-kharadi-bypass-101641128722890.html
02-01-2022||Mumbai||State, ULBs to purchase, rent only electric vehicles: Aaditya Thackeray||Mumbai In a major push for the use of clean energy in urban mobility, the state government has decided to purchase or rent only electric vehicles for use by the state and urban local bodies from this month. Earlier, this was to be done from April 1, but the deadline has been preponed to this month.This was announced by Maharashtra environment minister Aaditya Thackeray on Sunday. “Keeping our commitment to clean mobility and encouraging citizens, the Govt of Maharashtra has decided to implement the decision of Purchasing or Renting only Electric Vehicles for Govt/ Urban Local Bodies/ Corporations from 1st January 2022 instead of 1st April 2022,” Aaditya tweeted.He also thanked chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat for supporting the climate action policies of the department of environment and climate change and ensuring that the government mechanisms go green too, to encourage citizens to walk alongside in climate action.Aaditya has pitched electric vehicles as one of the means to fight air pollution, and the state has also announced its Electric Vehicle Policy- 2021 to incentivise and promote the use of electric vehicles. It wants to achieve a 25 per cent EV share in public transport in Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Aurangabad and Nashik. This policy envisages converting 15 per cent of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) fleet of buses into electric vehicles by 2025 and making the state the top producer of battery-driven vehicles in the country in terms of annual production capability.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/state-ulbs-to-purchase-rent-only-electric-vehicles-aaditya-thackeray-101641127582719.html
02-01-2022||Mumbai||Shiv Sena, NCP demand strict action against people behind Bullideals||Mumbai Taking a strong position against the communally-targeted harassment of Muslim women on social media, the Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) have demanded strict action against those responsible for it.After an unidentified group uploaded photographs of Muslim women on the ‘Bulli Bai’ app and “auctioned” them off online, Minister of State for Home (Urban) Satej (Bunty) Patil said that the Maharashtra Cyber Police and Mumbai Cyber Cell had initiated an inquiry and lodged an FIR. “Be assured, we will take this to a logical end with the culprits facing the law,” said Patil, who belongs to Congress.He further tweeted, “Digital platforms like these are rife with misogyny and communal hatred aimed at women. This is very disturbing and shameful. Maharashtra Govt. is taking strong actions against such platforms.”This is the second time in less than a year that Muslim women have been listed for auction on social media by right-wing elements. Last year, a similar ‘Sulli Deals’ site had led to a massive controversy but did not lead to any arrests.Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha MP and spokesperson Priyanka Chaturvedi said she had spoken to Sanjay Pandey, Director General of Police (DGP), Hemant Nagrale, Commissioner of Police, Mumbai, and Rashmi Karandikar, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP). She said she hoped that “those behind such misogynistic and sexist sites are apprehended.”On Sunday evening, Chaturvedi tweeted that the West region cyber police station has registered a FIR under the relevant sections of the IT Act against the Twitter handles and the Bulli Bai app developer hosted on GitHubChaturvedi said she also expected Twitter to cooperate with the police and provide them with the information needed. “Stonewalling the investigation citing intermediary safe harbour will not be helpful to ensure justice is served,” she stressed, while also noting that the perpetrators behind the previous Sulli Deals app had not been found and arrested.Maharashtra minority development minister and NCP leader Nawab Malik said that some such portals were “operated by some supporters of the ruling party at the Centre.” “They have a troll army…There can be no two opinions that they have support from the government. Even if the Central agencies do not act against them, the Maharashtra Police will surely do the needful as there are some girls from Maharashtra (who have been targeted). I will follow up on this personally,” he added.Malik said that the perpetrators had targeted those girls and women from the Muslim community who were vocal and outspoken. “I will personally write to the Home Minister (Dilip Valse Patil) and seek action against them,” he added, stating that these people should be arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-ncp-demand-strict-action-against-people-behind-bullideals-101641127222458.html
02-01-2022||Kolkata||Bengal shuts schools, colleges, allows flights from Delhi, Mumbai on 2 days||KOLKATA: With the daily count of Covid-19 increasing by more ten times in just six days in West Bengal, the Mamata Banerjee government announced a partial lockdown from Monday, shutting schools and colleges, imposing curbs on flights from Delhi and Mumbai, restricting timing of local trains and capping capping attendance at private and government offices at 50%.“All academic activities in schools, colleges and universities will remain closed. Government and private offices will continue with 50% of the work force at a time. Local trains will operate with 50% of the seating capacity and up to 7 pm,” West Bengal chief secretary HK Dwivedi told reporters at the state secretariat on Sunday.Flights from Delhi and Mumbai will be allowed to land in Kolkata only on Mondays and Fridays. The government last week announced suspension of direct flights from the United Kingdom landing at Kolkata airport from Monday and mandated Covid tests for all passengers arriving on international flights.The fresh restrictions announced on Sunday were announced after West Bengal reported 4,512 new Covid-19 cases, which translates into an increase of the daily count of new Covid cases by 10 times in less than a week. On Monday last, the state reported just 439 new cases.Kolkata has registered the maximum number of cases among all districts with 2398 cases, up from 204 on Monday (Deceber 27). According to aata compiled by the Union health ministry, Kolkata’s weekly positivity rate has risen to 23.4% for the week, December 24 – 31.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has already announced that containment zones may be brought back in Kolkata to check the spread of the virus. Officials said at least 11 such zones may be declared in the city on Monday.The state government imposed similar restrictions from May 3 2021 when Covid-19 cases shot up exponentially after the assembly elections. They were relaxed in phases.To be sure, Saturday’s daily count of cases is higher than the peak of of the first wave, which hit the state in October 2020. The state then recorded 4,157 in a day. The daily count touched 20,846 in mid-May 2021 during the second wave.According to the order introducing restrictions issued on Sunday, the Bengal government has reintroduced 10pm-5am night curfew. The government relaxed night curfew from December 24, 2021 to January 1, 2022 for Christmas and New Year celebrations.While swimming pools, spas, gyms, salons and beauty parlours, entertainment parks and tourist places have been ordered to close down, the government has allowed shopping malls, markets restaurants and bars to remain open for now on the condition that they operate with 50% capacity till 10pm.Social, cultural, academic, entertainment related gatherings, such as weddings have been allowed with not more than 50 people. “Even though cases have shot up, there is no need to panic. We have reviewed the health infrastructure including hospital beds and oxygen support. There is no shortage,” the Bengal chief secretary said, echoing a point made in the national capital Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal who stressed that most patients were asymptomatic or reported mild symptoms onlyKolkata’s mayor Firhad Hakim earlier said that about 80% of the Covid-19 cases reported in the city were asymptomatic, another 17% have mild symptoms and only 3% of the patients needed to be treated at hospitals.Officials said that the restrictions will remain into force till January 15, after which they would be reviewed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-shuts-schools-colleges-allows-flights-from-delhi-mumbai-on-2-days-101641123742402.html
02-01-2022||Mumbai||150-year old Horniman garden to get a face-lift||Mumbai: The 150-year-old Horniman Garden in South Mumbai is set to get a major face-lift starting next month, as the heritage cell of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has taken up restoration of the Grade-1 heritage structure located in the heart of Mumbai’s Fort area.The tenders are in the approval stage and the restoration, expected to start by February, will take 24 months to complete. Conservation-architect Pankaj Joshi, who is a consultant on this project, said that one of the key aspect of this project will also be to restore the cast-iron fence and the gates of the garden that date back to the Victorian era. To restore the gates, Joshi said that the composition of the metal will be identified in a laboratory to create ingots with a similar material.“After identifying the composition of the metal. We will create ingots with a matching metal. These molten ingots will be poured into the cast to make replicas of the missing pieces, which will then be fixed at the panel,” Joshi said.Senior officials of the civic body said that as portions of the garden’s walkways have caved-in, restoration of the garden will include bringing them to the same level as the footpaths outside the garden.“Inside the garden we will create green pathways and install heritage style benches and furniture and all the dilapidated structures will be refurbished to restore their original look. The present day electric poles will be replaced with new poles that will have a unique vintage design. There is also a fountain inside the park that is lying defunct and we will transform it into a modern programmable fountain with new design pattern,” an official from the department said.“The restoration works were due for many years and there was an ambiguity on whether the garden cell will carry out the work or the heritage cell. The ‘A’ ward office had been following on this issue since many years,” said Shivadas Gurav, assistant municipal commissioner, A-Ward.The garden, which has a circumference of 1.1 km, dates back to the 1860s. According to Shekhar Krishnan, a historian, archivist and advisor to the heritage cell, the idea of having an organised open space was conceived by the city’s first police chief Superintendent Charles Forjett.“This place was developed after the Fort walls came down and was known as Elphinstone Circle back then. Later with time, this place started to became a major business hub, with several offices and commercial establishments setting up their base here. Post-Independence, the garden and the area was renamed after eminent British journalist, Benjamin Horniman who was a well-known crusader of the Indian Freedom Movement,” said Krishnan.The garden also once operated as a ground where the city’s first stock trading activity -- in cotton and other commodities -- first started. “This garden was a trading hub of cottons during the Big Cotton Boom in the 1860s,” said Krishnan.BMC officials said that a water-storage chamber beneath the pyau (drinking water fountain) outside the garden as well as the staircase leading to it, will also be restored.“There’s a staircase adjacent to the Pyau that goes to the main water storage chamber. This chamber is situated 12-15 feet below the surface of the garden. We will be restoring that staircase and chamber and after that we will take a call on whether it should be opened for public viewing,” the official quoted above said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/150year-old-horniman-garden-to-get-a-facelift-101641121101986.html
02-01-2022||Chandigarh||Buy one, get one free, but conditions apply||Buy one, get one free. Buy now, pay later. Heavy discount sale! These are a few catchy phrases that hold perennial attraction for every Indian, irrespective of gender, age or class. Lucrative offers by traders are tempting enough for people to loosen their purse strings and indulge impulsively. Despite being packed to capacity, wardrobes are tested for their endurance as more garments, bought out of the compulsion of availing discounts than out of necessity, are stuffed in. Discounts on the exaggerated priced apparel lead to the buying of more clothes without getting rid of earlier ones, resulting in a textile glut. Some store owners are shrewd enough to display in bold letters: 50% OFF! Once you enter the store and spot an article of your choice, you are politely told, “Sorry sir, this is from the fresh stock. Items on sale are in that corner.” You are guided to a remote section to select from a bunch of out-of-vogue items to avail the much-publicised offer. Another ploy traders resort to is mentioning on the bill: Items purchased in sale won’t be exchanged. It belittles the dignity of the shopper and conveys the message that buying at reduced prices is not cool. Recently, a popular brand of sports shoes offered a laptop bag worth ₹2,000 with a purchase of a pair of shoes costing ₹6,000. I fell for the deal and ended up buying running shoes worth ₹6,000! My happiness was short-lived because my daughter was quick to decode the arithmetic behind the offer. She said that the bag was not worth more than ₹700 and the shoes I bought for ₹6,000 were available online for ₹5,000. Once again, my desire to have the last laugh was cut short. Another incident highlights the ploy traders resort to. Last month, my wife went to buy a woollen jacket, she was trapped in the network of freebies by the psychologists of marketing. When she was about to pay for the merchandise, the salesman persuaded her to buy one more jacket so that the bill adds up to ₹10,000. That would enable her to earn gift vouchers worth ₹2,000 for her next shopping jaunt. She readily accepted the offer and returned home with a heavy bag, and a heavier bill. The next day, she took our son along to buy a pullover for him by encashing the hard-earned vouchers. The salesman clarified curtly, “Ma’am, you can avail the voucher only if you buy clothes worth ₹10,000 or more. You can’t simply buy an item worth the price of the voucher and walk away. Once again, she had to buy expensive articles to avail the discount and return home with a big smile, and a bigger baggage. When I tried to challenge her shopping acuity, she was ready with the reply, “I have spent to save. Look at the rewards of judicious spending before labelling my shopping trip as a wasteful expenditure. And listen, I have another gift voucher worth ₹2,000 in case you require something worthwhile.” Herein lies the art and science of marketing: The art is in striking one’s fancy and the science in striking it repeatedly. rajivsharma.rs201067@gmail.com The writer is an Amritsar-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/buy-one-get-one-free-but-conditions-apply-101641120381520.html

The girl has been admitted to the hospital in serious condition. The horrific incident was captured on a CCTV camera in Anjali Vihar colony of Bagsewaniya area. The girl was identified as Guddi Bansal, daughter of a labourer who works at a construction site in Anjali Vihar colony.“Guddi was playing when a pack of dogs chased her and pulled her on the road. She was bitten on her head, ears, stomach and legs. She was saved by a local. A passerby threw a stone at dogs and chased them away. Later, the girl was taken to Hamidia Hospital where doctors are treating her, the girl’s father Rajesh Bansal said.The Madhya Pradesh Human Rights Commission (MPHRC) has taken cognizance of reports of the case and sent notice to Bhopal municipal corporation (BMC) commissioner and district health officer.Last year, a seven-year-old girl was attacked by stray dogs in the city’s Koh-e-Fiza area. In 2019, a six-year-old was killed by stray dogs in Bhopal.BMC commissioner KVS Choudary said the girl is being given proper medical treatment. “She is alright,” Choudary said, according to news agency PTI. Choudary rebutted criticism on social media that the authorities were not taking steps to curb the menace posed by street dogs. He said the canine sterilisation programme was paused only for two-three months last year during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, and that at least 30 to 40 dogs are being sterilised daily.

Officials from the power distribution company said the target is to install 297,000 smart meters across the district and put 2,000km high tension lines underground by the end of 2022. The officials said that the work of installing smart meters and underground cabling under the Smartgrid project was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The project was started in 2018. According to the officials, the smart meters will do away with the need for manual meter reading and resulting disputes, reducing thefts and increasing billing efficiency.Vikas Malik, chief engineer, Smartgrid project, said that the laying of high tension cables underground will help improve power supply and minimise leakage of power in the system. “We have also installed 230 smart feeders, out of the 580 smart feeders which have to be installed under the project,” he said. The officials said that once the Smartgrid project is completed, the power utility will have the ability to switch supply of power from one area to another in case of load shedding through control room. The underground cables and smart feeders will also help in managing the load evenly and balance the supply in areas which have low load requirement. In the final stages, the project will see that overhead power cables in most of the areas of the district have been brought underground, Malik said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/157000-smart-meters-installed-in-gurugram-dhbvn-101641115341317.html

Instead, they will need to avail the Ambience Mall underpass to do so. This will reduce convergence of vehicles below the Shankar Chowk flyover by a great extent, thereby reducing congestion and also helping commuters save travelling time,” Tomar said on Friday.The existing traffic issues below the flyover came into the notice of authorities during an inspection by Tomar and deputy commissioner Yash Garg on December 28, 2021, which prompted the traffic police to take the decision on closing the U-turns.“During the visit, we realised that closing the cuts will help improve traffic management. We are aiming to first create awareness among residents and then close the U-turns by mid-January. Depending on its success, we will take a further call on making them a permanent feature,” said Tomar.The 377-metre underpass at Ambience Mall helps commuters take a U-turn before the Sirhaul toll and head back towards Gurugram, without crossing into the national capital.Commuters said that the move will help them save around 10 minutes of travel time.“Travelling from Cyber City, I take a right turn below the Shankar Chowk flyover to head towards Delhi. I often get stuck at the converging points for 8-10 minutes. Vehicles from the extreme left carriageway on the highway’s service lane often make a sharp right to avail the two U-turns, which results in a bottleneck,” said Abdul Najeeb, a resident of RK Puram in Delhi who works in Gurugram.

Arvind Kejriwal explains why there is no need to panic||NEW DELHI: Covid-19 infections in Delhi are increasing rapidly but there is no need to panic because all the cases are mild and asymptomatic, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Sunday after the city reported about 3,100 new Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours, up from 2,716 cases reported a day earlier.Kejriwal also compared the current hospitalisation numbers with the figures during the second Covid wave to underscore the point.“Covid-19 cases are increasing rapidly in Delhi, but there is no need to panic. Currently, the active cases in the city are 6,360. Today, 3,100 new cases are expected to be reported. But, the reason why I am saying there is no need to panic is because only 246 hospital beds were occupied yesterday. All cases are mild and asymptomatic,” he said while addressing a press briefing. Kejriwal said that on March 27, 2021, Delhi reported about 6,600 active Covid-19 cases, which is similar to the current situation in the city.Also Read: Daily covid cases grow by 50%, harsher curbs unlikely soon“But, back then 1,150 oxygen beds and 145 ventilator beds were occupied. Today, we have 6,360 active cases and only 82 oxygen beds are occupied. Only five people are on the ventilator today. So, the Omicron variant spreads rapidly, but the severity of infections is fairly low this time,” he said.These numbers underline global trends that the Omicron variant appears to be more transmissible but less virulent, and that the variant of concern (VOC) does not crowd hospitals like the Delta variant did.The chief minister said even if people start needing hospital care, Delhi government is prepared with 37,000 oxygen beds.Also Read: West witnessing worrying Omicron-driven Covid surge. Low death rate is silver liningKejriwal also shared data to show how the cases have rapidly increased in the past five days, but the number of beds occupied in Delhi hospitals have declined.“On December 29, Delhi had 2,191 active cases. The total hospitalisation cases were 262. Today, on January 2, we have 6,360 active cases and hospitalisations have decreased to 247, despite the increase in caseload. This shows that most cases are mild and asymptomatic. There is no need to panic,” he said.
02-01-2022||Delhi||New Year’s Eve used to be like Diwali for us, rue DJs amid cancellations||Ringing in the New Year while dancing to the hottest party tracks has been the norm for many on December 31. However, due to the pandemic last year, we saw muted celebrations, and it seems to be continuing into this year as well. In view of the rising Covid-19 cases, several cities have banned New Year celebrations and imposed night curfew, which has led to last-minute cancellations, calling off party packages and tours of DJs — leaving the live music industry in shambles.DJ AJ feels that organisers as well as guests should have paid more attention instead of being lax about safety protocols. He says, “Just one day ago, I had received cancellation for my New Year’s Eve (NYE) performance in Bengaluru as well as another in the beginning of January. The season had just picked up with back-to-back performances for us since November. I just hope we have enough to sustain.”For many DJs, this was their time to shine and make the most money. However, they are in a catch-22 situation. DJ Kayu, who plays at a popular party spot in Gurugram says, “We cannot help but obey the new government regulations. The party packages have been cancelled but there’s a-la-carte for guests. We’ll also be playing only light music as per the curfew timings as we don’t want to go too loud and make people dance, resulting in social distancing problems.” Elaborating on how their plans have gone for a toss, DJ Sumit Sethi rues, “NYE is very important. It’s like Diwali for us. We get booked two to three months in advance. The moment the new restrictions were announced, we received cancellations and everything has gone for a toss.”DJ Suketu, who played in the Capital last week, believes that people have finally accepted the fact that parties are going to start and end early on NYE. “Most of the club and restaurant owners are going ahead with the celebrations, even though revenue wouldn’t be the same but kuch na hone se toh better hai. There are also restrictions for open air parties, so let’s see what happens with my gig.”In this scenario, are DJs planning to opt for online gigs? “Virtual gigs may come back but woh baat nahi hoti jo live mein hoti hai,” says Sethi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/new-year-s-eve-used-to-be-like-diwali-for-us-rue-djs-amid-cancellations-101641112460817.html

02-01-2022||Dehradun||10 days after FIR, SIT set up for ‘fair and unbiased’ probe in Haridwar speeches||DEHRADUN: Ten days after filing a criminal case over hate speeches delivered at Haridwar’s Dharma Sansad, the Uttarakhand Police on Sunday formed a five-member special investigation team (SIT) to probe the case.The move comes a day after the Uttarakhand director general of police Ashok Kumar confirmed that investigators have added two more names, Yati Narsinghanand and Sagar Sindhu Maharaj, to the list of accused in the case. The first information report (FIR) registered on December 23 initially listed only one accused, Jitendra Narayan Tyagi formerly Waseem Rizwi. Later, two more names, Annapurna Maa alias Pooja Shakun Pandey, and Dharamdas Maharaj, a general secretary of the Hindu Mahasabha, were added.Garhwal range deputy inspector general Karan Singh Nagnyal said a five-member SIT has been formed “for a fair and unbiased probe”.“The SIT will be led by a superintendent of police (SP), assisted by an additional SP, one inspector and two sub-inspectors. The case which was till date investigated by the Haridwar Kotwali police will now be handed over to this newly formed SIT. All necessary legal action will be taken by the police against those found accused in the investigation,” said Nagnyal.Police this week added section 295(a) of the Indian Penal Code (insulting a religion with deliberate and malicious acts) to the FIR. which earlier only cited section 153 (a) of IPC (promoting disharmony, enmity or feelings of hatred).The decision to assign a special team to probe the politically sensitive case comes against the backdrop of criticism that the police probe was moving too slowly. On Friday, senior lawyer Kartikeya Gupta said the police should have been “very very active” in probing the case relating to communal issues “but here it seems to be the opposite”.Uttarakhand police chief Ashok Kumar, however, countered this view, insisting that police are “taking all necessary action” in the case.The event where hate speeches were made targeting minorities was held from December 17-19 in Haridwar.Police registered a case on December 23 only after videos of hate speeches by the participants emerged on social media on December 22, causing furore among netizens who asked the Uttarakhand government to take action. The police then registered a case and assigned the investigation to a sub-inspector rank police officer of Haridwar’s Kotwali police station.

ACCF Anil Thakur said that a team of wildlife officials reached the spot after receiving information about the presence of a leopard in US Club area. “It is a 6-8 months old cub and has been rescued.

She was addressing a press conference on the sidelines of a party event wherein the Himachal Congress launched the New Year Calendar commemorating the MP’s husband and former chief minister, Virbhadra Singh. Replying to a question on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent rally held at Mandi, Pratibha said she expected that the PM would announce some relief package for the state, but nothing like that happened.“The PM just tried to please the people by speaking in the local dialect,” she said. Congress state president Kuldeep Singh Rathore said the demise of the former six-term chief minister has caused the Congress a great loss. On the evacuation of people following the terror threat, Rathore said if the government and intelligence agencies had some inputs, they should have informed the people beforehand.“Why did they allow such a large number of people to gather in the first place?” he asked, adding that the entire episode damaged the reputation of Himachal and would hurt the tourism also.Replying to another question, Rathore criticised the proposal of the central government to increase the rates of GST and said the government had no control over the rising inflation.

02-01-2022||Chandigarh||Himachal: Security beefed up in Shimla after intel inputs on terror attack||In the wake of threat perception from a Pakistan-based militant group, security has been beefed up on The Ridge and Mall Road in Shimla. Scores of tourists and locals had gathered on The Ridge on Friday night to celebrate the New Year, but just as the celebrations began, cops arrived along with sniffer dogs. The police teams carried out an anti-sabotage check in every nook and corner of The Ridge ground, resulting in panic among the revellers. The teams placed metal detectors on the entry and exit routes and frisked the visitors. Police vans fitted with public address systems repeatedly asked the people to return to houses, hotels and guest houses, saying that gathering could lead to the spread of omicron. As per the information provided by police officials, a Pakistan-based terror outfit had threatened to blow up the water storage tank below The Ridge. The tank was built in 1880 to meet the water requirement of Shimla town. The local police also took assistance from the army, which deployed its anti-sabotage teams in the town. Security has also been beefed up at the Army Training Command close to the Mall Road which was set up in 1991. The water tank is cleaned regularly, but a major portion of the tank has developed cracks. The police teams throughout the day conducted checks in the town as well as the key establishments, including the Himachal Pradesh secretariat. Security was scaled up at chief minister Jai Ram Thakur’s official residence as well, besides the Viceroy Regal Lodge. “There were specific inputs about The Ridge and the information was shared by Punjab intelligence. Inputs came late in the evening, so we had no option but to act promptly and get the area vacated,” said HP director general of police Sanjay Kundu. “There are a lot of tourists in the town. The security will remain tightened,” he added. HP chief secretary Ram Subhag Singh spoke to his Punjab counterpart besides officials of the home department to gather more inputs on the threat. However, there was a mixed reaction to police action among the business community. “It was an action taken timely as there was a huge rush and the safety of humans comes first,” said a trader on the Mall Road, Karan Nanda. State Congress chief Kuldeep Singh Rathore, meanwhile, castigated the police action. “The way people were asked to leave The Ridge and the Mall Road was inappropriate. It led to panic and scare among them,” he added. Security will remain heightened: CMChief minister Jai Ram Thakur said the security will continue to remain tightened in the state following the inputs from intelligence agencies. He said that the state had received inputs on Friday evening and soon after, forces were in action and police were deployed in Shimla. He said he had held a meeting with officials and other security agencies. He also thanked the Indian Army for deploying a special bomb disposal squad from Chandigarh. “We have kept all places on alert, especially Shimla. This input was for The Ridge and the Mall Road. We are allowing tourists and locals to move and are not stopping anyone, but the forces have been deployed. We got input late and we were able to evacuate the people as soon as it was possible. We vacated The Ridge and Mall Road, requesting people to move citing Covid-19 protocol. We will have to be alert in future as there are some kind of elements who want to destabilise peace. We took it seriously as it was needed,” said the chief minister.

Earlier in the day, Kejriwal paid obeisance at the Ram Tirath Temple in Amritsar, the ashram of Maharishi Valmiki and the birthplace of Lord Rama’s sons Luv-Kush. On this occasion, the Sant Samaj honoured the AAP convener with a mace. Addressing a press conference, Kejriwal made four promises related to the Dalit children, sanitation workers, Sant Samaj and sewer men.“I guarantee education of all Dalit children to fulfil the dreams of Maharishi Valmiki and Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar. Equality can be brought in the society only by giving good education to children of the poor and downtrodden,” said Kejriwal. He also agreed to Sant Samaj’s demand to dissolve the shrine board and promised that if voted to power, his party’s government will hand over the responsibility of running the temple to the society. Making the third promise, Kejriwal said the AAP government will regularise services of all sanitation workers in Punjab. He also promised to provide safety kits to all the sewer men. “We will give machines to those who go to sewer and clean them by hand so that they can do their business,” he added. AAP chief visits Dera Sachkhand BallanJALANDHAR: Eyeing Dalit votes, Kejriwal visited Ravidassia community’s Dera Sachkhand Ballan in Jalandhar and met its chief Niranjan Das. He was accompanied by party’s state unit chief Bhagwant Mann, leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema.

Nod to dental education service rules In order to bring uniformity, the cabinet also approved Punjab Dental Education (Group-A) Service (Amendment) Rules, 2021, according to the norms of the Dental Council of India.

Special package for Mega projects The cabinet approved special package of incentives for new mega and ultra mega projects to attract huge investment in the state. According to a spokesperson of the chief minister’s office, the project with fixed capital investment of ₹1,500 to ₹2,500 crore with minimum contract demand of 20 MVA would be treated as mega projects and projects with fixed capital investment of above ₹2,500 crore and minimum contract demand of 30 MVA shall be treated as ultra mega projects.

After coming to power for the second term in Delhi, Kejriwal is hoping to expand its base in the neighbouring UP.The AAP has made similar promises in Punjab, Uttarakhand and Goa that are also headed for Assembly polls this year.In the 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) registered a victory after it bagged 312 Assembly seats. The party secured a 39.67 per cent vote share in the elections for 403-member Assembly and brought Yogi Aditynath to the chief minister’s chair.The Samajwadi Party bagged 47 seats, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) won 19, while the Congress managed to win only seven seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/eye-on-up-assembly-election-arvind-kejriwal-to-address-rally-in-lucknow-today-101641086433530.html
02-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC elections: Why parties will remain on tenterhooks in mayoral race||The coveted post of mayor, the first citizen of Chandigarh, has seen pitched political battles over the years, and being a single-largest party or even having a majority in the municipal corporation hasn’t ensured a victory. In the 25-year history of the MC, on several occasions, even a party with one or two seats, has ended up getting their councillor elected as the Chandigarh mayor.The upsets were galore in the pre-2017 era, when nominated members had voting rights. There were major reverses for parties even holding a majority of elected members in the house. Even after nominated members’ votes were quashed, cross-voting all too frequently marred the parties’ election calculations. Nominated members votes scrappedIn 2017, the Punjab and Haryana high court quashed the nominated members’ voting rights in the mayoral elections. Advocate and former councillor Satinder Singh, on whose petition, the voting right of nominated members was withdrawn, said, “The nominated members’ votes were used to nullify people’s mandate. So, on many occasions, the nominated members played the kingmakers without having to answer to people like the elected councillors.” The HC while quashing the nominated members’ voting rights, stating, “In the meeting to be convened for the election of mayor, nominated members who have no right to vote in the meetings of municipalities would have no right to vote even in the meetings for election of the mayor of the municipal corporation, Chandigarh.”No anti-defection law in MC HouseThe anti-defection law in force in Parliament and state legislature hasn’t been enforced for Chandigarh MC. It can come into force in the MC only after Parliament’s nod.Satya Pal Jain, senior advocate and senior BJP leader, said, “In the absence of an anti-defection law, no law prohibits councillors from choosing a candidate of their choice irrespective of party. With secret ballot, it is easier for the councillors to do cross-voting. Anti-defection law should be implemented in the Chandigarh MC too.” The tricky numbers gameIn 2001 mayoral election, a Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) councillor Harjinder Kaur had won the mayoral election, even though, SAD had only two councillors in the house. BJP, with 13 councillors in the house of 20 elected councillors, didn’t participate. In the 10 votes polled on the occasion, seven went to Kaur, and three to her party colleague Mohinder Singh.Congress candidate Poonam Sharma was elected mayor in 2015, defeating BJP candidate Heera Negi by two votes, even as the BJP had 14 votes, including that of the MP, while Congress had only nine. Of the total 33 votes polled, Sharma got 17 votes and Negi managed to get 15. In a close contest in 2007, Anu Chatrath of the Congress lost by one vote to Harjinder Kaur of SAD, even though Congress had a clear majority with 13 seats (total elected councillors – 20).In the 1998 election, even though BJP had 13 councillors and its then ally SAD had two elected councillors, but still the party’s rebel candidate was elected to the mayor’s post.In another mayoral election, the Congress got its candidate elected with only one elected councillor against BJP’s 13.Cross-voting fears persistIn the post-2017 period too, with no anti-defection law in place, cross-voting has been the norm rather than exception in the mayoral elections.In 2019, the BJP, with 21 votes in the house of 27 (including one vote of Chandigarh MP), had a major scare when its candidate could win by only a narrow margin. Rajesh Kalia only got 16 votes and rebel candidate Satish Kainth received 11 votes, even though BJP had 22 votes in the house of 27, and Congress only four. Kainth later joined the Congress. In the previous year too, the party’s candidate Davesh Moudgil had got one vote less than the party’s total votes. In the last election of the outgoing house too, the winning BJP candidate Ravi Kant Sharma got two less votes than 19 votes the party councillors cast.In the newly elected MC house too it’s anybody’s game. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has 14 votes, BJP 13, Congress 8 and SAD 1. “Unlike the outgoing house where BJP had brute majority, and so cross voting didn’t cost the party an election, this time around, all the three parties are neck-to-neck. With cross-voting a real possibility, all three parties - Congress requires 19 votes from total 37 votes, BJP 6 and AAP 5, are in the race,” said a veteran BJP leader requesting anonymity. 
02-01-2022||Chandigarh||Tricity buzz: New Year bash invite from Chandigarh Traffic Police||Chandigarh’s deputy superintendent of police (DSP), traffic administration, Palak Goel took to Twitter to share an invite for a special New Year’s Eve party. Those invited included rash and drunk drivers. The venue, “your nearest police station”, was to feature a special performance by ‘DJ Lockup’. The tongue-in-cheek invite was shared widely across WhatsApp groups and liked by many for the sense of humour. Wonder how many actually made it to the party. Aaptimism: Victory march in UT with eye on PunjabThe “victory procession” of the Aam Aadmi Party, led by its national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, in Chandigarh on December 30 after the AAP won 14 of the 35 municipal corporation seats had a message for the Punjab electorate as well. With Punjab AAP chief Bhagwant Mann by his side, Kejriwal expressed the hope to be back in Chandigarh to attend the oath-taking ceremony of the Punjab government with his party at the helm. Some in the crowd were carrying posters of AAP candidates in Punjab; the biggest being a life-size poster of Kulwant Singh, the former mayor and now the Mohali AAP candidate.Mind your spellings, it’s ‘o’ not ‘a’ in Mohindra The Mohali District Public Relations Office (DPRO) was left red-faced the other day when it issued a press release wrongly spelling the name of Punjab cabinet minister Brahm Mohindra. The Punjab local bodies minister was in town recently to inaugurate a slew of development projects. The press note issued by the DPRO office spelled his surname with an “a”, while the minister spells his name with an “o” – Brahm Mohindra. All that was required was a little attention to detail, especially when it comes to the names of ministers. Covid vaccine drive gets booster shot in PanchkulaPeople ignore appeals and comply only when strict instructions are passed. The vaccination drive in Panchkula got a boost after the recent Haryana government order that only those who had taken both vaccine doses would be allowed at public places from the New Year. Earlier, convincing people to get vaccinated was a task in itself and some would even misbehave with health workers, who were already stretched. With Covid-19 cases on the rise again along with the government order, those who shunned the vaccine are now coming forward, seeking favours to get vaccinated at the earliest. Well, the administration should not have delayed passing such orders. Vaccine lucky draw winners fail to show up for prizes The UT health department had on December 9 conducted a lucky draw for people who got vaccinated in Chandigarh between November 18 and 30. A total of 200 winners were selected through a computerised draw at the UT Secretariat, and the winners were supposed to get gift hampers of ₹2,000 each, a cash award of ₹1,000 each, and food and beverages coupons of ₹1,000 each. Even though the health department extended the deadline for collecting the awards from December 22 to December 26, around 40% of the winners didn’t show up. “The winners were contacted several times but they didn’t visit the Chandigarh Housing Board’s office to collect their prizes. The validity of food and beverages coupons has expired but those who won cash prizes and gift hampers can still collect their wins. The lucky draw was aimed at increasing vaccination in the UT in view of the rising number of cases,” said UT health secretary Yashpal Garg said.

02-01-2022||Chandigarh||Morni rape case: High court dismisses bail plea of main accused||The Punjab and Haryana high court (HC) has dismissed the bail plea of Sunil Kumar alias Sunny, the main accused in the 2018 gangrape reported in Morni, a tourist town, 30 km from Panchkula.The victim had alleged that she was raped for four days, from July 15 to 18, 2018, by eight to 10 men, including two policemen, at Lovely Guest House in Kaimbwala village in Morni. She was initially turned away by the local police and an FIR was registered by the Chandigarh police, but later the Panchkula police took over the case. The bench of justice Gurvinder Singh Gill observed that the victim, in her statements, had consistently stood by the rape allegations. “The petitioner, being the main accused, and the allegations against him virtually having been substantiated, this court is unable to accept the contention that it is merely a case of Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956 and not of Section 376-D IPC (gangrape),” the bench stated.The accused had approached the high court on April 8, challenging the 2019 order of a trial court dismissing his bail plea. It was argued that even if all the allegations as alleged are taken to be correct, still the same, at best, would constitute an offence under Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act. It is punishable for a maximum imprisonment of two years. But the petitioner has undergone 3 years and 6 months’ sentence so far. It was also claimed that medical evidence presented did not corroborate allegations of rape.Police had claimed that Sunny is the main accused and was running a guest house, where the woman was initially allured on the pretext of offering employment but was raped. The accused invited his friends and she was made a captive. Some photos, of the woman, were also referred to, allegedly shared by the accused to invite his friends. The court said woman had been kept in a hotel and even if she had raised any hue and cry in a room in a hotel, the same was unlikely to have been heard by anyone else. Rather, sending of photographs to his friends would substantiate the case of the prosecution. “As such, with regard to aforestated facts and the heinous nature of crime, no case for grant of bail is made out,” the bench said dismissing his plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/morni-rape-case-high-court-dismisses-bail-plea-of-main-accused-101641077343242.html
02-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Congress chief Subhash Chawla, his deputy Devinder Babla get into public spat||The simmering tension within the Congress, after its poor show in the recently concluded Chandigarh municipal corporation elections, spilled out in the open as the party’s city unit chief Subhash Chawla and his deputy Devinder Singh Babla got into a public spat on Saturday. The incident took place during the oath-taking ceremony of the newly-elected councillors at the Municipal Corporation Bhawan in Sector-17 on Saturday. Both Chawla and Babla were sitting in the visitors’ gallery, when they got into a heated exchange, prompting other councillors to intervene. The spat went on for several minutes. Speaking after the episode, Chawla said, “Babla hurled abuses at me. I am very upset over his behaviour. The party will decide what action is to be taken against him for this behaviour.” Babla, on the other hand, denied the allegations of hurling abuses. “I was enquiring from him why a party meeting has not been called to discuss the defeat. However, his behaviour was odd. He shot back saying it was not necessary, which infuriated me.” He added that Chawla must take moral responsibility for the defeat and tender his resignation. Those present at the spot said that Babla accused Chawla of “destroying” the party. He also alleged that AAP was Chawla’s creation as he let senior leaders like Pardeep Chhabra (former Congress chief) to leave party and join AAP with several others. He also accused Chawla of “selling tickets” and giving it to those, who did not stand a chance to win “even in their own Mohallas.” “Chawla could not ensure his own son’s victory. It was a very good opportunity for us to win this election. There was a wave against BJP. But due to poor management of Chawla, we lost the polls,” Babla said after the incident. In a city, once considered a Congress stronghold, the party was outsmarted and out-campaigned by debutant Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) which grabbed most of the anti-incumbency votes against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Congress could secure only eight seats, while AAP won 14 and BJP retained 12 seats. Congress had four councillors in the outgoing house. 35 councillors take oath of officeThe 35 elected councillors were administered oath of office on Saturday morning at a ceremony at the assembly hall of municipal corporation in Sector 17 by deputy commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh in the presence of MC commissioner Anindita Mitra.

02-01-2022||Chandigarh||Parents’ union member booked for garlanding DEO with slippers in Ludhiana||A day after a parents’ association member garlanded a secondary district education officer with slippers, the police booked the former for trespassing, criminal intimidation, criminal conspiracy, committing an obscene act in a public place and obstructing a public servant from discharging his duty on Saturday.The accused, Rajinder Kumar Ghai, had accused the district education officer (DEO), Lakhvir Singh Samra, of not taking action against a physical training teacher who allegedly molested a student, following which he garlanded Samra with slippers at his office on Friday. The DEO told the police that members of the parents’ association had met him on the pretext of honouring him and to get pictures clicked with him.Initially, Samra refused to accept any garland, but when the union members insisted, he agreed. “Ghai garlanded me with slippers while other members were garlanding me with flowers. It was only when I began removing the garland, did I notice the slippers strung to it,” he told the police, adding that Ghai had clicked pictures of him wearing the garland to blackmail him. Teachers’ associations protest Hundreds of members of different teachers’ unions protested outside the DC office, demanding immediate arrest of the accused and raised slogans in support of the DEO. A protester, principal Amandeep Singh, said the protest will not end until the accused was arrested. “He should be behind bars as he has not only disrespected an honest and respectable officer, but has also defamed the education department.”The protesters demanded a comprehensive probe into the matter, suspecting the involvement of a few senior officials. “It is a bigger conspiracy and needs to be exposed. We suspect a few senior officials in the department to be part of this power tussle”, said another principal.Notably, Ghai had earlier sent texts to a few journalists revealing his plans, following which the teachers’ unions requested the police to probe their role as well. Charan Singh Sarabha, veteran teacher’s union president, said the DEO could have only have transferred the teacher. “The DEO is not a police officer and cannot arrest the teacher. He, however, submitted a report with seniors and transferred the teacher immediately”, said Sarabha.Teachers’ unions are likely to stage a bigger protest on Monday in case police fail to arrest the accused. Members of the Bharatiya Kisan Union also supported the DEO. The caseA probe was launched against the PT teacher by deputy DEO, secondary, Charanjit Singh, on December 22, after Rajinder Ghai filed a complaint with the chief minister’s office.Ghai had claimed that since DEO did not take any action though 10 days had elapsed, and was trying to save the teacher. The teacher had been already transferred to a boy’s school by the DEO. The DEO, on realising the indignity meted out to him, had confronted Ghai and told him that an inquiry report had already been submitted to senior officials for action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/parents-union-member-booked-for-garlanding-deo-with-slippers-in-ludhiana-101641074762907.html

02-01-2022||Chandigarh||Ludhiana logs six-month high as 37 test positive||The district witnessed a spike in cases for the third consecutive day as 37 more people tested positive for the virus on Saturday – the highest in six months. It was last on June 25 that the city had seen 43 new Covid cases in a single day. While the district had reported 17 cases on Thursday, 18 cases were reported on Friday. Among those who tested positive was the family of a prominent businessman who owns a woollens’ mill. It is learnt that he and his wife, contracted the infection from their domestic help. The number of active cases has also crossed 100 for the first time after five months. It was last on July 21 that 104 active cases were reported in the district.The sudden surge in cases has triggered speculation regarding the spread of the Omicron variant. However, civil surgeon Dr SP Singh maintained that no case of the Omicron virus has been reported in the district so far. “We were expecting the cases to surge at some point of time as the virus has not gone anywhere, it is just that we are getting a protective shield in the shape of a vaccine,” said Singh, urging people to strictly follow all Covid norms and wear face masks. On the other hand, a departmental employee said that the number of cases could be much higher. “Earlier, we used to sample around 10,000 people each day, but only 2,000 to 3,000 samples are collected each day now. If the government starts vigorously sampling, the figures may be much higher,” said a doctor working at the civil surgeon’s office. Most of the patients have symptoms such as cough, fever and loss of smell and taste, and a few are also complaining about fatigue. Those who have tested positive include three health workers, 11 flu-corner patients and 11 OPD patients. The new cases have taken the district’s Covid count to 87,845, of which 85,618 people have recovered so far.

Speaking to reporters after being brought down, Kaliraman said, “I’m due to retire in September and the government will offer me nothing. We do equal work, then why not equal treatment and pay?”The union members said at least 11 women teachers will shave off their heads on Sunday, and protest against the police, if Rajkumar was to be arrested.

A few panel members also engaged in a dialogue with students and contractors, but a final decision on the matter is yet to be taken by the varsity.PU had in December announced the revised rates of eatables in the university hostels for 2021-22 academic session on the representation of the contractors of mess and canteens. The decision however, drew criticism from the student bodies, who were quick to demand the pre-Covid rates be reinstated.A member of the panel, requesting anonymity, said, “The price hike was justified to student leaders who were invited for the dialogue. The panel has to also keep in mind the grievances of contractors as well.”According to students, the price for a regular meal for boys was around ₹35, which was increased to ₹40 during the lockdown, and later increased to ₹43.50 now. They added that the price of a regular meal in the mess has also been increased to ₹42 and the revised rate of the special meal, for both boys and girls, stood at ₹48.Another meeting of the panel is expected to be held, albeit after a round of discussion with students and contractors, before a final decision. A university official said the final call on the matter will be taken in the coming days.Box: Museums tour for children of migrant labourersPanjab University’s Centre for Social Work on Saturday organised an exposure visit for children of migrant labourers on the campus.

They also asked the chancellor to direct the vice chancellor to defer the meeting as the senate is incomplete.The members, in their letter to the chancellor, highlighted that the candidates who are yet to be notified had been elected after thorough scrutiny in accordance with the given procedure for the conduct of PU senate polls and the electoral process was conducted by the university under the directions of the Punjab and Haryana High Court after meticulously following the due process of law.“This is for the first time in the history of PU that notification of the senate was issued in two parts. It is even surprising that the university has scheduled the senate meeting on January 8, 2022 when the complete senate has not been constituted as per the Act, which would amount to violation of the PU Act,” the letter read.The elected candidates who are yet to be notified from the constituency of faculties are from the Goyal group and are former senate members. “We appeal to you to get the notification issued of the fourteen elected candidates issued immediately so as to uphold the democratic principles enshrined in the PU act and also direct the vice chancellor to defer the meeting of the incomplete senate till the full senate is constituted,” the members further wrote. PU senate, the varsity’s apex governing body, is scheduled to meet on January 8, with 11 items on its agenda for consideration. This will be the first meeting of the PU senate in two years.The senate election was held in 2021 following a year’s delay.

02-01-2022||Chandigarh||Charred beginning to New Year for 3 Ludhiana eateries||New Year celebrations turned sour for three eatery owners in Feroze Gandhi market after a fire broke out at their outlets around 2am on Saturday. The owners said the blaze started at one of the outlets due a short circuit and quickly spread to adjoining shops. The toughened glass partition, which separated the eateries – Datta Bhau Vada Pav, Chai Sutta Bar and Bite Crackers – also shattered after two gas cylinders exploded. Fortunately, the eateries were closed at the time of the incident and no casualties were reported. The flames caused revellers who were out and about at the time to panic. The scope for tragedy was large, but luckily the eatery owners were able to safely remove five gas cylinders from the outlets, and the fire did not gut the IELTS institutions above the eateries.The alarm was raised by an auto-rickshaw driver, who was crossing the area, and spotted smoke emanating from the outlets. “The power supply was not immediately snapped, which made the cylinders burst and the fire spread to other units,” he said. Sub-fire officer, Maninder Singh, said, “Soon after receiving the alert, three fire tenders were rushed to the spot. The flames were doused around an hour after the power supply was snapped.” PSPCL to blame: Shopkeepers Accusing Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) officials of not acting on their feet, the shopkeepers say had the power supply been disconnected at the right time, the fire would not have spread to other shops. Vada Pav eatery owner Raman Verma says the fire broke out due to a short-circuit outside the shops, and the fire fighting was delayed for around an hour because the PSPCL employees failed to snap the power supply, despite repeated requests. “The flames might have been doused outside my shop, and would not have spread to other shops, if only the power supply had been have snapped in time, “ he said. PSPCL executive engineer Rakesh Kumar said no one contacted him and neither had the staff has apprised him of any such incident. “The department gets the power supply snapped by contacting the grid immediately after a fire incident is reported. There might have been some miscommunication on the part of shopkeepers. The PSPCL’s grid is situated near the DC office complex, a throw’s away from Feroze Gandhi market.

Market association seeks fire lane Citing a 2019 high court order, Feroze Gandhi Market Association chairperson Col Harjap Singh (retd) demanded that a fire lane be established in the market. He also asked that the civic body decongest the parking lots in the market, by introducing hourly parking. “The MC has failed to take any steps to ensure the safety of residents,it would have been very difficult to douse the flames reported the day,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/charred-beginning-to-new-year-for-3-ludhiana-eateries-101641072423245.html
02-01-2022||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz | Nargis, barf mein umeed ki kali||On a stormy day, hope flickers like a diya (wicker lamp) braving buffeting winds; on a moonless night, it is the ‘jugnoo’ (firefly) who lends a glimmer of hope to the lost soul; in the tyrannical winters that beset alpine cottages of the Himalayas, come spring and it is sunny Nargis (daffodils) and their desperate fragrance that augurs relief from snow, weary-grey clouds and odours peculiar to layers of prickly, warm robes.As mysterious nature would have it, in the quaint apple hamlet of Bahu nestling in the Banjar valley of Kullu, the nargis bloomed early this December, much before their time. The white-yellow nargis sprang up in the chill, looking resplendent in the garden and apple orchard of Deepak Atheist. They were a welcome surprise, along with a few roses, mustard blooms and wild flowers, till the first of snow flakes gently kissed the plucky petals.Realising the blooms would soon be interred by tons of the white shroud, Deepak lopped the precious Nargis stems and placed them in two rooms of his cottage. They lasted weeks. Their scent, like intoxicating whiffs of Paris’ Chanel No 5, suffused the family’s living spaces with a fragrance of hope, from the siege of snows just a glance from the windows. Yearning for the sun’s smile this December, amid nagging clouds and hardening snow, the colours of early-up nargis penned a floral simile to warm, golden rays falling upon the white dread.The nargis enjoys cultural and religious resonance in the lives of the intensely superstitious pahadis. “In our apple orchards, when trees grow tall, we cannot grow wheat because of cold shadows. So, we plant nargis in orchards and it grows effortlessly. Nature is the gardener who selflessly tends to her modest needs. During our spring festival of Himachal Pradesh, nargis blooms are offered at temples and men sport nargis stems on their Kullu topees,” Deepak told this writer. The festival of Fagli is held in Paldi valley after Lohri. Masked men dance for four days sporting nargis stems. The priest finally throws a nargis bunch into crowds and in whose lap it falls, is deemed to have been supremely blessed. However, festivities were marred in 2019 when the bloom bunch fell into the lap of a Dalit youth, Lalchand, and his elation quickly turned to gloom. That bunch’s fall doomed Lalchand and his five friends as they were nearly lynched by so-called upper castes for having “polluted” ritual sanctity. vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzz-nargis-barf-mein-umeed-ki-kali-101641071705402.html
02-01-2022||Chandigarh||Guest Column | As memories linger, the nostalgia remains||Growing up as we did in the 60s and 70s, we did not have many amenities as available today, and yet our childhood was joyful and fun-filled. Of course, fun for us had an altogether different connotation – a candy, chocolate, orange bar, or a bottle of Coca-Cola were a big indulgence. There were no video games or expensive toys to entertain ourselves with, and we relied on simple games and the kids in the neighbourhood. With the internet, computers and mobiles things of the future, we had real interactions as opposed to virtual ones. We would wait for the holidays to visit our maternal grandparents’ home, our one-stop vacation, each summer vacation. An occasional film outing was enough to send us on cloud nine.Growing in a middle class family with two-three siblings , in a period of scarcity, we learnt to find joy in the small pleasures of life. Not only did we take pleasure in small things, but also learnt to enjoy the wait. There was no instant gratification, we had to wait for almost everything, small or big, and thus cherished the item when we finally got it. We had to wait for our birthday or a special occasion to get a new dress. A wristwatch may not be on the wish list of the children today, but I was on the top of the world when I finally got an HMT watch, in the eighth standard as reward for topping the class.There were no refrigerators or televisions in our homes, gadgets which are now believed as necessities. There was an anticipation and thrill, wait and excitement, and a celebration as each new device was added to our households. The acquisition of a thing as small as a transistor or a record player was a source of great joy for us. We would save money to buy records of our favourite movies. These days everyone carries a mobile, but back then there was a long wait of years for getting a fixed-line connection. Prior booking, at times running into years, was required to buy a scooter. I can’t forget how thrilled we were when ‘Hamara Bajaj’ arrived loaded as my father was yet to learn how to drive it!The new generation of kids are usually over pampered, most are fussy about food, and their whims are met more often than not. When they don’t feel like eating home-cooked food, Zomato, Swiggy are there to deliver their choicest food at the doorstep. However, we had to eat whatever was cooked, without any tantrums. Pizza, burger, and noodles were unheard of, and hot samosas and jalebis were a big treat. Home deliveries are a recent phenomenon, but back then there was no culture of dining out either. In fact, there was hardly any posh restaurant in my city till early 70s. I must have been in my teens when I had the first experience of eating at a three-star hotel. I remember feeling ill-at-ease with its ambience. Naively, I drank the water in the finger bowl. Well! We grew up in frugal times, yet we cherish our childhood for there was something magical about this joyful, carefree period of innocence. The 60s and 70s may be a distant past but we have treasure trove of childhood memories. As memories linger, the nostalgia remains.rama_1177@yahoo.co.inThe writer retired as an associate professor from MCM DAV College, Chandigarh)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-as-memories-linger-the-nostalgia-remains-101641071402450.html
02-01-2022||Chandigarh||Random Forays | The true significance of the 1983 victory||Those were very different times in India. Simplicity, quite simply, adorned people’s expressions. Success was rare. But we had our heroes. Somehow, there aren’t as many around these days.Kapil Dev’s men pulled off a well nigh unimaginable victory in the 1983 cricket world cup, against all predictions, all odds, all logic. Our dibbly-dobbly seam attack and a motely group of batsmen, some doughty, others spunky, achieved the impossible with a brand of cricket that, in hindsight, actually suited the conditions more aptly than any other team’s at the time. But who knew? Kabir Khan’s much awaited film, 83,which is centred on that momentous milestone in India’s sporting history has brought out our goose pimples and moistened our eyelids, even though four decades have elapsed. With style, verve, poise, an eye for detail, an emotional connect and an inspired narrative, the film wins our hearts. 83 is adroitly able to bring out the shyness, the camaraderie, the defiant spirit, the gradually enveloping sense of “we might actually be able to do it” that team India exemplified under the captaincy of the magnificent Kapil Dev in that world cup. Ranveer Singh’s portrayal of Kapil leaves us in awe of the aura of the champion all rounder, all over again. For us, the man on screen is not Ranveer, but the great cricketer himself. Kapil’s grit and gusto, his flamboyant style of batting, his energetic run up, his diction and his mannerisms are all on display on screen through an actor who was born two years after 1983. His astonishing, blistering,boisterous and world-record shattering innings of 175 not out against Zimbabwe has been showcased for us, as if for the first time, even though in enactment. The BBC’s strike on that unforgettable day, and the cricket world’s inability to watch even a single ball, is the stuff of legends as well.Kabir Khan has even managed to replicate most of the original scenes from the ‘83 world cup that we,watched on re-runs over the decades. Each memorable stroke that the cavalier Kris Srikkanth, the courageous Mohinder Amarnath, the swashbuckling Sandeep Patil, or the redoubtable Yashpal Sharma played during the cup has been filmed with almost exactly the same technique and manner as the originals. Kapil’s running catch at mid-wicket to dismiss the world’s greatest batsman off Madan Lal, Balwinder Sandhu’s astounding in-swinger which bamboozled the formidable Gordon Greenidge, Roger Binny’s impressive swingers and Amarnath’s slowish seam up bowling, have all been brought out with impressive authenticity. Sunil Gavaskar’s brooding (but ultimately joyful) expressions and DilipVengsarkar’s anguish after being struck by a Malcom Marshall bouncer, too, have been very adeptly portrayed.Deepika Padukone as Romi Dev is perhaps the only one who appears more like her own self than the character she portrays, but she too does her best to merge herself with her role. The stand out acting performance comes from Pankaj Tripathi as PR Man Singh. He is under the skin, under the breath, and seamlessly seeped in the persona of Singh. He acts brilliantly, compellingly, and with telling effect.Yet, more significantly, this remarkable film is merely a reminder of the unquestionable ground level impact of that 1983 victory, which came as a manna from heaven. India was by no means an all-conquering nation. We were forever the global ‘sideys’ despite our immense population. And though India reformed its economy from 1991 onwards, and the IT era later fashioned remarkable successes for Indian companies, it was from the 1980s that we slowly started imbibing confidence and standing up to the world as a people. Kapil Dev’s team actually transformed the narrative for the youth of that generation. We too began to believe, as Kapil did, that we could beat the best. We too began aspiring, as a then school-going Sachin Tendulkar did, to scale impossible heights.And even more tellingly, young India, in its villages, along its borders,in the hinterland, across its length and breadth, identified with that achievement in 1983, as being his or her own breakthrough moment. A never-say-die moment to remember for all times to come. That, then, was and is, the true meaning of the 1983 win.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/random-forays-the-true-significance-of-the-1983-victory-101641070863407.html

This is the highest single-day case count recorded in the city since June. With Mohali reporting 29 cases and Panchkula adding 26 cases, the tricity’s single-day count stood at 125 on the day. The only silver lining was that there were no deaths on the day. Active case count at six-month highThe active cases too shot up to 457, the highest the tricity has seen since June when it was in the midst of the second wave. At present, there are 236 people are actively infected in Chandigarh, followed by 114 in Mohali and 107 in Panchkula.The positivity rates in the three jurisdictions also stood above 1%. On Saturday, the positivity rate in Chandigarh was as high as 4.75%, followed by 2.41% in Mohali and 1.63% in Panchkula.Experts say the spurt in infections is a clear indication of the beginning of third wave. Dr Suman Singh, director, health services, Chandigarh, said, “Covid cases are rising sharply in Chandigarh, which is an indication of the third wave. This is a result of crowded gatherings that took place during election campaigns, marriage events and year-end festivities. People must follow basic rules like wearing masks, maintaining social distancing and getting vaccinated against the disease as it will help control transmission.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-reports-70-new-covid-cases-highest-daily-count-since-june-101641070565032.html
02-01-2022||Chandigarh||Roundabout | Things to leave behind and those to take along to 2022||How does one send off a year and welcome another in times such as these? Of course, there is no way of doing it but with hope. One such message has been brought to by an artiste of the city, Kumar Varma, whose plays one grew up seeing from our college days when we learned to go to auditoriums in Chandigarh to watch the drama of life as audience. Posting a picture of German actor, Helene Weigel, the famous matriarch of Bertolt Brecht’s plays in a scene from Mother Courage, online, which was the lifeline in secluded times, he quotes the playwright:‘The New Year’s come.The watchmen shout.The thaw sets in. The dead remain.Wherever life has not died out It staggers to its feet again’(Bertolt Brecht in ‘Mother Courage And Her Children’)No, Varma is not running an online theatre class all the way from Thrisur in Kerala, his home state, where he is settled after teaching a lifetime in the department of Indian theatre at the Panjab University. It is his way of wishing people, crushed by calamities, both natural and man-made, a happy and peaceful entry into the New Year. Who can tell this better than Mother Courage! This play by Brecht, although set in the 17th Century of the 30-year war, was directly aimed at decrying fascism. The courage of the mother notwithstanding, she sells her wares to soldiers and loses her three children to death. Even as she grieves she has no choice but to move on with her cart. Such is the way of an artiste playing with contradictions and yet suggest a path where all is not lost.‘Words are not mere words’It was city poet Kumar Vikal who had said, words are not mere words, there are people behind them, people in clothes of varied hues. In The Blind Matriarch, Namita Gokhale’s novel that came out in 2021, Ritika and Satish, who live in a joint family, became a pointer to the two years of pandemic, ranging from the political to the personal. Written in the breezy style, which was also seen in her debut novel Paro, she was able to bring alive the crisis of the trying times: “Ritika’s smile drooped as she made her way to the kitchen. Their maid, Irina, who lived in the slum cluster nearby usually stayed on to do the dishes, but there was a no-show today. “Kaf and Fiver,” she had reported in the WhatsApp message. Ritika had correctly decrypted her message. “Cough and fever”. Irina was twelfth-pass and proficient in Hindi; it was her ambition to be fluent in English as well”.The Blind Matriarch, thus, becomes a symbol of a system that refused to open its eyes. Commenting on it poet and critic K Satchidanandan says: “A multi-layered narrative woven around an extended family into an allegory of our existence as a nation with its vulnerabilities, its hierarchies… and special modes of surviving crises”. However, it is the title of her earlier novel, Things To Leave Behind, that demonstrates the struggle and sorrow of what often seems the hapless masquerade, besides the burden of sheer existence with the economy in doldrums. One treasures the spirit of the many in rising above the situation. We take with us the sacrifices of many front-liners, the generosity of others who shared the little they had, the health workers who met their end saving others, the activists who bravely performed last rights of those who had no one, those who tried somehow to bring food to stranded labourers, children with glasses on their noses taking online classes as they think of lost playgrounds and friends… as symbols of faith not lost. And lest we forget, thoughts turn back to the determined girl cycling hundreds of miles to take her ailing labourer father to safety and those too who perished on the way and or farmers who died protesting in the cold climes for their rights and those who lived to see things change.The return of a love poemAs the second year of the decade is born one shares a few lines of a poem Even Bricks Need Love by Nabina Das, who edited a beautiful and exhaustive volume of Witness: The Red River Book of Poetry Of Dissent through the pandemic but stopped writing poetry nearly completely, except a short sequence and then pined for recovery since this year began:One whole year of lovelessnessOne dream I had last night is of youA curtain flying in the wind, it’s a sea sideI taste salt from your roots and you too slakeYour thirst with the aroma I shed from my crevicesWe talk food we didn’t eat and love over heatFrom our mouths.

02-01-2022||Chandigarh||No decision yet on BJP’s CM face in Punjab: Gajendra Singh Shekhawat||The BJP seems to be dragging its feet on the announcement of the Dalit chief minister face for Punjab. BJP poll campaign in-charge and Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat underlined that no decision has been taken yet on the party’s chief ministerial face for the polls. Shekhawat was accompanied by state general secretary Subhash Sharma in Jalandhar on Saturday. While addressing a press conference, when asked that BJP’s national general secretary Tarun Chugh had made the announcement of a Dalit CM face in April, he said he feels that was his (Chugh) personal views as no person was authorised in the party to give such statements.“In the BJP, our parliamentary board decides upon the chief minister. Let the parliamentary board sit and decide the matter,” added Shekhawat. On the 100 days of chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s government in Punjab, Shekhawat claimed that it was full of empty promises. When asked about the Dalit CM face last week, state BJP president Ashwani Sharma, too, said that the sentiments of an individual do not reflect the party’s stand. A final call over such a vital decision had to be taken by the parliamentary board of the party. “The opposition parties will be decimated in the upcoming assembly elections and history will be created by the BJP by forming the government,” he said. Shekhawat claimed that the BJP will form the next government in the state and revive the economy of Punjab. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi would address a historic rally in Ferozepur on January 5 as there was huge enthusiasm among people. “The Prime Minister has a special bond with Punjab and will definitely work out a roadmap to rejuvenate the economy of the state,” he said. 
02-01-2022||Chandigarh||Start India, Pakistan trade by opening Khemkaran-Kasur rail link: Adesh Partap Kairon to PM||Former food and civil supplies minister Adesh Partap Singh Kairon on Saturday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is scheduled to visit Punjab on January 5, to open trade between India and Pakistan by using the Khemkaran-Kasur rail link, which has been lying closed since the Partition.“Instead of giving lollipops and freebies, there is a need to bring better economic policies to increase the income-generating resources of Punjab. There is no need to acquire any land or lay any rail line. An integrated check post should be established at the Khemkaran border to open trade between both the countries, which will not only increase the income of the farmers of Punjab but also provide better employment opportunities, especially to the people living in border areas,” Kairon said while addressing a press conference at his native village.He said, “The PM is coming to Punjab and I demand from him to pay special attention towards strengthening the commerce and industry sector of Punjab. Today, no big companies are ready to open their business in the state owing to its proximity to the international border. Many political parties have been talking about providing freebies to the people of Punjab, but the state needs a long-term solution. We need Himachal and Haryana-like industrial policies. The Central government should support Punjab to bring agricultural industries here.”“I am not against the freebies, but there should be proper policies to sustain these freebies from the state’s exchequer. Delhi CM Arwind Kejriwal has announced ₹1,000 to every woman in Punjab, but there is no clarity on where the amount will come. The state is already facing fiscal crises,” he said.He asked the PM to ensure the early completion of his brain-child project—the Patti-Makhu rail link, which connects the Majha and Malwa regions of the state. The project has been hanging fire for the last eight years. Farmers stand to benefit from the link as they could send vegetables and fruit to markets in Mumbai and Gujarat much faster. The distance between Amritsar and Mumbai will be reduced by 240 km, as the project will also link Punjab with the trade capitals of Gujarat and Maharashtra.Demanding the PM’s focus towards the border farmers, who have not received their compensation for the last four years, Kairon said, “The farmers of around 220 border villages of Punjab have not been getting their compensation due to the poor implementation of the policy. The PM should directly intervene and ensure the release of the compensation. These farmers have also been facing problems for many years in getting compensation for the land acquired by the Border Security Force (BSF) along both sides of the barbed-wire fence for patrolling. The PM should direct the officials concerned to fix the acquired land’s rate, besides releasing the compensation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/start-india-pakistan-trade-by-opening-khemkaran-kasur-rail-link-adesh-partap-kairon-to-pm-101641069065629.html
02-01-2022||Chandigarh||Charanjit Channi weakest chief minister of Punjab: Harpal Cheema||Leader of Opposition (LoP) Harpal Singh Cheema on Saturday said chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi is coming around to accept the ground reality of his “hollow announcements”. In a statement issued here, Cheema said on Saturday that Channi himself exposed the reality of his cabinet’s announcement to regularise 36,000 temporary employees in the state. “Today, the CM had to publicly tell the truth that 36,000 employees weren’t regularised. Whereas, we (Aam Aadmi Party) are saying this since day one that no employees are being regularised,” said Cheema, claiming that AAP state president Bhagwant Mann had challenged the Channi government to give names of any 36 employees that have been made permanent after the announcement. Terming Channi as the weakest chief minister of Punjab, Cheema said judging Channi’s “non-serious” attitude, all government officials are out of their control and due to their civil war, leaders and ministers seem to be uncontrollable. Cheema said if the chief minister had completed the process of filing for regularisation with seriousness, there wouldn’t have been any solid reason on the part of the governor to not clear that file. He said Channi is giving a statement that the governor is not signing the file, and if he didn’t then Channi with his entire cabinet would stage a dharna in front of Punjab Raj Bhawan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/charanjit-channi-weakest-chief-minister-of-punjab-harpal-cheema-101641069063639.html

The leaders are being given only two choices to either join BJP or be thrown behind the bars. Sidhu was in the district to participate in the Congress election rally in the Sahnewal area on Saturday.He claimed that even leaders who have committed marginal corruption in the past are being pressured and there are many who have been running mafia in the state.“The BJP was nowhere seen in the state in the last five years and now the party is forcing leaders to join them by pressuring them through the ED and other Central government agencies. Earlier also, there were 78 MLAs of Congress but the CM was of the BJP and he was working under the influence of the BJP and the ED,” said Sidhu. He also flayed Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) claiming that Kejriwal never came to Punjab in the last five years and now he was making false promises to form liquor corporation and generate employment, even as he has failed to perform in Delhi. Also, Delhi was the first state to notify three contentious farm laws.Speaking on the rift between Congress leaders over party tickets, Sidhu stated that there was a rift in every party but the party will choose honest candidates on merit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/corrupt-leaders-being-pressured-through-central-agencies-like-ed-to-join-bjp-navjot-singh-sidhu-101641069002653.html

Police said that this is perhaps the first time that there were hardly any complaints about drunken brawls, loud music and late night parties. According to operators at the PCR, even young children greeted them and conveyed wishes for their family members. One of the operators said that the callers simply wanted to greet them and asked to transfer calls to the PCR vehicles deployed for night patrolling. Police officials said that they received only 20 complaints about late night parties even after restrictions and three complaints about loud music. KK Rao, commissioner of police, said that 4,000 policemen were deployed on the streets on December 31 to maintain law and order situation. “Most of the parties and events were cancelled, and the night curfew imposed in the wake of rising Covid cases was implemented strictly. Our teams worked all night to ensure people did not organise large gatherings and were home post 11pm,” he said. Rao said the control room phone started ringing from 11.55pm and people wished the force for their good work. “People were expressing their concerns for police teams and wanted to send tea and coffee for the personnel at a few locations,” he said. According to the officials, most people celebrated the New Year’s eve at their homes, and crackers were also not allowed.

Sharma, his wife and two sons (aged 10 and 4) were travelling in an Audi Q7, and his parents (70 and 75) were travelling in another car on Friday to attend a dinner programme at a friend’s house in Noida Sector 26 on New Year’s Eve. “I was following my parents’ car near the Sector 52 metro station, when five to six men in a white Hyundai Verna car were driving the car from the wrong side. When my parents questioned them about driving on the wrong side, the suspects abused them. When we intervened, the suspects also used expletives on us,” Sharma said, adding that they decided not to engage with them and drove away.“My parents had safely navigated. However, the suspects started chasing our car near Hoshiarpur T-Point. We took a right turn towards Sector 35-52 and started to drive a little faster,” he said, adding that the suspects tried to overtake and stop them on the way. “When they failed, they threw at least eight to 10 beer bottles at us from the sunroof of their car. One of the bottles hit our car’s rear glass, which got damaged. The glass particles came inside the vehicle... my children had a narrow escape. The suspects followed us till Iskcon Temple in Noida Sector 33 and then drove away,” he said.The family somehow reached the friend’s place and informed the local resident welfare association (RWA) and the police.The incident took place between 9.10pm and 9.45pm, said Sharma, adding that he did not find any PCR or police vehicle on the way. He said that his children are still in shock. Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, Noida, said that the Sector 49 police has been directed to investigate the matter and scan CCTV footage along the route to identify and arrest the suspects at the earliest. Vinod Kumar, station house officer (SHO), Sector 49 police station, said that the victim could not note the registration number of the suspects’ car. “We have received a complaint on behalf of Sharma from the Sector 51 RWA on WhatsApp. There is no specific section for road rage incidents... A case will be registered under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 427 (mischief) and 279 (rash driving) at the Sector 49 police station. “We have not found the car in the CCTV camera footage till Saturday evening,” he said.Sanjeev Kumar, general secretary of Sector 51 RWA, said this was a serious matter. “We have informed the police and also called a residents’ meeting to discuss the issue on Sunday,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/road-rage-case-in-noida-group-of-men-chase-victim-s-car-throw-alcohol-bottles-101641066241793.html

Officials said the 81 fresh cases have primarily been reported from trans-Hindon localities like Indirapuram, Kaushambi, Vasundhara, Vaishali and Raj Nagar among others. An MLA (details not shared) and 11 of his family members were among the fresh cases reported on Saturday. With the sudden increase in the number of Covid cases, the sample positivity rate jumped from 0.62% (out of 5,369 samples tested) on Friday to 1.62% (out of 4,984 samples tested) on Saturday.The spike in the sample positivity rate indicates that the cases have risen even if the testing has not been increased. Sample positivity rate is the number of samples testing positive per 100 samples. Sometimes, patients would give more than one test for confirmation, and so the total positive samples could be higher than total positive cases. The overall sample positivity since the start of the pandemic (in March 2020) stands at 2.4%. “There is a sudden rise in the number of Covid and 81 infections were reported till the midnight of December 31, 2021. Majority of the patients are asymptomatic and also include one MLA and 11 of his family members. These cases have come in mostly from trans-Hindon localities where people often move to neighbouring cities for work,” said Dr Sunil Tyagi, additional chief medical officer.“As a result of the sudden spike, we have put on standby 58 healthcare facilities, which include government and private hospitals. This has been done for patients in areas requiring immediate medical intervention, and the people could be shifted to nearby facilities immediately in such cases,” according to Tyagi. The officials said that the majority of patients are asymptomatic, and they become difficult to trace. “That is why they often come in contact with other people and pass on the infection. In order to find out more suspected cases, we have also asked hospitals to conduct tests for OPD patients if they show symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI) or that of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI),” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, district surveillance officer. The symptoms of ILI and SARI include fever, cough, loss of appetite, body aches among others, which are generally found in Covid patients, too. According to the officials, the 58 hospitals have a total of 3,459 Covid beds, which include 796 ICU beds, 228 ventilator beds and 105 equipped with oxygen concentrators. The officials said that if the cases continue to rise further, they would scale up the number of beds to nearly 6,000, so that there is no shortage of beds in case patients need admission. “The rise in cases indicates that it is the start of another Covid wave and it is time that testing should increase in order to find out more cases so that they can be identified and treated at the earliest. It is high time that enforcement should increase against people not wearing masks or following Covid protocols properly,” said Dr Ashish Aggarwal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter). As of now, official records till Saturday (January 1) morning indicate that the district has had 55,919 cases since the start of the pandemic in 2020, and the active cases stand at 192.

Defended his government against the oft-repeated allegations of failing to deliver justice in sacrilege cases, claiming that the previous SAD-BJP government had not done its legal homework on the case. “Only one person gave statement under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) against Baba (Ram Rahim) and we issued warrants. The court allowed us custodial interrogation of Baba. Our team went to interrogate the dera’s team thrice, but nobody was found there. We have again sought custodial interrogation. We are proceeding in the case, keeping in mind legal hitches,” Channi told a press conference. FIXED ALLOWANCE INCREASEDEmphasising the need to boost employment avenues, Channi added, “My government is already in the advanced stage of implementing the Employment Guarantee Scheme, which would be announced soon. Modalities are complete.” He added that the regularisation of services of 4,587 Safai Sewaks and Sewermen working on contract basis Urban Local Bodies is already under way, with the notification having been issued.

He added that the fixed allowance of 42,500 mid-day meal workers has been increased from ₹2,200 to ₹3,000 per month at a cost of ₹64.2 crore.EVASIVE ON SIDHUOn Punjab Congress chief Navjot Sidhu’s repeated tirades against the decision of his government, the CM was evasive. “I am ready to work with the PPCC chief, as party organisation is considered to be boundary/fencing of the government. It is the party that has to propagate the works of the government.” When pressed for a clear answer, he said “Aaate aate aayega dil ko karaar, jaate jaate bekrari jayegi (the heart will peaceful, when it has to; unease will ease, when it has to).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/channi-outlines-initiatives-of-his-1st-100-days-as-punjab-cm-101641065401512.html

Acting on a tip-off that a Nigerian will deliver a drug consignment in DLF Phase 1 on Friday night, a team led by Ajay Dhankhar, in-charge of HSNCB Gurugram, reached the spot and barricaded the area, officials said. Dhankhar said that around 12.30am they spotted a two-wheeler and when signalled to stop, the rider tried to enter a hotel property but lost balance and fell. “We caught hold of the suspect and recovered a packet of white powder which was tested to be cocaine and weighed 10 grams,” he said. The cost of the drugs in the international market is around ₹5 lakh, the officials said.The suspect was identified as Chukwubuike Francis Onyegiri of Umunze in Nigeria, the officials said, adding that he came to India on a student visa on February 18, 2021, and his visa is valid until February 17, 2024. Vishnu Prasad, assistant commissioner of police, HSNCB, said that the suspect is being questioned about his previous involvements and source of the drugs. “It is also being probed to whom the consignment was to be delivered,” he said. According to Prasad, it is suspected that the Nigerian got the drugs from Delhi and supplied them in pubs, bars, and night clubs in the city. “Drugs such as cocaine, heroin and weed are sold at parties. The suspect, who is a member of a group dealing in drugs, was regularly supplying the drugs since February,” he said. The suspect was booked under Section 21 (punishment for contravention in relation to manufactured drugs and preparations )and Section 16 (punishment for contravention in relation to coca plant and coca leaves) of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act at DLF Phase 1 police station on Friday night. In a separate incident, the HSNCB team arrested two men with 650 grams of cannabis on Saturday from Lokra village in Pataudi. The suspects were identified as Hemant and Manoj, both from Pataudi. They were on a motorcycle when the team intercepted them and recovered the drugs. A case under relevant sections of the NDPS Act was registered against the duo at Pataudi police station, the officials said.
02-01-2022||Other||Pandemic effect: Pendency in HC at 4.5 lakh, over 15% cases added in 2021||Chandigarh The restrictions that Covid-19 pandemic induced have led to massive increase in pendency of cases in the Punjab and Haryana high court. According to government data tracking agency, National Judicial Data Grid, pendency of cases in high court on December 31 was recorded at 4.48 lakh cases with 69,000-odd cases added to the list in 2021 alone. Of total cases, 2.83 lakh were civil and 1.65 lakh criminal. On December 31, 2020 the pendency was 3.79 lakh cases with 2.42 lakh civil and 1.37 lakh criminal. The pendency on December 31, 2019, was 3.54 lakh cases including 2.33 lakh civil and 1.21 lakh criminal. Courts have been functioning in restricted mode, since March 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country and lockdown was imposed on March 24. Functioning of courts has been resumed, partially, with focus on disposal of freshly instituted cases. Old cases are being adjourned; the latest such move happened in December, when cases listed for January were adjourned for a date between July-September 2022. Data shows over 95,000 cases are between 1-3 years old, including 21 months of the pandemic, 88,655 are 3-5 years old, the highest pendency is in the category of 5-10 year-old cases at 1.05 lakh. The court has 13,344 cases pending for 20-30 years. ‘Special efforts needed to speed up disposal’ Lawyers say, when the functioning resumes fully, the filing is likely to go up manifold. Over 11,000 cases were such which have been filed, but not numbered in 2021, when ordinary cases filing was allowed by high court, says, Bar Association president, SS Grewal. He added that they have met the chief justice recently and would be meeting him again, when courts open after winter vacations. “Special efforts are required to speed up disposal. One way could be that cases, where replies are yet to be filed, be listed before a registrar and put up before a bench only when pleadings are complete,” he added. The situation has deteriorated to the extent that a lawyer wrote to the registrar general recently, questioning the fact that how were cases being adjourned through administrative orders. On some occasions, lawyers suspended work demanding that more category of cases be listed for hearing. “The high court ought to continue to hold its courts in restrictive manner and should not be adjourning cases. The pandemic, unfortunately, has more or less become a part of our lives,” said, lawyer Amar Vivek, former additional advocate general, Haryana, who in a letter sought details of government advisories, which have been the basis for adjourning cases. 49 judges against sanctioned strength of 85 The HC is functioning with 49 judges now, against the sanctioned strength of 85; for most of 2021, it functioned only with 44-46 judges, with five judges being appointed in October. Those appointed in October were recommended by the HC in August 2020. It has rarely recorded judges’ strength beyond 50. At one point of time in 2020, the strength was of 56 judges. But due to retirements and delay in new appointments number came down to 44 in 2021. There is only a remote possibility of HC getting more judges, immediately. The situation appears to be even more alarming in lower courts. In Haryana, pendency has gone up to 12.82 lakh, with 4.33 lakh civil cases and 8.49 criminal cases. In Chandigarh, over 69,000 cases are pending, nearly 23,000 civil and over 46,000 criminal. In Punjab, 9.19 lakh cases are pending with 5.24 lakh criminal and 3.95 lakh. ‘Ramped up virtual infra’ The high court administration said that virtual infrastructure has been ramped up in the high court as well as in lower courts and physical hearings are taking place, wherever possible. “The national judicial data grid figures include miscellaneous cases as well, such as traffic challans etc. Exact data is being compiled and will be available after high court opens after winter vacations,” said high court public relations officer, Vikram Aggarwal.

Online slots were made available for the children at 16 vaccination centres on Saturday, and there is also a walk-in facility for them if they produce their school ID cards or Aadhaar cards, besides other valid documents. “We have sought permission from schools so that vaccination administering teams can visit and provide Covaxin doses to the children. We have identified nearly 60 schools so far, and consent for camps is likely to be received from more in the coming days,” said Dr GP Mathuria, nodal officer for Covid vaccination. In December 2021, the Uttar Pradesh government issued guidelines for vaccinating children aged 15-18 years from January 3 this year, and also for senior citizens, healthcare workers and frontline workers who will be administered the third dose of the Covid vaccine from January 10. The government has also set targets for vaccinating beneficiaries in different groups.Gautam Budh Nagar has a target of vaccinating 115,592 children, and Ghaziabad would be vaccinating 234,488 beneficiaries in the 15-18 age category. “We are also appealing to schools to encourage children of classes 10 and 12 to get vaccinated at the earliest, so that they get their second Covaxin dose before their board exams. The second dose in case of Covaxin becomes due after 28 days. Once the vaccination starts on January 3, one team will be deployed at each school who requested for the vaccination camp,” Dr Mathuria added. At present, officials familiar with the development said that they have stock of nearly 50,000 doses of Covaxin and more will be procured before the vaccination process scheduled from January 3. According to the state guidelines, children will be administered only Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin as it is the only vaccine with Emergency Use Listing (EUL) for the 15-18 years age group and recommended by ‘Covid -19 Working Group’ of the National Technical Advisory Group on immunisation. Regarding the daily Covid vaccination till December 31, the district has achieved a target of 97.44% in case of administration of the first dose (2,632,938 doses administered against the first dose target of 2,702,167 doses). The second dose coverage is nearly 67.97%, with 1,789,676 beneficiaries who have got both the doses of vaccines till December 31, 2021. Of the first dose coverage, the district has administered 100% or more in case of healthcare workers, frontline workers and the ones in the 18-45 category.
02-01-2022||Chandigarh||Three killed, two injured after landslide at Dadam mining zone in Bhiwani||At least three persons were killed and two others were injured after a landslide at Tosham’s Dadam mining zone in Bhiwani district on Saturday, said district officials.The deceased have been identified as Sanjay Kumar, of Jind, Toffan Singh, of Jharkhand, and Vijender Kumar, of a village in Bhiwani’s Tosham tehsil. Two others were rescued out of the debris and were rushed to a private hospital in Hisar where they are undergoing treatment.The district officials said three persons were killed in the incident while Haryana home minister Anil Vij confirmed the death of four persons in the mishap at Dadam mining zone. The incident took place at around 8am on Saturday.Bhiwani superintendent of police (SP) Ajit Singh Shekhawat said, “A rescue operation is underway and four Poklane, dumpers and other machines are buried in the rubble. A team of doctors has also reached to provide medical assistance to the injured. A few more people are feared to be trapped.”Vij said a rescue operation by the district administration was underway and teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) have been called.In a tweet, Vij said: “I am deeply saddened by the accident that happened at the mining site in Haryana’s Bhiwani district. Rescue operation is being carried out by the administration. NDRF team has been called from Ghaziabad, SDRF team has been called from Madhuban. An army unit has been called from Hisar. Four people have died so far.”Large-scale mining operations are carried out in the hills of Khanak and Dadam in Bhiwani’s Tosham assembly constituency. Two months back, mining work was banned here due to rising pollution levels. Some eye witnesses said mining activities were halted after the National Green Tribunal (NGT) issued orders. On Thursday, the NGT had allowed resuming mining work and it had started the next day.“We speculate that explosions might be made to fulfil the shortage of building material which led to landslides but the exact cause of the collapse of stone mines is yet to be ascertained,” the eye witnesses added.Earlier in the day, Haryana agriculture minister JP Dalal, who is Loharu (neighbouring to Tosham constituency) MLA, reached the spot.“Some people have died. I cannot provide the exact figures as of now. A team of doctors has arrived. We will try to save as many people as possible. I have directed the police, administrative officials and a medical team to ensure swift rescue operations and immediate assistance to the injured,” he said.Tosham MLA and senior Congress leader Kiran Choudhry and leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda along with other leaders expressed grief over the incident and blamed the ruling BJP-JJP government for the incident.“I had flagged the issue of rampant illegal mining at Dadam many times in the state assembly but the government turned a deaf ear to the matter. The government should initiate a probe into the matter and compensate the families of those killed and injured in the mishap,” Choudhry added.Hooda said even the Supreme Court had made a serious comment on illegal mining being done in the area by flouting rules but the government is not conducting a fair investigation.“There should be a judicial inquiry into the flouting of norms,” Hooda added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/three-killed-two-injured-after-landslide-at-dadam-mining-zone-in-bhiwani-101641064502703.html

Ashu was also among those whose name was being whispered around as leaving the Congress. He dismissed any such talk as baseless. “Only non-performing, overambitious leaders or MLAs, who suspect that they might not get the party ticket this time, are joining other parties ahead of the assembly polls,” he said, after the trial run of the Pakhowal Road RUB (railway under-bridge) on Saturday. “The opposition is trying to tarnish our image, ahead of the elections, as the Congress is in a strong position. Many rumours are circulating, including one that the party symbol is missing from my posters installed in my constituency. No cabinet minister is joining the BJP. Only over-ambitious leaders and MLAs have joined other parties; these leaders sense that they might not get party ticket due to non-performance,” Ashu claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/only-non-performers-leaving-cong-ashu-101641064443347.html

The caller said that the two suspects shot the eatery owner, Rana, dead after he refused to serve them food.”Police took the victim to a nearby private hospital, where the doctors declared him dead, he added. A case has been registered against the two suspects under Indian Penal Code (IPC) Section 302 (murder) at the Beta 2 police station on Saturday, Kumar said.The 35-year-old eatery’s cook -- Praveen Kumar -- is an eyewitness in the case.“Praveen said that the two suspects reached the eatery at 1:30am on Saturday and ordered paratha. When Rana told them that the eatery caters to only online orders, the two suspects created a ruckus there,” Kumar said. Rana dialled 112 and a PCR van, which patrols the area, reached the spot. The suspects fled the spot after the police arrived there.At 3:30am, the two suspects again visited the eatery, this time armed with an illegal weapon. “They opened three shots of bullets at Rana, and injured him in the chest,” he said. Amit Kumar, deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida, said that Praveen revealed during questioning that Akash frequently visited the eatery. “We arrested both Akash and Yogendra from Greater Noida at 10am on Saturday,” he said. Police have also recovered the weapon used in the crime. The suspects were produced before a court and sent to judicial custody on Saturday.Sarita Rana, 30, sister of the victim, said that she and her family members were in Maharashtra’s Shirdi for a pilgrimage. “My brother used to return home at night. On New Year’s Eve i.e, Friday (December 31, 2021) he came home late. Some of his staff had left the place, and he was about to leave for work, when the suspects arrived at the eatery and opened fire. We do not have much information about the incident. Now, we are returning to Greater Noida,” Rana said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-eatery-owner-refuses-to-serve-food-on-new-year-s-day-murdered-101641062940951.html
02-01-2022||Noida||Noida registry office shut for third day over row on buildings in flood plains||Advocates continued to lock the stamp and registration department’s office building in Noida Sector 33 for the third day on Saturday, disrupting public work, as they demand execution of registries on residential buildings built on flood plain areas.They shouted slogans against the district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar, Suhas LY, demanding prohibition of registry of plots and flats on flood plain areas.Suhas LY, however, said that he stands by his order issued in September 2020, which bans registrations of ”illegal” buildings built on flood plain areas because the move is to protect “ecology of river and safeguard the rights of poor people, who are lured by land mafias” who develop illegal housing facilities along River Hindon. Meanwhile, the Bar Association of Noida said that they will continue to lock the registry office in Sector 33 if the registries on flood plain areas will not be allowed in the future. The special secretary with the Uttar Pradesh government, Ajay Kumar Awasthi, said in an order on December 6, 2021, that “there is a loss of revenue for the state government due to the ban on registrations, and thus the ban must be lifted”. “But even after the order of the special secretary of the state government, the ban on registrations continues on flood plain areas, affecting at least 1 lakh people who have bought property in the flood plains of Hindon or Yamuna. If the order is not implemented, we will continue to protest and lock the office. The ban is affecting our livelihood and affecting the people who have bought properties in flood plain areas,” said Shyamber Singh Baisoya, president of Bar Association of Noida. The general secretary of Bar Association of Noida, LC Sharma, said, “Why Why were these housing facilities allowed to be built on the flood plain of River Hindon? If these are built, people will live there, then why no registrations.” The committee of district disaster management of Gautam Budh Nagar constituted under Section 25 of the Disaster Management Act on September 30, 2020, prohibited registrations of structures on the land on flood plains and ‘unsafe unauthorised buildings’, because those are not considered safe for living. The district \magistrate, Suhas LY, also prohibited the registration process under the Disaster Management Act provisions. “We banned the registrations because land mafias are selling properties on unsafe structures or buildings, which are not even authorised by the local authorities on flood plain areas. Even the Allahabad high court, in its orders on February 3, 2021, took the disaster management committee’s decision on record and refused to lift the ban. We cannot allow illegal activities by land mafias in flood plain areas, come what may,” said Suhas LY. Administration and advocates will discuss the issue on Monday, said officials. “We will discuss the issue with advocates on Monday in detail to resolve the deadlock,” said Vandita Srivastava, additional district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar. 
02-01-2022||Lucknow||Cybercriminals adopting different strategies during pandemic, warn cyber experts||Beware, cybercriminals are adopting different strategies to dupe people to the advantage of the changing scenario at the time of the pandemic outbreak and its changing scenario, said UP police cybercrime cell’s superintendent of police (SP) Triveni Singh here on Saturday.The SP said the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has issued an alert for the citizens about the latest tricks and fraud being done by the cybercriminals on the pretext of Omicron testing and medicines. He said the state cyber crime cell is also trying to propagate it and alert people about this new trick about cyber fraudsters so they do not fall into the trap and lose their hard-earned money through these phishing emails sent to them and asked to share their details.Singh said cyber fraudsters are taking advantage of the situation by adopting new techniques to swindle citizens. He said the fraudsters try to capitalize on the things that the common man is going through and health issue is the main concern for everyone during the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak.He said the MHA has explained its modus-operandi in its advisory stating that fraudsters send emails regarding testing for Omicron with the attached malicious links and malicious files. He said government and private health services are being mimicked (e.g. their names are used as senders) in such attempts to scam innocent citizens.The SP said the potential victims clicking on the links are pointed towards fake websites created by fraudsters that look similar to government/private health services, where citizens can apply for a “Covid-19 Omicron PCR test”. He said the lure of a free Omicron PCR test allowing citizens to avoid Omicron related restrictions imposed by governments is presented to potential victims.He said the fake website prompt people to fill in their details like name, date of birth, home address, mobile number, and email address, mother’s maiden name, etc., and the process of registration is completed with a transaction of a small amount as registration fees from victims. The banking details of the victims are captured through such small transactions.“Cybercriminals attain personal details and banking credentials through this method for committing further cyber crimes such as financial cyber frauds, identity theft, etc,” the advisory said.The SP said people should simply avoid emails from unknown senders to remain safe from such phishing emails. He said people should avoid using unofficial websites of health services and other government/non-governmental services. He said people should avoid web pages with addresses not beginning with https://.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/cybercriminals-adopting-different-strategies-during-pandemic-warn-cyber-experts-101641062521454.html
02-01-2022||Lucknow||Yogi lashes out at Samajwadi Party in Rampur||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday lambasted the Samajwadi Party (SP) in the bastion of its Rampur MP Azam Khan, who is currently in jail in connection with multiple cases, and said that during their reign the “Rampuri chaku (knife)” was used for capturing the land of the poor. He also alleged rioters were honoured at the chief minister’s residence under SP rule.In an attack on SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, Yogi Adityanath said, “I heard “Babua” (a reference to Akhilesh) saying that they could have also got the Ram temple constructed.”“Kabristan banane se fursat hoti, toh Ram mandir ke bare mein sochte. (They would have thought of the Ram temple only they had time to spare after building graveyards),” he said.Those who did not hesitate to fire bullets on Hindus in Ayodhya, are now talking of getting the Ram temple constructed in the holy city, Yogi said.Yogi Adityanath was addressing a public meeting after inaugurating and laying the foundation stone of 25 development projects worth ₹95 crore in Rampur district.“We follow the guru parampara (tradition) for using the Rampuri knife. In the hands of good people, it will be used to protect the country and religion, but wrong people will misuse it in looting, capturing the properties of the poor and downtrodden. (Rampur ki ye chaku Samajwadi Party mein gareebon ki sampatti par kabza karne ka hathiyar bana),” he said.Comparing his government with the previous ones, Yogi said, “Fark saaf hai (a reference to the BJP’s catchline). Before 2017, the accused in the Muzaffarnagar riots and Saharanpur riots were called and honoured at the CM’s residence. After 2017, the farmers are honoured and Gurbani is recited at the CM’s residence.”Targeting Akhilesh Yadav further, the chief minister said that “Babua” was saying when he forms the government, free electricity would be provided, but when the (SP) government was there before 2017, they did not give electricity.“It was our government that provided electricity and constructed toilets,” Yogi said.Referring to cash seizures during tax raids, CM Yogi asked the SP apologise to the public.“We are recovering money from the people who were looting the public’s money and buried it in the walls. In the SP regime, the youths were cheated and did not get jobs,” he said.Reacting to the chief minister’s remarks, SP leader and former UP minister Pawan Pandey said: “With each passing day, these people (BJP top leaders) are getting more and more scared of Akhileshji and the support he is getting. Our previous government is remembered for its development works and now people are restive about getting it back. Our government had worked for all the sections of the society.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-lashes-out-at-samajwadi-party-in-rampur-101641062400955.html
02-01-2022||Mumbai||Ten ministers, 20 MLAs infected for Covid-19, says Ajit Pawar||Mumbai: Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Saturday confirmed that 10 ministers of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government and 20 legislators are infected with Covid-19, and urged people to follow Covid norms in the midst of the third wave in the state. The winter session of the state legislature, which ended on December 28, took place over five days, Pawar said. Inspite of this, many legislators were found positive.Among the infected are revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat, school education minister Varsha Gaikwad, women and child development minister Yashomati Thakur and state of minister for urban development Prajakt Tanpure — all of whom declared themselves positive for Covid-19 on their Twitter handle in the past one week.Other ministers and legislators who are Covid positive include state tribal development minister K C Padvi, Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, Sameer Meghe, and Madhuri Misal. More than 2,300 people were tested at a camp set up outside the state legislature building at Nariman Point for those attending or covering the second week of the session, which started on December 22.At least 54 people tested positive for the virus. This number does not include the state ministers and MLAs mentioned above.Several house staffers, police personnel and journalists who covered the legislative proceedings were found to be infected.The assembly secretariat also made it mandatory for all participating members to undergo Covid tests twice during the five-day long session: first at the beginning of the session and then after a gap of three days.“We have imposed fresh restrictions to contain the situation. The winter session of the state legislature was held only for five days. Despite that ten ministers and nearly 20 legislators have been infected with Covid-19,” Pawar said, speaking after paying tribute at Jay Stambh on the 204th anniversary of Koregaon Bhima war memorial in Pune.“The new variant (Omicron) of Covid-19 is infecting people at a very fast pace. It has wreaked havoc in countries such as the United States, France and Britain. We have suffered a lot during the second wave as many people close to us lost their lives. Life is important and the state government is trying to save your lives. We request you to follow all Covid appropriate norms,” Pawar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ten-ministers-20-mlas-infected-for-covid-19-says-ajit-pawar-101641062341139.html
02-01-2022||Mumbai||Cost of coastal road project to escalate||Mumbai: The ongoing construction work for the Mumbai Coastal Road Project (MCRP), stalled for two months near Cleveland Bunder at Worli due to an ongoing protest by fisher community will raise the cost of the project to a tune of ₹30 crore, civic officials said.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is building a span (bridge) near Cleveland Bunder to connect the coastal road with the Bandra-Worli Sea Link (BWSL).However, members of the Worli Koliwada fisher community who are staging the protest, said that the upcoming span will have a direct impact on their livelihood as they will not be able to safely navigate their boats into the sea.The 10.58 km road originates near the Princess Street Flyover at Marine Drive and will connect the BWSL through the proposed span at Worli that will be constructed near Cleveland Bunder. The span’s pillars in the sea are proposed to be built with a gap of 56 metres. However, fisherfolk said that they will need at least a 200-metre gap between each pillar for the safe passage of their boats during high tide.The local artisanal fishing community has been protesting since October 30 due to which construction work on the connecting bridge has been stalled.The BMC has said they have already suffered a loss of ₹30 crore and if the delay in works continues then the overall cost could escalate further. As per the 2021-22 BMC budget, the cost of this project is ₹12,950 crore including construction and other consultancy charges. “All the construction works that were happening at Worli and Cleveland Bunder have come to halt for more than two months. The proposed connector is an important aspect of this project because this is the point of interchange from where traffic coming from and going to the northern side of the city using the coastal road will merge with the BWSL,” said a senior official, who didn’t wish to be named.In December, state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray had said that MCRP will be completed by December 2023. The officials said that the BMC had planned to finish the primary construction works for this span by May 2022, but due to the ongoing protests the BMC is already two months behind its schedule and with monsoon, the project will get delayed further. With an estimated loss of ₹5 crore per month, the BMC has said that they are set to suffer a minimum loss of ₹30 crore for this delay which will increase further if the work doesn’t resume soon.“The six months delay will cost us ₹30 crore because of the machines and logistics that are lying unused. Besides these, there are other overhead costs which include day to day office expenses, fuel costs, freight charges, manpower and electricity charges. These additional charges will easily escalate the cost of the project by multiple fold,” said the official.The BMC has appointed the Tata Institute of Social Service (TISS) for carrying out a survey for giving out compensation to the fisherfolk community. The BMC also claimed that they have also offered to pay interim relief compensation to the members in advance however the members are reluctant to give in unless the BMC assures them that the width between the pillars will be increased to 200 metres.“We have reports of all the state appointed technical agencies which suggests that a width of 30-35 metres will be more than enough for them and here we are proposing a gap of 50-56 metres. Also the existing span at BWSL is only 17 metres wide but they have been operating boats below that for many years now,” the official said.Nitesh Patil, secretary of Worli Koliwada Nakhwa Matsya Vyavsay Sahakari Society Limited, who is spearheading the movement, said that their protests will continue unless the BMC agrees to increase the width of the span.“During high tide and monsoon it will become difficult for us to navigate our boats through such a narrow span. We need at least 200 metres of gap for safe passage. There are heavy winds blowing by this area throughout the year and the sea bed near Cleveland Bunder is very dangerous as there are rocks over there. If adequate space is not given to us then the gushing winds will lead to crashing of the boats in the pillars of the proposed bridge,” said Patil.“Due to the reclamation all our catches have moved away from the shallow waters and we have to travel deep into the sea for our daily catch. Now if we don’t have enough space to navigate our boats then how are we supposed to sail into the sea? We have our own source of livelihood but if our demands are not taken into consideration then it will be difficult for us to survive,” he said.Royal Patil, another member of the community, said that earlier this week, the BMC had written to them saying that a committee of TISS members will visit them for a survey.“We are not withdrawing our protest unless the demands are not met. They can do as many surveys as they want but we know the loss that we will face if our demands are not met,” said Royal Patil.The Worli Police had, on December 19, issued a notice to protesting fisherfolk under Section 49 of the Criminal Procedure Code, instructing them to “stop interfering” with ongoing Coastal Road construction work being carried out by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), or face prosecution. Since October 14, fisherfolk have prevented the BMC’s contractor from constructing the interchange between the Coastal Road and the Worli end of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link, which they maintain will cut them off from their traditional fishing grounds.Despite being warned of penal action, the fishers once again occupied the waters of the construction site (for the 10th time since October 14). Their demand is that the interchange’s design be revised to include a span of 200 metres under the bridge, to allow safe passage for their boats. Else the project will force them to shut down operations at Cleveland Bunder, a traditional Koli fishing port in Worli Koliwada, which locals estimate is at least a century old and supports between 40 to 60 motorised and non-motorised fishing boats on any given day, in addition to employing a large number of non-Koli and migrant fishers.(With inputs from Prayag Arora Desai)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cost-of-coastal-road-project-to-escalate-101641062222176.html

He had been with the Congress for two decades. Lali Majithia resigned as the chairman-cum-director of Punjab Pungrain on Thursday, accusing the state government of mishandling of sacrilege and drugs issue and will contest against SAD leader and former Punjab cabinet Bikram Majithia from Majitha. “We are sure that Lali will win the seat by defeating Majithia from Majitha constituency,” said Raghav Chadha, AAP’s Punjab co-incharge. The move is seen as a setback for the Congress; on Tuesday, two Congress MLAs from Gurdaspur district — Fateh Jung Bajwa and Balwinder Singh Ladi — had joined the BJP. Lali, who had been sidelined for at least four-and-a-half years, was given the plump post as the Pungrain chairman by former CM Captain Amarinder Singh in June. Amarinder had brought Lali to the fore to counter his rebels from the Majha region, after his ministers Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, Sukhjinder Singh Sukh Sarkaria, among other MLAs, had opened a front against Amarinder for not acting against Majithia. “The state government has failed to nab Majithia who has been booked in a drug case. Has he gone underground? The government is deliberately not arresting him. There has been no justice in sacrilege cases,” Lali has said in the pastCongress’s Amritsar-rural district president Bhagwan Singh Sachhar said, “Lali was given top posts even after he had lost several elections. He has betrayed the party.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/congs-lali-majithia-joins-aap-101641061620200.html

As on Saturday, Covid 19 vaccines were administered at 1,365 sites, of which 1,247 were government establishments.On December 25, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced inclusion of 15 to 18 year olds in the national Covid immunisation programme from January 3, 2022. The decision was taken based on the advice of technical experts on immunisation looking into the scientific evidence generated globally on children’s vaccination against Covid-19. The eligible teenagers will only be given Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin.The Delhi government has prepared a list of 159 vaccination centres across the city where beneficiaries between 15-18 years will be vaccinated from January 3. A senior official of Delhi’s health department said that while not all of these centres will be exclusively for children, a separate section of the building will be reserved for them so that they do not have to wait with others.“There will be a separate wing where children will be vaccinated. The entry and exit to these centres will be separate from the regular vaccination points. We are also getting schools to encourage children to come forward and get vaccinated from Monday,” said the official who asked not to be named.Also Read | Delhi govt readies 3,000 Covid beds of kids as cases surgeSome of the centres where children will be vaccinated are Hindu Rao Hospital, Giridhari Lal Hospital, Kasturba Hospital, Maulana Azad Medical College, Charak Palika Hospital, Government Girls Senior Secondary School, Bawana, Safdarjung Hospital. The full list of 159 centres can be accessed at dshm.delhi.gov.in.As part of the preparations, the Delhi government’s directorate of education (DoE) on Friday wrote to schools in the capital, directing them to inform parents to get their children in the 15-18 age group vaccinated as soon as possible. In its directive to both government and private schools, the department said that it was imperative for all government, government-aided, and private unaided school students aged 15 to 18 years to get vaccinated on an immediate basis.Outlining the crucial role that school heads could play in ensuring prompt vaccination of children, the DoE has asked schools to identify a nodal In-charge at the school to coordinate the vaccination drive . “Class teachers of the relevant classes/sections must ensure that parents are informed to take their children to nearest vaccination site earmarked for vaccination of children between 15 to 18 years of age,” the DoE directive said.AK Jha, principal of Government Co-ed Sarvodaya Vidyalaya, Rohini, said the school has already sent messages to parents. Jha said the school was in touch with doctors and exploring the possibility of carrying out vaccination through mobile vans. “A mobile van can be positioned at the school for a fixed number of days. This will allow us to vaccinate children in batches,” said Jha.Sudha Acharya, principal of ITL Public School, Dwarka, said the school will be holding a vaccination camp on after tying up with a private hospital. “We have written to a private hospital in the vicinity and the district administration for holding a vaccination camp. Starting from Monday, we will be holding webinars laying emphasis on the need for the vaccination of children. We will also rope in children to create awareness videos about vaccination to convince parents who are a little hesitant about vaccination,” said Acharya, who is also the chairperson of the National Progressive School Conference (NPSC) which has 122 Delhi schools as members.Dr Suneela Garg, professor and a member Lancet Commission Covid India Task Force, said as per 2011 census there are over 900,000 children in the Capital between 15-18 age group. Dr Garg said many under the 15-18 age group may be at risk due to obesity and other comorbidities, and that they also have higher chances of getting infected when they go to schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-readies-159-centres-for-vaccines-to-15-18-year-olds-101641059160841.html
02-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi: Cold wave abates, air quality worsens||New Delhi: Coldwave conditions in Delhi abated, at least statistically, on Saturday with the mercury rising marginally above four degrees on Saturday after two days staying below 4°C mark -- considered the benchmark by IMD to declare a coldwave.The city recorded a minimum temperature of 4.2 degrees Celsius on Saturday even as the IMD predicted that the temperatures are expected to start rising Monday onwards due to a fresh western disturbance (WD) that is expected to bring light showers to Delhi on January 5, 6 and 7.The IMD declares a coldwave in a region, when the minimum temperature is 4.5 degrees or more below the normal mark, or when it drops to 4 degrees or lower. Delhi recorded coldwave conditions on both December 30 and 31, with Safdarjung (3.8 degrees), Lodhi road (4 degrees) and Ayanagar (4 degrees) the stations meeting the criteria.The lowest minimum of the season so far has been 3.2 degrees Celsius, recorded at Safdarjung on December 20.On Saturday, Lodhi Road, Jafarpur and Safdarjung stations recorded 4.2 degrees Celsius, which is around three degrees below the normal mark for this time of the season. The maximum temperature was recorded at 20.2 degrees Celsius – one degree above normal.“Temperature will begin rising from Monday onwards and the minimum could touch 10 degrees Celsius by January 5. Overcast skies and light rain will meanwhile bring down the day-time temperature and make the day of January 5 and 6 cold, with the maximum expected to be below 20 degrees,” said Jenamani.According to the forecast, shallow to moderate fog is expected in the region on Sunday, with the maximum and minimum likely to hover around 21 and 4 degrees Celsius respectively.Meanwhile, a combination of low temperatures and cracker bursting on New Year’s eve led to deterioration of air quality in Delhi with the Central Pollution Control Board recording an air quality index of 362 (very poor) on Saturday. On Friday, Delhi’s AQI was recorded at 321 (very poor).Forecasts by the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar), a body under the ministry of earth sciences, predicted on Friday that air quality will deteriorate over the next three days, owing to firecracker emissions and coldwave conditions.Gufran Beig, founder project director at Safar however said adverse weather conditions played a key role in deterioration of air quality. “We had forecast both coldwave and firecracker emissions to impact Delhi, but the deterioration has not been too sharp. This indicates it was mainly due to the low temperatures prevailing in the region,” said Beig, stating air quality was unlikely to improve in the next three days, but a severe spell was also unlikely.Also, the sub-committee on Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) has lifted the ban on operation of stone crushers and hot-mix plants in NCR, according to an official order dated December 30, stating that air quality was unlikely to hit severe zone (AQI 401-500) until January 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-coldwave-abates-air-quality-worsens-101641058920672.html

02-01-2022||World||Near-vertical rise in Covid in US: 5 things Fauci observes about Omicron surge||Top US pandemic advisor Anthony Fauci on Sunday commented about the present surge of the epidemic in the United States, driven by Omicron. The US is experiencing almost a vertical increase in Covid cases but the peak has not yet come, Fauci said. The peak may be weeks away, he said in his interview to CNN.Here are 5 things that Fauci said:1. "We are definitely in the middle of a very severe surge and an uptick in cases," Fauci said. But the short-lived wave in South Africa offers some home that the surge will not last long.2. Omicron is milder than previous variants, now there is mounting evidence, Fauci said. The US rates of death and hospitalisations have been far lower so far, Fauci observed.3. However, there is still a danger of a surge in hospitalisation due to a large number of coronavirus cases. "There will certainly be a lot more cases because this is a much more transmissible virus than Delta is," Fauci said.4. For children, it's not unsafe to get back to school, Fauci said. "I think all those things put together, it's safe enough to get those kids back to school, balanced against the deleterious effects of keeping them out," he added.5. Because of the increase in cases, the system will be put under stress, he said. “When I say major disruption, you’re certainly going to see stresses on the system and the system being people with any kind of jobs ... particularly with critical jobs to keep society functioning normally,” Fauci said. “We already know that there are reports from fire departments, from police departments in different cities that 10, 20, 25 and sometimes 30% of the people are ill. And that’s something that we need to be concerned about because we want to make sure that we don’t have such an impact on society that there really is a disruption. I hope that doesn’t happen.”On the recent CDC isolation guideline, Fauci said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now considering including the negative test as part of its guidance after getting significant “pushback” on its updated recommendations last week.Under that December. 27 guidance, isolation restrictions for people infected with COVID-19 were shortened from 10 days to five days if they are no longer feeling symptoms or running a fever. After that period, they are asked to spend the following five days wearing a mask when around others.The guidelines have since received criticism from many health professionals for not specifying a negative antigen test as a requirement for leaving isolation.“There has been some concern about why we don't ask people at that five-day period to get tested,” Fauci said. “Looking at it again, there may be an option in that, that testing could be a part of that, and I think we're going to be hearing more about that in the next day or so from the CDC.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/near-vertical-rise-in-covid-in-us-5-things-fauci-observes-about-omicron-surge-101641144848060.html
02-01-2022||World||‘Hospitalisations might stress healthcare systems’: Anthony Fauci's warning on Omicron||The omicron variant of Covid-19 shows signs of causing milder illness but the “really unprecedented” rise in cases is still likely to cause serious sickness in many unvaccinated Americans, Anthony Fauci said. “When you have so, so many cases, even if the rate of hospitalization is lower with omicron than it is with delta, there’s still the danger that you’re going to have a surge in hospitalizations that might stress the health-care system,” U.S. President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “We’re still going to get a lot of hospitalizations.”Fauci was referring to the delta variant of the coronavirus, which caused a deadly wave of infections around the U.S. last year. Now hospitalizations are rising again, and average daily infections are at a record 400,000, Fauci said on ABC’s “This Week.” Several states have mobilized their National Guards to help provide medical care amid staffing shortages and, like Texas, asked for federal help. Almost 73% of U.S. adults are fully vaccinated, and 36.3% of adults have received a booster shot, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.SchoolsFauci said that despite omicron’s rapid spread, schools should remain open, though with masking and other rules, and he urged parents to get eligible children vaccinated. Mitigation strategies including masking and vaccines are working in schools, which should remain open if possible, U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said Sunday.“Our default should be in-person learning,” Cardona said on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” citing the benefits of classroom education over virtual learning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hospitalisations-might-stress-healthcare-systems-anthony-fauci-s-warning-on-omicron-101641140832714.html
02-01-2022||World||South Africa's national assembly completely destroyed in massive fire||A massive fire in South Africa's houses of parliament in Cape Town has completely destroyed the National Assembly where parliamentarians sit, a spokesman said on Sunday as the blaze continued to rage."The entire chamber where the members sit... has burned down," Moloto Mothapo said, adding that the blaze had still not been extinguished.No casualties have been reported so far but President Cyril Ramaphosa told reporters at the scene an arrest had been made."Someone has been held right now and is being questioned," he said.As day dawned, smoke could be seen billowing from the building against a blue sky."The roof of the Old Assembly building has collapsed and is gone," Jean-Pierre Smith, Cape Town's mayoral committee member for safety and security, told reporters earlier.The historic building houses a collection of rare books and the original copy of the former Afrikaans national anthem "Die Stem van Suid-Afrika" ("The Voice of South Africa"), which was already damaged."The entire building has suffered extensive smoke and water damage," Smith said, adding "the fire has not been contained".After ravaging the older wing of the building, the flames spread to newer parts of the complex which are currently in use."Firefighters are currently trying to control the fire in the New Wing, where the fire has affected the National Assembly Chamber," parliamentary spokesman Mothapo told an online news conference earlier in the day.The imposing red and white building was still shrouded in a thick cloud of black at midday.Metres from Tutu's burialA team of firefighters who were first to arrive at the scene battled the flames for several hours before being forced to retreat and call for reinforcements.Around 70 firefighters were later deployed, some using a crane to spray water on the blaze.Former Cape Town mayor and current minister Patricia de Lille warned it would still be several hours before the fire was brought under control.Inside the rooms, fine showers of grey ash fell from the ceiling to the floor, which was already littered with debris.Emergency services said they feared the fire could spread swiftly through the old rooms, which are decorated with wood, thick carpets, and curtains.Images broadcast on television had earlier shown giant flames leaping from the roof.The area around the fire in the upmarket neighbourhood was quickly cordoned off.The cordon stretched to a square where flowers were still displayed in front of the nearby St. George's Cathedral, where anti-apartheid icon Archbishop Desmond Tutu's funeral took place on Saturday.After a simple, no-frills mass, with a cheap coffin -- according to the famously modest Tutu's instructions -- his ashes were interred in the cathedral on Sunday.The second fire in a yearCape Town has been home to South Africa's houses of parliament since 1910 when separate administrations formed a union under British dominion and became a predecessor to the modern South African republic.The site includes the National Assembly and the upper house National Council of Provinces, while the government is based in Pretoria.It was in parliament where South Africa's last apartheid president FW de Klerk announced in 1990 plans to dismantle the brutal white-minority regime.The houses of parliament in Cape Town consist of three sections, with the newer additions constructed in the 1920s and 1980s.Another fire also broke out in the older wings of parliament in March, but it was quickly contained.Cape Town suffered another major fire in April when a blaze on the famed Table Mountain which overlooks the city spread, ravaging part of The University of Cape Town's library holding a unique collection of African archives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-s-national-assembly-completely-destroyed-in-massive-fire-101641139855585.html

02-01-2022||World||South Korea: Unidentified individual crosses border into North Korea||South Korea’s military said Sunday that an unidentified person crossed the heavily fortified border into North Korea.South Korea had earlier spotted the person with surveillance equipment at the eastern portion of the border and sent troops to capture him or her on Saturday night. But the troops failed to find the person and the surveillance equipment detected the person crossing over the border, Joint Chiefs of Staff officers said.South Korea sent a message to North Korea on Sunday morning to ensure the safety of the person, but the North hasn’t responded, the officers said requesting anonymity citing department rules.It was unclear if this was a rare case of a South Korean hoping to defect to the North, or it could be a North Korean who briefly entered the South Korean territory for some reason before returning to the North.In September 2020, North Korea fatally shot a South Korean fisheries official found floating in its waters along a poorly marked sea boundary. South Korea said that North Korea troops were under orders to shoot anyone illegally crossing the border to protect against the coronavirus pandemic.Earlier in 2020, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un placed a border city under total lockdown after a North Korean defector with COVID-19-like symptoms sneaked back home. The fate of that defector, who had lived in South Korea, is not known.On Saturday, North Korea announced it had decided to place top priority on strict virus restrictions at a high-profile ruling party meeting last week.The two Koreas are split along the world’s most heavily armed border, called the Demilitarized Zone. An estimated 2 million mines are peppered inside and near the 248-kilometer (155-mile) -long, 4-kilometer (2.5-mile) -wide DMZ, which is also guarded by barbed wire fences, tank traps and combat troops on both sides.Defecting via the DMZ is rare. At the height of their Cold War rivalry, both Koreas sent agents and spies to each other’s territory through the DMZ, but no such incidents have been reported in recent years.About 34,000 North Koreans have defected to South Korea since the late 1990s to avoid poverty or political oppression, but a vast majority of them have come via China and Southeast Asian countries.North Korea has yet to report any cases of the coronavirus while experts have questioned its claim of a perfect record.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-unidentified-individual-crosses-border-into-north-korea-101641122629582.html
02-01-2022||World||France to ease Covid isolation rules: government||France will relax Covid isolation rules from Monday, the government announced, in a bid to ease their impact on society and the economy.Fully vaccinated people who test positive will only have to isolate for seven days regardless of the coronavirus variant they were infected with, but can leave quarantine after five days if they show an antigen or negative PCR test.There will be no quarantine for fully inoculated individuals who have a close contact test positive.However, people must respect protective measures and "undergo regular testing", health minister Olivier Veran said in an interview with Le Journal du Dimanche.Until now, those who tested positive in France had to isolate for 10 days with their close contracts also quarantined for a week.The maximum isolation period could be up to 17 days -- regardless of the variant -- if a household contains a positive case.The change in rules responds to the need "to take into account the extremely rapid evolution of the spread of the Omicron variant in France".It should allow a "benefit-risk balance aimed at ensuring the virus is controlled while maintaining socio-economic life", said the Ministry of Health.Additionally, "the first available virological data" showed "the incubation period of Omicron appears to be faster than previous variants, favouring a possible reduction in the length of isolation".Meanwhile, people who test positive for the virus -- but who are not fully vaccinated -- must complete a 10-day quarantine, according to the same rules, but shortened to seven should they present a positive antigen or negative PCR test.The seven-day quarantine remains for close unvaccinated contacts, who must show a negative test to leave isolation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-to-ease-covid-isolation-rules-government-101641108936857.html

The number of newly infected people living in Gyeonggi province and the western port city of Incheon was 1,244 and 231 respectively.The virus spread also raged in the non-metropolitan region. The number of new infections in the non-capital areas was 1,081, or 29.4 percent of the total local transmission.Among the new cases, 150 were imported, lifting the total to 17,595.The number of the Omicron variant infections was 1,207 so far, including 602 imported cases and 605 domestic transmissions, up 93 from the prior day.The number of infected people who were in a serious condition stood at 1,024, down 25 from the previous day.Sixty-nine more deaths were confirmed, leaving the death toll at 5,694.

Denmark scored worst with 2,045, followed by Cyprus with 1,969 and Ireland with 1,964.AFP's calculations are based on official figures, but some infections could have gone undetected, for example if patients were asymptomatic.Covid-related deaths are however decreasing in Europe.Europe recorded on average 3,413 coronavirus deaths a day over the past week, a seven percent drop from the previous week. At its worst, that average saw 5,735 deaths a day in January last year.People on the European continent are now, on the whole, more vaccinated than the worldwide average.Sixty-five percent of Europeans are partially vaccinated, while 61 percent are fully vaccinated -- more than 58 and 49 percent respectively worldwide, according to the "Our World in Data" website.Taking into account excess mortality linked to Covid-19, the World Health Organization estimates the overall death toll worldwide could be two to three times higher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-records-over-100-million-covid-19-cases-more-than-third-of-entire-global-tally-101641099662596.html

It counted almost 163,000 new cases Saturday, a slight dip after days of unprecedented daily tallies.The UK government, which has responsibility for health policies in England only, has so far refused to curb socialising and large events, unlike the rest of Britain.Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have all rolled out new rules since Christmas limiting gatherings, as the Omicron variant fuels an unprecedented nationwide surge in infections.But Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government in London insists the data does not yet justify such measures in England."Curbs on our freedom must be an absolute last resort and the British people rightly expect us to do everything in our power to avert them," Health Secretary Sajid Javid wrote in the Daily Mail newspaper."I've been determined that we must give ourselves the best chance of living alongside the virus," he added, noting the "enormous health, social and economic costs of lockdowns".Despite the record rise in infections, there has been a less dramatic rise in numbers admitted to hospital and then intensive care units, fuelling hopes that Omicron is less severe."I've been working closely with the NHS, to make sure it is ready and resilient for what lies ahead," Javid vowed.- 'Watch and wait' -In England, the government last month mandated mask-wearing in most settings, working from home if possible and a Covid pass system for nightclubs and large events.But it has stopped short of the further measures seen in other parts of the UK.Instead, it is relying on a stepped-up vaccination programme, which saw every adult offered a third dose by end-2021 and around 60 percent of the eligible population getting a booster jab.However, Education Secretary Nadim Zahawi said late Saturday the government would recommend secondary school students wear face coverings in classrooms and teaching spaces when they return next week as a "temporary" measure.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, he also conceded that "some remote learning will be necessary" as staff and pupil absences rise.Meanwhile, the state-run National Health Service (NHS) is under increasing strain across Britain as hospital admissions reach levels not seen since last March.Nearly 2,000 new patients were admitted in a single day earlier this week, according to the latest data released Saturday.At the same time, more than 110,000 staff -- nearly one in ten NHS workers nationwide -- were absent from work Friday, the Sunday Times newspaper reported.The Times said around 50,000 of those absent NHS workers were sick or self-isolating because of Covid-19."We still need to watch and wait," Chris Hopson, the head of NHS Providers which represents hospitals in England, tweeted.But he added: "Govt must be ready to introduce new restrictions at pace if they're needed."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-covid-19-curbs-in-england-last-resort-minister-101641083315541.html

02-01-2022||World||Soaring Covid cases hit New Year celebrations||New York: The world ushered in 2022 on Saturday with scaled-back celebrations due to new restrictions aimed at slowing soaring Covid cases - although hope remained for a better new year.New York revived its New Year’s Eve ball drop in Times Square in limited form, Paris nixed its fireworks show over rising Omicron cases and London’s pyrotechnic display was broadcast on TV to discourage crowds.More than 5.4mn people have died since the coronavirus was first reported in central China in December 2019.France on Friday became the latest country to announce Omicron was now its dominant coronavirus strain.In Britain, the US and even Australia - long a refuge from the pandemic - the Omicron variant’s prominence is driving record numbers of new cases.Celebrations the night before, from Seoul to San Francisco were either curtailed or cancelled in the face of the infection surge.New York’s annual New Year’s Eve ball drop - cancelled last year - was scaled-down, welcoming fewer revellers than in previous years, with only about 15,000 people - all required to show proof of vaccination - allowed in.In Madrid’s Puerta del Sol, about 7,000 people - half the usual capacity - rang in the new year by eating grapes, one for each time the clock chimed up to 12.Dubai went ahead with its celebrations undeterred, with 36 firework displays at 29 locations. But authorities warned they would fine anyone in attendance not wearing a mask.China ends 2021 with highest weekly casesChina ended the final week of 2021 with its biggest tally of local Covid-19 cases for any seven-day period since it contained the country’s first pandemic nearly two years ago.The National Health Commission reported on Saturday 175 new community infections with confirmed clinical symptoms for December 31, bringing the total number of local symptomatic cases in mainland China in the past week to 1,151, driven mostly by an outbreak in the northwestern industrial and tech hub of Xian.Australia starts 2022 with record Covid casesAustralia started 2022 with a record number of new Covid-19 cases as an outbreak centered in the eastern states grew, and New South Wales eased its isolation rules for healthcare workers as the number of people hospitalised with the virus rose. New South Wales, the most populous state, and Victoria posted daily record case numbers of 22,577 and 7,442 respectively on Saturday, health department figures showed.‘New Covid restrictions would be a last resort’New restrictions in England to slow the spread of Covid-19 will only be introduced as a last resort, health minister Sajid Javid said, stressing that although hospitalisations were rising, the number of patients in intensive care was stable.The rapid spread of the Omicron variant across the UK has sent infections to record highs, with close to 190,000 new cases reported on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/soaring-covid-cases-hit-new-year-celebrations-101641074669075.html
02-01-2022||India||Punjab’s governor counters CM on pending bill||A day after chief minister (CM) Charanjit Singh Channi threatened to stage a sit-in against Punjab governor Banwari Lal Purohit for not clearing a Bill for regularising services of 36,000 contractual employees, the governor Sunday put the spotlight back on government, asking chief minister’s office (CMO) to reply to six queries relating to pending court cases, reservation and funding raised on the proposed legislation.Calling the CM’s claim as “factually incorrect”, the governor, in a written statement, said the file regarding the regularisation of the services of contractual employees was reverted to the office of Punjab chief minister with six queries, which need to be clarified by the state government. “This file was duly received by the CMO on December 31 and the reply is awaited,” he said.Channi, while addressing a press conference on Saturday on completing 100 days in office, alleged that the governor was holding up the file under pressure from the BJP-led central government. “If the governor does not clear the file, I will sit on dharna with my cabinet colleagues against him,” he warned.However, the governor said, “Once the reply comes, the Bill will be re-examined at governor’s secretariat.”The Bill regarding regularisation of the services of contractual employees was passed in the state assembly on November 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjabs-governor-counters-cm-on-pending-bill-101641148106241.html
02-01-2022||India||Youth should consider careers in sport: Modi||MeerutPrime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday the youth in the country should be encouraged to pursue sports as their careers as he criticised the previous governments for not motivating people in the field, a remark that came after he laid the foundation stone for the Major Dhyan Chand Sports University in Meerut.Youth in Uttar Pradesh will now have a better chance to shine in sports at a time when India’s athletes are winning laurels in the international arena, the Prime Minister said.“Previous governments did not give importance to this potential of the youth in the field of sports. For the development of sports in the country, it is necessary that our youth should have faith in sports and should be encouraged to take up sports as their profession,” Modi said.The Prime Minister used a sports metaphor to lampoon previous governments in India’s most populous state. Earlier, gangsters and criminals used to have free play in Uttar Pradesh, but the Yogi Adityanath government is “playing jail-jail” with them, he said at a rally ahead of assembly polls early this year. The world-class facilities at the proposed university in Meerut district’s Salawa will help create international athletes and foster a sports culture in the country, he said.Meerut was the birth place of Dhyan Chand, and the central government named the country’s biggest sports award Khel Ratna after Dadda, as Dhyan Chand was popularly known, the Prime Minister said, adding that the first sports university of Uttar Pradesh is being dedicated to him. The university will be built with a budget of ₹700 crore and produce more than 1,000 players every year, he said.“The city of revolutionaries will further strengthen its identity as the city of sportspersons,” Modi said, referring to the 1857 war of Independence against the British that began in Meerut with the death of sepoy Mangal Pandey. Modi lauded the sports goods manufacturing industry of Meerut that exports equipment to over 100 countries.“During previous governments, criminals used to play their games and the mafias used to play their own. Earlier, there used to be tournaments of illegal land grabbing,” Modi said. “Now, the Yogi government is playing jail-jail with such criminals.”People living in Meerut and adjoining areas can never forget how houses used to be set ablaze, he said. “The result of these games played by earlier governments was that people were forced to leave their ancestral homes and there was an exodus.”Five years ago, women in Meerut feared leaving their homes after evening, he said. “Today, the daughters of Meerut are bringing laurels to the entire country,” Modi said.Modi also referred to the infamous Sotiganj stolen cars market of Meerut. “There has been an end to the game played with vehicles in the market,” he said.The Prime Minister accused previous state governments of not making efforts to change the narrow mindset towards sports. The sports world was earlier marred by maladies like games of nepotism, casteism, corruption and discrimination at every level, right from the training to team selection, but now the situation has changed, he said.The impact of the change is seen in the many medals Indian sportspersons are winning at the Olympic and Paralympics, he said.Payment made to farmers during the Yogi government’s term was more than what was paid by the two earlier regimes, he said.Modi interacted with Olympians, national and international players before addressing the gathering. He also inspected stalls of sports goods manufactured in local units.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/youth-should-consider-careers-in-sport-modi-101641147871351.html

So far, we have pulled out two excavators and four dumpers from the rubble. However, another dumper is still trapped in the debris.The rescue operation will continue till Monday. We have called in mining experts, and explosions are being carried out in small areas to avert another landslide,” Meena said.Team formed to probe matterThe SP said, “The deputy commissioner has constituted a team to check if any norms were violated while mining. So far, there is no evidence that illegal mining was carried out at the Dadam mining site.”A senior official, requesting anonymity, said the mining contract had been given to Yamunanagar-based Govardhan Mines. On the second day of the rescue operation, teams of the NDRF from Ghaziabad, and State Disaster Response Force team from Madhuban, and an army unit of Hisar joined the rescue operation.Meanwhile, BJP MP from Bhiwani-Mahendergarh parliamentary Dharambir Singh alleged that illegal mining was being carried out at the Dadam mining site. “The contractors never allowed anyone to enter the site. They have been extracting the stone being used in building material by violating all norms,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhiwani-landslide-rescue-operations-continue-one-feared-trapped-101641147685018.html

02-01-2022||India||Govt appeals against WTO ruling over sugarcane trade||India has appealed against a ruling of the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) trade dispute settlement panel which ruled that the country’s domestic support measures for sugar and sugarcane are inconsistent with global trade norms, an official said.The appeal was filed by India in the WTO’s Appellate Body, which is the final authority on such trade disputes. India has stated that the WTO’s dispute panel ruling has made certain “erroneous” findings about domestic schemes to support sugarcane producers and exports and the findings of the panel are completely “unacceptable” to it.The panel in its ruling on December 14, 2021 recommended India to withdraw its alleged prohibited subsidies under the Production Assistance, the Buffer Stock, and the Marketing and Transportation Schemes within 120 days from the adoption of this report.Ruling in favour of Brazil, Australia and Guatemala in their trade dispute against India over New Delhi’s sugar subsidies, the WTO panel has stated that the support measures are inconsistent with WTO trade rules.The official said that the dispute panel’s findings are unreasonable and not supported by the WTO rules and also evaded key issues which it was obliged to determine.“The panel’s findings on alleged export subsidies undermine logic and rationale. India has appealed in the appellate body of the WTO against the panel’s ruling,” the official added.In 2019, Brazil, Australia and Guatemala dragged India into the WTO’s dispute settlement mechanism alleging that New Delhi’s domestic support measures to producers of sugarcane and sugar and export subsidies are inconsistent with global trade rules including various provisions of the WTO’s Agreement on Agriculture, Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, and the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT).Brazil is the largest producer and exporter of sugar in the world. India is the world’s second largest sugar producer after Brazil. In December 2020, the government had approved a subsidy of ₹3,500 crore to sugar mills for the export of 60 lakh tonnes of sweetener during the ongoing marketing year 2020-21 as part of its efforts to help them clear outstanding dues to sugarcane farmers. In the previous marketing year 2019-20 (October-September), the government had provided a lump sum export subsidy of ₹10,448 per tonne. Mills exported 5.7 million tonnes of sugar against the mandatory quota of 6 million tonnes set for the 2019-20 season (October-September), according to official data.These three countries, which are members of the WTO, had complained that India’s support measures to sugarcane producers exceeds the de minimis level of 10 per cent of the total value of sugarcane production, which according to them was inconsistent with the Agreement on Agriculture.They had also flagged India’s alleged export subsidies, subsidies under the production assistance and buffer stock schemes, and the marketing and transportation scheme.According to WTO rules, a WTO member or members can file a case in the Geneva-based multilateral body if they feel that a particular trade measure is against the norms of the WTO. Bilateral consultation is the first step to resolve a dispute. If both the sides are not able to resolve the matter through consultation, either can approach for the establishment of a dispute settlement panel. The panel’s ruling or report can be challenged at the World Trade Organization’s Appellate Body.Interestingly, the appellate body of the WTO is not functioning because of differences among member countries to appoint members in this body. Over 20 disputes are already pending with the appellate body. The US has been blocking the appointment of the members.Even if the body, which is the final arbiter on such trade disputes, starts working from now, it would take over an year to take up India’s appeal. According to trade experts, if the appellate body also passes a ruling against India’s support measures, New Delhi has to abide by that and make appropriate changes in the way it provides those measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-appeals-against-wto-ruling-over-sugarcane-trade-101641147504611.html

It has happened for the second time in less than a year. The app appeared to be a clone of Sulli Deals which triggered a similar row last year.  Politicians, netizens and women's rights groups demanded strict action against the makers of the app and many blamed it on right-wing elements.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi called upon people to raise their voice against "'insult of women" and communal hatred."The insult of women and communal hatred will stop only when we stand against it in one voice. The year has changed, the situation should also change. It is time to speak up," Gandhi tweeted using the hashtag 'no fear'.As the issue snowballed, IT Minister Vaishnaw tweeted on Sunday, "Government of India is working with police organisations in Delhi and Mumbai on this matter."Police of both the metropolitan cities have registered cases in the matter.NCW chief Rekha Sharma, on Twitter, "noted" a tweet from a journalist whose photo was used in the app. The journalist also raised a complaint with the Cyber Cell of the Delhi Police."@NCWIndia  has taken cognizance of this incident. Chairperson @sharmarekha has written to @CPDelhi to immediately register FIR in the matter. The process must be expedited so that such crime is not repeated," the NCW tweeted."The action taken in both the cases must be apprised to the Commission at the earliest. A copy of the letter has also been sent to Dy Commissioner of Police, Delhi," the NCW said in another tweet.The Delhi Police has registered an FIR against unknown persons for allegedly uploading a doctored picture of the woman journalist on a website.An official said Mumbai Cyber police has also registered an FIR against developers of 'Bulli Bai' app and Twitter handles that promoted this application. The case was registered on Saturday under sections 354-D (stalking of women), 500 (Punishment for defamation) and other sections of the Information Technology Act, he said. The West region of Cyber Police registered the FIR against Twitter handle holders and the 'Bulli Bai' app developers hosted on GitHub," the official said.Vaishnaw has said GitHub has confirmed blocking the user and that the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) and police authorities are coordinating further action in the matter.PDP president Mehbooba Mufti alleged that ''fringe elements'' who were targeting Muslim women online had the ''official patronage''.  "Appalling that the criminals behind such derogatory & demeaning actions against Muslim women are given a free run," the former chief minister tweeted.Shiv Sena MP Priyanka Chaturvedi had on Saturday flagged the 'Bulli Bai' app, seeking action from Mumbai police and Vaishnaw.The All India Progressive Women's Association alleged that "Hindu supremacists" were behind this and expressed solidarity with the victims.Many netizens took to Twitter to raise the issue."The Indian government, police, media, society at large ignored Sulli deals. And now you have #BulliDeals, a horrifying cruel depraved sadistic "auction" of Muslim women using their pictures. The more you ignore these things, the more sure you can be that it'll be your family soon," a netizen tweeted.       Once the app is opened, a Muslim woman's face is randomly displayed as Bulli Bai. Muslim women with a strong presence on Twitter, including journalists, have been singled out and their photos uploaded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/outrage-mounts-over-bulli-bai-app-it-minister-says-centre-working-with-police-101641146749170.html
02-01-2022||India||Yogi govt is enemy of development: Akhilesh attacks UP CM, spares Modi||Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav Sunday fired a fresh salvo at the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh (UP), calling it “Vikas key dushman, alpsankhayak ke dushman (enemy of development and minorities)” but left Prime Minister Narendra Modi out of his attack. The SP chief launched the verbal attack during the Lucknow leg of his Vijay Rath Yatra while addressing two public meetings. The yatra was taken out on the day when Modi, along with chief minister (CM) Yogi Adityanath, laid the foundation stone, for UP’s first sports university in Meerut.Continuing his attack on Adityanath, Yadav said, “When this government felicitated our Olympic heroes, where did ‘baba mukhya mantri’ do the ceremony? Of course, at the same stadium built by the SP government. So, in 2022 (polls), hit ‘baba mukhya mantri’ out of the boundary.” The yatra (tenth in the series) started from HCL headquarters at Chak Ganjaria. Akhilesh asked the crowd to turn their eyes towards the HCL facility “that gave jobs in Lucknow to many youths who used to migrate to Bengaluru, Mumbai, Hyderabad for IT jobs.” He said the HCL facility in Lucknow came up in his government’s tenure. He also asserted his government built the cancer institute and ultra-modern dairy plant in the area that was a jungle before. He called upon people to bring back the “development-oriented SP government”. “The BJP government is an enemy of minorities as they discontinued reservation for Anglo-Indians (in Parliament and state legislatures).” Reiterating his free electricity promise, he said: “On coming to power, our government will give 300 units of free power to domestic consumers and free power to farmers for irrigation.” “Had the present government carried forward the SP government’s power plant projects, UP would have had plenty of cheap power. When our government returns, these projects will be executed. This is only the first promise in our manifesto. But there will be many more especially for farmers, economically weaker sections, women and youths among others. The manifesto will be released soon,” he said. Slamming Yogi for frequently alleging that “in the previous government terrorists and rioters were invited at the CM’s residence, Akhilesh retorted, “It is this government that harbours criminals.” He added, “Why doesn’t this government release lists of top gangsters in the districts? And wasn’t it the same government who sheltered and protected one of its MLAs in the Unnao rape case? It is under this government that the Hathras case took place. And has there been any chief minister like this one with so many cases filed against him?” The SP chief also attacked the BJP government over farmers’ issues, unemployment, Covid deaths, law and order, price rise and development. After holding public meetings at Chak Ganjaria and Rohtas ground, Kasimpur in Mohanlalganj assembly constituency, Akhilesh visited Bhagwan Parshuram temple at Mahurakala village, Gosainganj, and offered prayers. he also unveiled an idol of lord Parshuram. The newly built temple with a nearly 73-foot axe, the weapon of Lord Parshuram, has been built near the Purvanchal Expressway in Lucknow. Responding to Akhilesh’s free electricity promise, Union education minister and BJP’s election in-charge in UP Dharmendra Pradhan tweeted: “Those who gave “goondaraj” are now talking of giving free power supply. Now, Akhileshji is also talking of getting the Ram temple constructed even though everyone knows that it was the SP government that had ordered firing on Ram bhakts. The credibility of liars is zero...”

Speaking at a rally in Smriti Upvan, Kejriwal said, “During their tenures (in government), SP made kabristans and BJP shamshan ghats. But if you vote us (AAP), we will construct schools and hospitals,” he said. Referring to the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, Kejriwal alleged that “the BJP not only made shamshan ghats but also sent people there… Uttar Pradesh was the worst in managing corona (Covid-19 pandemic).” Promising to improve the condition of schools across the state, he said, “ [Uttar Pradesh chief minister] Yogi Adityanath has failed to improve the condition of schools (government schools) in the last five years. But I will ensure good schools for all in UP, like the ones in Delhi.” AAP has announced it will contest almost all the 403 assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh where polls are due in February-March. “Before the Yogi government, the state experienced four-hour power cuts. Under his (Yogi Adityanath) government, there are eight-hour power cuts. If the BJP is voted to power again, then there will be 12-hour power cuts… If you want 24-hour electricity, vote for us,” the AAP leader said to the crowd.He asserted that 35 lakh families in Delhi were getting ‘zero’ electricity bills, a reference to the AAP government’s free electricity supply scheme in the capital. He also promised free pilgrimage for all the people of Uttar Pradesh to Ayodhya, like the Delhi government pilgrimage scheme. On the occasion, Kejriwal also announced ₹1,000 per month allowance for women above 18 years of age if voted to power “You have tested the Samajwadi Party, the BJP, the BSP and the Congress, now give us an opportunity for five years (to govern Uttar Pradesh),” Kejriwal said.Reacting to Kejrwal’s allegations, the SP said the state remembers the development work carried out under former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav. “People of Uttar Pradesh know about the development work carried out during the SP government. Even Arvind Kejrival recently praised our national president Akhilesh Yadav and stated that he should become the next CM in 2022. Our party is committed to develop UP and we have an agenda and vision,” said SP spokesperson Abdul Hafiz Gandhi.BJP did not respond to queries for comment.

Action should be taken in the matter," Yadav told ANI.Police reached the sets of the film to investigate the complainant and found out that the numbers are different. "During the investigation of the number plate, we found out that all misunderstanding was caused by the bolt fixed on the number plate. Due to that bolt, the number one is looking like number four.

02-01-2022||India||Back in Tripura, Abhishek Banerjee hard sells TMC as lead challenger to BJP||AGARTALA: Back in Tripura, Trinamool Congress general secretary Abhishek Banerjee on Sunday pitched his party as the primary opposition to the ruling Biplab Deb government, underlining that his party is committed to putting up a tough fight to the Bharatiya Jnt Party (BJP) and pledging that his party will not compromise in this battle against the saffron party.Abhishek Banerjee’s visit - he was last in the state in October when he addressed a rally - comes two days before the scheduled visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 4 to inaugurate the new terminal building of Tripura’s Maharaja Bir Bikram (MBB) Airport at Agartala.“They torture common people, ransack their homes to keep up their fascist politics with ‘Duare Goonda’ model (goons at doorstep). Tripura is reduced to a theatre of goons and madmen. Our fight is against this….Biplab Deb has become politically bankrupt”, he told reporters after prayers at Choddo Debata Bari, the temple of Tripura’s royal family deities, on the outskirts of Agartala city. He said that he prayed for the well-being of people in the state and said TMC would continue its political fight against what he described as the BJP misrule.Banerjee said the Biplab Deb government’s performance had been a disappointment, and that opposition political workers were subjected to targeted violence. Besides, the government did not even honour court rulings.“We shall not cede a single inch of ground in this fight”, he said and expressed confidence that people are now supporting his party. Citing Tripura urban body polls held last year, the TMC leader claimed his party secured 24% vote share and emerged as the principal opposition force in front of BJP.To be sure, according to the State Election Commission, the TMC was indeed the runner up in the Agartala municipality but ended up at the third spot in the overall vote share across the state. The party secured 16.39% vote share across the state, next to the CPI (M) which received 18.13% votes. The BJP was way ahead; it secured 59% votes and won 11 out of the 14 urban bodies that went to polls. In all, the BJP won 217 of the 222 seats that voted in addition to the 112 seats that it netted uncontested.Abhishek Banerjee is expected to meet state Trinamool Congress leaders and supporters later in the evening.The Trinamool Congress, which started its journey in Tripura in 1999 with former chief minister Late Sudhir Ranjan Majumder, never formed government or won any assembly election. The TMC did have six MLAs in 2016, but they had shifted from the Congress party and later jumped to the BJP once again in 2017, barely months before the 2018 assembly elections, which brought the BJP to power in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/back-in-tripura-abhishek-banerjee-hard-sells-tmc-as-lead-challenger-to-bjp-101641137123272.html

About 89% of the cases are asymptomatic, the data revealed. No deaths were reported in the last 24 hours. Sunday's number for Mumbai is a sharp rise as on Saturday, the entire state recorded around 9,000 fresh cases. As during the previous wave, Mumbai is emerging as a hotspot along with Delhi. West Bengal has put a cap on flight operations from these two cities.On the Omicron front, Maharashtra reported 50 new cases including 36 from Pune city, eight from Pimpri Chinchwad, two each from Pune Rural and Sangli, and one each from Thane and Mumbai. The overall Omicron tally of the state reached 510. The tally of fresh Covid cases in Maharashtra stood at 11,877. According to Maharashtra government data, Mumbai on Sunday reported 7,792 Covid cases.The steady surge is an indication that the Omicron variant is driving the increase and, according to BMC data, Omicron has proved to be the dominant variant in some bunch of samples sent for genome sequencing. Community transmission of Omicron in Mumbai has not been ruled out either by experts.'Stage of lockdown is approaching', says Maharashtra minister amid huge spike in Covid-19 casesThe Maharashtra government is estimating a huge jump in the number of infections in the third wave which many experts believe has already set in. This is primarily because Omicron is known to be more contagious than Delta. Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary (health) has said Maharashtra may report a total of 2 lakh active Covid cases by the third week of January. "Based on the current trend of rising COVID cases in the state, it is expected that we will have about two lakh active cases by the third week of January 2022. Separate instructions are issued for managing these numbers, in case some of them need hospitalisation," he said."Don't be lulled by the narrative that third wave or Omicron wave is mild and not fatal. It's equally fatal for those who are not vaccinated and have comorbidities. So please improve vaccination coverage and save lives," Dr Vyas added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-reports-8-063-new-covid-19-cases-27-higher-than-yesterday-101641132045304.html

Swift action by the troops deployed at the Line of Control foiled the bid and eliminated the terrorist, later identified as Mohd Shabbir Malik, a Pakistani national,” Major General Abhijit S Pendharkar, GOC 28 division, said at a media briefing in Kupwara.“This clearly establishes that Pakistan continues to sponsor cross border terror. A hotline communication has been made to the Pakistan Army asking them to take back the body of the killed individual,” he said.BAT, according to officials, is said to be a mix of regular Pakistani soldiers and militants who are known for attacks on the Indian army on the border. Pakistan has always denied these allegations.“A search of the belongings revealed Pakistani national identity card and vaccination certificates (issued by Ministry of National Health Services Regulation & Coordination Government of Pakistan) identifying him as Mohd Shabir Malik. The belongings also include a photo of the infiltrator in army uniform wearing name tab of Shabbir,” he said.“The incident site is located on the Pakistani side of the Anti Infiltration Obstacle System, kept under surveillance by the Indian Army to effectively counter any nefarious activity by the infiltrators or Pakistan Army,” the top army commander said.The route adopted by the terrorist was similar to the one adopted on April 4, 2020, during Operation Rangadori Bhaikh in which five terrorists were eliminated.In February 2021, Indian and Pakistan’s militaries agreed to strictly observe a ceasefire agreement along the Line of Control (LoC) after years of tumultuous relationship on the border between the two armies.Pendharkar said in complete breach of the ceasefire understanding arrived at between the director-general of military operation (DGMOs), the armed intruder dressed in Pathani suit and a black jacket was detected moving from areas under the control of the Pakistan Army across the Line of Control at about 3pm on Saturday.“Ambushes were laid along likely routes that could be adopted by the intruder and movement was followed till 1600 hours. The ambush was sprung at the opportune moment and the infiltrator was eliminated. The body of the slain infiltrator was recovered along with one AK 47 and large quantity of ammunition including seven grenades,” he saidThe army said that the surveillance of the area is in progress, denying any “exploitation” of the bad weather condition prevailing in the area.“The operation is ongoing. The route adopted by the terrorist was similar to the one adopted on 04 Apr 20 during Op Rangadori Bhaikh in which five terrorists were eliminated,” he said.In response to a question, the officer said that the intelligence inputs of these areas are always there from where infiltration may be attempted by some terrorists.“We are vigilant to that. There are inputs of some of the launch pads and some terrorists being there. The weather conditions could be exploited as the snow falls and winter sets in when snow is more,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/killed-pak-terrorist-take-body-indian-army-messages-pak-on-hotline-after-kupwara-ops-101641130882729.html

The number of containment zones in the city has reached 1,621, the bulletin released by the health department revealed. That the numbers will breach 3,000 was already told by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in his press meet held earlier in the day, during which he said that despite the spike in the numbers, there is no need to panic as hospitals in the capital are not occupied and most patients are asymptomatic.

02-01-2022||India||HT This Day: Jan 3, 1950 - Cooch-Behar merges with W. Bengal||The 450-year-old Cooch-Behar State, whose administration had been taken over by the Government of India in September last, was finally merged yesterday with West Bengal.Hundreds of people from different parts of the State and from West Bengal were present at a public meeting held here in the morning when the West Bengal Premier, Dr B. C. Roy, explained the implications of the integration and welcomed the citizens of the State into West Bengal as also into the constitutional set-up of the Indian Union. A large number of officials of the provincial Government and the State were also present at the meeting. Dr Roy assured the people of Cooch-Behar he would do everything possible to ameliorate their condition. The Premier declared that for historical, as well as for sentimental reasons, Cooch-Behar would be maintained as a separate district with headquarters at Cooch-Behar. Representation would be given to the people of Cooch-Behar in the provincial legislature on the population basis. As regards the future of the State employees, Dr Roy said that all State servants would be absorbed in West Bengal Government service on terms not less advantageous than those under the State regime. In case, however, it was found necessary to discharge any person, adequate compensation would be paid to him. Dr Roy also announced the decision of the Government to spend the balance of the State treasury on the date of merger (amounting to about ₹1.5 crores) on nation building schemes for the benefit of the people of Cooch-Behar. PEOPLE WELCOMED Welcoming the people of the State into West Bengal, the Premier said that socially and ethnologically the people of Cooch-Behar had close affinities with the people of the Jalpaiguri area in West Bengal. Besides its indigenous population, the State had a good proportion of Bengalis, Beharis and Marwaris, who had resided here for generations. The court language of the State was Bengali. Dr Roy said that with the advent of independence in India, the forces responsible for bringing this freedom travelled to and affected the people of the States. Fortunately, the Rulers, on their part, recognized the changes that were coming on and adjusted themselves to these forces. “Therefore we have witnessed the fact that within a few months of on independence, smaller States have been consolidated into sizeable units and democratic institutions and responsible governments have been introduced in them. Thus it was possible for the Government of India to utilize those forces for purposes of integration and bring about a united India in which the Indian Union and the States and their respective citizens will have full scope to co-operate and develop the country as one unit.” The meeting over, Dr Roy proceeded to the State Secretariat, where he formally took over charge from the Chief Commissioner, Mr V. L Nanjappa, who had been administering the State on behalf of the Government of India. A Calcutta Gazette Extraordinary published the West Bengal Government’s notification declaring that the Chief Commissioner’s province of Cooch-Behar be constituted into district in West Bengal and divide the district into the following subdivisions: Cooch-Behar Sadar, Dinhata, Mathabhanga, Tufaganj and Mekliganj. The notification further adds that the district of Cooch-Behar will form part of the presidency division in West Bengal. Mr V. I. Nanjappa, Chief Commissioner. Cooch-Behar, has been appointed, until further orders, district magistrate and collector. KATJU’S BROADCAST The Governor of West Bengal, Dr K. N. Katju, broadcasting from the Calcutta station of All India Radio last night said that the merger of the States into larger unions of neighbouring provinces was a historic and political necessity. Congratulating the people of Cooch-Behar and West Bengal on this “auspicious occasion when a great destiny was bringing them together into one whole,” the Governor said that ever since his arrival in Bengal, 18 months ago, he had more and more realized the depth of the attachment, in which the people of West Bengal held their brethren in Cooch-Behar and the intensity of the longing for the union which had now happily taken place. On their side the Cooch-Beharis had always considered Calcutta as their metropolis and had deeply cherished the bonds, economic and cultural, which bound them to this great city. It was, therefore, a matter for rejoicing that their brethren of Cooch-Behar were opening a new chapter in their history and starting upon a much larger and richer life. Lying between Assam and West Bengal, Cooch-Behar has been an area of over 1,300 square miles with a population of 6,50,000. The revenue of the State, according to this year’s budget, amounts to ₹1.11 crores. In the matter of food production the State is a surplus area, producing about 3 lakhs maunds of paddy annually. It grows the best kind of tobacco in this part of the country, fetching a revenue of ₹40 lakhs annually as export duty. It also produces about 52,000 bales of jute. Although the existing administrative set-up of the State will not be disturbed in the immediate future, Cooch-Behar will form a district of the presidency division of West Bengal. The present Chief Commissioner, Mr Nanjappa, will act as administrator of the district. There will be a period of transition from three to six months before the State becomes a full-fledged district. SARDAR’S MESSAGE Sardar Patel in a message said that the decision to merge the State with West Bengal was taken by the Government of India only after they were convinced that interests of her people would be thus better served. “The interests of the people of Cooch-Behar and of the country at large demand that the people should now take to the task of consolidation with West Bend with faith and determination,” he said. The message which was read by the Chief Commissioner of Cooch-Behar, expressed confidence that the West Bengal Government would realize the special responsibility that they owed to the people of Cooch-Behar for their progress and prosperity. Sardar Patel said: “I can assure them that the Central Government will continue to watch their future in West Bengal with lively interest. “Cooch-Behar has had old connections and associations with West Bengal. Though partition has somewhat affected the closeness of that association, it has also emphasized the need for consolidation. They should have faith not only in the assurances given to them by the Government of West Bengal, of which they have already given an earnest in the specific obligations that they have accepted and which were announced in the Press note issued by the Government of India, but also in the vigilance and watchful attention of the Central Government in their welfare. They should have determination to see that their own interests are fully safeguarded under the new dispensation and to ensure that they play their due part in the great responsibility that they owe to the country as whole.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthis-day-jan-3-1950-cooch-behar-merges-with-w-bengal-101641124462348.html

Experts say notion rooted in ‘pandemic fatigue’According to the data furnished by the ministry, 90% of the eligible population has been administered the first dose of the vaccine and the coverage is at 65% for the second dose.The 90% first dose coverage was higher than that of the USA (73.2%), the UK (75.9%), France (78.3%) and Spain (84.7%), the ministry said. However, the UK, France and Spain were ahead of India in their respective second dose coverage, the ministry’s data showed. The US, with 61.5% second dose coverage, was the only country behind India in the list shared by the ministry.“Further, over 11 states/UTs in India has already achieved 100% of 1st dose vaccination, while 3 States/UTs have already achieved 100% full vaccination (both 1st and 2nd dose) against COVID-19. Many States/UTs are soon expected to achieve 100% vaccination very quickly,” the ministry also said.The ministry’s remarks came after a recent media report in the BBC on December 31, titled “Covid-19: How India missed its vaccination target”, said that India missed its vaccination target of inoculating its entire adult population of 940 million with two doses.BJP leader Prakash Javadekar first made the claim of full vaccination by the end of 2021 in May 2021, when he was an Union minister, the report said. Javadekar had made the remarks previously in response to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who had criticised the vaccination drive.Notably, health minister Mansukh Mandaviya, in a written reply to Parliament back in July 2021, said that there was no fixed time-frame for the completion of the vaccination drive, however, also noted that the Centre expected all beneficiaries above 18 to be jabbed by December 2021.As of 7am on Sunday, 1,454,413,005 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine have been administered in the country. With the vaccination drive set to include people in the 15 to 18 years age group, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya discussed the vaccine rollout in this age group and also the Omicron variant with state health ministers on the day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/misleading-centre-on-media-reports-about-missed-covid-19-vaccination-target-in-india-101641121960599.html

During the winter session of Parliament, the bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha by Union minister Smriti Irani. Then it was sent to the 31-member committee for examination. According to the members' list of the parliamentary standing committee, led by senior BJP leader Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, available on the Rajya Sabha website, Sushmita Dev is the only woman among the 31 members."I wish there were more women MPs in the committee but having said that we will make sure all interest groups are heard," the MP told PTI.NCP MP Supriya Sule said the chairman of the panel has the power to invite other women MPs for a more inclusive and wider discussion.The proposed bill has already become controversial with several MPs terming the bill as an infringement on several personal laws as the bill will amend seven personal laws -- the Indian Christian Marriage Act; the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act; the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act; the Special Marriage Act; the Hindu Marriage Act; and the Foreign Marriage Act.“Equality of women in our country needs to be seen in [terms of] age of marriage. Invoking marriage laws of different faiths, I rise to introduce the amendment bill. This amendment gives equality to men and women in allowing both to marry at 21. Our research shows that 2.1 million child marriages had to be stopped and many underage girls were found pregnant. So you are stopping right to equality," Smriti Irani had said.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-1-woman-member-in-panel-that-will-examine-bill-to-raise-legal-marriage-age-101641121115901.html

The girl, about two to three years' old, was later rescued by a man and admitted to a hospital, they said. The incident, which took place on Saturday evening in Bag Sewania locality, was captured on a CCTV and the footage went viral on social media platforms. In the clip, five dogs were seen charging at the girl while she was running away in panic after being chased. The canines were seen pulling her down on the road and biting her. A man then came to her rescue and chased away the dogs by hurling stones at them. The girl received wounds on her head and face. She has been admitted to the government-run Hamidia Hospital, police inspector Sanjeev Chouksey said, adding that they came to know about the incident through social media. A policeman was sent to the hospital to enquire about the girl's identity and health. So far, no one has complained to police about the incident, he said. “The girl is two to three years' old. She is being given proper medical treatment. She is alright," Bhopal Municipal Corporation Commissioner KVS Choudary told PTI. Denying that the stray dog menace has gone up in the state capital, he said the canine sterilisation programme was paused only for two-three months last year during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. At least 30 to 40 dogs are being sterilised daily since over a month, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stray-dogs-attack-minor-girl-in-bhopal-captured-on-cctv-101641117598578.html
02-01-2022||India||Nawab Malik says BJP leaders lobbying for Sameer Wankhede's extension at NCB||On December 31, Sameer Wankhede's term as the NCB Mumbai zone chief ended. Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik on Sunday claimed that some influential BJP leaders from Maharashtra are lobbying for the extension of his term at the level of the Union home ministry. "Despite negative report against Sameer Wankhede for his wrongdoings, some influential BJP leaders are pursuing with the Union Home Ministry to change his negative report to positive and get him an extension in NCB. Let them do that. After the order is issued, we will seek information under the RTI and expose the manner in which it has been done," Nawab Malik whose son-in-law was also arrested by NCB last year said.After superstar Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan was arrested by the NCB in a drugs case, Nawab Malik brought a series of allegations against NCB and Sameer Wankhede. On Sunday, Nawab Malik released two audiotapes where Wankhede is purportedly speaking with witnesses asking them to give their backdated signatures. "I have released two audiotapes consisting of conversations between the witnesses and the NCB officers. NCB is putting pressure on the witnesses to come to the office and sign in the matter. Already panchanama (record) has been completed but now NCB is demanding backdated signature from the witnesses," Nawab Malik said.Commenting on the audio clips released by Nawab Malik, an NCB official said to news agency PTI that the person 'Maddy', who is talking to an NCB officer (in the audio clip), is one of the witnesses in a case. "At the time of filing a charge sheet, we call such witnesses. There is nothing like signing (back-dated) papers or any other documents. Whatever allegations the minister is making are false and baseless. We have not threatened anyone for anything," the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nawab-malik-says-bjp-leaders-lobbying-for-sameer-wankhede-s-extension-at-ncb-101641117885323.html

They have 40 of 40 MPs in the state, it's a double engine government, then if not them, who would be answerable?" he further questioned.Calling out the state government for not remembering its promise of providing 19 lakh jobs, opposed to RJD's promise of 10 lakh jobs, Yadav said, "In the state where people are already dealing with things like floods and drought, inflated prices, the government should have provided them with the promised 19 lakh jobs.""I do not ask them to give it every year, but at least give it for one year; at least remember the promises you make," he added.As per the Niti Aayog's Multi-dimensional Poverty Index (MPI), Bihar has the highest proportion of "multidimensionally poor" people; 51.91 per cent of the state's population.Poverty, under MPI, was measured on three equally weighted dimensions - health, education, and standard of living.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitish-kumar-govt-slammed-by-tejashwi-yadav-over-niti-aayog-ranking-of-bihar-101641115885947.html

"The year has changed, the situation has also changed -- now we have to speak," Rahul Gandhi tweeted. After a Delhi-based journalist filed a complaint with the Delhi Police against a questionable website for uploading her doctored photos, several politicians condemned it. The Delhi Police registered an FIR on Saturday night.What is ‘Bulli Bai’, the controversial app targeting Muslim women on social media?IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the app has been blocked and further action was being coordinated. "GitHub confirmed blocking the user this morning itself. CERT and Police authorities are coordinating further action," the minister said. महिलाओं का अपमान और सांप्रदायिक नफ़रत तभी बंद होंगे जब हम सब एक आवाज़ में इसके ख़िलाफ़ खड़े होंगे।साल बदला है, हाल भी बदलो- अब बोलना होगा!#NoFear"I was shocked to find out this morning that a website/portal called bullibai.github.io (since deleted) had a doctored picture of me in an improper, unacceptable and clearly lewd context. This needs immediate action, as the same is clearly designed to harass me and other similarly situated independent women and journalists," the woman journalist said in her complaint.A senior Delhi police officer said the case has been registered under sections 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) and 354 A (sexual harassment and punishment for harassment) of the Indian Penal Code on the complaint of the journalist alleging that she is being targeted by an unidentified group of people on "Bulli Bai" portal.The police said no arrests have been made in the case so far and a probe is underway.This is not the first time that Muslim women have been targeted by online platforms. Around six months ago, Sulli Deals -- Bulli Bai is believed to be a clone of that -- used to collect photos of Muslim women from their social media accounts and 'auction' them. Both the apps were created by unidentified groups on GitHub. In the Sulli Deals controversy, two FIRs were filed by the Delhi and the Uttar Pradesh Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/communal-hatred-will-stop-only-when-rahul-gandhi-on-auction-of-muslim-women-101641113252320.html

The youth here will do well.” An official release by the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) has noted that the sports university is being established at an estimated cost of ₹700 crore at the Salawa and Kaili villages of the Sardhana town in Meerut. It will have the capacity of training 1,080 sportspersons, including 540 women and 540 men.“This modern university would be one of the best of its types in the entire world,” Modi said. “Along with sporting facilities, it would also help in nurturing the careers of over 1,000 youth and turn them into successful sportspersons.”The Major Dhyan Chand Sports University has been planned with all the modern, state-of-the-art sports infrastructure – including a synthetic hockey ground, football ground, separate grounds for basketball, volleyball, handball, and kabaddi.It also includes a lawn tennis court, gymnasium hall, a synthetic running stadium, swimming pool, a multipurpose hall, and a cycling velodrome.According to the government release, the university will also house facilities for shooting, squash, gymnastics, weightlifting, archery, canoeing, and kayaking, among other facilities.Modi had earlier said that inculcating sporting culture and establishing a world-class sporting infrastructure in all parts of the country is one of the key areas of focus for his government. The establishment of the Major Dhyan Chand Sports University in the poll-bound state is expected to be a major step towards fulfilling this vision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-in-meerut-lays-foundation-of-major-dhyan-chand-sports-university-101641113163055.html

02-01-2022||India||Omicron acts as natural vaccine? Experts say notion rooted in ‘pandemic fatigue’||Experts have dismissed the claim of the Omicron variant of coronavirus being a natural vaccine as a “dangerous idea” by irresponsible people who don’t take long Covid into account. The Omicron causing milder infections and less hospitalisation and deaths have led to the notion that the new variant of concern may act as a natural vaccine. A Maharashtra health official recently said that the new variant spread faster than Delta, but there have been few hospitalisations."We hope this trend continues. If this happens, Omicron will act as a natural vaccination and may help in its (COVID-19) progression towards the endemic stage," state surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate told PTI.Noted virologist Shahid Jameel said it is a dangerous idea spread by irresponsible people."It breeds complacency and is rooted more in pandemic fatigue and the inability to do more, than in evidence available at this time," PTI quoted Jameel as saying.Jameel said that those propagating the natural vaccine theory don’t take into account the effects of “long Covid”."Especially in India, where malnutrition, air pollution and diabetes are rampant, to willingly let people be exposed to a virus about which you understand little is not good science and public health," he added.Giridhara R Babu, the head of Lifecourse Epidemiology at the Public Health Foundation of India, urged people to stay away from this misinformation, saying there have been deaths and hospitalisations due to the Omicron variant.“Compared to vaccination, natural infection cannot protect the population (against death or hospitalisation) against any variant (Alpha, Beta, Gamma or Delta). Proponents of herd immunity are saying it again that Omicron would provide herd immunity. Evidence matters, not opinions," he said.Shuchin Bajaj, founder-director, Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals, cautioned about the long term effects of the disease."It has been shown that it can be seen persisting for more than six months in various other organs in addition to lungs, like heart and brain and kidneys etc, even after very mild infections. So we don't really know what long term effects it can cause. We are already seeing a lot of long COVID patients with brain fogging, inappropriate sinus tachycardia," he said."So we should not really think of this as a vaccine. It's not really a vaccine, we have had deaths due to Omicron. We have had ICU admissions due to Omicron. So it is a much milder version compared to Delta but still, it is a virus and we need to be careful," he added.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/omicron-acts-as-natural-vaccine-experts-say-notion-rooted-in-pandemic-fatigue-101641107770257.html

A detailed report has been sent to the Airports Authority of India headquarters and the DGCA," the director said.According to the flight schedule, SG-3703 was on time for taking off for Delhi, but it was observed by ATC that the pilots flew without taking the mandatory permission for take-off."Through its communication, the Rajkot ATC asked the pilots as to how they flew without take-off permission… In response, the pilots apologised and said that there was a mistake. This conversation took place when the plane took off," a senior official of the Airport Authority of India was quoted as saying by the news agency.According to a report in the Times of India, a pilot said the investigation will ascertain how the lapse happened and who was at fault. "Was it a communication gap, error or something else.

02-01-2022||India||West witnessing worrying Omicron-driven Covid surge. Death rate is silver lining||The record daily case of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the United States this week has caused fresh concerns about the Omicron variant as it continues to spread rapidly across the globe. The United Kingdom, France and the US have been witnessing an exponential surge in Covid-19 cases, with Britain reporting over 2,200 daily cases per million people. While France is the close second with over 2,000 daily infections per million people, the US is quickly catching up with the worst-hit countries.The fatality rate, however, remains the silver lining of the Covid wave fuelled by the highly contagious Omicron variant. In January 2021, when Britain was reporting the unprecedented surge in daily cases, the fatality rate was around 18 deaths per million people. Now that the UK is reporting almost three times daily infections from January last year, the number of daily new confirmed deaths per million people is hovering around 1.47, less than one-tenth of the fatality rate recorded a year before.Experts suggest that the low fatality rate can be attributed to the high vaccination coverage in the country this time.According to Our World In Data, the seven-day rolling average of daily new infections is currently around 1,100 per million people, way above its January peak of 756. The average daily deaths related to Covid currently stand at around 4 per million people, while it was at 10 per million people in January 2021.Dr Suresh Kumar, MD of Delhi’s LNJP hospital, said that 138 Omicron cases were treated in the hospital last month as the infections continue to increase at an alarming rate. Kumar told news agency ANI that 95 per cent of them have recovered and returned home, adding that all Omicron patients at the hospital are stable."As many as three children were found Omicron positive in the last one month. Two have been discharged while the third one is recovering and stable at present", added the LNJP MD.The symptoms are less visible in the vaccinated population while in children the symptoms are moderate fever and loose motion, according to the doctor."The children will get vaccinated in the next two weeks and we can expect fewer Covid-19 cases after that", said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/west-witnessing-worrying-omicron-driven-covid-surge-death-rate-is-silver-lining-101641102925925.html

02-01-2022||India||Aero sports set to get a boost under new policy||NEW DELHI Given the right impetus, India could be one of the top air sports nations by 2030 because of its vast size, varied terrain and fair weather conditions, the civil aviation ministry said in a proposed aero sports policy. The policy, which has been in the works for about a year, covers activities such as air racing, aerobatics, aeromodelling, hang gliding, paragliding, paramotoring, flying vintage aircraft, ballooning, operating drones and skydiving.Besides the revenue from air sports activities, multiplier benefits in terms of growth in travel, tourism, infrastructure and local employment, especially in hilly areas of the country, are much greater, the government said. Creating air sports hubs across the country will bring in air sports professionals and tourists from across the world, according to the draft policy released on Saturday.“Air sports by their very nature involve a higher level of risk than flying a regular aircraft. NASP 2022 places strong focus on ensuring international best practices in safety,” said the document, which has been placed in the public domain to seek feedback. India will establish an Air Sports Federation that will regulate and oversee the sporting activities in the country. The federation will represent India at the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale, the global governing body for air sports headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland. The draft policy requires all people and entities providing air sports services to register as members of respective air sports associations. They will also have to register key equipment used for air sports with their associations.Indian airspace is divided into red, yellow and green zones, according to the DigitalSky platform of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, which allows air sports enthusiasts to rely on the easily accessible map for guidance. Operations in red zones require a permission from the central government, and yellow zones need approval by the concerned air traffic control authorities. Operation in green zones for aircraft with total weight of up to 500kg does not require any permission.Locations such as Bir-Billing in Himachal Pradesh, also known as India’s paragliding capital, Gangtok in Sikkim, Hadapsar in Maharashtra and Vagamon in Kerala will be declared as control zones for air sports that would require approvals from the federal home and defence ministries, the concerned state government and the local air traffic control. “This will enable hassle-free flying by air sports enthusiasts in such control zones without creating any risk to national security or safety of other manned aircraft,” the draft policy said. “During peak winters, the level of air sports reduces in Europe and North America, and the air sports aficionados migrate to milder climates. ASFI and the air sports associations will work towards developing a hassle-free process to enable their movement to India,” it pointed out. “This will enable Indian air sports enthusiasts to learn from the experience of the visiting professionals, get exposed to global best practices and create opportunities to host global competitions in India.”The government will also consider allowing import of air sports equipment without any levies for a specified number of years. Schools, colleges and universities will be encouraged to have air sports included in their curriculum, the policy proposes. In order to make air sports affordable to all, the government will request the GST Council to consider rationalizing tax rates on air sports equipment to 5% or less, the draft said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-readies-first-aerosports-policy-proposes-an-ambitious-target-for-2030-101641100159755.html

02-01-2022||India||Chennai got 20cm rainfall in 5 hours. IMD explains why it couldn’t foresee it||NEW DELHI: Extremely heavy rain that brought Chennai to a standstill on Thursday was unexpected and took the India Meteorological Department (IMD) by surprise, people familiar with the matter told HT on Friday. The met department was expecting moderate rainfall but extremely heavy rain of over 20 cm was recorded in a relatively small area of parts of urban and suburban Chennai within a span of around 5 hours, the department said.Three people were killed in a rain-related incident on Thursday and parts of the city remained waterlogged on Friday. “We expected moderate rain on Thursday. But extremely heavy rain occurred in a small area covering parts of Chennai and its suburbs… between 4.30pm and 10pm. As of now, we do not have the science to forecast such localised, short span extreme events. So, we started broadcasting rainfall alerts and issued a red category warning when we noticed such an event was unfolding,” said S Balachandran, deputy director general of meteorology, IMD Chennai“We have short and medium-term weather forecasts but these events are not captured in those. There are continuous changes in the atmosphere, a dynamic process just like the human body. We do not expect such rainfall events during this time of the year but we have to expect the unexpected now in weather,” he added.“The weather department was unable to predict the heavy rain yesterday. We will take up the issue of upgrading weather forecast systems with the central government”, Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin told reporters.According to Balachandran, the heavy rainfall may be attributed to the interaction between moist, low-level easterlies with the westerly winds, but other interactions may have also taken place.On Thursday, between 8.30am and 7.45pm, rainfall as high as 24 cm was reported from parts of Chennai.Strong northeasterly winds are prevailing off the coast off Tamil Nadu in the lower levels. A cyclonic circulation is lying over southwest Bay of Bengal, off the Sri Lankan coast at the middle tropospheric level. Under its influence, widespread rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall activity is very likely to continue over coastal Tamil Nadu during next 2 days, IMD has warned.IMD director general Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said about the Chennai rainfall, “This may have happened because of the interaction of northwesterly winds from northwest India and easterlies from the northeast monsoon. There was a trough near the Tamil Nadu coast and a deep trough in the northwesterlies. We were expecting heavy rain from December 31 but not on December 30. The impact of the interaction was advanced, which we did not foresee. It’s important to remember that this was a localised event and short spanned.” “It’s difficult to say that this event is attributed to climate change because that will need the study of atmospheric concentration of CO2; temperature profile etc. But there is no doubt that extreme rainfall events due to climate change are increasing over India,” he added.Chennai’s rainfall is among several extreme weather incidents reported across the country this year.In October, severe flooding was reported in Nainital following a cloudburst; several parts of Maharashtra, particularly the ghat areas also recorded floods and landslides in July. Mahabaleshwar, a hill station in Maharashtra’s Satara district located in the Western Ghats recorded the highest rainfall ever in its history with 60 cm in 24 hours.Recording 20cm or more in 24 hours is classified to be “extremely heavy” rain by IMD.Flooding was also reported in parts of east Rajasthan, west Madhya Pradesh etc in July and August. During the northeast monsoon, as many as 100 people were killed across Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu in various rain-related events in the southern peninsula in November.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chennai-got-20cm-rainfall-in-5-hours-imd-explains-why-it-couldn-t-foresee-it-101641098959500.html

02-01-2022||India||What is ‘Bulli Bai’, the controversial app targeting Muslim women on social media?||A controversial app created on a repository hosting service has triggered outrage on social media after photos of Muslim women were uploaded on it without their consent. The app named ‘Bulli Bai’ was allegedly found auctioning pictures of Muslim women, months after some unidentified persons created a similar app ‘Sulli deals’ where photographs of hundreds of Muslim women, sourced from their social media accounts, were uploaded and auctioned. The app was taken down following outrage on social media.On Saturday, a woman journalist shared an image of her being sold on the Bulli Bai app as ‘deal of the day’. Taking to Twitter, the journalist said it was “very sad that as a Muslim woman you have to start your new year with this sense of fear & disgust.”“To "sell" someone online is a cybercrime & I call on the police to take immediate action. The perpetrators deserve exemplary & condign punishment,” Congress leader Shashi Tharoor wrote on Twitter.Shiv Sena MP Priyanka Chaturvedi said she has repeatedly asked the Union information technology minister Ashwini Vaishnaw to take stern action against “rampant misogyny and communal targeting of women through #sullideals like platforms.”‘A shame that it continues to be ignored,” she added.Photos of Muslim women again misused on app, 2 police complaints filedVaishnaw informed that GitHub has confirmed blocking the user on Saturday morning and CERT and Police authorities are coordinating further action. Responding to the minister, Chaturvedi said “besides blocking the platform punishing the offenders creating such sites is important.”The journalist later filed a complaint with the Cyber Cell of Delhi Police for immediate registration of FIR and consequent action against people behind the auctioning of Muslim women on social media."It is indeed disappointing to see the impunity with which such hate mongers continue to target Muslim women, without fear of saction whatsoever. Based on tweets posted on the Delhi Police handle, I believe that Delhi police has 'taken cognizance' of this offence," the complaint read.Delhi Police have registered an FIR under sector 509 of the Indian Penal Code on the complaint of the woman journalist. FIR has been registered in the Cyber Police station of the South East district, reported news agency ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-is-bulli-bai-the-controversial-app-which-has-triggered-outrage-on-social-media-101641096495632.html
02-01-2022||India||Will stick to ₹8 lakh income limit for EWS quota, Centre tells Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: The Centre has decided to continue with the existing annual income limit of ₹8 lakh for identification of economically weaker section (EWS) following the recommendation by a committee set up to revisit this criterion after the Supreme Court raised doubts over the 10% quota rollout while dealing with NEET-PG admissions.In an affidavit filed late Saturday night, the Centre annexed a copy of the committee’s report and said, “The central government has decided to accept the recommendations of the committee including the recommendation of applying the new criteria prospectively.”The three-member committee comprising former union finance secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey, member secretary ICSSR VK Malhotra, and principal economic advisor Sanjeev Sanyal, in its report submitted to Centre on December 31 said, “The committee has come to the conclusion that the existing annual income criteria of ₹8 lakh is not over-inclusive.”The income criterion for identifying EWS was introduced by a notification of January 17, 2019 which further laid down other conditions for identifying EWS, such as the beneficiary’s family must not own or possess five acres of agricultural land, a residential flat of 1,000 square feet and above or residential plot of 100/200 square yards and above in notified/non-notified municipalities.The committee altogether omitted the residential asset criteria but retained the five acre agricultural plot criteria. It said, “The committee is of the view that on merit as well as for ease, convenience, and simplicity, the residential asset area criteria should altogether be omitted as it does not reflect true economic conditions and also poses serious complications and burden on EWS families without commensurate benefits.”However, with regard to agricultural asset, it maintained, “Removal of agricultural land limit criteria could result into anomalous situation of big land owners being included in EWS.”The committee’s recommendations will be applicable from the next admission cycle as it was of the view that the existing and ongoing criteria in every on-going process where EWS reservation is available should be continued.The committee was formed on November 30 after the top court, while considering a bunch of petitions questioning the introduction of 10% EWS and 27% OBC quota in NEET-PG admissions in 2020-21 academic session, wondered whether the income criteria of ₹8 lakh could be uniformly applied across the country. Also, it was pointed out that this was the same cutoff for identification of creamy layer or socially advanced persons among OBCs.The affidavit filed by ministry of social justice and empowerment has come ahead of the hearing of NEET-PG petitions on January 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-stick-to-rs-8-lakh-income-limit-for-ews-quota-centre-tells-supreme-court-101641095239198.html

It is learnt that the probe team led by Air Marshal Manavendra Singh examined all likely scenarios for the crash including possible human error or whether it was a case of disorientation by the crew when the helicopter was preparing for landing.The people said the findings of the Court of Inquiry and the procedure it followed in the probe are being legally vetted. “The legal vetting is being done to ensure that the probe team followed all the laid down norms and procedures,” said one of the people cited above.Asked about possible causes of the crash, a number of aviation experts said there were instances of a significant number of air accidents caused by visual disorientation triggered by the loss of situational awareness by pilots. And bad weather could be a factor contributing to the loss of situational awareness at times, said one of them.The report is expected to be submitted to Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhari in a week, they said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/probe-report-on-cds-chopper-crash-likely-in-coming-week-101641066090519.html

02-01-2022||India||Chennai battles waterlogging after heavy rain||Continuous and heavy rainfall over the past few days led to waterlogging in several parts of Chennai on Saturday.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted heavy to heavy rainfall activity over coastal Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal during the next 24 hours.“A cyclonic circulation lies over southwest Bay of Bengal of Sri Lanka coast at middle tropospheric level, under its influence, fairly widespread rainfall with isolated heavy to heavy rainfall activity is very likely over the coast of Tamil Nadu during next 24 hours and decreases thereafter,” said the IMD.People had found themselves in knee-deep water in T. Nagar on Friday morning. Some inundated roads were also closed as their clearing was underway. People were also seen placing sandbags outside to stop rainwater from entering their houses. A day after several parts of Chennai experienced over 20 cm rainfall, Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin on Friday said the Meteorological department usually provided information on likelihood of rainfall, but they could not forecast Thursday’s heavy showers.After inspecting initiatives to drain rain water from several flooded localities using heavy duty motors, Stalin accused the previous AIADMK regime of not taking appropriate steps to strengthen infrastructure and prevent water-logging.Expressing confidence that water logging issues would be addressed before the next rainy season, the CM said IMD usually provided information (to government) on likelihood of rainfall.They, however, could not forecast the heavy rainfall on December 30 in Chennai and it was unexpected, he told reporters.To a question on surprise rains and whether there are any issues in providing weather forecast and if the state government would submit a representation to the Centre to change equipment at the IMD regional centre here, he said it is the job of the union government.”However, since you have raised the matter, the Tamil Nadu government will remind the Centre about this.”On Thursday, several areas of Chennai experienced more than 20 CM rainfall, he said.Asked on the CM’s comment, an IMD (Chennai) official told PTI that considering several technicalities and practical difficulties it is not always possible to provide 100 per cent error free forecast.A weather forecast by the IMD (issued 12.30 hours on December 30) had said: “Thunderstorm with moderate rain is likely to occur at a few places over coastal Tamil Nadu. “Thunderstorm with moderate rain is likely to occur at many places over Villupuram, Cuddalore and Delta districts, Puducherry and Karaikal. Light rain is also likely to occur at isolated places over Interior Tamil Nadu districts.”For the second consecutive day, people here battled inundation, and stench as rain water mixed with sewage in a number of areas.As rainfall continued here and in several suburbs, traffic congestion was also witnessed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chennai-battles-waterlogging-after-heavy-rain-101641061984497.html

Bengaluru Traffic Police’s mascot – Meese Thimmaiah – can bring a smile to anyone’s face. The new mascot was an instant hit with the people. This mascot based on a real-life traffic policeman, who died saving a woman and her child, had a fan following of his own in the 1990s way before the social media era.Head constable Marichikaiah Thimmaiah who was posted near the General Post Office (GPO) Junction, a stone’s throw away from Vidhan Soudha,had become a landmark for the junction.Hailing from Koratagere taluk in Tumakuru district, Thimmaiah joined Bengaluru police in 1977. A year later he got married to Lakshmama, who still remembers her husband’s fondness for big moustaches. “He started growing a moustache in 1985 and maintained it till his last day. He loved it when people called him Meese Thimmaiah (moustache Thimmaiah). Every morning, he would oil his moustache before getting to work,” remembered Lakshmama. Owing to the popularity of his moustache, the department made an exception to give him an annual allowance of ₹500 for grooming. “Thimmaiah remembered all the officers who served with him. He was popular among children and elders alike,” said R Hitendra, who previously served as the additional commissioner of police, traffic.“Whenever a school bus used to pass by the GPO junction, we would hear children cheering for him,” said retired sub-inspector Lakshman Gowda, who served with Thimmaiah. Despite mandatory routine transfers, Thimmaiah’s area was not changed due to his popularity, and unfortunately the same junction claimed his life. On April 26, 1995, a mini-truck violated the traffic regulations ignoring his signals. In an attempt to save a woman and her child who were crossing the road then, Thimmaiah jumped in. Even though he managed to rescue the child and her mother, he was killed in the accident.The memories of that day are still fresh in his wife’s mind. “As usual, he was in front of the mirror grooming his beard. He dropped the children to school and hours later I heard about his death,” she said. He was the family’s sole earning member when he passed away in August 1995, leaving behind his wife and three children. Thimmaiah had an immaculate record till his death and was awarded for his services posthumously with a gold medal by the state government. The GPO circle which he managed with great distinction was renamed in his honour as Police Thimmaiah Circle. “We could think of no one else but Thimmaiah when we wanted a mascot for Bengaluru,” said Hitendra.

02-01-2022||India||Mismanagement, huge rush caused stampede in Vaishno Devi: Eyewitnesses||Jammu: Overcrowding and lack of supervision by authorities led to the stampede at the Vaishno Devi shrine in Jammu & Kashmir’s Katra that left 12 dead in the wee hours of Saturday, according to eyewitnesses.Also Read | At least 12 killed during Vaishno Devi stampedeAt least 12 people died and over a dozen were injured in a stampede at the Vaishno Devi shrine triggered by a heavy rush of devotees on the New Year. This is the first such tragedy at the shrine located atop the Trikuta hills, about 50 km from Jammu. Soon after the incident, local residents, pilgrims and members of the Baridar Sangharsh Samiti staged a massive protest at the Katra bus stand, demanding a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation and framing of charges against the shrine administration under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code.“This is really very unfortunate that on New Year so many pilgrims died. The administration and shrine board authorities are responsible for it. There must be a fair probe into the entire incident, which is not possible by the panel constituted by the LG. The Centre should form a panel. Had there been proper management, there would not have been so many deaths,” said Sham Singh, president of the Baridar Sangharsh Samiti.Most of the deaths were due to suffocation, police said.Director general of police Dilbag Singh, who accompanied Union minister Jitendra Singh to take stock of the situation at the shrine, told reporters that the incident took place due to confusion or “probably somebody at the site acted funny which could have led to some altercation”.“People who got admitted here are stable. We may add some technical solutions for the yatra (pilgrimage). Earlier, people used to visit the shrine during festivals but nowadays youngsters want to visit the shrine on the 1st day of the year,” said Jitendra Singh.“All these things are being looked into. That area is a little narrow and people ran helter-skelter without knowing the reason,” Dilbag Singh said. “Most of the deaths have taken place due to suffocation after being run over by each other and most of the injuries are also due to the same reason.”(WITH AGENCY INPUTS)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mismanagement-huge-rush-caused-stampede-in-vaishno-devi-eyewitnesses-101641059646382.html
