08-01-2022||Pune||Over 36k Molnupiravir doses in private hospitals, govt centres prep to purchase stock||Pune: As per the Pune Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), Pune city’s private hospitals have over 36,000 capsules of Molnupiravir which was the most recent drug approved for the treatment of mild Covid patients whose symptoms could worsen from mild to moderate. However, in addition to this, Pune hospitals have more than enough stock of Favipiravir in both government and private hospitals while government hospitals in Pune are yet to stock Molnupiravir which was only recently added to the protocol of treatment of Covid patients. Also, for the treatment of moderate patients, Pune has close to 3.5 lakh vials of remdesivir. As the number of Covid cases surge in the district and the doubling rate comes down to one or two days, the administration is rushing to stock the essential drugs. While most new Covid cases are being reported among those who are vaccinated and the reported symptoms are mild, most patients might need the drugs used to treat patients suffering from the mild to moderate symptoms. While private hospitals have enough stock, government hospitals are in the process to procure the Molnupiravir which is the latest drug to get approval of Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) for the treatment of adult patients with Covid, with SpO2 >93% and who have high risk of progression of the disease, including hospitalisation or death. Dr Ashok Nandapurkar, civil surgeon for Pune district, said, “The drug Molnupiravir was only recently added to the list of drugs approved for the treatment of Covid patients and so we are in the process of procuring the drugs. However, Favipiravir which was already in use even in the second wave and is also used to treat Covid patients with mild symptoms is available in large stocks. We have enough stock as of now and there is no scarcity given the current situation.” Pune district also has over 1.28 lakh vials of remdesivir of which 1.24 lakh are in government hospitals and 4,772 in private hospitals. As of Friday (January 7), of the 7,665 active Covid cases in Pune district, close to 10% or 770 required remdesivir as per data from the Pune FDA office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/over-36k-molnupiravir-doses-in-private-hospitals-govt-centres-prep-to-purchase-stock-101641666419107.html
08-01-2022||Lucknow||Seven-phase UP assembly polls to begin from western districts that currently have high Covid caseload||The seven-phase Uttar Pradesh (UP) assembly polls to be held between February 10 and March 7 will commence from the western districts that account for about 50% of the state’s Covid-19 caseload after a surge in the infection graph since the last week of December 2021. The polling dates in UP are: February 10, 14, 20, 23, 27, March 3 and 7. The counting of votes will be taken up on March 10, the election commission announced on Saturday.In the first phase, polling will be held on February 10 in 58 assembly constituencies in 11 districts, including Shamli, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Baghpat, Ghaziabad, Hapur, Gautam Buddha Nagar (Noida), Bulandshahr, Aligarh, Mathura and Agra.About 50% of UP’s 6,411 fresh cases – 3,402 — were reported in these 11 districts going to polls in the first phase. These districts also account for over 50% of the active cases (10,128), making the task of holding poll challenging for the poll panel.With the 6,411 fresh Covid-19 cases across the state in the last 24 hours, the tally of active cases in UP has gone up to 18,551, according to data released by the state health and family welfare department on Saturday.The positivity rate increased to 2.91% while the recovery rate that was 98.6% in December declined to 97.6% on Saturday.The second phase voting will take place on February 14 in 55 assembly constituencies in nine districts.The third phase will have voting in 59 assembly constituencies in 16 districts, the fourth phase in 60 assembly constituencies in nine districts and the fifth phase in 60 assembly constituencies in 11 districts. During the sixth phase, polling will take place in 57 assembly constituencies in 10 districts. The seventh phase will see polling in 54 assembly constituencies in nine districts.Acknowledging that the Covid-19 situation in the poll bound states is dynamic and not static, the poll preparations have been made to hold a Covid safe election, said chief election commissioner Sushil Chandra in New Delhi.For his part, Uttar Pradesh chief electoral officer Ajay Kumar Shukla said the direction issued by EC for ensuring Covid-19 appropriate behaviour during the election campaign and polling will be implemented strictly. A ban has been imposed on physical rallies, road shows, padyatras, street corner meetings till January 15. The political parties have been urged to hold virtual and digital campaigning on various social media platforms, he said. The election commission’s guidelines have been sent to all the district magistrates and they have been directed to ensure that there is no violation of the poll panel order. The district magistrates will be held responsible for the violation of Covid guidelines issued by the ECI, he said. EC has also directed the chief secretary and state health department officers to ensure that maximum people are fully vaccinated with the double dose, personnel deployed in the poll duty get the precautionary booster dose and the polling stations are fully sanitised. The political parties have been told to furnish an undertaking that they would abide by the Covid-19 guidelines, Shukla said. Although the Covid-19 infection is spreading fast in the state, the virus is mild and this can be gauged from the fact that during the second wave on March 29, 2021, out of the 2,556 active cases in Lucknow, 312 people were admitted in hospitals but on Saturday, out of the 2,573 cases in the city, merely 15 patients are admitted in hospitals, said additional chief secretary (health and family welfare) Amit Mohan Prasad.Uttar Pradesh has ramped up Covid-19 vaccination by administering 21.5 crore doses. While 7.7 crore people (53%) have received two doses, 13.11 crore (88.98 %) have been given the first dose. Strict measures have implemented in the districts in which the active Covid tally is 1,000, he said. Dr PK Gupta, former president of Lucknow branch of the Indian Medical Association, said two-month long poll process in Uttar Pradesh will commence on January 14 amid the surge in Covid cases in UP.With the third wave likely to peak by January-end or the first week of February, EC’s guidelines to check gatherings should be implemented strictly till then and political parties should be motivated to hold virtual meetings, he said. The notification for the first phase of the UP assembly elections will be issued on January 14, Uttar Pradesh chief electoral officer Ajay Kumar Shukla said on Saturday.With the announcement of the assembly election schedule, the mode code of conduct (MCC) has come into effect in Uttar Pradesh, Shukla said. Directions have been issued for effective implementation of MCC. He also said orders have been issued for a ban on the transfer of officials and employees associated with the election work.For the first phase, the last date for filing nominations is January 21 and scrutiny will take place on January 24. The last date for withdrawal of candidature is January 27.The second phase notification will be issued on January 21, and the last date of nominations is January 28. The notification for third phase will be issued on January 25 and for fourth phase on January 27. The notification for the fifth phase will be issued on February 1,sixth phase on February and seventh and last phase on February 10. 
08-01-2022||Pune||Hospitalisation among vaccinated, unvaccinated in proportion, more data needed: officials||While the perception that more breakthrough Covid cases are being reported and most report only mild symptoms has led to a general public consensus that the Omicron variant could not be as fatal as the Delta variant, the data from Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) health department shows that the number of those who require hospitalisation, ICU beds or ventilators is almost proportionate irrespective of the vaccination status. It further pushes the requirement for the third dose which the civic body will start administering from Monday as the waning antibodies could be the reason for reinfection or breakthrough cases, if civic data is to be believed. As per the PMC health department, of the 3,976 Covid positives tracked for their vaccination status by the civic body up until January 5, 627 had not taken a single dose of the vaccine while 3,243 were breakthrough infections. However, out of the 627 patients reported who have not taken a single vaccine dose, two required ICU beds while out of the 3,243 breakthrough infections, four required ICU beds. While the perception of Omicron being milder is leading to leniency among those vaccinated, the PMC data shows that with comorbidity factor and waning antibodies in place, both vaccinated and unvaccinated population could be at equal risk. The data up to January 5 includes only those with vaccination status and needs to be updated, said civic officials to get a holistic picture. Earlier, Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol had said that 80% of the new cases are breakthrough infections and not require hospitalisations. A senior doctor from KEM requesting anonymity said, “As per the data from our hospital admissions, of the 48 active Covid-19 cases, 34 or 70.8% are fully vaccinated. Of the three on ventilators, two have had no doses and one has had both doses. One on High Flow Nasal Cannula or HFNC has had no dose and one on oxygen has had two doses. All others are on room air and only isolated and 22 or (45%) have comorbidities. Of these 48, one is 9 months old, one is 13 years old and 21 of the 48 are over 60 years.” The data shows that of the 3,900 new Covid cases reported, over 3,200 are breakthrough infections and despite fully vaccinated status, three needed oxygen beds and four needed ICU. Dr Sanjeev Wavare, assistant health officer said, “Although currently the data might show that there is no huge disparity in those admitted in terms of their vaccination status, this would be too early to conclude anything based on this data alone. We have little information to jump to any conclusion. The number of cases is doubling in one or two days and so the picture could change drastically. However, we can say that despite such a surge the number of hospitalisations has not risen in proportion because compared to the second wave we have a large number of people vaccinated.” Starting from Monday, the civic body will start a precautionary dose or the third dose for those who have completed nine months post second dose and for healthcare and frontline workers who will be given the third dose. Earlier studies had indicated that the antibodies developed post vaccination could wane off in a couple of months and so the government is now pushing for a third dose given the much anticipated third wave driven by Omicron.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/hospitalisation-among-vaccinated-unvaccinated-in-proportion-more-data-needed-officials-101641666000077.html
08-01-2022||Mumbai||BMC to start rolling out third precautionary doses from Jan 10||Mumbai: The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Saturday said that it will start administering the third ‘precautionary’ dose of Covid-19 vaccine to health and frontline workers and citizens above 60 years of age with comorbidities from January 10 onwards.The BMC has said that an individual who has completed nine months or 39 weeks since the second dose will be eligible to take the third dose. The municipal corporation also maintained that a person needs to take the same vaccine for the third dose which they have taken earlier. Which means, if an individual has been administered with Covishield then they will have to take Covishield only and not any other vaccination.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner and in-charge of public health in BMC said that the third dose will be administered in all the operational vaccination centres across Mumbai. He shared that for the time being no dedicated booths will be required for inoculating beneficiaries exclusively with third dose.“At present, the footfall for general public is really low at the vaccination centres, as majority of the population are vaccinated. Which is why we are not starting any dedicated booths for the time being and have decided to wait and watch for now,” Kakani said.Both online and walk-in facilities will be made available for the precautionary doses and eligible citizens by the BMC. Citizens can also get their doses from private hospitals as well.The BMC on Saturday also informed that the online registration window has opened from January 8 and incase if an eligible frontline or health-worker who is less than 60 years of age is unable to get registered online then he/she will be have to register on spot by displaying their identity cards.“Those who are under 60 years of age is categorised as general citizens so they need to register themselves first at government centres physically by showing their proof of occupation. If they wish to take the dose in a private centre then they will have to first come at government centre for registration and then go to private centre to take the dose as the registration facility is unavailable at private centres,” the BMC statement said.“The senior citizens taking the precautionary dose will also have to display a doctor’s document and consent certificate as a proof of comorbidity,” said the statement.Kakani also informed, “At present we can say that only 2.5 lakh to 3 lakh citizens have finished their nine month window, which is why we are not expecting a high footfall on the first day itself. But as time will progess, more people will become eligible for their dose.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-to-start-rolling-out-third-precautionary-doses-from-jan-10-101641665459038.html
08-01-2022||Delhi||Overnight rain spell gives Delhi its wettest Jan in 22 years||A widespread spell of rain on Friday night gave Delhi its wettest January in 22 years, just eight days into the new year, showed data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD), as the showers mopped up the city’s pollution, giving the Capital an air quality index (AQI) lower than 100 for the first time since mid-October.The IMD’s Safdarjung observatory, considered to be the official marker of the city’s weather, recorded 41mm of rain on Saturday. The last time Delhi saw more rain in January was in 1999, when the city recorded 46mm of precipitation on January 7. The Palam weather station received 47.6mm rain during the same period, which according to IMD, is the highest rainfall in 27 years. On January 9, 1995, the Palam station recorded 52.2mm of rainfall. Weather officials attributed the rain to a western disturbance and the induced cyclonic circulation. The western disturbance is over north Pakistan and neighbouring areas, while the induced cyclonic circulation is over east Rajasthan and neighbouring areas, the IMD said in a press release on Saturday.RK Jenamani, senior scientist, IMD, said while the western disturbance is a routine phenomenon, the widespread rain this time is due to a “strong” western disturbance. “Some western disturbances are so strong that their tail lies till the central part of the Arabian Sea. The weather activity that we witnessed was on account of a huge western disturbance that picked up moisture from a vast area of the central Arabian Sea and covered areas such as Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand,” said Jenamani. He said Punjab, Haryana, and parts of Rajasthan also recorded high rainfall. “The western disturbance resulted in high rainfall in a number of areas. That doesn’t happen normally. The western disturbance was very active this time,” he said.The rain resulted in temperatures dropping in the national capital; on Saturday, the maximum temperature at the Safdarjung station was 16.4 degrees Celsius (°C), three degrees below normal and nearly four lower than Friday’s reading of 20.3°C. The minimum temperature on Saturday was 15.2 degrees Celsius, with the difference between the maximum and minimum temperatures on Saturday being just 1.2 degrees. “An interesting thing to note is that the difference between the day and night temperature is only one degree. That is very unique,” said Jenamani. The IMD said fairly widespread rainfall is likely to continue in Delhi on Saturday and decrease thereafter. As per the IMD’s weekly forecast, a cloudy sky with light rain is expected on Sunday. The air quality in the city also improved on Saturday, thanks to the rain. Delhi recorded an air quality index (AQI) reading of 91 (satisfactory), an improvement from Friday’s AQI of 182, as per the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) 4pm bulletin. The CPCB classifies an AQI of zero to 50 as “good”, 51-100 as “satisfactory”, 101-200 as “moderate”, 201-300 as “poor”, 301-400 as “very poor” and above 400 as “severe”. The Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) attributed the improvement in AQI to strong dispersion of pollutants and wet deposition of particulate matter on account of rain. “From 9th (Sunday) onwards air quality is likely to degrade due to gradual decrease in maximum and minimum temperatures as well as wind speed, all contributing to low dispersion of pollutants,” the forecast said. In the aftermath of rain, waterlogging was reported from various parts of the capital. Areas such as New Friends Colony, Dabri, Bindapur, Tilak Nagar, and Chattarpur were inundated, traffic officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/overnight-rain-spell-gives-delhi-its-wettest-jan-in-22-years-101641665279193.html
08-01-2022||Pune||No rains likely in Pune for few days||According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Pune city may not experience rainfall in the next few days, but may see drop in temperature. “Pune city has no chances of rainfall. But the skies across the city may get clear from January 9. Maximum temperature will be around 29 to 30 degrees Celsius in the next few days. After January 9, the night temperature may see a drop of three to four degrees,” said Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting department of IMD Pune. On Saturday, city’s day temperature was 30.3 degrees Celsius which was 1.3 degrees Celsius warmer than normal. And night temperature was 13.5 which was 2.5 degrees Celsius warmer than normal. The days are likely to remain warmer in many parts of the state with temporary temperature drop likely in the next few days. Many rural parts of Pune district reported fog and haze during early hours which continued in some areas till mid-morning hours. Though the phenomenon has become a common occurrence, as per climatology data, fog-filled days are rare, as per the weather department. Kashyapi said the western disturbance (WD) as a cyclonic circulation lies over north Pakistan and neighbourhoods in lower and middle tropospheric levels. “The induced cyclonic circulation lies over east Rajasthan and neighbourhoods at lower tropospheric levels. High moisture feeding from Arabian sea over northwest and adjoining central India in lower and middle tropospheric levels is very likely to continue till January 10. The confluence of winds from Arabian sea and Bay of Bengal at lower tropospheric levels is very likely over central India till January 12,” he said. In other subdivisions of Maharashtra, rainfall along with thunderstorms is likely. “On January 9, Marathwada may receive lightning and thunderstorms at isolated places. On January 9 and January 10, moderate rainfall along with lightning and thunderstorms may continue in Vidarbha as well,” said Kashyapi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/no-rains-likely-in-pune-for-few-days-101641664860824.html

08-01-2022||Delhi||Lawyers pitch in to help two girls pay their tuition fee||Several lawyers, who were awaiting their turn for video conferencing hearings at the Delhi high court, on Friday pitched in to help two underprivileged girls, who would have otherwise had to forgo their studies for lack of funds. Not only did the lawyers help the two girls pay the admission fee for the current session, but the Delhi high court bar association president Mohit Mathur also assured justice Najmi Waziri that the bar will take care of the further expenses of the two girls whose parents were divorced and their father did not have the means to pay their fee.While hearing a contempt plea filed by the mother against the father for not paying maintenance, the court was informed that the younger daughter is pursuing her bachelors in law from a college in Ghaziabad and is currently in the third year. She missed out on the midterms of the fifth semester due to non-payment of tuition fee, the court was told.The court was also told that if the outstanding amount is not paid by January 10; the law student would lose an academic year. The mother also told the judge that the older daughter, who is pursuing B-2 Level Certificate German Language Course (External) from Goethe Institute, Max Mueller Bhawan, on KG Marg in New Delhi, has been made an external student due to non-payment of ₹12,400 towards tuition fee.The father was engaged in photocopying and bookbinding business at the Tis Hazari court and said he does not have the wherewithal to meet the expenses. On an earlier date, he had informed the court that the shop has been taken away by the Delhi Bar Association (DBA). Following this, the court posted the matter to February 1 for further hearing.However, the mother approached the court with an urgent application saying she was facing financial difficulties due to which the girls would have to leave their studies.As the court was mulling a solution, lawyers logged in to the virtual hearing and offered to contribute the fee. Immediately, 10 lawyers contributed towards the educational expenses and gathered over ₹1 lakh to support the girls.Seeing the overwhelming response, the court asked the advocates to jointly contribute towards the children’s education and deposit money in the petitioner mother’s bank account.Later, speaking to HT, the mother said she wants her daughter to become a judge so that she can help similarly placed women in distress.“I wanted to make my daughters independent, especially after what I have suffered at the hands of my in-laws and husband whose behaviour deteriorated after I gave birth to my second daughter. I want my younger daughter, pursuing law, to become a judge and ensure that none has to face the situation that we have faced,” the woman said.The woman, who was married in 1998, left home in 2011 and instituted proceedings to dissolve the marriage while also filing a domestic violence case against her husband and in-laws. She alleged that in the last 11 years, she has been bearing the educational expenses of her children by taking money from her retired father, doing petty jobs and borrowing heavily from others. She also claimed that the husband, being rich, has the clout and has given false submission to the court. “I think that the law should be amended to such an extent that all maintenance orders passed by the family courts are strictly adhered to and no one should face the hardships due to a broken marriage, just like I did,” she said.
08-01-2022||Delhi||300,000 people in Delhi eligible to get Covid booster shots from Monday||Senior citizens and at least 300,000 fully vaccinated health and front line workers will be eligible for a third precautionary jab that will start being administered in Delhi from Monday, according to estimates by local authorities. The directorate of family welfare of the Delhi government issued an order on Friday, asking all district magistrates, hospitals and vaccination centres to administer the precautionary dose to eligible beneficiaries based on the reference number mentioned on their vaccination certificates. Online appointments on the CoWIN portal for the booster jabs began on Saturday evening. Those who got the second dose 39 weeks ago (roughly nine months) will be eligible for the precautionary shots, health officials said.“The reference number generated on the vaccination certificate identifies the beneficiaries as health care workers, front line workers, senior citizens, or the general people. That is how the verification of eligible people will be done to avoid discrepancies,” a government spokesperson said. “If by chance an eligible beneficiary does not have his or her status assigned as a health or fornt line worker, then they will first have to get their status appropriately assigned to get the precautionary dose,” the spokesperson added. “For those aged 60 years and above, there will not be any problems in obtaining the shot as their age is clearly mentioned on the certificates.”To assign the status of a health or front line worker, the beneficiary will have to produce his or her employment certificate at any government-run vaccination centre. For senior citizens, the booster shot will be available at all vaccination centres across the city. The CoWIN system will send a text alert to the beneficiaries when their booster dose becomes due.In its Friday order, the Delhi government urged private hospitals to ensure that their staff get the booster dose. “Private hospitals that function as Covid-19 vaccination centres can vaccinate their staff (doctors, paramedics etc.) at the hospital itself,” the January 7 order said. “District magistrates, chief medical officers and district immunization officers are requested to issue necessary instructions to the hospitals concerned in this regard.”“The number of daily eligible beneficiaries will keep changing depending on the 39-week gap,” a health official said on condition of anonymity. “Text messages will be sent to the eligible people accordingly. Districts are also spreading awareness among senior citizens about the programme. A doctor’s certificate is not required for senior citizens with comorbidities to obtain the shot.” On December 25, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the Centre’s decision to start precautionary third doses for high priority categories from January 10. The same vaccine that was administered as the first and second doses is to be administered as the booster shot as well. It means those who were administered Covaxin as their first and second doses will receive the same as their precautionary dose. People who received Covishield and the first and second does will likewise get the same vaccine as a booster dose, officials said.The booster dose programme comes at a time when the country is in the clutch of a third wave of Covid-19 infections. The emergence of a highly transmissible Omicron variant is contributing to the surge, though the severity and fatality of the disease is currently low.Delhi on Saturday reported 20,181 fresh Covid-19 infections and seven deaths. The number of containment zones in Delhi on Saturday was 9,227.All arrangements are in place to start administering booster shots for the high priority groups, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said. “We have adequate doses and proper infrastructure in place to vaccinate about 300,000 people everyday,” he said. “Delhi has full stock of booster doses to start the drive.” 
08-01-2022||Lucknow||Like NZ PM Ardern, grandma Indira my inspiration: Priyanka||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Saturday said she liked New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern among the present women leaders though her grandmother the late Indira Gandhi was her inspiration.She connected with the people on social media, responded to questions from them a few hours before the Election Commission of India announced a ban on physical rallies till January 15 while announcing the schedule for assembly elections in five states including Uttar Pradesh.Priyanka responded to some of the questions sent to her. “Who is your favourite leader,” was one of the questions. “I will say Jacinda Ardern. She is Prime Minister of New Zealand. I like her because she is natural. She is courageous…. She is connected to people. She carried her child to parliament,” replied Priyanka. She, however, added if she talked about leaders of the past, it was her grandmother the late Indira Gandhi. “She was an inspiration to me,” said Priyanka.Asked to narrate an incident about Indira Gandhi, Priyanka referred to an incident of stone pelting at her to make her point, “She was fearless. She continued to speak though her nose was bleeding (when a stone hit her). She left only when security persons insisted,” said Priyanka.About the Congress’ newly coined slogan “Ladki Hun, Lad Sakti Hun”, Priyanka said the same was worked out collectively at a meeting. She used the occasion to read out some of the promises the Congress has made in the women manifesto titled “Shakti Vidhan” and said her party’s campaign had elicited a good response from the people.Replying to a question about striking a balance between her married life and politics, Priyanka said she would complete 25 years of her married life next month and she did not face any issues in striking a balance as her children had grown up and her husband was cooperative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/like-nz-pm-ardern-grandma-indira-my-inspiration-priyanka-101641664078818.html
08-01-2022||Lucknow||Alld HC junks PIL against ECI order reserving Cong, BJP’s poll symbols||The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court has dismissed a public interest litigation (PIL) petition challenging the Election Commission of India’s (ECI) September 1989 orders reserving symbols of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress and according them the status of national parties. In one of two orders passed on September 19, 1989, the ECI had accorded the status of a national party to the BJP and reserved “Lotus” symbol for it. Similarly on September 23, 1989, the poll panel passed another order granting the status of a national party to the Congress and reserving “Hand” symbol for it. Petitioner Sheshmani Nath Tripathi, who is a member of the Samajwadi Party, had contended that the Election Commission of India lacked the authority to issue such an order under the Representation of the People Act, 1951.A division bench of Justice DK Upadhyay and Justice Saroj Yadav on January 5 said: “Thus, so far as recognition of political parties as a national party or a state party is concerned, the Allotment Order, 1968 contains provisions empowering the Election Commission to do so.” “The writ petition also, in our considered opinion, suffers from non-joinder of necessary parties,” the court said. “In this regard, it is noticeable that though it has been prayed in the writ petition that paragraph 3 of the letters of recognition dated 19th September, 1989 and 23rd September, 1989 may be quashed and struck down, however, the political parties, which are likely to be affected in case the prayer made in this petition is granted, have not been impleaded as respondents,” the court observed. The court examined provisions of the Representation of People Act, 1951 and Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) order. The court further observed: “The petitioner has also submitted that in absence of any statutory powers vested in the Election Commission of India in the field covered by the Act, the power to recognize a political party and to reserve the election symbol could not have been exercised by the Election Commission.”“The said submission is completely misconceived and is untenable. The recognition of a political party as a National Party or a State Party and reservation of election symbol are the functions which are exercised by the Election Commission under the provisions of Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968, as amended from time to time,” the court said. “Thus, the argument of the petitioner that the Election Commission does not have any authority to recognize a political party or to reserve an election symbol also fails,” the court observed. “For the discussions made and reasons given above we find that the writ petition is highly misconceived which is hereby dismissed,” it said.

08-01-2022||Lucknow||Custodial death cases must be viewed with greatest sensitivity and concern: HC||Expressing concern over delay in submission of judicial enquiry report in a 2020 custodial death case, the Allahabad High Court said where there is allegation of death in police custody, the judicial enquiry cannot be allowed to drag for long, as “these are instances which have to be viewed with greatest sensitivity and concern”. Hearing a writ petition filed by one Suresh Devi and Ghurmal, a division bench comprising Justice Ashwani Kumar Mishra and Justice Deepak Verma directed the registry of Allahabad High Court to enquire from the district judge, Bulandshahr as to when the enquiry report has been submitted in the custodial death of one Somdutt alias Sonu Bairagi.“In the event, such a report is not submitted, the explanation of the judicial officer concerned in that regard shall be placed before the court by the next date fixed as a period of more than one year has expired,” the court added.While directing to list this case on January 27, 2022 for the next hearing, the court in its order dated January 7 further directed that in the event, such enquiry has not been concluded so far, the same shall be concluded most expeditiously by following the procedure in law. In the petition filed by Suresh Devi and her husband Ghurmal of Bulandshahr, it has been alleged that their son - Somdutt died in police custody on the intervening night of December 11/12, 2020 after he was arrested by Khurja Nagar police of Bulandshahar in a case under section 366 (kidnapping) of Indian Penal Code (IPC).In the petition, they have requested the court to direct the authorities concerned to protect the life and liberty of the petitioners as their son was subjected to torture and murder as he had contracted inter-caste marriage out of his own free will. The petitioners’ counsel Jamil Ahamad Azmi and Ashutosh Kumar Tiwari drew the attention of the court to the provision contained in section 176 (1)A of criminal procedure code (CrPC), which contemplates holding of a judicial enquiry where death is caused in police custody. It was also stated that no post mortem was carried out and instead the policemen cremated the body contrary to all settled norms. The additional government advocate (AGA), representing the state government, did not dispute the fact that a judicial enquiry was initiated with a request made to district judge on January 6, 2021 and stated that a report was still awaited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/custodial-death-cases-must-be-viewed-with-greatest-sensitivity-and-concern-hc-101641663058811.html
08-01-2022||Lucknow||UP CM Yogi announces advanced paediatric centre at SGPGI||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday announced that a ₹500 crore advanced paediatric centre will be developed at Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS), Lucknow.He also said the government will ensure that the project comes up in a time-bound manner. “It will be a centre for children with all the components existing as departments under one roof. It would provide holistic care to children,” said a press release issued by SGPGIMS soon after the CM’s announcement.Yogi said this while dedicating to people the newly constructed emergency medicine and renal transplant centre at the medical institute. The centre houses a host of advanced facilities under one roof. The inauguration ceremony took place in CV Raman auditorium at the SGPGIMS. He said kidney patients in Uttar Pradesh will now get best treatment facilities. “The day is not far when SGPGI will become the hub of organ transplant. Not only will the kidney transplant project expand here but liver transplant will also get a boost,” Yogi said.“When the foundation stone of the emergency medicine and kidney transplant centre was laid three years ago, we were not sure if it could be established on time. But despite Covid, it has been inaugurated today with the help of the central government and that too within time,” the CM said.Various projects worth more than ₹600 crores have been inaugurated at SGPGI, a CM tweet reads. It says with this people of UP will be able to get better medical facilities. His tweet says, “With a view to providing best facilities to kidney patients in UP, the emergency medicine and kidney transplant centre has been inaugurated at SGPGI today.”“We will not let any challenges to become a breaker,” Yogi said while lauding the efforts put up by the team of SGPGI for excellent management of Covid 19 pandemic without being affected by the criticism which was also a part of this difficult journey.Stating that the SGPGI played an important role during the first and second wave of Covid, the CM said in fight against the pandemic, medical institutions like SGPGI worked relentlessly. Yogi also shared his intensive and extensive planning and research work done to eradicate Japanese Encephalitis (JE) from eastern UP, particularly Kushinagar district, which could only be done with the interdepartmental coordination.“Today, when someone asks me what is the biggest achievement of our government, I say that earlier thousands of children would lose their lives due to encephalitis. But after coming to power in 2017, we have been able to control encephalitis to a great extent. Our government has given a new life to eastern Uttar Pradesh,” the CM said.The kidney transplant centre will enhance the capacity of dialysis to 110 dialysis stations from the existing 55 stations, clinical beds from 62 to 97, critical care nephrology from 8 to 11 beds and there will be two operation theatres dedicated for intervention nephrology to cater to estimated 50,000 patients of end-stage kidney disease requiring dialysis and kidney transplant in UP.Referring to the achievements of the government in the medical field, the CM said before 2017 the medical infrastructure in Uttar Pradesh was like a challenge. The state had 12 medical colleges. “Today we are moving towards setting up medical colleges in every district,” he added.The new emergency medicine centre is built to cater to over one lakh emergency patients per year. This is a seven-fold increase in the number emergency beds from the current 30 to 210 beds. It will have multiple (over 20) emergency care segments, including a dedicated radiology wing with MRI/CT/ultrasound/DSA/x-rays.Speaking on the occasion, SGPGIMS director prof Radha Krishan Dhiman presented a detailed report of the facilities of the centre. He also expressed his gratitude to the state government for extending its full support in completing the centre within record time.Union minister of state for housing and urban affairs Kaushal Kishore; UP minister, medical education, Suresh Kumar Khanna; UP minister of state, medical education, Sandeep Kumar Singh; chief secretary, Uttar Pradesh, Durga Shankar Mishra and principal secretary, medical education, UP, Alok Kumar were also present on the occasion.
08-01-2022||Lucknow||Hindu organisations demand arrest of Jawed Habib under NSA for spitting on woman’s hair||Various Hindu organisations have demanded immediate arrest of celebrity hairstylist Jawed Habib under National Security Act (NSA) amid a major uproar over a viral video wherein he is seen spitting on a Baghpat-based beautician’s hair during a workshop in Muzaffarnagar on Wednesday.A case has already been lodged against Habib on the complaint of the beautician with Mansoorpur police of Muzaffarnagar on Thursday under sections 355 and 504 of IPC and Epidemic Act. “The CCTV footage of the hotel, where the event was organised, is being scanned and hotel staff are being quizzed about the incident. Appropriate action will be taken after collecting evidences,” SHO of Mansoorpur police station Sunil Kumar Saini had said.Meanwhile, Hindu organisations held a meeting at the house of Bhawani Sena’s district general secretary Santosh Devi at Nawala village in Muzaffarnagar on Friday evening and demanded immediate arrest of Habib under NSA for insulting women. Shiv Sena district president Bittu Sikhera and Sarv Shakti Sena district incharge Vinay Bindal and their supporters also attended the meet. They also declared that Habib will not be allowed to enter the district. Bhairav Sena’s district incharge Ashok Sharma has pledged to remove all posters of Habib from saloons in the district. The controversy erupted on Thursday after the video of Habib spitting on the woman’s hair started making rounds on social media, drawing a major backlash from people and caught the attention of the National Commission for Women (NCW) that has sent a notice to Habib and summoned him on January 11.In the video, the hairstylist can be seen using his saliva while parting the woman’s hair and saying that in case of a dearth of water, one can use saliva. The woman, who runs her beauty parlor in Baraut town of Baghpat told mediapersons that the act had destroyed her career.Meanwhile, Habib took to Instagram to apologise for the incident and said his act was an attempt to make the workshop “humorous”. “What can I say? If you are truly hurt, I apologise from the bottom of my heart. Please forgive me, I’m sorry,” he added in the video statement. However, the beautician dismissed the apology as “drama” and said she will fight for justice till her last breath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/hindu-organisations-demand-arrest-of-jawed-habib-under-nsa-for-spitting-on-woman-s-hair-101641662698611.html

He is the younger brother of Congress Rajya Sabha member Partap Singh Bajwa.Sources in the security establishment told PTI that Fatehjang Bajwa has been provided the Y+ security cover for his movement in poll-bound Punjab.The Union home ministry sanctioned the deployment on the basis of a recommendation sent by central intelligence agencies that underlined potential security threats to him, they said.The task has been given to the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and as part of this security categorisation, Bajwa will have a team of 3-4 armed commandos every time he travels in the state.Recently, the Union government had granted a higher Z-category VIP security cover to Punjab politician Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi who had joined the BJP in December.The security cover of Manjinder Singh Sirsa, former Shiromani Akali Dal leader and Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee chief, was also upgraded by the Centre from the lower category of Y to Z.

08-01-2022||Mumbai||Covid numbers show marginal dip, experts think curve may be reaching a plateau||Mumbai Mumbai’s Covid numbers showed a marginal dip on Saturday, even though the overall case tally stayed above the 20,000-mark for the second consecutive day. In the last 24 hours, the city saw 20,318 fresh infections taking the overall case tally to 8,95,098 and five deaths, taking the overall toll to 16,399.A total of 71,019 tests were conducted in Mumbai on Saturday. This was for the third consecutive day that nearly 70,000 tests have been conducted. The daily positivity rate stood at 28.6 per cent.With the new cases hovering around 20,000, doctors are wondering whether the third wave is reaching a plateau, which means that the daily cases will remain constant for some time, before a gradual decline. However, experts said that they need to wait for one more week to reach a concrete conclusion. “For every 65,000 to70,000 tests that are being done, about 15,000 to 20,000 fresh cases are being reported now. So, clearly, there is not much difference in the ratio between the tests conducted and positive cases. It’s possible that if more tests are done, then more cases could be reported,” Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of both the National and Maharashtra Covid task force.On Friday, municipal commissioner, Iqbal Singh Chahal had cited the example of Omicron spread in South Africa and said that the infection rate started to recede after the fifth week, and added that Mumbai is in the third week.However, Pandit on Saturday said it will be unfair to compare the scenario of Mumbai with that of South Africa. “The vaccination rate and seropositivity rate in Mumbai is much higher than South Africa. So scientifically, we are in a much better situation. It’s safe to say that we are inching towards the saturation point and the graph is slowly moving towards a plateau. But we need to wait for some more time,” he added. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state Covid task force, said that there are many people in the city who have taken self Covid tests, and these numbers are not getting added to the final tally. “It is still premature to say that whether we have reached the plateau or peak. We need to see one more week as the cases can go up by next week as well. However, the key takeaway is that the severity of the fresh cases is lower now,” said Joshi.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner and in charge of public health in Mumbai, however, said that the next one week will be important to decide the further course of action.“In many cases, we can see that patients are developing symptoms two days after testing positive and require immediate medical attention. Keeping this factor in mind, it is safe to assume that hospital admissions may go up next week and we are prepared for that,” said Kakani. He further added that if the positivity rate goes up, then certain curbs may be modified. Out of the fresh infections reported on Friday, 16,661 (82%) patients were asymptomatic and the BMC data also showed that nearly 1,257 patients were hospitalised in the past 24 hours and the overall hospital bed occupancy level stood at 21 per cent on Saturday.According to data available on the civic dashboard, as of January 8, nearly 42 per cent of the beds in the private hospitals were full. Senior doctors and medical experts also said that the demand for hospital beds is higher in three private hospitals, which includes Bombay Hospital, Breach Candy and Lilavati Hospital.Dr Gautam Bhansali, who is a doctor of Bombay Hospital and the coordinator of all the private hospitals for Covid management in the city, said that the occupancy rate of the Covid beds in these three hospitals is around 60 per cent.“The hospital admissions that are happening now are mostly senior citizens who are coming for the antibody cocktail and these are not long-term admissions as they are getting discharged within 24-48 hours after their treatment,” said Dr V Ravishankar from Lilavati Hospital.Mayor confirms no weekend curfewMumbai mayor, Kishori Pednekar on Saturday said that weekend lockdown will not be imposed in the city and urged Mumbaikars to remain cautious and not panic.“Even though 20,000 plus cases are being reported in the city regularly, more than 17,000 patients are asymptomatic and doesn’t need medical treatment. Out of the total available beds in Mumbai, more than 80 per cent are still unoccupied and the admission demand for the oxygen beds is also very marginal,” said the mayor on Saturday.“We can see the transmission rate this time is higher and the positivity rate is also four times than what we have seen last year, but I would urge Mumbaikars to not panic. The situation is well under control and there’s nothing to worry as the symptoms of the latest variant is very mild and our medical infrastructure is well equipped to handle the cases. Instead, citizens must follow all the Covid appropriate behaviour and must not step out without their mask,” said the mayor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-numbers-show-marginal-dip-experts-think-curve-may-be-reaching-a-plateau-101641661018263.html

08-01-2022||Patna||Patna accounts for 43% new Covid cases in Bihar||Patna accounted for 1,956 new Covid-19 cases in Bihar, which was over 43% of the total 4,526 cases reported in the state on Saturday, and the state capital’s test positivity rate jumped from 12.26% to over 20% in the last three days, said officials in the state health department. The state also reported the first case of Omicron on the national portal, when a resident of Chapra tested positive for Covid-19. The man returned from London on December 15 last year. He tested positive at Delhi airport and spent 14 days under institutional quarantine in New Delhi. He was discharged after testing negative on December 29. His sample tested positive for Omicron variant on the whole genomic sequencing test. The person has fully recovered now, said officials. “The state’s test positivity rate has gone up from 0.29% to 2.15% in the last seven days, and that of Patna was 18.71% yesterday, which is an indication of the high transmissibility rate of the virus. Though there is nothing to be scared, there is need to exercise utmost caution,” Pratyaya Amrit, additional chief secretary (health) said at a virtual press conference on Saturday. The test positivity rate of Muzaffarpur, which reported 263 new cases on Saturday, Nalanda (212 cases), Begusarai (276), Gaya (284), Saharsa (37) and Arwal (45 new cases) was higher than Bihar’s average positivity of 2.15% said Amrit. As many as 300 blocks of Bihar against 79 on January 1 were now affected by Covid, he added. He said the government was fully prepared and had 25,794 beds for management of Covid-19 in the state of which only 0.9% were occupied, which was a pointer to the fact that home isolation was the new norm. Over 8,253 Covid-positive people were under home isolation, as per government’s Covid-19 bulletin on Friday. Meanwhile, health minister Mangal Pandey reviewed the preparedness for Covid management at AIIMS-Patna on Saturday. Executive director of the State Health Society, Sanjay Kumar Singh, who accompanied Pandey to AIIMS, said half of the 38 Covid-19 patients admitted there were unvaccinated. This, he said, was a pointer to the important role of vaccination in the fight against the pandemic. Around 96% of the Bihar’s eligible target population had taken the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine and 89% of those eligible for the second dose had taken the jab so far, added Singh. He said 96 doctors and nurses from the state would be trained under the National Oxygen Stewardship Programme of the Central government for management of moderate to critical cases of Covid-19. Meanwhile, four doctors of the Patna Medical College Hospital also tested positive for Covid-19. Already, over 42 doctors at AIIMS and around 180 at the Nalanda Medical College Hospital have been infected by the virus. 
08-01-2022||Patna||CAG report: Gap in Bihar govt books swells to ₹80K cr in 10 years||Since 2010-11, the Bihar government has not submitted utilisation certificates (UCs) for nearly ₹80,000 crore of funds despite finance department’s 1975 executive order prescribing a deadline of one year from the date of sanction of fund for submission of UCs, which was extended to 18 months by a 2011 executive order, says the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) for the financial year ending March 31, 2020, which was tabled in the state Assembly in December last year.Of the total outstanding UCs, departments of panchayati raj, education, social welfare and rural development department account for 67.12%. This is so when data regarding the number of pending UCs/ misreporting, keeping funds in fixed deposit accounts or any other type of account with lesser returns could not be ascertained due to non-availability, says the report. “Though such instances of non-submission of UCs feature in the CAG reports regularly, there has been no improvement, while in many cases the same recipients continue to get further grants from the same departments despite pending UCs. High pendency of UCs is fraught with the risk of misappropriation of funds,” says the report.An audit officer said that the fact that UCs remaining pending for so long means there are no chances of their submission, unless bills are fudged. “Of the total outstanding UCs, ₹7,516 crore (9.43%) are for the 2010-11 to 2013-14 period, while the rest over 90% outstanding UCs are for the period since 2014-15, which covers almost the previous term of the government. There is no way old claims can be verified,” he said, citing the report.Finance department principal secretary S Siddharth said the government was reviewing the matter on a monthly basis to reduce backlog and had succeeded to a great extent. “It is a matter of interpretation. Imagine the state annual budget is of over ₹2 lakh crore rupees. It means the spending in the last 10 years on an average may have touched at least ₹15 lakh crore. It means the non-submission of UCs account for only 5.53%. And it is an ongoing process. Every year, some new entry is added and some subtracted after submission. Besides, the panchayati raj institutions and urban local bodies are the biggest source for delayed submission of UCs. We constantly work on it,” he said.State’s panchayati raj minister Samrat Choudhary said the department was working to put in place a mechanism for regular monitoring of spending and auditing of funds spent. “The problem is there and that is why I decided to create a new system as soon as I assumed charge of the department barely 10 months ago,” he said.Similarly, the CAG report has pointed out how a total of 20,642 abstract contingent (AC) bills amounting to ₹9155.44 crore had not been adjusted till March 2019-20, while 1,383 AC bills amounting to ₹644.13 crore had been drawn in March 2020 alone. Abstract contingent (AC) bills are charges on items of expenditure by a state government, for which final classification and supporting vouchers is not available at the time of drawl. “Substantial expenditure against AC bills in March 2020 indicates that the drawls was primarily to exhaust the budget provisions and reveals inadequate budgetary control. The fact that 5,689 AC bills amounting to ₹4231.06 crore were drawn under various capital heads for creation of capital assets indicate lack of objective planning and poor public expenditure management. The maximum pending AC bills ( ₹3390 crore) are under the head of relief on account of natural calamities,” says the report. The report says that Bihar Treasury Code, 2011, provides that a certificate shall be furnished by the drawing and disbursing officer (DDO) to the effect that the money withdrawn on the contingent bills shall be spent within the same financial year and the unspent amount shall be remitted to the treasury before March 31 of that year. “The code also specifies that the detailed contingent (DC) bills shall be submitted within six months and no abstract bill shall be cashed after that period unless the detailed bill has been submitted,” says the report, highlighting how unadjusted amount has been growing since 2016-17, when it was just ₹2,375 crore.The issue of AC-DC bills from 2003-04 to 2018-19 had snowballed into a major controversy a few years ago and had landed in the Patna High Court, which sought latest status from the departments concerned.“The pendency was big, but now it has been almost controlled and things will further improve,” he said.The finance department has recently also written to all the department heads, commissioners, district magistrates, treasury and drawing & disbursing officers to ensure timely submission of all contingency bills to avoid the usual last-minute rush at the end of the fiscal.“It has been observed that there is usually a rush of contingency bills at the end of the fiscal, which causes undue stress on the software system and leads to difficulty in their disposal.

08-01-2022||Patna||Bihar allies BJP, VIP in shadow boxing ahead of UP polls||The Mukesh Sahni-led Vikashsheel Insaan Party’s plan to contest the upcoming Uttar Pradesh polls has not gone down well with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has reportedly started talking tough with its ally in Bihar, people familiar with the matter said.In 2020, the VIP, which fought Bihar assembly polls as part of the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), had won four seats, of which Bochacha fell vacant in December last year with the death of Musafir Paswan, the party MLA. The by-poll for the seat is due in coming months. Sahni, 40, himself lost his maiden election, but was made fisheries and animal husbandry minister in the Nitish Kumar government and later elected to the Legislative Council in a by-election in January 2021 for a truncated term of less than two years, which ends in July this year.Reliable sources in the NDA said Sahni was recently told by BJP brass he should not expect support for a second term in Legislative Council if he decides to press ahead with plans to contest UP polls. It was also conveyed to him that BJP may stake claim on Bochacha seat if he doesn’t fall in line. Sahni, a former set designer in Bollywood, though, said he had not received any such message. “I am firm on contesting UP polls. If BJP does not give me a second term as MLC, it would be a betrayal of its own promise made to me when I had come to NDA before 2020 assembly polls. I am not bothered at all,” he told HT on phone.State BJP president Sanjay Jaiswal said, “We have cordial relations with all our allies. I have no further comment to make.” He said such matters are dealt by the central leadership.Sahni, who calls himself “son of Mallah (fishermen community), has been trying to rally Nishads and Mallahs in eastern UP on the demand for including the community in scheduled castes instead of OBCs. BJP fears this could damage its prospects in UP polls, for which it has already made a tie-up with NISAD party chief Sanjay Nishad.“Our party is no mood to give him any seat in UP. Of course, there is a looming threat that Sahni could upset poll arithmetic of many parties, including of BJP, if he fields candidates in UP,” said a senior BJP leader, wishing not to be named. He said the BJP leadership is also not intimidated with Sahni’s recent statements hinting at leaving NDA and align with RJD-led opposition alliance since his three MLAs were not in mood to leave go along.Sahini, however, sounded defiant. “ Even if my own people back-stab me, I have no problem. The 2024 parliamentary election is not too far. Many MLAs are eager to contest. Switching sides will hurt them. Besides, one should remember LJP too suffered a split, but it has not affected Jamui MP Chirag Paswan or his stature,” he said.The VIP chief, however, said he was ready to support BJP in UP polls if it makes a commitment in coming days that it would give reservation to Nishads in scheduled caste class.“In Bengal, Nishads are categorised as SCs. But in Bihar, Jharkhand and UP, they are in OBCs. It just requires a modification in a notification to include them in scheduled caste class in UP,” he said, adding that he was getting offers from some big parties in UP to strike an alliance.“I have not made up my mind so far. But I have plans to field candidates in 165 seats and that could damage the BJP,” he said. 
08-01-2022||Patna||JD(U) rejects RJD offer as ‘hypothetical’||The ruling Janata Dal (United) on Saturday dismissed opposition RJD’s offer of support should it go ahead with its demand for special status for Bihar and a caste census despite ally BJP’s apparent indifference.“RJD’s offer is hypothetical. There is no cause of friction in the NDA. For RJD, special status demand is a political issue, while for us it is a commitment. They want to show it is their demand, while the fact is they thwarted it. Had the RJD put pressure on the then Manmohan Singh government, it would have got it for the state before the NDA came to power, but they only played politics with it, despite being part of the UPA,” said JD(U) national president Rajiv Ranjan alias Lalan Singh.Former JD(U) president Vashishtha Narayan Singh also echoed similar sentiments. “There is no need to react to what a senior RJD leader has said. Where is the question of government falling? The NDA is one and the government is stable. Caste census is an issue, but Nitish Kumar has already cleared his stand in it. That also remains the party stand,” he said.

The NOC was cancelled by the Ministry of Defence on September 29, 2020.“Both the MP’s Girish Bapat and Supriya Sule assured that they will be meeting Rajnath Singh in coming days to discuss the issues regarding Pune airport.

Now, we will write to senior police officers and request to solve the case at the earliest.”Kandul said, “The sound system is big and a single person cannot handle it. And it can be replaced only through a technician.”PMC officials said that they had installed a branded company’s sound system in the auditorium but it was replaced during the lockdown period when the auditoriums were closed.PMC, meanwhile, has filed another police case related to bogus bills worth Rs1 crore. The works were shown in the five crematoriums and bills were submitted for the same.PMC officials blamed that their signatures are forged. Kandul said, “Police conducted an enquiry and arrested the contractor for submitting bogus bills but in sound system stolen case, there is no progress.

As a result, around 1,200 litre per minute was discharged downstream.Due to the breach, five villages namely Zanzorli, Bandate, Dondhalpada, Patharipada and Navinpada, were to be evacuated. An NDRF team from Andheri, comprising of 47 jawans with Flood Water Rescue (FWR) arrived in Kelwe to evacuate the villagers if the need arises, said Ashish Kumar, deputy commandant, NDRF who reached the spot. “We were called by the Palghar collector Dr Manik Gursal and if needed, we will call motorboats and other equipment in case we need to evacuate the villagers to a higher place to avoid flooding,” said the official.The dam will be repaired by placing sand and other materials where the breach has been found to control the seepage, informed Prabhakar Giri, deputy engineer, Irrigation Department Palghar. He added that the dam supplied water to 17 gram panchayats.Fortunately, the monsoon season is over or else there were chances of a dam burst due to the leakage, said Giri.“We first noticed a minor leakage in the dam during the pre-monsoon period and the leakage increased during the monsoon in July,” said Giri. he added that they informed the Dam Safety Organisation (DSO) Nashik of the Irrigation Department and the diver went underwater to videograph the situation. They said they wanted the monsoon to be over to start the repairs of the dam, but noticed the breach on Saturday. “We will cover the breach with around 300-400 dumpers full of sand and other materials. Right now, there is no need for evacuation,” Giri said. Around 100 policemen and 30 jawans from the Riot Control Police are at the spot and villagers are on alert.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/breach-in-40-year-old-dam-in-palghar-ndrf-set-to-evacuate-5-villages-101641653995816.html

People will question you, but we should prepare for it. There might be some people who will differ from us, but it is the beauty of democracy and we must accept it,” said Dhindsa, addressing his supporters at a local restaurant.Dhindsa junior termed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s security breach as unfortunate, and advised the Punjab government to avoid any confrontation with the Centre for the development of Punjab, amid the slugfest between the state and the Centre over the Ferozepur incident.“The incident of the PM’s security breach was unfortunate. It should have not happened because it will harm Punjab’s interests. The PM was going to inaugurate development projects and he might have announced a package for the state. These announcements might have reduced farmers’ anger,” he added. The former state finance minister also claimed that the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had been making false promises of freebies, which could not be fulfilled.“They need to think on the lines of what Punjab requires? How can we stop the brain-drain? As of now, Punjab can provide 5 lakh jobs, but we need to make our youth eligible,” he claimed from the dais.Dhindsa junior added that his father and founder of the SAD (S) Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa had submitted a charter of 12 demands, including release of Sikh prisoners, fresh elections of Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) and making Punjabi language the second language in neighbouring states, to the PM and home minister’s office earlier. “We will fight for these demands,” he added.
08-01-2022||Mumbai||Central Railway cancels AC train services on trans-harbour line||Due to the poor response received from commuters, the Central Railway (CR) has cancelled the air-conditioned train services on the trans-harbour line from last Monday.The trans-harbour line, which connects Navi Mumbai with Thane, has two divisions. While the first one connects Vashi station with Thane, the second connects Nerul and Panvel stations with Thane. The AC trains on both the divisions were introduced in the first week of November. However, due to exorbitant fares, the commuters hardly boarded those trains. A senior railway officer from Navi Mumbai said, “The authorities had provided only one AC rake on this line and that would make around twelve trips between Thane and Vashi, and between Thane and Nerul/Panvel on a day. There was, however, a huge difference between the fares of AC and non-AC trains. For example, the price of a non-AC ticket for travelling from Vashi to Thane is just ₹15 while the price of an AC ticket for the same distance is ₹145. Secondly, the gap between every two AC trains was big. So, the commuters did not want to take the risk of waiting on platforms even after purchasing an expensive ticket.”The officer informed that AC rake on trans-harbour line is now being run between Panvel and CSMT, and between CSMT and Goregaon. The CR has provided a non-AC rake as a replacement for the AC rake on the trans-harbour line.“The response received by the AC trains was so poor that at times the number of railway staff in a train (including the GRP officials) used to be more than the number of commuters travelling in it. So, CR had no other option but to cancel the services,” he added.Dattaram Patil, a 40-year-old resident of Vashi, said, “I once travelled from Vashi to Thane station in an AC train in December. The climate was very pleasant then and hence the AC coach hardly served any purpose. So I did not see any reason for shelling out an extra ₹130 to travel in an AC train and decided not to do it again.”

On the drastic dip in the positivity rate, he said, “Three state health authorities and our expert team are working to ascertain the reason. For now, we changed the lab that conducted tests on Thursday and Friday.”The new lab that a Dr Tejinder Bhasin heads conducted Covid-19 test of 192 passengers who landed at the airport in an Air India flight from Birmingham about 10am on Saturday. This lab had been operating at the airport for six months, being replaced by SpiceHealth in the last week of December. Punjab’s health authorities are also probing the testing mechanism of SpiceHealth. On Thursday, 125 of 179 (70%) passengers had tested positive upon landing at the airport from Italy; on Friday, 172 of 285 (60%) flyers, again from Italy, were found positive. A state health department official said, “We have asked airport authorities to submit their probe report into the testing mechanism of SpiceHealth lab. There might be a technical glitch with their machines, or a chemical that the lab was using could be the issue.”RETESTING ON FOR NEARLY 300Amritsar assistant civil surgeon Dr Amarjit Singh said, “Those who tested positive on Thursday and Friday are being retested by respective district administrations. Of 125 who tested positive on Thursday, 11 were from Amritsar district; of 172 tested positive on Friday, 20 were from Amritsar. We are conducting re-testing of these 31 passengers by approaching them at their homes; four have tested negative as of now.”A 42-year-old man from Amritsar, who returned from Italy with his son, was among 125 passengers tested positive on Thursday. Talking to HT over phone, his nephew said, “We conducted a rapid test and a RT-PCR test of our uncle from a private lab in Amritsar; the result of both was negative. This is contrary to the report of the Amritsar airport lab. Before boarding the flight, my uncle and his son had undergone the RT-PCR test in Italy, which was valid for 72 hours. How could he be found positive merely eight hours after boarding the plane? This is a big scam that needs investigation.” Another 31-year-old passenger and his wife, both declared positive at the airport, have tested negative after being retested from a private lab in Amritsar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-positivity-rate-at-amritsar-airport-dips-5-times-after-lab-change-101641651956152.html

The people who test positive in the society will have to quarantine themselves for seven days after the test results are positive. The close contacts of those infected also should be tested immediately if they show any symptoms. If they do not show symptoms, they will still be tested on the fifth and seventh days from which their contact has tested positive.”If the family that has tested positive has a caregiver, he/she shall be fully vaccinated and in constant contact with the family and the society members. The society committee shall co-operate with the flats with positive cases and ensure that they get all the essentials delivered so that they do not have to go out.The biomedical waste from the flats that have positive patients would be collected separately in yellow garbage bags.The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation’s (NMMC) commissioner issued notification to housing societies stating that if a particular society has less than 25 Covid positive cases, only the floors with cases would be sealed henceforth.“The building or the society will get sealed if the cases are above 25. If only a particular wing of the society has cases above 25, only the wing will be sealed and not the whole society. In such cases house helps and security guards who are fully vaccinated can enter the society except for the sealed floor or building,” NMMC commissioner, Abhijit Bangar, said.Also, patients with comorbidities above the age of 60 and pregnant women would be admitted to Covid centres or hospitals for treatment. Due to the large number of asymptomatic positive patients at present, emphasis is being placed on home isolation. The commissioner also directed the health department and the departmental offices to implement the containment zone rules for a period of seven days. The Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) chief, Vijay Suryavanshi, gave directives that the weekly markets would not be allowed in KDMC limits. Retailers would not be allowed in APMC market while wholesalers and workers in the market should be fully vaccinated.“Vehicles arriving into the market should abide by norms or else we will have to only allow 50% of vehicles to the market in coming days,” added Suryavanshi.Vendors at Lakshmi Market will be only allowed on alternate days.

He was fully vaccinated. The Covid death toll of Mumbai police has now reached 124.Senior Mumbai police officials have said that in view of the surge in cases, the city police would reopen its Covid Care Centres (CCC) for its police personnel. Sub-inspector Rau Ramu Redkar, a resident of Tilaknagar in Chembur, complained of back pain on Friday morning while he was on duty.Following this, he was taken to Shatabdi Hospital, Chembur, where after examination, the doctor advised him home rest. In the evening at 4 pm, he again complained of pain, following which his son first rushed him to a private hospital in Chembur and then to the MGM Hospital in Navi Mumbai. “He was kept in ICU. During the treatment, he breathed his last at 9.30 pm on Friday. Redkar tested positive for Covid-19,” said Savlaram Agawane, senior inspector of Deonar police station. Kolhapur native Redkar joined the police service as a constable in March 1987 and was promoted as sub-inspector in November 2020. He was posted as the preventive officer at Deonar police station. Redkar was survived by his wife Surekha, son Shirish and daughter Shweta.

08-01-2022||Mumbai||Man arrested for threatening to kill BJP leader Ashish Shelar||Mumbai The Mumbai crime branch has apprehended a 48-year-old Mahim resident for allegedly threatening BJP leader Ashish Shelar to death. The accused claims his mother has an ancestral land in Bandra reclamation, which was taken over by the MHADA. Suspecting Shelar was eying this land, the accused gave him death threats over a phone call.He would be handed over to the Bandra police station. Shelar on Saturday wrote to home minister Dilip Walse Patil and said that for the past few days he has been receiving threat calls. On Saturday, his representative lodged a complaint at the Bandra police station. Crime branch unit-9 officials launched a parallel probe and analysed the phone call details and on Saturday nabbed the suspect, Osama Shamshed Khan, a resident of Mahim Causeway. A police officer said that Khan’s mother’s land in Bandra reclamation was disputed and MHADA has deputed a guard on the said property. In November last year, Khan and his son had allegedly assaulted the guard over the possession of the land. Bandra police had then registered an FIR on the guard’s complaint. Khan managed to secure an anticipatory bail in the case while his son was arrested and is still in jail on charges of attempt to murder. Khan suspected Shelar could be behind the disputed land and gave death threats to him over phone using his own phone. However, reasons for his suspicion are still unverified, said an officer. DCP detection-1 Neelotpal said that Khan would be handed over to the Bandra police station for further investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/man-arrested-for-threatening-to-kill-bjp-leader-ashish-shelar-101641649195857.html

08-01-2022||Pune||Startup Mantra: Businesses get open-access to big data||Pune-based start-up Finarkein Analytics has built a privacy-first, data analytics platform working seamlessly with various open digital ecosystems (ODEs), to help small and large businesses access open data standards (also known as digital public goods).Finarkein’s holistic data ecosystem will provide a unified solution across data collection, transformation, modelling and analytics with a collaborative approach. Founded by Nikhil Kurhe and Dheeraj Kumar, volunteer architects helping build the account aggregator (AA) framework, Finarkein’s products are designed to solve massive problems faced by India and at a global level due to lack of “access to data”.In the beginning…Finarkein is a five-co-founder team with Kurhe (27) as CEO and youngest team member, Kumar as CTO and Aakash Agarwal as COO. Although two cofounders are yet to join the start-up, officially, they all have a very common computer science and data engineering background and complementary skill sets. Kurhe is a student of Pune Institute of Computer Technology (PICT – 2016), Kumar is from Sinhgad College of Engineering Pune (SCOE - 2013) and Agarwal from Vishwakarma Institute of Technology (VIT - 2013). They all met while working at a business intelligence company as a core data science and data engineering team.Says Kurhe, “We were solving problems in a different domain. The amount of scale we were working on in the big-data field there was fairly massive. That’s when we realised that we have a very unique skill set, but the problems that we are working on are very niche and are not making any impact with the skillset we had. So, we started looking at financial services’ sector initially, because we were struggling to manage our own finances and we wanted to automate our money management. That led us to discover the ‘account aggregator’ framework and Reserve Bank of India’s NBFC master circular in 2016. We started working afterhours on a part-time basis, trying to build and understand what this ecosystem is. We also reached out to volunteers and architects who were actually building these ecosystems.”“While Finarkein as a company was incorporated in October 2019, the code for one of our flagship products, Flux – a no-code low-code platform – ranges back to 2017 while we were working part-time. My other cofounders were able to work two jobs, but I could not. So, I quit my job in August 2019 and started building out the technology front-end. Since I was the face, my role transcended more into business development, product roadmap and ecosystem evangelism,” adds Kurhe.Leveraging dataDerived from the Greek root word “Arkein”, meaning self-reliance, independence – Finarkein means data and financial independence by the ability to extract information and value to solve massive problems. According to Kurhe and his team’s assessment, India as a nation is probably five to ten years ahead of others in terms of open data standards. He says, “There are many digital public goods in the works like the Ayushman Bharat Health Mission, DigiLocker, AgriStack. Everyone is trying to access these systems, get data, extract relevant information, go into a specific vertical and solve a problem statement. It is still very difficult to leverage that data. There are many inefficiencies in the current system. Most of these steps are repetitive and the unique bit is only where a business applies some business logic. It’s here that we are automating about 75 per cent work done by all businesses.”“When you have inefficiencies and data silos, then to solve challenges like financial inclusion, better healthcare access, climate change, you need to first make them solvable from the unit economics perspective. That’s when we felt that Open Data standards coming up in India and globally are a good equaliser. It levels the playing field for everyone to focus on the problems in the value chain,” Kurhe said.Enterprise-readyIndia is a data-rich nation with an added benefit of demographic dividend, believes Kurhe. He along with Kumar is actively pushing ode.dev, a community of builders and enablers working in and around the Open Digital Ecosystems. Says Kurhe, “We had participated and won the ‘Sahamati’ organised Account Aggregator hackathon in August 2020. We got a good feedback post-hackathon and we realised that what we are solving is a very tangible and real problem statement. Our core minimum viable product was ready. However, the customers we wanted to go after were looking for additional security features like enterprise grade security, audit logs, compliance, certifications. Getting from the MVP to enterprise-ready stage we spent another six months.”First customerKurhe and his team saw an opportunity with one of the insurers in February-March 2021. Finarkein was among the four start-ups selected by Max Life Insurance to engage under the second edition its flagship InsurTech accelerator programme - ‘Max Life Innovation Labs 2.0’.Kurhe said, “We were able to convince their leadership to explore this new problem statement of leveraging India’s Open Data Standards – both in the financial and health sector. That is how we got our first enterprise client and Max Life Insurance became the first insurer to join the ‘Account Aggregator ecosystem’ using Finarkein software. At the same time, we got into IIM Ahmedabad’s CIIE (Centre for Innovation Incubation and Entrepreneurship). We were a part of the third cohort of their financial inclusion lab.”Learning curveSays Kurhe, “We did not immediately ramp up as we didn’t have the experience of dealing with enterprises. As the anchor client we wanted to get some experience for the product and Max Life Insurance was willing to experiment and work on it. There were some very tough lessons learnt that is now allowing us to have a very improved turn-around time. From the first meeting to contract signing, we are able to close a deal in 70 to 75 days which is very good for the enterprise B2B sales. Going from 0 to first client was a long undertaking and from 1 to 5 clients happened in less than a month. We were able to build very strong network and now we aim to have 40 enterprise clients by end of 2022.”Open-banking applicationsKurhe explains one of the use cases of their product ‘Flux’ for any insurer to successfully financially underwrite a customer. “Usually when an end-customer uploads their payslips or other documents, there is scope for editing or tampering the document and thereby resulting in a fraud. Finarkein’s platform provides insurers a trusted execution environment in which their business logic like financial underwriting can run on the customer data and obtain desired output. Not only the data is coming in a very good machine-readable format to do analytics, it is coming encrypted and digitally signed directly from the bank. From insurers’ perspective, they are able to leverage a very reliable data to successfully financially underwrite the customer,” Kurhe said.Future plansSays Kurhe, “We are working on around seven more projects which will start paying off every six to eight months from Q3 2022. We are also raising a $1 million seed round and we have good investors like Sanjeev Bikhchandani-led Info Edge and others. At present we have about six employees and we are ramping up our hiring from engineering colleges. Soon, we will capture around 35 per cent market share of the financial services sector.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/startup-mantra-businesses-get-open-access-to-big-data-101641638634697.html
08-01-2022||Chandigarh||Cong, BJP joined hands to defeat AAP in Chandigarh mayoral poll: Raghav Chadha||Punjab Aam Aadmi Party unit co-incharge Raghav Chadha on Saturday alleged that BJP and the Congress came together to defeat the AAP in the mayoral elections on Saturday despite the party emerging as the single largest party in the municipal corporation House. Also read: BJP’s Sarabjit Kaur is the new Chandigarh mayorHe said that the mayor should have been from the AAP as it had the highest number of 14 councillors in the House. Sarabjit Kaur Dhillon of the BJP was declared winner after she polled 14 votes and the AAP candidate got 13 votes and one vote was declared invalid. The seven Congress councillors and the lone Shiromani Akali Dal member abstained from voting. “The BJP and the Congress came together. One councillor shifted to the BJP and then the MP was allowed to vote,” he said, adding that even the administration colluded with the BJP to ensure their candidate’s win. He questioned why Congress abstained from voting. When the result was declared, Chadha came to the MC office along with councillors and staged a protest, demanding a meeting with deputy commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh. Chadha’s claims, however, go against Section 38 of the Punjab MC Act, 1976, as extended to Chandigarh. According to it, an MP can vote in mayoral elections and if there are two candidates, the person who gets 50% and more votes of the total strength of the House, he or she is declared the winner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cong-bjp-joined-hands-to-defeat-aap-in-chandigarh-mayoral-poll-raghav-chadha-101641637374077.html

08-01-2022||Uttar||‘Can’t match BJP’s infra for digital campaign’: Akhilesh Yadav’s message to EC||Samajwadi Party (SP) national president Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday said that if the election commission leans in favour of a virtual campaign for political parties in the UP Assembly elections 2022, then the commission should also make it a level-playing field for all the political parties.At a Press conference in Lucknow hours before the Election Commission declares the poll schedule in New Delhi, Akhilesh Yadav said: “The Election Commission should give some funds to political parties so that they (the political parties) create a step-up, infrastructure because we cannot compete with the BJP infrastructure. So we appeal that EC should get the political parties some funds from the government so that in the democratic set up all political parties who do not have strong set up like BJP’s should be able to compete”.Akhilesh Yadav’s request to the election commission came in response to a question on the SP’s preparedness to run a digital campaign if the poll panel backs the suggestion that political parties should hold a virtual campaign.Will repeat free laptop schemeAkhilesh Yadav also announced that the Samajwadi Party will repeat its free laptop scheme of the 2012 manifesto if the SP returns to power in 2022.“It will be the second promise after the first promise of free 300 units power to all domestic consumers and free power to farmers for irrigation. As the SP government did in its previous government... if the party forms the government in 2022, then it will again give laptops to youth and students for higher studies. Earlier we had given lakhs of laptops which led many of the beneficiaries to get self-employed”.Akhilesh Yadav has already promised free 300 units free power to domestic consumers and free power to farmers for irrigation, a caste census in the state, ₹25 lakh to the families of those farmers who died in the farmers’ agitation, ₹5 lakh to those cyclists who die in a road accident, ₹5 lakh to those who die in the bull attack.Will file FIRAkhilesh Yadav also said his party’s legal cell will file an FIR against a BJP IT cell member who sits in Delhi who posted his photograph and claimed that the perfumer recently raided by tax authorities in Kanpur was standing with him. “BJP is doing false propaganda against the SP. We will file FIR now, and act against the person when we form the government. Because if anyone says anything against me, no action is taken but if anyone says anything against BJP leader, then immediate action is taken”About the Uttar Pradesh government’s ad campaign, Akhilesh Yadav reiterated: “A government does campaign of its works, but here the government is doing party’s campaign on government expense. When the time comes, we will act against the government people and ad agencies involved in all this”.Akhilesh also said that SP and RLD alliance was firm and seat-sharing with alliance partners has been decided and will be announced after the election notification.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/cant-match-bjp-s-infra-for-digital-campaign-akhilesh-yadav-s-message-to-ec-101641635453784.html
08-01-2022||Lucknow||Governance picks up pace with flurry of orders in Uttar Pradesh before polls||Governance has picked up pace with a flurry of orders clearing pending work in Uttar Pradesh and beating Election Commission of India’s model code of conduct amid a spree of public rallies, inaugurations and laying of foundation stones every day ahead of the assembly elections.The motto that “closer the elections faster the work” appears to have worked well in the state over the years and the current situation is no different.While Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and chief minister Yogi Adityanath take part in various ceremonies to inaugurate or lay the foundation stones of projects ahead of polls, various state government departments are busy issuing government orders (GOs) on a number of issues.A close scrutiny of GOs issued in the past four years indicates that the most orders have been issued in 2021, the last full year of the BJP government’s current tenure with elections due early this year. Most of the government orders of 2021 have been issued in the last quarter of the calendar year making faster decision making in the last three months obvious.The Uttar Pradesh government issued 13,141 GOs in 2021 against 12,916 in 2018, 10,058 in 2019 and 10,779 in 2020. A break-up indicates the maximum work in the last three months of 2021 when 3514 GOs were issued against 2131 during the same period in 2017, 2647 in 2018, 2033 in 2019 and 2754 in 2020.The number of GOs issued was the highest in the last month every year with 1553 GOs in December 2021, 759 in the last month of 2017, 868, 655 and 1144 in the same month in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.“Yes, when elections come near, the pending issues are resolved. Use of the annual budget is low in the first three months and the most funds are used in the last three months every year. But this is more so in an election year,” agreed Alok Ranjan, former Uttar Pradesh chief secretary.Ranjan further said this should, however, not be done.“There should be uniformity in work all across the year be it an election year or otherwise,” he said.This becomes more evident when the Election Commission of India is about to announce its model code of conduct for any election. About 326 GOs have been already issued in the first eight days of 2022 at the time of filing of this report and more may come as the day progresses. The state cabinet has also approved a large number of decisions at least thrice this month in an obvious bid to beat the ECI’s model of code of conduct. The state cabinet’s decision included restoration of secretariat allowance to its employees working in secretariat and other higher offices and reducing rate of Value Added Tax on Aviation Turbine Fuel from 21 per cent to one per cent.)“Yes, issues remain pending for years. The decisions are made at the last minute and GOs are issued at a faster pace to beat the ECI’s model conduct and woo voters. This should not be done and there should not be any pendency at any stage,” said VP Mishra, national president of the Indian Public Service Employees’ Federation.Does the last-minute work help any political party or government?“Public memory is very short. So, the ruling parties always try to take advantage of this and decide to go for last minute decision making and the higher number of GOs issued in the last year, quarter or month reflects this,” said Professor SK Dwivedi, the former head of the department of political science, Lucknow University.

India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials attributed the unseasonal rains to the passage of a western disturbance in the north, due to which moisture is being drawn from the Arabian Sea and carried to parts of Maharashtra, including interior districts such as Nashik and Dhule. Officials also said temperatures in Mumbai are likely to fall sharply today.Today 07.20 hrs pic.twitter.com/a4U2Q2xhfq“There are two western disturbances expected to pass over the region in the next seven days, creating an upper air cyclonic circulation over Rajasthan. These weather systems will pull moisture from the sea, and the wind direction is such that Mumbai, Thane, parts of Palghar and also some interior districts will see light to moderate rain, with a possibility of hailstorms in the interiors as well,” said a meteorologist with the IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai.Winters or monsoon?#Mumbai #MumbaiRains pic.twitter.com/Wyqto0qX6iThe official also said that the temperature, both during the day and night, will likely remain below normal till at least January 12.“The minimum temperature could fall to as much as 15-16 degrees Celsius and the maximum will also fall to about 24 to 26 degrees Celsius. It will depend on how much more rain the city gets today.

Seven councillors of the Congress and the lone member of the Shiromani Akali Dal in the 35-member House abstained from voting in the Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) mayoral election. Also read: Punjab CM’s wife, son, daughter-in-law Covid positive; Channi tests negativeSarabjit Kaur got 14 votes, while Katyal got 13 votes and one vote was declared invalid. Both the BJP and the AAP had 14 votes each in the House. Sarabjit Kaur Dhillon, a councillor from ward number 6 is the wife of Jagtar Singh Dhillon, a former councillor and lives in Mani Majra. She has studied till BA second year. She entered politics after her husband’s ward was reserved for a woman candidate. BJP’s Dalip Sharma won the senior deputy mayor election, defeating AAP’s Prem Lata. Sharma got 15 votes and Lata 13 out of the 28 votes cast. BJP candidate Anup Gupta won the deputy mayor’s election. He was declared the winner by draw of lots. Earlier, Gupta and Ram Chander Yadav of the AAP were tied with 14 votes each in the House with a strength of 28 members. The Congress and the SAD abstained from this election as well. In the December 24 election, the AAP bagged 14 seats, BJP 12 seats, Congress eight and the SAD one seat.

Another vote it has is of city MP Kirron Kher. Soon after the declaration of the result, AAP councillors resorted to sloganeering. The result is disappointing for the AAP, which became largest party in the House, in its maiden election but lost the mayoral polls. In the last five years, this is the first time when no clear winner could be predicted in the mayoral battle. In the previous term of the House, the BJP had a majority of 20 of the 26 seats, and even though there were some hiccups in a couple of mayoral elections, the results were always a foregone conclusion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mayor-election-close-call-for-aap-bjp-as-congress-sad-abstain-101641625972488.html

The letter was in a brown envelope, with names of Pathak and two other gang members.Jain, in his statement to the police, said the letter extended new year wishes from the gang before it went on to remind the trader that he hadn’t complied with their instructions to meet Pathak or send the money demanded by them.“This time I have sent the letter by post. Next time I will send a bullet which will not be aimed at the cupboard, but directly in the head),” the letter, written in Hindi, said, a reference to a February 21, 2021 attack when a member of the Pathak gang allegedly fired at Jain’s shop.The police had then found a chit thrown by the shooter with the gang’s name on it (‘Uday Pathak Rahul Mandri Vicky Pise Pathak gang’) and made a demand of ₹1crore against a death threat.Jain approached the Kurar police with the letter.“We have registered a case of extortion and are conducting investigations,” said Somnath Jadhav, senior police inspector of Kurar police station.Police said Pathak has sent similar letters in three other extortion cases registered against him after being jailed in 2011 in the Kurar murder case.

08-01-2022||Chandigarh||Cheap Iranian import now threatening stored Himachal apples||After a lean apple season that was marred by weather vagaries and pandemic-induced lockdown last year, there was a huge yield in the hilly state also known as the fruit bowl of the country. Total 2.84 crore apple boxes were produced this year while the last year recorded a 3.43 crore yield. The varieties produced in Himachal were sold in the open market during the season, but about one lakh metric tonnes of apples were kept in the cold stores as well as the controlled atmospheric stores in different parts of the country including, Chandigarh, Kundli and Sonepat in Haryana, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Hyderabad and Vijayawada. But now again, the cheap apples from Iran are threatening the Himachal apples. “The cheap imports from Iran have killed the market for Kashmiri apples and conventional cold-stored apples from Himachal as Iranian apples are also bound to impact the controlled atmosphere stored apples, making the trade unviable and non-remunerative,” said Lokinder Singh Bisht, president, PGA Progressive Growers’ Association. Growers from Himachal and Kashmir have been repeatedly demanding the government to raise import duty on apples. For the last two years, home-grown apples have been facing stiff competition from duty-free fruits being imported from Iran under the India‘s Free Trade Agreement. Large consignments of apples are also shipped to ports in Gujarat and Maharashtra, while some are routed to markets in north India through the Attari-Wagah border. “It is mostly the Red Delicious variety grown in Iran, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan that makes its way into India. Despite numerous representations to the Centre by orchardists in Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, duty-free import of fruits has not been rolled back. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur recently asked the Union government to raise the duty on apple import, but we have been constantly demanding the same for long,” said Harish Chauhan, convener, Hill State Horticulture Forum comprising growers from Himachal, Jammu, Kashmir and Uttarakhand. “Cheap Iranian apple is definitely giving competition to the apple produced in Himachal and Kashmir,” said a young entrepreneur, Abhinav Jaggi, who owns online Agri Fresh stores. A 10-kilogram box of Iranian apples cost about ₹400 to ₹600 per kilogram of apples, “he said, adding that Iranian apples are gaining ground with retail fruit sellers. Despite erratic weather and unseasonal rains, Himachal Pradesh witnessed the production of more than 3.43 crore boxes in the 2021 apple season, which is also the highest production in the last five years. The previous record is of 3.88 crore boxes in the year 2015. The highest ever production of 5.11 crore boxes was achieved in the year 2010. Compared to the previous five years, apple production in 2021 has been good. Though the production was large, orchardists didn’t get the price for the product as the hailstorm and unseasonal snow and rain had battered the crop. Due to the dented produce, the B-grade apple didn’t fetch expected prices in the market after mid-August. Till the first week of August, when the good quality produce arrived in the market, the orchardists got a price of ₹3,500 per box. However, the prices fell sharply in the second week and one box could hardly fetch between ₹1,800 to ₹2,200 which resulted in huge losses to the marginal and small farmers. In 2021, a record 73,216.67 metric tonnes, which comes around 36 lakh boxes, were procured by the government undertakings like Himachal Pradesh Horticulture Produce Marketing & Processing Corporation (HPMC) and Himachal Pradesh State Cooperative Marketing And Consumer’s Federation (Himfed) under the market intervention scheme. The government had fixed a price of ₹9.50 per kilogram apple under the MIS scheme which was quite low as compared to the MIS prices in Jammu and Kashmir. This wasn’t enough for the orchardists to recover their input cost. 
08-01-2022||Kolkata||Gangasagar Mela starts today, lakhs of pilgrims head to Bengal as HC gives nod||The Gangasagar Mela, which occurs at West Bengal's Gangasagar (also known as Sagar) Island during Makar Sankranti every year, starts today and will continue till January 16. There was a major cry regarding its cancellation owing to the ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and the recent surge in cases across the country amid Omicron variant outbreak. However, the Calcutta high court on Friday gave a go-ahead to the Trinamool Congress-led state government to conduct the event after taking necessary measures to check Covid-19.On Makar Sankranti, thousands of pilgrims, seers and tourists are expected to take a holy dip in the confluence of Ganga and Bay of Bengal, and offer prayers at the Kapil Muni Temple.The court showed concerns regarding the virus spreading due to oral and nasal droplets transmitting through river water after the pilgrims take dips in the confluence. Advocate General SN Mukherjee, representing West Bengal government, however, reportedly informed that residents of Sagar Island have been inoculated with both jabs of Covid-19 vaccine and the test-positivity rate in Diamond Harbour was under control.The state further stated that it wasn't expecting the headcounts at the annual pilgrimage this year to exceed 5 lakh, while adding that nearly 30,000 seers have already visited the fair (mela) and around 50,000 people, including more seers, have reached the event ground from various locations of the country.High court's instructions to contain Covid-19 at Gangasagar Mela 2022:The court directed the state government to constitute a three-member panel comprising the leader of opposition at the state assembly, chairman of West Bengal Human Rights Commission, and representative of the state, to ensure compliance of Covid-19 measures in the Sagar Island.Should there be any laxity in compliance, the committee has been asked to make recommendations to the state government without any delay to prohibit entry in the island, on which the competent state authority will take immediate action. The court also stated that the secretary of West Bengal Human Rights Commission will coordinate with the committee members on the matter.The high court has instructed the state to ensure that all persons and pilgrims at the Gangasagar Mela ground mandatorily wear masks, adhere to social distancing norms and use sanitisers. The same protocols are applicable for individuals associated with the control and management of the event such as police personnel, medical personnel, volunteers and government officials.As many as five RT-PCR testing facilities along with some rapid antigen testing centres must be set up at all entry points, including Howrah and Sealdah railway stations.Concerns from doctors:Despite the green signal from the high court, the Doctors' Forum is sceptical on how the Covid-19 measures suggested by the former will be conducted by the state government. It also stated that the affidavit filed by the state on January 6 to the high court is a mere eyewash to go ahead with the mela.The forum has claimed that the medical facilities made available in the mela premises are not adequate to cater to lakhs of pilgrims.Covid-19 situation in West BengalAs many as 18,213 new Covid-19 cases were reported in West Bengal on Friday, up from 15,421 the day before. There are 51,384 active cases in the state with the case positivity rate as high as 26.34%. The number of people hospitalised in the state due to the virus also saw a rise to 2,444 on Friday from Thursday's 2,228, according to the state Covid-19 bulletin data.South 24 Parganas where the Sagar Island is situated logged a total of 704 new Covid-19 cases on Friday of the overall 18,213 infections.

08-01-2022||Delhi||Delhiwale: The lost world||The street is teeming with market people. The street-side is taken over by two tailors. They are mending torn suitcases. More of such damaged suitcases are piled up behind them.But who will mend the damaged building (see photo) further behind?On a closer survey, the building turns out to be as haunting as a lost world. Staircases are going up to rooms that no longer exist. The cobwebbed niches on the walls joyfully stare into the air, like an eternal grin of skulls. Some parts of the house appear to be made of lakhori bricks, the building material of yesteryear.This ruin is in Gurugram, considered to be the land of office high-rises and shopping malls. This house is very old, remarks a rat poison vendor hawking his ware. The building is obviously abandoned. No human can live in it, here in Sadar Bazar, just opposite a much-loved sweet shop (who hasn’t heard of the famous Sardar Jalebi!). Squirrels are running about the fallen bricks. A black cat darts across and instantly disappears from view. An all-knowing shopkeeper in the vicinity once gossiped some stories about the landmark, but you don’t need to bother with telltales. A connoisseur of the city street is required to simply gaze upon the dilapidated structure from a polite distance, and imagine the extinct house’s daily life that must have played out within — the celebrations and deaths, the happiness and grief.Today, the roof is gone and the broken walls make the place resemble a tatty book with missing pages. The innards of the residence lie exposed for all the world to ogle at. Discarded plastic bags adorn the rubble. The only element that seems to show some bit of sympathy to the building is a giant neem. Its sprawling branches are reaching out to the vastness of the untended concrete like a protective parent wanting to embrace the unlucky child.One day, these remnants might be replaced with a smart modern building, designed after contemporary aesthetics. And then this place as we see it today will go out of our mind, as if it had never been.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-lost-world-101641602189461.html

08-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi adds 17,335 Covid infections, 9 more fatalities||The Capital added 17,335 cases of Covid-19 on Friday, as the daily spike in the city hit its highest level since May 9 last year, even as nine more people succumbed to the infection on the day.The fresh infections on Friday came at a test positivity rate of 17.73%, showed data from the state’s daily health bulletin, as this statistic also continued to rise amid Delhi’s fifth wave of infections, which is likely fuelled by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.The positivity rate in Delhi stayed below 5% for 227 days, but breached that mark on January 3.The nine deaths on Thursday is the most in one day since June 21, when 11 people died of Covid-19.The city added 8,370 cases each day over the past week, up from 771 a week ago, and 116 the week before that.Hospitalisations have not risen at the same pace or magnitude in that time, however, confirming global trends that have shown that the Omicron variant of the coronavirus is more transmissible than the Delta variant, but does not cause severe illness or hospitalisations to the same degree.The number of active cases – patients currently recovering from the illness -- in the city is now just short of 40,000.However, just 1,390 hospital beds in the city are currently occupied, including by suspected Covid-19 patients, showed the state’s health bulletin. Of these, 1,159 are patients from Delhi. A vast majority of those admitted are not on oxygen support, while 31 patients are on ventilator support.Experts affirmed that while the Omicron variant did appear to cause milder infection, residents should keep their guard up.Dr Ambrish Mithal, chairperson and head of endocrinology and diabetes division, Max Healthcare, said, “When we say the Omicron variant causes ‘mild disease’, we mean mild in comparison to the deadly Delta variant. Omicron can result in just a mild cough, sore throat, but can also cause a full blown viral with severe headache, body ache, fever, cough lasting several days.”Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases department at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said the peak of infections may likely be reached in the first week of February according to current trends.“The experience of different Omicron-hit countries of the world shows that the number of cases will further increase in the country, especially in the weeks to come. Omicron spreads four times faster than the delta variant, but infection is mild and only 25% cases are required hospitalisation. The peak is likely to hit in the first week of February. People should avoid gatherings and comply with the guidelines,” said Dr Kant. He also stressed on the importance of using high-quality masks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-adds-17-335-covid-infections-9-more-fatalities-101641597112665.html
08-01-2022||Chandigarh||Despite Covid surge, single counter set for vaccination, testing in Ludhiana||Paying no mind to the surge in coronavirus cases in the city, health authorities have set up a single vaccination and testing counter at the civil surgeon’s office, increasing the risk of exposure. Incidentally, with people hurrying to get their vaccine shots as the third wave of the virus begins its ascend, the single Covid counter at the civil surgeon’s office is the most crowded area on the premises. Among those at the civil surgeon’s office were a few people who were exhibiting flu-like symptoms, including cough and cold, and were waiting to get an RT-PCR test.The queue grew longer after the vaccination centre opened an hour late. One of the persons, Surinder Kumar of Kundan Puri, said he had arrived at the vaccination unit at around 8am, but no one was present. ‘Stampede-like situation’ “Soon a huge crowd gathered at the Covid counter. As the crowd continued to swell, cops deployed at the venue had to use force to avoid a stampede-like situation,” he said. “The cotton swabs given after administering the vaccine were scattered on the floor at the vaccination point. When I raised the issue, a policeman standing at the vaccination counter started handing out tokens ,” said Rakesh Kumar.While standing in line in the drizzle, a local, Gurpreet Singh, who was waiting to get his tests done, said, “I am suffering from cough, cold and fever and have been waiting for over half-an-hour to get the test done. Why can’t the testing counter be set-up at a separate location,” said he said. “There are so many vacant rooms at the civil surgeon’s office and the testing centre could be shifted anywhere. The health department authorities know best why both vaccination and testing is being done at the same place,” said Sushil Kumar, who wanted to get vaccinated.Residents’ reports delayed Some residents were in line to find out the status of their Covid report, two days after they had been taken. “I have a body ache, cough and fever. I had given my Covid samples on Thursday morning, but have still not received my report,” said a resident.Civil surgeon Dr SP Singh said due caution was being taken to avoid mingling of the two groups visiting the Covid counter. “The issue will be resolved soon,” he said. Additional deputy commissioner- cum- nodal officer Nayan Jassal took note of the anomaly, and said guidelines will be issued to set-up Covid testing centres at a separate location.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/despite-covid-surge-single-counter-set-for-vaccination-testing-in-ludhiana-101641597109364.html
08-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi downs its shutters for the weekend||A weekend curfew was imposed in the Capital on Friday night as the city entered a crucial phase of its Covid-19 outbreak, with 17,335 new cases taking the number of active infections in the city to 39,873.Activities have gradually wound down in the city after the highly transmissible Omicron variant sent case rates spiralling, although fewer people are in hospitals – a trend that will be crucial to watch over the coming week.Delhi recorded over 17,000 new cases on Friday, rising from 5,481 on Tuesday, 10,665 on Wednesday, and 15,097 on Thursday. The positivity rate, which was below 1% on December 28, is now 17.73%.The weekend curfew prohibits all non-essential activity, and exempts some categories of businesses and workers such as health care professionals, government and judicial officials, diplomats, and media persons.People coming from or going to airports, railway stations or bus terminals will be allowed travel with valid tickets, as will those who work for services such as grocery shops, internet service providers, banks and petrol pumps. Delivery of food and online shopping deliveries will be allowed, and people can attend weddings, which will need to have at most 20 attendees, by showing an invitation card.Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain said the rate of hospitalisation has been roughly six times lower compared to previous waves in the city, urging people not to panic, but at the same time exhorting them to continue wearing masks and maintaining distance properly.“The best way to avoid corona is to wear a mask and practise social distancing. Only go to hospitals if you have severe symptoms; treatment at home is entirely feasible,” he said on Friday, before adding that there will be no lockdown and construction work will be allowed to continue as well.The Omicron variant has been established in scientific studies to be significantly less likely to lead to severe disease, partly due to the large number of people with vaccination or a previous infection and because the virus intrinsically may have mutated to become less virulent.But it has spread rapidly, causing cases to accelerate at an unprecedented pace. The sharp jump has forced staff shortages and raised fears that the tsunami of cases could still lead to a large number of people who need medical attention, even if they are fewer as a proportion of all infected than those needing critical care before.Some of the disruption seemed to set in as two of cities biggest hospitals closed regular clinical services on Friday: the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and Safdarjung Hospital issued orders to restrict non-Covid services for outpatient departments (OPD), speciality clinics and centres till “further decision”.Jain, while speaking at the briefing where he made the above remarks, said the city was prepared with adequate number of beds in case hospitalisations were to surge.Experts said while lockdowns will not be particularly helpful in reducing the spread, a weekend lockdown drives public messaging since voluntary compliance of Covid-appropriate behaviour is lacking.“The occupancy of Covid beds is currently very low as compared to what was witnessed in the previous waves. The government should monitor the situation and enforce Covid appropriate behavior among general public strictly. Not all people have self-discipline in the society that is why restrictions are needed. In the national perspective, however, avoiding rallies may be better strategy than imposing curfew,” said Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital.“A complete lockdown was necessary in earlier waves to prepare the health systems and check the transmission so that unprepared systems can’t handle the patient load. The cases surging now are primarily asymptomatic or mild in nature,” said Giridhara R Babu, head, epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health.“A lockdown is economically devastating for poor people and does not yield added benefits at this stage when the health systems have been boosted to handle patient load. A complete ban on all mass gatherings (especially indoor) is what is needed now along with strict compliance of mask use,” he added.The relatively milder nature of the current outbreak has led to some alterations in protocol in order to minimise the disruption to everyday life. The home isolation period has been reduced from 10 days to seven, as long as there has been no fever for three consecutive days, and the Delhi administration has not announced the strictest of restrictions that would have otherwise been enforced as part of the graded response action plan (Grap) on Covid-19.Nonetheless, the rise has put some people on edge and the government has assured there will be no lockdown, which in the past has sparked large movement among migrant workers, which led to further spread of the infection as they crowded at train and bus stops to head back home.“The construction activities are allowed and labourers who are staying on the site can work or those who are going to work on foot are also allowed,” said a senior revenue department official who asked not to be named.A Delhi Disaster Management Authority order lacked clarity on the movement of domestic help, but a senior revenue department official said they are allowed to move about if going to work on foot.“There is no lockdown in Delhi, and construction work will continue as usual so there is no reason for labourers and migrant workers to be concerned,” Jain said.During the weekend, to facilitate commute for essential workers, the Delhi Metro and buses are permitted to use 100% seating capacity.Authorities across Delhi’s revenue districts said they were prepared to strictly enforce the weekend curfew, and had mobilised enforcement and awareness teams from Friday evening.Traders said the curbs are hurting them economically. Manpreet Singh, treasurer of the National Restaurants Association of India, said the restrictions have come as a blow to industry. “With odd-even, stores open only 2-3 times a week. How does the government expect shopkeepers and restaurants to pay the salaries and other fixed expenses when the shops reopening is restricted? It will hit jobs also. Restrictions should be linked to occupation of hospital beds and not with number of cases,” Singh said.Harsh Vardhan Bansal, director of Vegas Mall in Dwarka, said the precautions are necessary in fighting Covid but livelihood needs were equally important, asking the government to strike a finer balance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-downs-its-shutters-for-the-weekend-101641596552845.html

08-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh BJP demands high-level inquiry into lapse in PM’s security||A delegation of the Chandigarh Bharatiya Janata Party met the Punjab governor and UT administrator on Friday and submitted a memorandum, demanding a high-level inquiry into the lapses in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s security at Ferozepur on January 5.The delegation was led by state president Arun Sood, Himachal Pradesh co-incharge Sanjay Tandon, additional solicitor general of India Satya Pal Jain and senior leader Raghubir Arora.In its memorandum, the BJP alleged, “The whole nation was shocked to see the manner in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s security was compromised by the Congress-led Punjab government. It was a major lapse in his security when he was stuck atop a flyover for 15-20 minutes while on his way to Ferozepur, Punjab, due to the road being blocked by some protesters.”Sood alleged that this was an exhibition of the anti-Modi narrative of the Congress. “It shows the mentality of those who could not go beyond their family’s interest and accept Narendra Modi as the Prime Minister. There has been negligence on the part of the Punjab government, but they are trying to put the blame on others,” he added.Later in the day, the party organised a “Congress Sadbuddhi Maun Dharna” in Sector 46. Sood said the silent dharna was organised for the good wisdom of the Congress party, its leaders and chief ministers in different states across the country.Party protests outside Mohali DC’s office Mohali Upset over the lapses in the security arrangements of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 5, members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) held a protest outside the District Administrative Complex in Sector 76 on Friday.Speaking on the occasion, senior BJP leaders Ramesh Kumar and Ashok Kumar Jha alleged that the Punjab government had miserably failed in enforcing law and order. “It should be dismissed immediately and President’s rule should be imposed and elections should be conducted,” they added.Later, protesters handed over a memorandum to deputy commissioner Isha Kalia.Youth Congress raps Shah for blaming Punjab govtThe Chandigarh Youth Congress (CYC) on Friday held a protest against Union home minister Amit Shah for blaming the Congress-led Punjab government for lapses in the security of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.CYC president Manoj Lubana said, “The BJP should stop blaming the Punjab government. We strongly stand by chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi. The responsibility of PM’s security lies with the SPG, through the home ministry. With daily expenditure on PM’s SPG security cover reaching over ₹1.62 crore, the blame cannot be placed on anyone else.”He added that when hundreds of lives were lost during peaceful farmers protest, not a single word was spoken by the PM, but when he was made to wait 15-20 minutes, he created a huge drama.“The PM returned to the airport as his scheduled rally attracted only 700 people, as opposed to the expected 70,000. In 2009, when Manmohan Singh was the Prime Minister and went on a visit to Ahmedabad, he was opposed, but he did not attack the then chief minister, Modi, who is now creating such a big ruckus on the same matter,” said Lubana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-bjp-demands-high-level-inquiry-into-lapse-in-pm-s-security-101641594590447.html
08-01-2022||Chandigarh||Covid curbs in Chandigarh: Ailing hospitality sector staring at another blow||Yet to recover from pangs of past pandemic restrictions, city’s hospitality industry is facing another struggling time with the UT administration imposing fresh curbs in view of the rising Covid-19 cases.In 2020, the sector was completely shut down for around three months and thereafter allowed to reopen partially, causing many units to close down and leaving hundreds jobless.It was only after June 2021 that the hospitality sector started to get a semblance of normalcy. Seven months later, restrictions have once again returned in Chandigarh, Punjab and Haryana.On Thursday, the UT administration had imposed night curfew from 10pm to 5am and mandated that all bars, cinema halls, multiplexes, malls, restaurants, spas, museums, etc., operate at 50% capacity with fully vaccinated staff.Gatherings for any purpose have been restricted to 50 persons for indoor and 100 persons for outdoor events. Besides, the total number of persons should not exceed 50% of the venue’s capacity.Further, the Chandigarh district magistrate on Friday, under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), directed that kitchens of restaurants, eating places, hotels, and food joints in various malls will run only at 50% capacity and close by 10pm. The last order can be accepted till 9pm.Similar restrictions were imposed by the Punjab and Haryana governments earlier.Smaller units worst hit“Every time Covid cases go up, the hospitality industry is made a scapegoat. The industry has not even recovered from the deadly collapse in 2020 and now this,” said Gurpreet Singh Virk, head, Punjab and Chandigarh chapter of the Hotel Association of India.Stating that the industry will not be able to sustain if the restrictions stayed for long, Manmohan Kohli, chairman, Hotels and Restaurants’ Association, Chandigarh, said, “We are with the administration on bringing the Covid cases down, but if the curbs stretch out for more than 10 days, many units in the industry will collapse, especially the small and medium establishments. Their large workforce will also lose their jobs.”Another hotelier, on condition of anonymity, said, “The governments are so lax when it comes to political events where large crowds gather and Covid protocols are ignored. Governments should focus their energy on controlling these mass spreader events. The hospitality industry, in contrast, already maintains high discipline with regard to safety protocols. This should be kept in mind while imposing restrictions.”‘Allow relaxations’Hoteliers have also demanded “scientific approach” by the government for restrictions. Virk said, “Time has little relevance in terms of Covid. Hotels and restaurants should be allowed to operate till 11pm, instead of 10pm. Also hotels should be allowed to rent all available rooms, as each customer is fully vaccinated and remains in their room, which is a bubble arrangement in itself. Gatherings at banquet halls should be as per their size. On the other hand, night clubs and lounge bars may be asked to close as there is zero possibility of maintaining social distance there.”He added that with cases rising, people were already putting off their dining-out plans, and with the new restrictions, the sector was staring at another major crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-curbs-in-chandigarh-ailing-hospitality-sector-staring-at-another-blow-101641594589101.html

08-01-2022||Chandigarh||Decks cleared for Chandigarh power dept’s privatisation||In a month’s time, the city’s electricity management will be in a private company’s hand with the Union cabinet giving its nod to the ₹871-crore bid made by a private company in August last year.The electricity department will now be bundled into a company and its shares transferred to the private company.Stating that the legal and technical formalities are left to complete the process of power privatisation, UT adviser Dharam Pal said, “The consultant (Deloitte) for the entire process is chalking out the plan for conversion of the department into a company. Thereafter, agreements, including share agreement, will be signed and shares of the newly created company will be transferred to the private company. The entire process is likely to take another month.”The consultant will also formulate the final plan for the employees within the new dispensation. Administration has assured that their interests will be protected. Kolkata-based industrial and services conglomerate RP-Sanjiv Goenka (RPSG) Group had quoted the highest bid for the department.The group’s flagship Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation (CESC)’s wholly-owned subsidiary Eminent Electricity Distribution (EED) quoted a bid of around ₹871 crore against the reserve price of ₹175 crore. The next highest bid of ₹606 crore was made by Torrent Power.Others among the seven companies in the race were Sterlite Power, ReNew Wing Energy, NTPC Electric Supply Company Limited, Adani Transmission Limited and Tata Power.Originally, 21 companies had bought the request for proposal, but only these seven entered the bidding stage.The decision to privatise the UT electricity department was taken on May 12, 2020, after directions from the Centre. The UT had committed to finish the process by year-end, but it got entangled in legal battles after the UT Powermen Union approached the Punjab and Haryana high court against privatisation. The move also elicited criticism from resident welfare associations and opposition parties.The process was stayed by the high court twice. Most recently, on May 28, HC had applied brakes on privatisation and even pulled up the administration for its “undue hurry” during a raging pandemic. On both occasions, the administration had approached the Supreme Court, which allowed the process to continue. HC will be taking up the case again on Thursday.Tariff still within JERC’s ambitThe UT electricity department caters to a city with a relatively low demand of around 400MW. As there are only 2.3 lakh consumers, if privatised, the department’s efficiency is expected to improve, specifically in terms of distribution of power. “The Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission will continue to oversee and fix the tariff for the private sector operator, as being done for the government department,” said UT adviser Dharam Pal.Employees to go on strikeMeanwhile, the UT Powermen Union has called a protest rally in Sector 17 on January 11. Gopal Dutt Joshi, general secretary of the body, said, “We are still awaiting HC’s decision on the petition filed on the issue, but the administration has finalised the privatisation. We will announce a strike call against UT’s decision.” The process so farMay 12, 2020: UT decides to privatise the power dept November 9: Bids invited December 1: HC orders stay on process January 12, 2021: SC stays HC orderFebruary 9: SC remands back matter to HC April 19: UT announces it will fast-track the process May 28: HC stays the process again June 28: SC once again stays HC orderAugust 4: Bids opened, EED quotes ₹871 croreJanuary 6, 2022: Union Cabinet approves the bid.
08-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh mayoral polls today: In AAP vs BJP, SAD may prove game changer||After the historical municipal corporation poll results, suspense remains over the results of the mayoral election scheduled on Saturday. Debutant Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are set to fight it out with 14 votes each, while the Congress,with its seven councillors, has decided to sit the election out. With the Congress refusing to pick sides, it can be anyone’s game, especially considering the strong history of cross voting in the mayoral polls. The lone Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) councillor, if he does not abstain, can well be the game-changer. In case, both the parties are tied, a draw of lots may be the determiner. The House meeting will start at 11am and BJP councillor Maheshinder Singh Sidhu will be the presiding authority. Charges of horse-trading have been flying high, with parties going so far as moving their councillors out of town to prevent poaching. The AAP had taken its councillors first to Delhi and then to Kasauli-Barog in Himachal Pradesh, the Congress arranged for its councillors stay in Jaipur, Rajasthan, and the BJP opted for the cool climes of Shimla. The candidates in frayThe AAP has fielded Anju Katyal and the BJP Sarabjit Kaur, both first-timers, as the post is reserved for a woman councillor in the new House’s first year. While both candidates filed their nomination papers on the last date, the Congress had opted out of the race. The SAD also did not pitch a candidate. The BJP has fielded Dalip Sharma for the post of senior deputy mayor and Anup Gupta for the post of deputy mayor, while the AAP has fielded Prem Lata for the post of senior deputy mayor and Ram Chander Yadav for the post of deputy mayor. A hung House In the December 27 results, no single party had secured majority, throwing up a hung House. The AAP had won 14 seats, while the BJP’s strength was reduced to 12 seats from the 20 it had won in 2016. Congress had won eight seats, and the SAD one seat. However, after Harpreet Kaur Babla, who won on a Congress ticket, switched to the BJP, Congress’ strength dropped to seven and BJP’s increased to 13. In the full House of 36, including one vote of Chandigarh MP, who is currently from BJP, the total votes of the saffron fold stand at 14, equal to AAP’s strength in the House. The BJP and AAP leaders are confident that their candidates will win the election. Congress’ spokesperson Rajesh Sharma said, “We have principally decided that we will not vote for any party and abstain from it. We are ideologically different from both BJP and AAP, and will not support any of them.” Meanwhile, it is unclear whether SAD’s Hardeep Singh will support the BJP or AAP, or abstain from voting. The party has not issued any categorical statement.

08-01-2022||Chandigarh||Convoy breach in Punjab ‘rarest of rare’: Govt to SC||The Supreme Court on Friday ordered that all materials related to the breach of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s security in Punjab be kept safe with the registrar general of the Punjab and Haryana high court, as it agreed to examine a request for setting up a court-monitored independent panel to investigate the unprecedented lapse.The apex court also asked the central and state governments to suspend the proceedings of their respective inquiry committees into the incident until its next order.The central government told the three-member bench that the breach was a “potential international embarrassment” and might have involved “cross-border terrorism”.“Please, understand the seriousness of the situation. A serious mishap could have happened and a serious international embarrassment could be there,” said solicitor general (SG)Tushar Mehta, who represented the Centre.“The matter is rarest of rare,” he added.The Prime Minister was stuck on a flyover for 15-20 minutes on the road from Bathinda to Ferozepur on Wednesday afternoon due to a blockade by protesters, sparking a furious political battle between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

According to police, the deceased has been identified as Rajnish Yadav, a native of Azamgarh district in Uttar Pradesh. He was living in Sutyana village in Greater Noida under the jurisdiction of Ecotech- 3 police station, Gautam Budh Nagar.The deceased’s brother, Avneesh Yadav, filed a complaint at the Ecotech-3 police station on Friday morning. In the complaint, Avneesh said his younger brother Rajnish worked at a transport company in the Kulesra area of Greater Noida.“On January 4, Rajnish was hit by a speeding truck while he was on his way home in the evening. The truck fled the spot after the incident,” said Avneesh. He further mentioned that passersby noted down the number plate of the truck and rushed his brother to Sharda Hospital.“My brother was then referred to Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi where he succumbed to injuries on Thursday night. I have submitted a complaint to the police and request them to nab the culprit,” said Avneesh, who is a daily wage labourer.Following the complaint, a case has been registered at Ecotech-3 police station against unknown truck driver under sections 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way), 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 304-A (causing death by negligence) of the IPC.“We have formed teams and are scanning CCTV footage of the area to identify the suspect,” said a senior officer of Ecotech-3 police station.

08-01-2022||Chandigarh||Readers’ Take: Drive home the point of road safety||Alcohol test for drivers outside pubs, restaurants Speeding and drunken driving are the main reasons behind most road accidents. Due to Covid, police have stopped setting up nakas to catch those driving under the influence of liquor. In my view, checking should be carried out in parking lots of all places having restaurants, bars, pubs and clubs nearby. Drivers of all vehicles should be made to undergo the alcohol test before they allowed are to leave. Sqn Ldr Manjit Singh Johar (retd), ChandigarhBetter safe than sorryFor making the city roads safer, speed radars must be installed on all busy roads. The minimum age bar for driving must be increased to 21, and the driving test must be stricter to ensure that only well trained drivers hit the road. Liquor shops have already been removed from state highways and national highways, these should be removed from the main roads of the city. Audio alerts warning motorists against unsafe driving practices must be played at all light-points so that they stay alert. Navjot Singh, via emailPositive policing, not challansCity Beautiful has the highest per capita ownership of vehicles in India, as per a recent survey report. The number of vehicles on city roads is rising exponentially, even as the infrastructure remains disproportionate. Traffic chaos further makes the situation grim, leading to fatalities on roads. Road mishaps are not always a result of speeding, sometimes, malfunctioning of prevailing ‘traffic policies’ also play an active role. Challans are not the only viable solutions to curb violations. Positive policing is the way to go. Shammi Bhatia, via emailAbide by the rulesDrive in the prescribed speed limits, always put on helmets, seat belts and other safety equipments before driving, do not drink and drive, never use mobile phones or ear phones while driving, know the traffic signs, signals, lights and traffic safety rules before you hit the road. Ishita Nara, via emailNo need for speedPeople should be made aware of the dangers of speeding. Speed radars and hi-tech cameras should have a proper challaning system and police should inform the common public about this. Speed-reducing devices such as speed breakers and roundabouts should be increased. Police personnel should be deployed on all roads, especially at dangerous intersections. Saikrit Gulati, ChandigarhCheck underage drivingAlcoholism, substance abuse, mobile use while driving, and sheer thrill of speed are some of the reasons for reckless driving among adolescents and teenagers. To a large extent, parents are also responsible for inculcating these reckless behaviours among the children. Primarily, it is the money power which spoils the teenagers. Secondly, they are not taught to respect the law and life of others on the road. Traffic police should act responsibly and bring such culprits to book without delay. Anil Kumar Yadav, ChandigarhExemplary punishment to violatorsStrict traffic rules need to be put in place and implemented in letter and spirit to check fatalities due to rash and negligent driving. Exemplary punishment, including jail term, to habitual violators, confiscation of their driving, and hefty fines can help instill a fear of law. There should be zero tolerance towards those ignoring traffic rules.Ramesh K Dhiman, ChandigarhSpeed breakers, lane driving needed It is time to put cemented speed breakers on all roads in the city, especially near roundabouts, traffic light-points, inner lanes and accident-prone zones. It should be ensured that these are visible properly during both night and day. Additionally, lane driving concept can be easily followed on the wide roads of Chandigarh. Implement these two measures at the earliest possible and results will be visible.Kampreet Gill, ChandigarhTake charge of your and others’ safetyWe have to take charge of learning road and traffic rules. We must use proper paths and ways, and also wear safety gears and accessories to avoid all possible accidents. Along with this, we must educate our peers, seniors and younger members to follow traffic rules and stay safe and make roads more safe to travel for all of us. Anju Mohan, PanchkulaOnus on motoristsIt’s unfortunate that despite having good roads and smart traffic management, fatalities on city roads are increasing. This only implies that people are not following the rules. Though high-end cameras and speed radars are a definite deterrent against traffic offences, the onus is on the drivers of vehicles to follow traffic. The city administration, on its part, should bring in more signboards and other requisite infrastructure, make it mandatory for cyclists to use cycle tracks, and prune trees regularly so that these don’t block traffic lights.Chhavi Kumar, ChandigarhNeed breakdown lanesSmooth roads and weak vigilance always attract traffic violators. The few traffic cops deployed on roads seem more interested in issuing challans and increasing their revenue than ensuring a safe road journey for pedestrians and motorists. Many of them can be seen hiding in the bushes, literally and figuratively, to catch violators. Besides, the city also lacks infrastructure such as ‘safe side lanes’, where a vehicle can be parked in case of a breakdown. Many fatal accidents take place due to stationary vehicles on the road. Capt Amar Jeet, KhararDedicated lanesOne must follow dedicated lanes to minimise road mishaps. The administration must also start drives to educate people about traffic rules and regulations. They can also be educated through hoardings, banners etc. Speed limits must be defined on roads so that commuters lives are not put at risk. Defaulters must not be spared. Garv Bhupesh, PanchkulaName and shame violatorsMost people, who violate traffic rules and indulge in rash and negligent driving, do it for thrill. Authorities must adopt the practice of name-and-shame to rein in on such people. Cameras must be installed on all roads to catch willful defaulters. Their registration numbers must be displayed on social media to publically shame them for their acts. Aarti Verma, PanchkulaSuspend licence, RC of traffic violatorsMere challaning won’t deter traffic violators. We need to bring in stricter measures such as suspending the licence and registration certificate of repeat offenders, or even impounding their vehicles, can send the message out loud that there would be no tolerance for violations. Parents of underage drivers must be named and shamed, and children should be sensitised about the risks of rash driving, at the school level. AK Sharma, ChandigarhPause and reflectThe Chandigarh administration and police have done enough to check traffic violations – closed-circuit television cameras are installed on most roads and PCR vehicles are stationed after every few miles. But it is often seen that many motorists, cyclists and even pedestrians don’t act responsibly. It is common to see cyclists riding in an inebriated condition. Retired civilians and youngsters can be asked to volunteer to assist police in screening such people. Kundan Lal Sharma, MohaliTechnology for implementing traffic rulesIt is shocking that of the 92 accidents that caused 94 fatalities in Chandigarh last year, traffic police found that speeding led to 51 deaths. Speeding challans rose by 50% in 2021 as compared to 2020. Stringent action against violators, especially during night patrolling at accident-prone traffic intersections, better road-infrastructure and using latest devices to check speeding are vital. 3D zebra crossings and breath-analysers will help check violators. Installing cameras which can automatically register challans against violators will also help. Usha Verma, ChandigarhHefty fines for violatorsChandigarh was planned on geometric pattern and all roads run parallel and perpendicular to each other. The tendency to drive fast and not follow traffic rules leads to accidents. The need of the hour is to educate people and follow traffic speed limits and rules. High-definition speed surveillance cameras should be installed at vulnerable points and people violating speed limits must be made to pay hefty fines. At the same time, people must be educated about traffic rules. The help of traffic marshals and NGOs, must be taken to for this campaign. Col TBS Bedi (retd), MohaliNeed well-maintained roadsBad quality roads lead to road mishaps, which sometimes end fatally. To avoid such mishaps, roads must be repaired from time-to-time to do away with potholes, craters etc. Traffic laws and regulations should not merely be on paper, but be implemented in letter and spirit. The city police need better speed-measuring systems and fines for violators must be increased. Administration should carry out periodic medical checkup, especially of vision and hearing of the drivers. Also, emergency response and care must be sped up, and crash-protective vehicle designs must be promoted.Prabhjot Nagpal, ZirakpurCorruption in traffic policePeople have lost the fear of being challaned for violating traffic rules. The reason is traffic policemen take bribe and let the defaulters go. Firstly, government should keep a vigil on traffic cops to ensure transparency and fair judgment. Secondly, government should specify a prescribed speed-limit for vehicles and spread awareness among the masses. Government in coordination with government and private offices should start a plan to deduct salary of employees through offices for speeding. Recarpeting roads and repair streetlights to avoid accidents. Separate lanes should be marked for different types of vehicles to avoid speeding. Vehicles of those performing stunts or rash driving should be impounded and lead to suspension of driving licence for one year. Abhilasha Gupta, MohaliTackle rush-hour trafficIt’s good that UT police are focusing on challaning drivers indulging in speeding during night hours by installing more night vision cameras. But, if we take a look the data released by the Union ministry of road transport and highways, it reveals that in Chandigarh, most accidents take place between 6pm and 9 pm. The maximum, 81 accidents (24%) took place between 6pm and 9pm, followed by 70 accidents (20%) in late night hours of 9 pm to 12 midnight. The city must use this data to take corrective measure. Sanjay Chopra, MohaliAdopt ‘4 Es’ of road safetyRoad safety can be implemented by adopting the 4 Es: Education, Enforcement, Engineering and Environment and Emergency Care of road mishap victims. As drivers on the road, we must remember that driving safely will save our own, as well as others’ life, help us avoid hefty fines and imprisonment. Respect for other drivers on the road is sacrosanct to road safety. Khushboo Singla, via emailRoad to safety begins with repairsContinuous inspection of roads by authorities must be ensured so as to provide better roads and save precious lives. The public must voice their opinions and also play citizen journalists, by clicking pictures of damaged roads and bringing it before authorities concerned.Shubham Dhiman, ChandigarhRespect others’ right to way, and right to safetyAccidents do not happen, they are caused. No one owns the roads, so treat others with respect. New drivers should complete a basic course or advanced tuition at race tracks. It is important to drive in one’s lane and avoid overtaking. Drunken driving and using phone while driving should be strictly avoided. Adhere to speed limits and be aware of blind spots in your routes.Vijay Malia, ChandigarhMore rotaries neededIt is a proven fact that approaching from right-angled directions automatically helps in reducing speed, thereby resulting in lesser collisions as compared to unmanned signal crossings at odd hours. To bring down the number of road accidents, the UT administration will do well to provide rotaries at all busy road crossings. SC Luthra, ChandigarhMulti-pronged approachFirst and foremost, authorities must repair roads to do away with potholes and uneven stretches that cause accidents. Traffic personnel must be trained well to deal with busier roads, and must be taught that their sole aim must be to ensure the safety of everyone on roads. As individuals, we should all take it upon ourselves to do everything in our hand to avoid untoward incidents. This includes following rules, taking safety precautions and not indulging in speeding or rash driving. Lastly, speed monitors can go a long way in deterring violators. Komal Sharma, ChandigarhIncrease traffic police presence, use sensorsSpeeding and flouting of traffic rules are the main reason behind road fatalities. Presence of traffic police must be increased and speed bumpers must be installed at all busy stretches to deter rash driving. Also smart technology such as speed sensors etc must be used. Amanpreet Kaur Bains, KuraliAuthorities’ must do their partTraffic police should stop playing “hide-n-seek” for catching violators and do their job honestly. Conduct random alcohol tests of drivers and use affix speedometers on important roads to get people to slow down. Sumesh Kumar Badhwar, MohaliStrict enforcement need of the hourMost road accidents are caused by youngsters who deliberately flout traffic rules by speeding, breaking speed limits, jumping red lights, indulging in drunken driving, using mobile phones while driving, not using indicators, seat belts and helmets by two wheelers and cyclists. Cyclists are often found riding without reflectors during night time. Traffic rules are not being enforced strictly which is the main reason for increase in violations. Kidar Nath Sharma, via emailSafety the mottoAll damaged roads must be repaired, CCTVs installed at every traffic light point, and regular awareness drives must be carried out in all localities to make people behave responsibly on the roads. Strict punishment must be awarded to traffic violators so they learn a lesson before its late. Most importantly, the corruption in traffic police must be address. P Mehta, via emailYoung and negligent Safety on roads depends upon traffic cops. Traffic rules should be strictly followed. Mostly, bikers flout the rules. They cross from where they find little space. Even school-going students can be seen driving vehicles, even though they are underage and don’t have a valid licence. Harnam Singh, MohaliREADER OF THE WEEKThink safety – it couldn’t hurtAccidents can be avoided. By adhering to the speed limits, staying focused on driving, stopping at traffic lights, avoiding the temptation to drink and drive, and avoiding the use of mobile phones while driving, you can make roads safer for yourself and others on the road. Safe driving practices may seem simple and commonplace to drivers, but in today’s fast-paced world, these are often overlooked, forgotten, or simply ignored. Road safety rules are best tools to avoid accidents, so we should do our best to spread awareness about these. Also, authorities will do well by solving the menace of potholes and stray animals, as these are the cause behind several mishaps. Vineet Gandhi, ChandigarhExpert takeRules of the roadAny death is a death to many. Chandigarh, with its wide roads and strict policing, still nears the top in percentage of fatalities? Why? Because persons with no knowledge of traffic rules are allowed to drive. Almost all drivers overtake from the wrong side. Overtaking must be allowed only at designated spots.Justice Rajive Bhalla (retd), Punjab and Haryana high court Safety firstTo check speeding at night, we are procuring 3 night-vision speed radars. Speed limits have also been simplified. We have come up with suggestion for making rotaries at certain light junctions to reduce fatalities. A Chandigarh Road Safety Society is also being set up to improve road design and infrastructure.Manisha Choudhary, SSP, traffic, ChandigarhStrict enforcementFor minimising road accidents, strict enforcement of traffic rules is necessary. Even violations by cyclists, rickshaw-pullers etc should not be ignored. At spots where the fatality rate is high, steps must be taken to ensure that road design is in keeping with the IRC guidelines. Prof Umesh Sharma, head, department of civil engineering, Punjab Engineering CollegeAwarenessAuthorities must involve traffic marshals in enforcement of traffic rules as we have a lot of experience in this area. Focus should also be on creating awareness among motorists to bring down fatal accidents. Gurnam Singh, traffic marshall Right of wayPeople must be sensitised about the right of way when it comes to cyclists. Authorities must put up cameras on cycle tracks to issue challans to motorists who drive on these. Many people who drive on cycle-tracks to take a short-cut go even faster than normal, putting cyclists in danger.Akshit Passi,vice-president, Cyclegiri||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/readers-take-drive-home-the-point-of-road-safety-101641586908505.html

08-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Small shopkeepers, gym owners cry foul over Covid curbs||While the UT administration has ordered restrictions in the markets of the city considering the rising Covid cases, shopkeepers of smaller and congested markets claim they are being unfairly targeted as many of them had to suffer heavy losses during the first and the second wave. They claimed that no reimbursements were given to them.The president of the Shastri Market, Sector 22, Jaswinder Nagpal said, “How political rallies are allowed while shopkeepers have to bear the brunt of the administration’s order. Also, what logic is behind the 5 pm deadline? Many people get free from office at that time. This will affect our business.”A similar situation could be seen in Palika Bazaar, Sector 19. Harpreet Singh, who sells blankets here, said booth markets were being singled out even as showrooms and street vendors were allowed to function without such curbs. Lalilt Kumar, a shopkeeper in Palika Bazaar, said it was even more congested at the vending zones in Sector 19, which have no partition in between stalls. However, they are being allowed to function.Devinder Bajaj, who sells clothes in the market here, said, “Customers are already not coming due to Covid. This is the time to clear our winter stock. If the restrictions continue, I will most likely go bankrupt.”The administration has further said that retail customers and the general public will not be allowed to go to the Sector 26 mandi from January 10 onwards. This has also irked the shopkeepers here with Lohri around the corner.Vijay Kumar, who sells dry fruits here, said, “Lohri is a big festival and if the customer can’t come to the market to make purchases, what will we do with our stocks? The government should have told us at least a month in advance so we wouldn’t have bought the stock.” Another dry fruit seller here, Satish Kumar, said they will face big losses because of this.Meanwhile, gym owners are also not happy with the new order. Mohinder Singh, a member of the Tricity Gym Owners Association, said that they were trying to get the administration to listen to their point of view. “We are strictly following the social distancing and sanitising guidelines. Exercise help people remain fit and should be encouraged rather than asking us to close completely.”Residents are also apprehensive whether these restrictions will lead to a rise in the rates of vegetables and fruits like last year. The chairman of the Chandigarh Residents Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED), Hitesh Puri said, “Vendors should be allowed to move through sectors as people may want to avoid the crowded mandis. However, there should be some check on the rates they charge, as last year they had started charging exorbitant rates for tomatoes and potatoes, while the mandis were closed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-small-shopkeepers-gym-owners-cry-foul-over-covid-curbs-101641586128245.html

Justice Raina retired in July 2020.The high court bench of justice Vivek Puri has a sought response from his wife, Candy Meena Raina, by February 23. She had made a complaint under Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, against him last year, and acting on the same, the trial court had taken cognisance of the same and summoned him on September 20, 2021. In the high court, he had sought quashing of the complaint as well as the summoning orders.Justice Raina had argued that he is suffering from “serious health issues” and is aged about 63 years. The wife has been provided a flat in Chandigarh and he is also paying the water and electricity charges for the premises and also paying a sum to the extent of ₹15,000 per month on account of maintenance.

Singh added that in the absence of the representation of the elected members, the interest of the faculty members and the staff would be jeopardised. “It is requested that the process for notification of the elected members may be expedited and till then the meeting of the senate please be adjourned,” he added in the letter, a copy of which has also been sent to the PU vice-chancellor.Earlier, nine members of the PU senate had also written to Naidu, adding that it’s the first time that the notification of the senate was issued in two parts and calling the meeting before the complete senate has been constituted will amount to a violation of the PU Act. The PU senate is set to meet for the first time since December 2019. With the spike in Covid cases, the meeting will be held online. The senate meeting will be broadcast live for the media in the DPR room of the PU. Eleven agendas are set to be tabled during this meeting, including the recommendations made by the Board of Finance in January 2020.

08-01-2022||Mumbai||96% of COVID + patients who are on oxygen beds, are unvaccinated: BMC data||Even as Mumbai recorded 20,971 cases on Friday, data from the Brihanmumbai Corporation (BMC) showed that a large majority of Covid-positive patients requiring oxygen support are those who have not taken a single dose of the anti-Covid vaccine.Mumbai has 22,222 active beds for Covid patients (including oxygen, ICU and ventilator beds) in 186 private and public hospital facilities. As of January 6, of the 11,912 oxygen beds, only 16.6% or 1,983 beds, are occupied. According to municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal, till Thursday, 96% of the oxygen bed occupants were unvaccinated and had not taken even a single dose of the vaccine. The remaining were partially or fully vaccinated.“Out of the around 1,900 Covid patients who were on oxygenated beds, around 96% are unvaccinated and only 4% are vaccinated,” Chahal said.The age group and co-morbidity status of these patients occupying oxygen beds is not yet know. However, separately doctors said that the age group of such patients is above 40 to 50 years.As of January 6, the city also had 2,636 ICU beds of which 671 were occupied and 1,407 ventilator beds, of which 421 were occupied. The vaccination status of these patients is not known.According to BMC officials, trends from the past experience of the pandemic indicates that comorbidities and old age increases the chances of death. In the past 16 days, the city has recorded a death a day on average, officials said.In Mumbai, the BMC has vaccinated 108% of the population with at least one dose (the number exceeds 100% because it includes floating population; the target adult population is 9.2 million), while 89% have been given two doses. However, the civic body is in the process of compiling data on exactly how many have taken a single dose to compute the ratio of residents to floating population. Since January 03, the civic body started vaccinating 0.9 million teenagers in 15 to 18 years age category was started.“We may even have 100,000 Covid active patients in Mumbai. Our oxygen consumption is only 10 tonnes. Our (production) capacity is up to 200 tonnes (a day). We have another 400 tonnes of oxygen in storage. In the third wave, we have to understand that positivity rate or cases will not be parameter with which to gauge the situation but hospitalisation rate. The occupation of oxygen and ICU beds along with the overall bed occupancy rate is to be gauged.”Chahal said 80% of the city’s Covid beds were as yet unoccupied and the situation will be reviewed if occupancy reached 50% in the coming days.“Our experts from the Covid Taskforce have told me that in Mumbai may even go up to say 40,000 cases daily. This may or may not happen but we will come out comfortably out of this considering the cooperation from citizens,” he said.According to BMC officials, going by the trend in South Africa, the cases of Omicron variant started going down in a time span of five weeks. A recent round of BMC’s genome sequencing revealed that 55% of the samples were of the Omicron variant, but experts said that Delta and Delta derivatives could also be driving some number of hospitalisations.Officials said that the Omicron variant could likely be the dominant strain in circulation in the coming days.Dr Gautam Bhansali of the Bombay Hospital who is also coordinator of all private Covid hospitals in the city said, “In case of hospital beds, both vaccinated and unvaccinated citizens are occupants, but on oxygen beds, the majority of patients are unvaccinated. The age group of such patients is normally above 40 to 50 years. This shows that vaccination is very important for each and every citizen.”An analysis carried out by the civic-run Seven Hills Hospital in Marol showed that of the 4,054 Covid patients admitted between October 1, 2021 and January 5, about 11% or 443 were unvaccinated and about 12% or 477 had taken only one shot of the vaccine. While the hospital has not analysed the vaccination status of those on oxygen support and in ICU separately, they said that anywhere between 10%-20% of the patients who are on oxygen or in the ICU are unvaccinated or have taken only a single dose. “We are in the process of collating more specific data,” said Dr Smita Chavan, deputy dean of the hospital.Infectious disease expert Dr Om Srivastava, who is also a member of the Covid-19 task force said that there is a definite increase in the number of unvaccinated and partially vaccinated people who were being hospitalised with Covid-19. “Many of these patients seem to have rushed to take the vaccine after the surge in cases started, perhaps battling the initial hesitancy towards vaccination,” said Srivastava. “We have not conducted a thorough analysis, but the uptick in such patients, even on oxygen support and ICUs is visible,” he said.According to Srivastava, Omicron is largely affecting the upper respiratory area and patients suspected with Omicron may not require oxygen. While the presence of Omicron is confirmed by genome sequencing, some hospitals have started using the S-gene dropout parameter in the RT-PCR tests to indirectly indicate the variant causing the disease in the patient.“Recent data from Bostwana and other parts of Africa have also shown similar trends wherein Omicron is not causing any lower respiratory distress that might need intensive care or oxygen support. My worry is about the possibility of joint infections with both Delta and Omicron variants due to repeated exposure that could be driving some number of patients towards severe disease. We don’t have genome sequencing data to establish this, but it definitely needs to be looked at,” he said.(With inputs from Jyoti Shelar)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/96-of-covid-patients-who-are-on-oxygen-beds-are-unvaccinated-bmc-data-101641584029470.html

Others put on notice for January 13 are Paramjeet Singh, director, public instructions (colleges) and professor Arvind, chairman of the recruitment committee and vice-chancellor, Punjabi University, Patiala. The plea alleges violation of December 3 order of the high court with which the state was told not to proceed with the selection process. The petitioner, Kulwinder Singh, was a candidate for posts advertised for computer science subject. The plea said even as order was passed in the presence of state counsel and an officer of the department, the government published the final selection list of English subject and selections were finalised in the subjects Punjabi and Hindi on December 9. The selected candidates were given appointments letters on the night the order was passed in high court on December 3.In some cases, same was done with back date, the plea claims adding that the respondents conducted the whole process in a “very clandestine manner” and list was not published on website. The plea demanded that an independent probe be ordered into entire recruitment.Taking note of similar allegations on December 21, the high court had directed Punjab government to seal record pertaining to recruitment and put it in custody of the chief secretary.

08-01-2022||Lucknow||Uncertain future for major wedding season ahead||With the new pandemic wave, the city is back to night curfews and cap on number of guests in a gathering. The wedding season is just a week ahead and planners, decorators, caterers, venue providers are staring at major losses in the business, once again. The new norm for guests — 100 for indoor and 50% for outdoor gathering — has forced everyone to restrategize the plans. Side-functions are being cancelled; some people are postponing the wedding dates while many big fat weddings are turning into a low-key affair. Dr Jaideep Chandra, who has booked a prominent club for his daughter Bhavya’s wedding this month-end, has to majorly alter his plans. “I had a foresight that we may see a new wave so we had a back-up plan in mind. Earlier, we planned 600-800 guests for the wedding but now we have reduced to 100-150 immediate family members and close friends. We are shifting the venue as well, which will result in forfeiting my deposit, but there is no point taking such a big space for such small gathering. Thankfully, I had not given much deposit in advance to rest of the associated people,” he says. Wedding planner Upendra Singh has booked artistes like Jaslin Matharu, Milind Gaba, Silver String Band and Rocky Star Band for weddings ahead but he is now not sure what lies in store. “We have given advance to most of them but now some clients are saying to wait-and-watch and not releasing further advances. Tickets have been booked but weddings turning into smaller affair so nothing much can be done. Though we have also asked celebs to be on hold but have no idea till when all will be streamlined. Once again, we are staring at losses,” he says. After a good November-December season, Manoj Bachaani got a major expansion done at Moti Mahal Lawns for the coming season but the current scenario not seems in his favour. “We had a very good wedding season planned ahead but due to the fear of the new variant we all are extremely apprehensive. People are reducing 1,000 packs to 100-200 and if this continues it will be a major loss. With night curfew starting at 10 pm it’s obvious that weddings will be minimalistic so for now it feels our planning and preparations have gone haywire.” Leading decorator Jameel Shamsi has booked for people from various parts of the country and now with the fast-changing scenario they are clueless about the course of action. “We call artisans from different parts of the country for theme weddings. The tickets have been booked and the planning has been done months before but now clients have started altering plans. It’s very much possible if they won’t have any outstation guests and with night curfew imposed and uncertainty ahead this is bound to happen,” he says. Umesh Ahuja, who runs Golden Blossom Resort, adds that 13 departments are involved in a wedding and with each alteration things are bound to go topsy-turvy. “We have been facing a tough time in the last two years and now when finally, things had started to look up here we are back to square-one. As service providers we have no option as we have to abide to government norms and alter as per customers need.

08-01-2022||Other||Unidentified persons booked, FIR has no mention of Modi’s security breach||The first information report (FIR) registered by Punjab Police has no mention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s security breach on Wednesday.The case was registered at Ferozepur’s Kulgarhi police station on Thursday evening, about 30 hours after the incident when PM’s cavalcade was stuck near Piareana village due to road blockade by activists of the BKU (Krantikari).Even as the unprecedented security breach has become a national issue, the FIR (HT has a copy) has no mention of the movement or obstruction to the PM’s road movement.The FIR was lodged under mild bailable offence of Section 283 (obstructing public ways) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) that has a maximum penalty of ₹200.Even as top leaders of the ultra-Left leaning farmer organisation BKU (Krantikari) used social media platforms and mainstream media to confirm their involvement in blocking the highway when PM’s cavalcade was moving, police lodged a complaint against unidentified persons.In a video posted on social media on Thursday, farmer union chief Surjit Singh Phul claimed that there were about 1,000 activists at the dharna that started at 11am on Wednesday. He admitted that the protesters did not allow BJP supporters’ buses to pass by to reach the rally that Modi was to address in Ferozepur.But the police record has no mention of the number of people and organisations who blocked the highway when the PM’s cavalcade was stuck for 15-20 minutes.Interestingly, the station house officer (SHO) of Kulgarhi, Birbal Singh, is also a complainant in the case.The FIR mentioned that a police party reached the blockade spot after 2.30pm on Wednesday that was after more than an hour when PM’s motorcade had to return due to security concerns. The BJP rally ended early at around 2.30pm after the PM could not reach the venue due to a road blockade.Ferozepur range deputy inspector general Inderbir Singh and Ferozepur senior superintendent of police Harmandeep Singh Hans were unavailable for comment.The SHO evaded reply when asked if videos in the public domain are being taken into consideration to identify those who violated rules that led to Modi’s convoy being stuck on the flyover for 15-20 minutes.BKU (Krantikari) general secretary Baldev Singh Zira owned the responsibility of leading the dharna at Piareana that blocked the PM’s convoy. Some farmer unions lauded the BKU (Krantikari) for stopping the PM, while others termed the blockade of his convoy “avoidable”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/unidentified-persons-booked-fir-has-no-mention-of-modi-s-security-breach-101641583187963.html

The liquor belongs to 1998-batch distilled, blended and bottled by Gwalior Distillers Limited,” police said.There was a liquor ban imposed in state by the then government led by chief minister Bansi Lal between 1996 and 1998.Cell in-charge inspector Hamir Singh said the seizure was made after a tip-off that old stock is stored in a godown and some men are selling it illegally to labourers at cheaper rates.“Following this, a decoy customer was sent and we found it to be authentic. A raid was conducted in the presence of officials of the excise department. We have been informed that the owner of the godown had given this place to a caretaker. We called the owner but he is under isolation for being Covid positive and couldn’t reach,” the inspector added.Superintendent of police (SP) Jashandeep Singh Randhawa, in a statement, appealed to the residents to inform them if they find anyone selling liquor illegally so that action can be taken against them.“Names of the informers will be kept confidential and appropriate reward will be given if the information is found to be true,” the statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/police-seize-1998-batch-liquor-from-ambala-godown-101641583010842.html

08-01-2022||Lucknow||Covid spurt: Political parties cancel ‘big crowd’ events||Lucknow: The Congress, the Samajwadi Party and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) have announced the cancellation of big public meetings and rallies in view of the rising Covid-19 cases in the state. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), under pressure from the initiatives of the rival opposition parties, has not announced any new programmes and expects that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s proposed January 9 rally in Lucknow might be cancelled. Political parties are watching the Covid situation and also waiting for the Election Commission to issue directions. The Uttar Pradesh Congress was the first to take such a step and on Wednesday, decided to go for door-to-door campaign and roadside meetings only and cancel all the big public rallies and programmes, including marathons, at least for now. The Samajwadi Party (SP) on Thursday announced the cancellation of party president Akhilesh Yadav’s Vijay Yatra in Ayodhya which was scheduled for January 9. But it decided to go ahead with his “thin attendance” programmes in Gonda and Basti on Friday and Saturday. “Only the Vijay Yatra of Ayodhya has been cancelled--in view of Covid--as the Vijay Yatra of the Akhileshji attracts large crowds. The rest of his programmes will continue as per the schedule,” said SP spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary. Akhilesh attended the event in Gonda where he unveiled a statue of late SP leader and former UP minister Pandit Singh. Pandit Singh died of Covid in May during the second wave of the pandemic. Akhilesh also addressed a press conference in Gonda after the event. On Saturday, Akhilesh would be in Basti for a political event, said Chaudhary. Meanwhile, the rest of the party leaders are continuing with their public meetings, rallies, door-to-door, campaigns and street meetings. The AAP cancelled its rallies in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh in view of a spurt in coronavirus cases, senior party leader Sanjay Singh said on Thursday. The party would hold virtual rallies in the state, he said. “All rallies of AAP in Uttar Pradesh have been cancelled. I will talk to you at the ‘Kejriwal Guarantee’ public meeting to be held in Varanasi on January 8 through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube,” the AAP MP tweeted in Hindi. Singh, who is the party in charge for Uttar Pradesh, said accordingly yatras scheduled to start from Sahibabad on January 9 and from the western part of the state on January 10 had been deferred. Meanwhile, a Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leader said: “The BSP currently has no rallies or public meetings scheduled. Two rounds of public meetings of the party’s national general secretary SC Mishra were over and the campaign schedule of the party’s national president Mayawati will be announced after the Election Commission’s expected announcement”. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is under pressure again to hold virtual rallies – a demand that has gained traction after Samajwadi Party and Congress set the trend by rescheduling their poll programmes in election-bound UP. “Our Jan Vishwas Yatras that started on December 19 have concluded. However, the formal conclusion was likely to be with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s January 9 rally in the state capital. In all probability, that rally isn’t taking place now,” a BJP leader said. Yet another BJP leader said since the party hadn’t officially declared that the PM would hold a rally in Lucknow on January 9, there was no point declaring that the rally was being rescheduled or cancelled. “BJP’s Jan Vishwas Yatras in UP that started on December 19 culminated at six different places from December 31 to January 3. However, the PM’s proposed rally was to mark the official culmination of the rallies on January 9,” the party leader said. After the Jan Vishwas Yatras, the next phase of all rallies or poll programmes of top leaders is yet to be announced. However, all the scheduled government programmes continue. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath held two programmes in Lucknow and one in Varanasi, while union surface transport minister Nitin Gadkari, along with deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, held a programme each in Ayodhya, Kaushambi and Gorakhpur related to road inauguration and foundation-laying. The chief minister also distributed tablets and smart-phones to students in an event in Ayodhya on Friday. Union law minister Kiran Rijjiju also attended a lawyers’ event in Lucknow the same day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/covid-spurt-political-parties-cancel-big-crowd-events-101641583007862.html
08-01-2022||Other||Punjab dithers on naming regular DGP||Chandigarh Two days after the Punjab government received the panel of three names of officers from the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) for appointment of one of them as the state’s regular director general of police (DGP), there is indecision within government ranks. The UPSC’s three names are 1987-batch IPS Dinkar Gupta, 1987-batch IPS VK Bhawra and 1988-batch officer Prabodh Kumar. The government’s inability, even failure, to take a call on one of these names is due to the fact that it is unsure if the incumbent, acting DGP S Chattopadhyaya, should be replaced. The fact that he ‘dared’ to order the registration of a First-Information Report (FIR) against former Akali minister Bikram Singh Majithia is a big plus in his favour, in the government’s books. A senior government official added Bhawra was likely to be the final pick, due to various reasons, but lack of consensus between the chief minister’s office and the state home minister’s office complicated matters. Another senior functionary in the CMO said the final decision may take a few days more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-dithers-on-naming-regular-dgp-101641582829249.html

The drama of breach in security was scripted to gain sympathy.”“It (the security breach) is part of an advertisement campaign of the Prime Minister to take political advantage in the upcoming polls, he (the PM) can do anything for publicity,” he added.Charuni was in Karnal to thank the farmers in district for their support and contribution in the farmers’ agitation against the now repealed three contentious farm laws.Reacting on the poll promises being made by the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders to the voters of Punjab, he said, “They have adopted a policy of ‘pehle bhookh failao, phir bheekh do’ (first spread hunger, then give alms).”“But we are not in favour of such freebies during polls. We want the income of the common man to be increased so that he can live a respectful life,” he added.He has requested the farmers of Haryana to support the candidates who actively participated in the farmers’ agitation in the upcoming panchayat elections of Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/will-make-efforts-to-unite-all-farm-leaders-for-punjab-polls-charuni-101641582649567.html

The infected persons also include those who had earlier contracted the virus and received both the doses of the vaccine,” the doctor added.During the first and second wave of the virus, nearly 950 employees of PGIMS had tested positive.

The Purvanchal division covers districts of Varanasi, Mirzapur, Azamgarh, Prayagraj, Gorakhpur, Basti, Ghazipur, Jaunpur, Chandauli and Sant Ravidas Nagar. The Varanasi region is now abuzz with activities that have given a boost to exports.Agarwal said that with the active intervention of APEDA, about 20,000 Metric Tonne (MT) of agri-produce have been exported from the Purvanchal region in the last six months. Out of these shipments, about 5,000 MT of fresh fruits and vegetables and 15,000 MT of cereals have been exported to Vietnam, Gulf nations, Nepal and Bangladesh by all modes of transportation.Varanasi and nearby areas witnessed an export of around 12 MT, 22 MT and 45 MT in October, November and December respectively in 2021. Also, around 125 MT have been exported from Varanasi and nearby areas.Varanasi region has reputed institutions of central and international level such as the Indian Institute of Vegetable Research (IIVR), International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Banaras Hindu University (BHU).Currently, the Varanasi region has several exporters and the export of agricultural products is being undertaken through air route due to the establishment of robust quarantine as well as customs clearance facilitation centre at Lal Bahadur Shastri International (LBSI) Airport.To monitor the product and production, a project of AI tech is also being considered for approval. APEDA is also planning to take member farmer producer organizations to different successful territories for unveiling the agri-supply chain and market linkage.The government is also considering replicating the Varanasi model in the Gorakhpur region of Purvanchal as the geography, demography and a few other parameters are common in both places. The newly established international airport in Kushinagar may play a vital role in triggering the export. The DDU Gorakhpur University, Indian Institute of Seed Science, Mau are the institutions actively working towards the promotion of agri-activities in the region.APEDA has also approved three projects for comprehensive grain and nutritional quality profiling of non-Basmati Rice, value-added products from Rice and rice-based food systems.An APEDA-funded project for integrated IT solutions to enhance Agri Export in Varanasi Region is under process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/purvanchal-region-exports-20-000-mt-of-agri-produce-in-past-six-months-101641582407680.html

In that sampling, they had adopted various tricks to defame the state government by releasing unrealistic figures of 34% unemployment. Doing this kind of petty politics over such fictional figures is not right,” the CM said.“It is always beneficial to only share correct and factual figures. If needed, action will be taken against the CMIE for pressing such unrealistic figures,” Khattar said, adding that the NITI Aayog considers the survey conducted by the National Statistical Office (NSO) for all policy decisions.The CM said the CMIE is a privately-owned company formed for profit making and it cannot be said to be fair and free from bias.“It has been the habit of this company to degrade the image of the state government by presenting a false picture of the employment scenario on the basis of fictitious figures,” Khattar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/congress-banking-on-wrong-unemployment-figures-claims-khattar-101641582349880.html

Bhath also said that a few shops on the national highway near Wazirpur, which were also established illegally, were also demolished in the drive.“We have repeatedly asked the land owners to obtain licences and permission from the state government to sell plots or launch housing projects. Now, the next step would be to register FIRs against those developing these illegal colonies and the dealers engaged in duping gullible buyers,” he added. Earlier on Thursday, the department recommended registration of FIRs against 58 individuals for developing nine illegal colonies over 32 acres of land in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dtcp-demolishes-eight-illegal-colonies-covering-50-acres-of-land-in-farrukhnagar-101641581627840.html

08-01-2022||Gurugram||Faridabad: Two arrested for killing 2 construction workers, injuring 1 for money||Police arrested two men late Thursday night for allegedly killing two construction workers and severely injuring another person at an under-construction site in Faridabad’s Nangla Enclave Part-2 on Sunday (January 2 this year), said officials on Friday. The suspects were identified as Rohit, 20, and Pankaj, 20, both residents of Nangla Enclave Part-2, police said, adding that “the duo is allegedly addicted to drugs”. The victims -- Aakash, 23, Ramvir, 42, and Monu, 25 (the injured person) -- are all natives of Hathras in Uttar Pradesh. Narender Kadiyan, deputy commissioner of police (crime), said the suspects entered an under-construction site on January 2 to steal material from there and sell those to earn money for buying drugs. They, however, found three labourers sleeping at the site, and tried to steal their cellphones and wallets.“The duo was caught red-handed by the labourers, and a scuffle broke out between them. The suspects picked up a hammer and bricks lying on the ground, and attacked the victims. The victims fell unconscious, and the suspects escaped with their belongings,” Kadiyan said. The victims had been working and staying at the under-construction site for the past two months as the material kept in the store was not locked, according to the police. Kamal Singh, a resident of Nangla Enclave Part-2, who found the victims unconscious at the site around 12.30am on January 2, informed the police and the trio was taken to a nearby hospital, where Aakash and Ramvir, who had suffered multiple injuries in the head, were declared dead.“Monu recovered in the next two days and recorded a statement in the case, following which we started launched an investigation and scanned CCTV footage of the area,” Singh said, adding that police had put the cellphone numbers of the victims on surveillance, which helped them in tracking the suspects and arresting them from Faridabad’s Dabua on Friday.The suspects allegedly revealed during interrogation that they had “robbed the victims of three cellphones and ₹2,000 after attacking them with a hammer, a knife and bricks”.The suspects were earlier arrested thrice for their involvement in snatching and assault cases in Faridabad, and they were currently on bail, said the police. The arrested trio was produced before a court and sent on a three-day police remand on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/faridabad-two-arrested-for-killing-2-construction-workers-injuring-1-for-money-101641581268998.html

The demand for masks of different types has also increased all of a sudden. As masks are available at cheaper rates than before people are preferring use-and-throw masks.Besides buying masks and sanitisers, people are also taking other precautions and are keen to follow Covid-19 protocol issued by the government.Anil Kumar Dubey, president, Chemists’ Association, Prayagraj, said although masks and sanitisers were in demand since Covid-19 cases increased during the first wave, their demand and sale has increased to 200% after the threat of the third wave. People are not taking chances and are aware that negligence may pose a serious threat to their health and lives.There are large varieties of masks available in the market but recently people are showing interest in buying use-and-throw masks. People are buying them in large numbers and dispose of them after using them for a few hours or a day. As other masks require regular washing, people are now giving preference to use-and-throw masks.Besides masks, an increase in the sale of face shields has also been witnessed recently as it offers more protection from Covid-19 infection, Dubey said.Dubey further said that not only masks but sanitisers and other protections are in adequate stock in the market and their supply is equal to their demand. However, people should buy sanitisers from authorised medical stores only as fake sanitisers available in the market may cause allergy and pose other health risks to users.Dubey also said that people should take precautions and follow protocol but need not panic as all medicines prescribed for Covid-19 treatment are in adequate stock. A chemist in the old city area, Mohd Shariq, said more people are buying sanitisers and masks since Covid-19 cases have increased in the district. People are also asking for ‘Joshanda’ packets as it gives relief from cough etc which is seen as one of the initial symptoms of coronavirus.Senior psychiatrist Dr Rakesh Paswan said people need not panic in the wake of Covid-19 threat but should take all precautions and follow the guidelines. People should consult doctors and get themselves checked if they have a fever or other symptoms instead of panicking. Strong will power and positivity is also necessary to remain healthy, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid19-resurgence-sale-of-sanitizers-face-masks-picks-up-pace-again-101641580730335.html

According to official data, Gautam Budh Nagar reported 2,251 cases in the first week of the month, the highest number of Covid-19 cases to be reported in the last seven months. The last time Noida logged in more than 700 cases in a day was on May 14 last year, when 718 cases were recorded. However, there were 10 fatalities from the infection then while no deaths have been reported so far. Though daily cases are now as high as during the peak of the second wave in Noida, hospitalisation as well as oxygen requirement is minimal so far. Official data shows the district has the highest number of daily as well as active cases in Uttar Pradesh, though officials claim that none of the patients are serious. “We have two notified Covid hospitals, but till now, we haven’t had any patient who needs oxygen support. The cases are more since the testing has been scaled up, especially with the availability of private labs in the district, compared to other districts in Uttar Pradesh. It is good that cases are being detected and are being treated at the earliest,” said Suhas L Y, district magistrate. He added about 70-80% of the cases being reported in Gautam Budh Nagar are from private labs. Though the total number of private tests being conducted daily is unclear, about 6,000 tests are being done by government teams. The positivity rate now is around 5%. The positivity rate-- the percentage of all coronavirus tests performed that turn out to be positive -- is an important metric through which the public health system keeps tabs on the level of Covid transmission.The WHO recommends the test positivity should remain below 5% in a region for an infection to be considered under control. By Friday evening, 26 patients were in hospital while 2376 were in home isolation. Among the new cases is a traveller, who has come from United Kingdom. “We have 26 patients in hospital and six in the ICU. However, none of them is serious and those in ICU are being monitored only because they have several comorbidities. None of the patients are on antivirals. We are only giving multivitamins to all patients and paracetamol to those with mild symptoms,” said Dr Tritya Saxena, medical superintendent, Noida Covid Hospital. So far, 65,985 people have tested positive in Gautam Budh Nagar on the back of 1,780,023 tests. Meanwhile, the district has earmarked 44 schools across the district for mega vaccination drive exclusively for children in the 15-18 age group. All centres will have online as well as slots for walk-in registration for vaccinations. “We have seen that parents and children often look slots online and do not go for vaccination if they can’t book online. However, we have enough slots at every centre for walk-in or offline vaccination. People should go to their nearest vaccination centre with a valid age proof even if it shows no slots are available online,” said Dr Neeraj Tyagi, district immunization officer. So far, around 19,000 children in the 15-18 age group have taken the shot in Gautam Budh Nagar. The estimated population falling under this age group in the district, who are eligible to take the vaccine, is 115,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-719-new-infections-take-active-cases-tally-over-2000mark-101641580727483.html

Confirming the development, senior police officers said more police personnel could likely be infected in Modinagar. The Ghaziabad district on Thursday recorded 360 fresh Covid cases after conducting 8,007 tests, which spiked to 609 new cases on Friday, from a total of 8,802 samples tested. The alarming rise has caused the positivity rate -- the ratio of people who test positive from among the total tested -- to climb to 4.36% on January 7 from 3.64% on January 6. The overall positivity rate since the start of pandemic is 2.64%, district health officials said. “Seven policemen, including the SHO of Loni Border police station, have tested positive for Covid and all of them have been asked to stay in home isolation and follow Covid protocols. We have information about some more policemen from our SWAT team in Modinagar getting infected. We are confirming this,” said Pawan Kumar, senior superintendent of police. “A majority of our personnel have taken both doses of Covid vaccine and we have asked them to turn up for a precautionary dose, which will be administered to front-line workers starting January 10,” the SSP said. According to the district health department, Ghaziabad district at present has 57,543 Covid-19 cases since the start of the pandemic, and 1,771 active cases. Of these, 1,629 contracted the disease in the first seven days of January. “Testing has been increased since the past three days and that is helping us find and treat more infected people. In the coming days, we are planning to increase daily testing to about 10,000 with about 60-70% of tests being RT-PCR,” said RK Singh, district magistrate, Ghaziabad. Of the 1,771 active cases, the district has only 13 patients who are hospitalised and the hospitalisation rate is about 0.73%. “The cases are expected to rise further and they will soon peak. It is expected that cases may come down by February. Although cases are rising, the severity of infection is low or even negligible. It is vital that those who have not taken the vaccine get it fast. Even parents should expedite vaccination of children,” said Dr Ashish Aggarwal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter). According to district officials, till January 6, Indirapuram had the highest number of patients at 262, followed by Carte segment (comprising localities of Shastri Nagar, Govindpuram etc) with 260 cases. On the other hand, Raj Nagar has a total of 131 cases and nearby Raj Nagar Extension with 108 cases. Other localities such as Sahibabad, Vaishali and Vasundhara have 147, 163 and 124 cases, respectively. The district health department said 102 rapid response teams are working round the clock to trace contacts and to check on the health of infected patients. “The severity of infection is low and those in the age group of 21-50 years are the ones mostly affected since this segment keeps travelling for work. Our vaccination coverage is nearing 100% and those who have not taken their vaccine doses should get them at the earliest,” said Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar, chief medical officer.

To combat these infections, antibiotic usage has tremendously increased leading to another problem of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Hence, substantial efforts are being made to explore effective antibacterial alternatives to antibiotics, said Seema Nara, associate professor in MNNIT’s department of Biotechnology, who is heading the project.The team is conducting research to synthesise catalytic nanomaterials that generate reactive oxygen species (ROS)— highly reactive chemicals formed from oxygen— and can be used as low cost, non-toxic and effective antibiotic alternatives. “ROS can inactivate bacteria by irreversibly damaging its proteins, DNA, and polysaccharides. This project aims at engineering Cerium oxide-based catalytic nanostructure with good bacteria capture ability and ROS mediated bacterial killing,” Nara said. As part of this project, the efficacy of the nanozyme (nanomaterial-based artificial enzymes) in combating bacterial infections, disinfections and biofilm inhibition will be studied on a broad range of bacteria such as E coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus—all known to cause a range of life-threatening illnesses such as pneumonia, meningitis, toxic shock syndrome and sepsis among others, she explained. The expert said that the bacteria binding ability of the nanozyme would extend its applicability as an antibacterial coating on medical devices as it could well capture bacteria and kill it through its ROS generating ability. “It could have future potential and use in a number of applications such as potential antibiotics, in wound healing applications, in suppressing inflammation, etc,” she added. 
08-01-2022||Delhi||#WeekendCurfew: Home chefs come to the rescue for Delhiites||The first weekend of 2022 is here, but looks like it’s going to be far from fun, for the city is going to be under #WeekendCurfew. To address the concern of rising Covid cases in the Capital, the imposition of weekend curfew will bring along restrictions such as closure of dine in services at restaurants, no house helps turning up, and a working Saturday for many Delhiites. As most residents struggle to finish the housework and office work alongside, city-based home chefs have stepped in to take care of Delhiites’ hunger pangs.“I’ve just finished cooking two kgs of rajma, so you can imagine the number of bookings I have! If I get to counting, I have already 22 orders, and more requests are coming in as we speak,” says Alka Singhal, a Greater Kailash-based home chef, adding, “I had to hire extra help on weekdays to assist me in preparing meals for the weekend. Most people are going to be indoors and want to order in food. In fact, I have also got a pass made for my driver, so that he can make the deliveries during the curfew, instead of me coordinating with the delivery apps. People, who will be working from home, have to prepare chai, coffee sab... toh at least lunch and dinner banane se bachh jayein toh bartan bhi gande nahi honge! And during curfew, it gets very boring to be home, and food is something everyone looks forward to... Shayad isiliye zyada orders aa rahe hain.” The feel good factor on seeing food gets escalated when there’s surety that the food is going to be hygienic, healthy, nutritious and budget-friendly (ranging from ₹200-400). And with home chefs, that’s a plus point. Kalkaji-based home chef Ashita Oberoi, whose meals are also on the verge of being booked out, says, “People cannot call their part time help when its weekend curfew, and want that at least food should be catered from outside. So not only are they booking for this weekend, but also for the coming weekend as some of them feel the rising cases mean it might get difficult to get a slot for home cooked food, if not ordered well in advance. Many are especially asking for healthy soups to be part of their meal, since it’s winter and staying warm helps keep Covid at bay.” Some of these home chefs, who otherwise cook all round the year, are presently preferring to take orders from the Covid positive patients or families. “That’s what I started doing during the first Covid wave, and am doing that now as well,” says Sanhita D Sensarma, a corporate lawyer and cook from CR Park. She has been inundated with orders, and says, “I serve what I eat, and have put a nominal price for the meals I prepare, which are high in protein. As of now the meals I make are all going for Covid infected families and other frontline workers. I’m only making 25-30 meals per day, and I’m completely booked this weekend. This makes me feel that the Covid crises is back, and I knew the time has come for me to reach out and help those who our support at this time,” she says. Singhal is also preparing food by “consulting dieticians, to come up with special meals that are high on immunity and also taste good”. And Oberoi adds, “For Covid infected families, we have full breakfast, lunch and dinner plans and they can book these for as many days they want. These bookings have, sadly, also come in this weekend.” Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/weekendcurfew-home-chefs-come-to-the-rescue-of-delhiites-101641580188911.html

Besides DGP Chattopadhyaya, the officials who were summoned to the BSF headquarters in Feorzepur were additional director general of police (ADGP) G Nageshwar Rao; ADGP Jitendra Jain; inspector general of police (IGP), Patiala, Mukhwinder Singh Chinna; Ferozepur deputy inspector general (DIG) Inderbir Singh; Faridkot DIG Surjeet Singhl; Ferozepur deputy commissioner (DC) Davinder Singh, Ferozepur senior superintendent of police (SSP) Harmandeep Hans; Moga SSP Charanjit Singh Sohal; Kotkapura duty magistrate Varinder Singh; Ludhiana joint commissioner Ankur Mahendru; Bathinda DC Arvind Pal Singh Sandhu; Bathinda SSP Ajay Maluja; and the Ferozepur VVIP control room in-charge. The communiqué sent by Punjab chief secretary Anirudh Tewari to these officers on Thursday had said, “You are requested to meet the committee on January 7 at 10am onwards at BSF Campus, Ferozepur, along with the relevant orders/documents/records with reference to the above subject.” The committee announced by the Union home ministry is to inquire into “serious lapses” in security arrangements that exposed the VVIP (PM Modi) to “grave risk”. It is led by Sudhir Kumar Saxena, secretary (security) in the cabinet secretariat, and has Intelligence Bureau joint director Balbir Singh and Special Protection Group IG S Suresh as its other two members. Visits flyover, martyrs’ memorial and IAF stationThe probe panel landed in Ferozepur in the morning and first visited the flyover where the PM’s cavalcade was stuck for nearly 20 minutes before going back to the Bathinda airport without attending the planned programme. The Ferozepur SSP, Faridkot SSP and Ferozepur DIG accompanied them to the flyover, which was inspected on foot by the team. After recording statements of the officers, the probe team visited Hussainiwala, where the PM was to visit the National Martyr’s Memorial before addressing a rally at Ferozepur. The team was also seen photographing and going through the videography done by the Punjab Police during the PM’s visit. The team also visited the Air Force station at Bhisiana in Bathinda. In what the Centre described as a “major security lapse”, Modi’s convoy was stranded on Wednesday for 20 minutes on a flyover due to a blockade by farm protesters in Ferozepur. He returned from poll-bound Punjab without attending any event, including a BJP rally, and the Centre blamed the Congress government in Punjab for the security breach. Show-cause notices issued to officersAccording to information, a few senior officers on duty during the PM’s visit have been given a show-cause notice by the MHA for the security breach and have been asked to file a reply by January 8. Archna Verma, deputy secretary to the Centre, has stated in the letter to Bathinda SSP Ajay Maluja that “since there was grave security lapse during PM Modi’s visit, the Bathinda SSP is directed to show cause as to why action should not be initiated against him under law including disciplinary action under All India Services (Discipline and Appeal), Rules, 1969, the acts of ommission and commission.”However, Maluja denied receiving the notice and said he was responsible for the motorcade of the PM till Zida in Faridkot district and everything was smooth till that point. “After that it was Faridkot officer’s duty,” he said. It is not immediately clear if these officers would file a reply as the entire probe by the state and central teams has been stayed by the SC on Friday. 
08-01-2022||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad case: Bombay HC extends Varavara Rao’s bail||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Friday extended till February 5 the temporary bail granted to Elgar Parishad case accused P Varavara Rao, 81, citing the Covid-19 situation.The case relates to alleged inflammatory speeches made at an event in Pune on December 31, 2017, which allegedly triggered violence the next day near the Koregaon-Bhima war memorial. A division bench of justices S S Shinde and N R Borkar issued the extension order after senior advocate Anand Grover, who represented Rao, told the court his client’s health condition was not good and he was seeking permanent bail. Rao’s bail was to end on Friday. Advocate Sandesh Patil, who appeared for the National Investigation Agency (NIA), opposed Grover’s plea and said the bail granted last year was extended from time to time and that Rao should now surrender.The court said it needed to go through medical reports while extending the bail. It added that in light of the current Covid-19 situation and considering Rao’s age, NIA should not object to the extension being sought.The bench added that in view of the rising cases of coronavirus across the state, it would not be wise to send the 83-year-old poet-activist back to prison.Patil told the HC that Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh had not been briefed in the matter and sought a week’s time to complete the process.He urged the HC to grant the next date of hearing in a week’s time.“Mr Patil, there is no point in keeping (the plea for hearing) next week.

Anyone who believes in the democratic system will never forgive this unconstitutional behaviour of the Congress,” said Khattar in a news conference after handing over a memorandum to the governor, seeking imposition of President’s rule in Punjab.Khattar said the Congress government in the neighbouring state should be dismissed so that upcoming assembly elections are held in a free and fair manner. He said the Punjab government will be unable to ensure law and order during the upcoming Punjab polls when political leaders, including PM Modi, will campaign.The chief minister said during the PM’s visit, he was participating in the programme to be held in Ferozepur virtually and the Punjab CM too had joined the programme virtually.“Both of us were linked with the PM’s function via digital mode. The Punjab CM was leaving his seat time and again that day. Channi appeared uneasy,” Khattar said.“Maintaining law and order in state is the duty of the state government and such a grave lapse in the PM’s security is complete negligence and condemnable,” Khaattar added.He said the PM is not a common man but the representative of 130 crore people of the country.Calling the PM as the most popular prime minister of the country till date, Khattar said, “Modi has taken bold decisions that his predecessors feared to even touch.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pm-security-breach-haryana-cm-alleges-conspiracy-demands-channi-govt-s-dismissal-101641541184686.html
08-01-2022||World||HT This Day: Jan 9, 1972 – Mujib is free, flown to London||Says Bangla Desh a reality No pledge to Bhutto on links with Pak APLONDON- Sheikh Mujibur Rehman to- day proclaimed Bangla Desh as "an unchallengeable reality" and called for world recognition and the admission of his country to the United Nations. Sheikh Mujib, freed by Pakistan President Z. A. Bhutto and flown to London early today, told a news conference that he had been kept in a condemned cell under sentence of death by hanging during his nine-month imprisonment in Pakistan. Speaking in a vigorous voice and showing no signs of ill-health, the 51-year-old Bangapita said he had given no promise to Mr Bhutto that Bangla Desh would maintain any link with Pakistan. Scores of elated Bengalis clustered outside the plush Claridges Hotel as Sheikh Mujib held his news conference in the ballroom against a background of ornate wall mirrors and under the glare of television lights. First question One of the first questions he was asked was: "Why did you come to London instead of flying to Dacca?" "I was a prisoner," the Sheikh said. "It was the Pakistan Government's will, not mine." The Sheikh said the duration of his stay had not yet been decided, but he hoped to meet British Prime Minister Edward Heath before leaving. The officials later announced that Sheikh Mujib would meet Mr Heath in the evening. The Sheikh told the newsmen Mr Bhutto had asked him to consider keeping links between Bangla Desh and Pakistan. Merciless killings "I told him I could not say anything about this until I returned to my people", he said. Sheikh Mujib was introduced to newsmen as "our beloved leader, the free President of the free people of an independent sovereign State." The Sheikh, wearing dark tunic, style suit, immediately paid a tribute to "the sacred memory of millions of martyrs who gave their lives" in the struggle to establish Bangla Desh. Sheikh Mujib said Pakistani troops, which tried to hold down he aspirations of Bangla Desh, had been guilty of "merciless Killings." Then he added: "If Hitler had been alive today, he would have men ashamed." Sheikh Mujib would not be trawn into any direct criticism of Mr Bhutto. "I wish him good luck," he said. The Sheikh expressed good wishes to India, the Soviet Union, Poland, Great Britain, France and 'also those freedom loving people all over the world, including those of the United States."In calling for world recognition of Bangla Desh the Bangapita said: "I appeal to all citizens of the world to help my hungry millions." Sheikh Mujib was asked if he had been physically ill-treated or tortured during his imprisonment. He replied that he had been held in a condemned cell in solitary confinement in a desert jail with no visitors, no letters and no contact with the outside world. –Mock trial Sheikh Mujib said that he underwent a "mock trial" but refused to defend himself when the hearing was halfway through. The Pakistani authorities then appointed a counsel to defend him, he said. "It was a court-martial of a civilian " he said. "They wanted to hang me." He said the Bhutto regime, which replaced the Government of former President Yahya Khan, who had ordered Sheikh Mujib's arrest, refused to carry out the sentence. He said he knew about the India-Pakistan war only because of an air-raid blackout in the area of his prison. And he knew nothing of the victory of the freedom fighters until Mr Bhutto told him, Sheikh Mujib added. "I am a free man now but I was cut off from the whole world," the Sheikh said. He told the newsmen that after the mock trial ''I was mentally ready to die." "The day I went to jail I didn't know whether I was to live or not. But I knew that Banda Desh would be liberated." he said. The Sheikh was asked what would be his attitude to the United States in view of Washington's support for Pakistan in the conflict with India. Triumphant shot The Sheikh ducked the question by replying : "I was in prison and I do not know many things yet. I will have to disccuss this with my people when I go to Dacca." Old acquaintances of the Sheikh said he appeared thinner than they remembered him, but still full of spirit despite his ordeal. He rounded off the news conference saying that he was tired after the flight from Rawalpindi. He then raised his voice in a triumphant shout of "Jai Bangla." Outside the hotel more of his supporters were gathering by the minute, hugging each other and shouting the same victory slogan. Reuter adds: The Sheikh declared : "I cannot wait a single moment to return to my people." He said he hoped to return to Dacca tomorrow or the day after. In a voice quivering with emotion, Sheikh Mujib told reporters : "No people have had to pay as high a price in human life and suffering as the people of Bangla Desh." He arrived at the Press conference 20 minute late and greeted the newsmen with "Jai Bangla." "Today," he said, "I celebrate the unbounded joy of freedom in a liberation struggle," Officials of the Bangla Desh mission indicated that it was felt a breathing space was needed before the Sheikh's return to Dacca. They said as many as a million people would come to the airport to see him. "I have nothing against the people of West Pakistan in spite of the way in which they behaved. When they arrested me, they arrested my children too and interned them and my house was burnt." He said Bangle Desh had been exploited for hundreds of years and that Britain bore some responsibility for this although the British Government had always been good to him personally. Loses 42 lb Bangla Desh officials said Sheikh Mujib appeared to have lost about 42 lb. (19 kg) in weight. Asked about reports that the Bangla Desh Government intended nationalising banking, insurance and foreign trade, Sheikh Mujib said such action was implicit in the manifesto of his Awami League which won the Pakistan elections of December, 1970. He added that he had great confidence in what his colleagues were doing in Bangla Desh. Sheikh Mujib said : "I am not going to lose my freedom again in any war. I'm ready to co-operate with anyone." He said Pakistan had played a dirty game and there should be some sort of trial for the mass murders. "But now that my people are liberated I have nothing against the people of West Pakistan. I wish Mr Bhutto success and good luck."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ht-this-day-jan-9-1972-mujib-is-free-flown-to-london-101641664296551.html

Experts slam earlier presumption as US sees record hospitalisation||Amid the ongoing debate of how wrong it is to call Omicron, the new variant of SARS-CoV-2, a mild variant, scientists have started pointing out that deaths from Covid-19 are rising in South Africa. "Looks like some may have discounted #Omicron too soon. Let’s stop it with the “it’s mild” nonsense once and for all. Protect your community. Protect kids," epidemiologist Eric Feigl-Ding has written on his social media as the South Africa government has added some backlog fatality figures in its tally recently, It is not clearly known whether those deaths were due to Omicron. #COVID19 hospitalizations just set a new record today with 138,073 currently hospitalized in the US. ICU occupancy is now at 22,394 - twice the level just 7 weeks ago. Deaths are rising in states like NY. Are these the signs of a "mild" infection? pic.twitter.com/IAA9joN9QWOmicron was first identified in South Africa on November 24. Since then, its spread has been rapid and in many countries, it has replaced Delta. The present surge in the number of Covid cases across the world is because of Omicron. 📍Watching—Deaths from #COVID19 are still increasing in South Africa🇿🇦 (with new backfilled data)— looks like some may have discounted #Omicron too soon. Let’s stop it with the “it’s mild” nonsense once and for all. Protect your community. Protect kids.🙏 Figure by @DrWilliamKu pic.twitter.com/FBRWFm6mIWShowing the data of hospitalisation in the United States, data scientist William Ku said Covid-19 hospitalisation in the US has sent a new record with 1,38,073 currently hospitalised in the US. "ICU occupancy is now at 22,394 - twice the level just 7 weeks ago. Deaths are rising in states like NY. Are these the signs of a "mild" infection?" the researcher said.Explaining the surge, Dr Eric said that it is simple math as exponential cases are likely to swamp out any 'mildness'. "People forget the nature of exponential math. If you have 10x, 20x greater number within 2-3 weeks, that out swamps any benefit of 2x lower mild. That’s why we see hospitalization rates surging across multiple countries” with Omicron," Dr Eric said.World Health Organization has recently flagged that Omicron should not necessarily be categorised as mild. “Just like previous variants omicron is hospitalising people, and it’s killing people. In fact, the tsunami of cases is so huge and quick that it is overwhelming health systems around the world,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.WHO emergencies chief Dr Michael Ryan said that the speculation that omicron might be the last variant of the outbreak was wishful thinking. “There still is a lot of energy in this virus,” he cautioned.Several doctors and experts have pointed out that Omicron's impact appears to be less severe as it does not attack the lungs. Young and vaccinated people may recover from Omicron soon, but for old and people with comorbidities, Omicron might not be as 'mild' as it is being projected, experts said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-mild-experts-slam-earlier-presumption-as-us-sees-record-hospitalisation-101641660806482.html
08-01-2022||World||Imprisoned without charge, Saudi princess freed after 3 years: Report||Saudi authorities have released a princess and her daughter who had been held without charge for nearly three years in the capital, a human rights group said on Saturday.Basma bint Saud, 57, a royal family member long seen as a proponent of women's rights and a constitutional monarchy, has been detained since March 2019, and in April 2020 implored King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to release her on health grounds."Basma bint Saud Al Saud and her daughter Suhoud... have been released," the ALQST for Human Rights said on Twitter."She was denied the medical care she needed for a potentially life threatening condition," the rights group added. "At no point during her detention has any charge been levelled against her."Saudi officials were not immediately available to comment on the case.Princess Basmah was arrested shortly before a planned trip to Switzerland for medical treatment, according to a source close to the family.The nature of her illness has never been disclosed.Prince Mohammed has overseen a reform drive since he was appointed by his father King Salman in June 2017 at the expense of the previous designated heir to the throne, Mohammed bin Nayef.Reforms have included lifting a decades-long ban on women driving and the easing of so-called "guardianship" rules that give men arbitrary authority over female relatives.But Saudi authorities have also cracked down on dissidents and even potential opponents, ranging from preachers to women's rights activists, even royals.Princess Basmah was kept in Al-Ha'ir prison, where numerous other political detainees have been held.In written testimony to the United Nations in 2020, seen by AFP, her family said her detention was likely due in large part to her "record as an outspoken critic of abuses".She was also deemed an ally of Mohammed bin Nayef, the written testimony added.In November 2017, a vast anti-corruption campaign saw Riyadh's luxury Ritz-Carlton hotel serve for three months as a de facto detention centre for dozens of princes and senior officials suspected of graft or disloyalty.In March 2020, the royal guard arrested King Salman's brother and nephew, accusing them of fomenting a coup against Prince Mohammed, according to several sources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imprisoned-without-charge-saudi-princess-freed-after-3-years-report-101641650731119.html

08-01-2022||World||Canada health official warns of Omicron’s strain on hospitals||Canada’s chief public officer on Friday said there has been no “explosive rate” of rise in serious illness in the country during the fifth wave of the Covid pandemic, driven by the highly transmissible Omicron variant, but warned that the “enormous volume of cases” it is causing is expected to add an additional strain on the health care system. “Although evidence from ongoing surveillance and recent studies indicates that the risk of hospitalisation is lower for Omicron compared to Delta,the sudden acceleration of Omicron”, which is now the dominant variant in Canada, will impact the system because of “increased hospital admissions and high numbers of illness and absenteeism among health care workers, which is expected to impact many areas of the country over the coming weeks,” said Dr Theresa Tam.In light of the surge in cases, with 44,309 new infections reported on Friday, Canada’s health minister Jean-Yves Duclos said vaccine mandates could become necessary.“What we see now is that our health care system in Canada is fragile, our people are tired, and the only way that we know to get through Covid-19, this variant and any future variant, is through vaccination,” he said during a briefing on Friday. At least 41,743 new cases were reported daily across Canada between December 30 and January 5, an increase of 65% over the previous week. An average of 3,646 people were being treated in hospitals each day during that period, which is 91% increase over the previous week, and, on average, 594 people were being treated in intensive care units, 25% higher than the week before, according to a release from Tam.Over nine million booster doses of Covid-19 vaccines have already been administered in the country, while 83% of the total population has received at least one dose and over 77% are fully vaccinated. But seven million still remain to be vaccinated.Vaccine certification is already required in many jurisdictions to access gyms, bars, restaurants, sports, and entertainment events, among others. The province of Quebec will add entry into liquor and cannabis stores to that list soon. The central government has mandated vaccinations for its employees, and for travel by air, on some trains, and on cruise ships.

Here's what WHO says||The Omicron variant has been causing a surge in the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) infection across the world. The number of hospitalisations is less, but the spread of infection is faster, owing to a high number of mutations the Omicron possesses.This begs a question: Can the Omicron variant reinfect a person? Health experts and the World Health Organization (WHO), which keeps an eye on the new and emerging variants of the constantly mutating coronavirus, have said that the possibility of reinfection is high.In a note published on the Omicron variant, the WHO said that the variant can evade previous immunity in people and can still infect those who have had Covid-19 in the past. It sounded an alarm for people who are unvaccinated, and those who were vaccinated many months ago.“Individuals who have recovered from Covid-19 are 3 to 5 times more likely to be reinfected with Omicron compared to Delta,” the WHO said in the note released on its website last month.It, however, added that there is still no proof that Omicron causes more severe disease than the Delta variant, which led to a devastating second wave of infection last year.The WHO said that the virus has been transmitted mostly among adults in their 20s and 30s, spreading initially in large cities and in clusters associated with social and workplace gatherings.However, some studies have confirmed the silver lining of the Omicron variant. News agency Bloomberg reported earlier this week that a combination of widespread immunity and numerous mutations have resulted in a virus that causes far less severe disease than previous iterations.The Bloomberg report was based on the ongoing studies being conducted on Omicron, including in South Africa where the variant first emerged.One of the crucial factors which makes Omicron less virulent is that it does not infect the lungs as easily as the previous variants. One such study was published by a consortium of Japanese and American scientists, who experimented on mice and hamsters. Another study in Belgium reported similar outcomes in hamsters, which experienced severe illness with previous mutations of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-recovered-covid-19-patients-be-reinfected-with-omicron-here-s-what-who-says-101641609966490.html
08-01-2022||World||Can booster shots beat the coronavirus? Read what experts have to say||The Omicron variant of coronavirus has created an unprecedented situation, leading to surge in Covid-19 infection and increasing the vaccination doses. Many countries across the world are asking people to take a third – or the booster shot – to tackle the heavily mutated Omicron.Israel has gone a step further and is giving a fourth dose of Covid-19 vaccine to its population. India has also launched a programme to inoculate an eligible group of people with the precautionary dose.But is this the way forward? And do we have to take a booster shot every few months? The healthcare experts and researchers have been baffled by the constantly mutating coronavirus and have been advocating increasing the vaccine coverage. But in many interviews, these experts have said that trying to boost the entire population every few months is not realistic.Akiko Iwasaki, professor of immunobiology at Yale University and one of the most authoritative voices on Covid-19, told New York Times that “there are better ways than doing boosters every six months”.“This doesn’t seem to be a sustainable long-term strategy, for sure,” said another immunologist Deepta Bhattacharya, from the University of Arizona.Booster shots were advocated to increase the immunity against the coronavirus, looking at the frequent mutations it is coming up with. But there is no data to support the effectiveness of this dose.The boost to the immunity has been temporary, with some studies in the United States pointing to a drop in antibody levels just weeks after a third dose.“Even with that amount of antibody, it’s very hard to stop the virus for very long. It’s a much higher bar now than before, and maybe an Omicron-specific vaccine would do a better job,” Shane Crotty, a virologist based in California told the New York Times.Late last year, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said that people might need a fourth Covid-19 shot sooner than expected due to the Omicron variant. The statement came days after Pfizer and BioNTech released results of a study which showed that a third shot of the vaccine is effective against Omicron, but a two-dose regime saw its ability to protect dropping significantly against the heavily-mutated virus.But in the United States, the worst affected country, Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that it’s too early to discuss a potential fourth dose of Covid-19 vaccine.Singapore's Health Minister Ong Ye Kung reiterated the same thought in a Facebook post on Friday. "If you have recovered well from an infection, without complications, your immune system would have gone through a strong stimulus. Think of it as a fairly powerful vaccination shot," he said.Ong said there is no rush to get boosted for those who have been infected and then vaccinated, or those who have been infected in between vaccine doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-booster-shots-beat-the-coronavirus-read-what-experts-have-to-say-101641609201715.html

08-01-2022||World||Arbery killers get life in prison; no parole for father, son||Three white men convicted of murder for chasing and killing Ahmaud Arbery were sentenced to life in prison Friday, with a judge denying any chance of parole for the father and son who armed themselves and initiated the deadly pursuit of the 25-year-old Black man.Superior Court Judge Timothy Walmsley said Arbery left his home for a jog and ended up running for his life for five minutes as the men chased him until they finally cornered him. The judge paused for a minute of silence to help drive home a sense of what that time must have felt like for Arbery, whose killing became part of a larger national reckoning on racial injustice.“When I thought about this, I thought from a lot of different angles. I kept coming back to the terror that must have been in the mind of the young man running through Satilla Shores,” he said, mentioning the neighborhood where Arbery was killed.Greg and Travis McMichael grabbed guns and jumped in a pickup truck to chase Arbery after spotting him running in their neighborhood outside the port city of Brunswick on Feb. 23, 2020. Their neighbor, William “Roddie” Bryan joined the pursuit in his own truck and recorded cellphone video of Travis McMichael firing close-range shotgun blasts into Arbery.“Ahmaud Arbery was then hunted down and shot, and he was killed because individuals here in this courtroom took the law into their own hands,” the judge said. Walmsley ordered the McMichaels to serve life without parole and granted Bryan a chance to earn parole after serving at least 30 years in prison.A few dozen supporters cheered Arbery’s family as they exited onto the courthouse steps Friday afternoon.“Today your son has made history, because we have people who are being held accountable for lynching a Black man in America!” said Benjamin Crump, a civil attorney representing the family.Murder carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison under Georgia law unless prosecutors seek the death penalty, which they opted against in this case. During the sentencing hearing, Arbery's family had asked the judge to show no lenience in deciding whether to grant an eventual chance at parole.Arbery's sister recalled his humor, describing him as a positive thinker with a big personality. She told the judge her brother had dark skin “that glistened in the sunlight," thick, curly hair and an athletic build, factors that made him a target for the men who pursued him.“These are the qualities that made these men assume that Ahmaud was a dangerous criminal and chase him with guns drawn. To me, those qualities reflect a young man full of life and energy who looked like me and the people I loved," Jasmine Arbery said.Arbery's mother said she suffered a personal, intense loss made worse by a trial where the defense was that her son had made bad choices that led to his death.“This wasn’t a case of mistaken identity or mistaken fact. They chose to target my son because they didn’t want him in their community. They chose to treat him differently than other people who frequently visited their community,” Wanda Cooper-Jones said. "And when they couldn’t sufficiently scare or intimidate him, they killed him.”The sentences matched the recommendation of prosecutor Linda Dunikoski, who said all deserved the mandatory life sentence for showing “no empathy for the trapped and terrified Ahmaud Arbery.”Contending the McMichaels still believed they didn’t do anything wrong, Dunikoski disclosed Friday that Greg McMichael gave Bryan's cellphone video of the shooting to an attorney, who leaked it.“He believed it was going to exonerate him,” the prosecutor said.The McMichaels' defense attorneys argued that their clients deserved the possibility of parole because the killing was an unplanned, unintentional act. Bryan's lawyer said he showed remorse and cooperated with police, turning over the cellphone video of the shooting to help them get to the truth.“Mr. Bryan isn’t the one who brought a gun,” Kevin Gough said. “He was unarmed. And I think that reflects his intentions.”Bryan is 52, raising the chances that he will spend the remainder of his life in prison even with the chance of parole after serving 30 years.The guilty verdicts against the men handed down the day before Thanksgiving prompted a victory celebration outside the Glynn County courthouse. In addition to murder, all three men were also convicted of aggravated assault, false imprisonment and criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment. Travis and Greg McMichael were each sentenced to an additional 20 years for aggravated assault.Defense attorneys have said they plan to appeal the convictions. They have 30 days after sentencing to file them.Next month, the McMichaels and Bryan face a second trial, this time in U.S. District Court on federal hate crime charges.

Though the investigation in the behaviour of the new strain is still in a very early stage, researchers have found very little to raise concern.The study, yet to be peer-reviewed, has been published on MedRxiv. In it, the researchers said that “it is still early to speculate on the IHU variants as the number of cases is extremely low”.Also Read | Explained: When was IHU variant first discovered and its spreadEarlier this week, then World Health Organization (WHO) also said that the ‘IHU’ variant has not become much of a threat as of now.The new variant was first identified in November and has been on WHO’s radar since then. It has so far not been labelled as a 'variant under investigation' by the global health body.The latest study has, however, advised keeping an eye on the ‘IHU’ variant.For now, the world’s focus is on the Omicron variant, which is leading to a surge in the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) infection across the world. The United States and Europe are badly hit by the Omicron strain.The IHU variant has 46 mutations and 37 deletions in its genetic code, more than Omicron. Many of these affect the spike protein.The variant is a sub-lineage of the B.1.640 and its discovery was announced by researchers from Méditerranée Infection in Marseille, part of France’s Instituts hospitalo-universitaires (IHU, or University Hospital Institutes) - hence the name. It has been classified as B.1.640.2.The IHU variant was discovered in November, in a sample of a man who visited Cameroon in Africa on a three-day trip.He began experiencing respiratory symptoms and was tested for Covid-19. The sample returned positive, with the presence of the B.1.640.2 variant.A localised spread of the infection was reported in France and attributed to the IHU strain, Vinod Scaria, a scientist of Delhi's Institute of Genomic and Integrative Biology, said on Twitter that there is no proof of that.The B.1.640, meanwhile, is not new. According to outbreak.info, it was first detected on January 1, 2021, and 400 infections have been identified till now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-ihu-variant-not-spreading-far-enough-cases-extremely-low-says-study-101641601388251.html

But a diplomatic solution is still possible and preferable if Russia chooses it," Blinken told reporters ahead of talks Monday in Geneva.Blinken said that Russia, which has amassed tens of thousands of troops along the border with Ukraine, was "gaslighting" the world by making demands."No one should be surprised if Russia instigates a provocation or incident then tries to use it to justify military intervention, hoping that by the time the world realizes the ruse it'll be too late," Blinken said.Russia asked for the talks after putting forward proposals that include guarantees that NATO will not expand to Ukraine or further parts of the former Soviet Union."I think that's certainly part of the playbook -- to put out a list of absolutely non-starter demands and then to claim that the other side is not engaging and then to use that is somehow justification for aggressive action," Blinken said."But the fact of the matter is -- Russia knows well what is a non-starter."He said that the focus of talks will be Russia's "aggression toward Ukraine.""We won't be diverted from that issue. Because what's happening in Ukraine is not only about Ukraine, it's part of a broader pattern of destabilizing, dangerous and often illegal behavior by Moscow as it tries to build a sphere of influence that covers the countries that were once under Soviet dominion," Blinken said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-can-still-choose-diplomatic-solution-on-ukraine-says-blinken-101641580754360.html
08-01-2022||World||US: Joe Biden to deliver first State of the Union address on March 1||President Joe Biden will deliver his first State of the Union address on March 1, the White House confirmed on Friday, after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent the president a formal invitation to speak to Congress and the American public one year into his term.It will mark the latest any president has delivered a State of the Union address. The speech is normally timed for January, and occasionally for February. The delay is driven in part by a busy legislative calendar, a winter spike in Covid-19 cases from the more transmissible Omicron variant and the upcoming Winter Olympics, which ties up broadcast network time.The last State of the Union address was delivered by then-President Donald Trump on the eve of his acquittal by the Senate in his first impeachment trial.Joe Biden first addressed a joint session of Congress in April 2021, about 100 days into his time in the White House, which he used to promote twin infrastructure and domestic spending bills. Biden signed a slimmed-down and bipartisan version of the infrastructure proposal into law last year in crowning first-year legislative achievements. The larger expansion of the social safety net passed the House, but Biden has struggled to secure enough Democratic support in the Senate for passage.An address to Congress in the president’s first year is not an official State of the Union address, and Biden’s April speech bore little resemblance to one because of strict Covid-19 protocols. It was marked by limitations on attendance, with no guests allowed, and lawmakers seated on both the floor of the House chamber and the galleries above. Officials said pandemic precautions for this year’s speech were still being worked out, though they expect it to look more like a traditional State of the Union address than last year’s remarks.“Thank you for your bold vision and patriotic leadership which have guided America out of crisis and into an era of great progress, as we not only recover from the pandemic but Build Back Better!,” Pelosi wrote in her letter to Biden. “In that spirit, I am writing to invite you to address a Joint Session of Congress on Tuesday, March 1, to share your vision of the State of the Union.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-joe-biden-to-deliver-first-state-of-the-union-address-on-march-1-101641580429239.html

The chief minister added that as many as 39 mines have been identified in the limits of Lemru Elephant Corridor and the question of quarrying in these mines does not arise, officials said on Saturday. “No further activities would take place in the mines falling under this area which were found by Chhattisgarh or other states. Information regarding the same has already been sent to the Government of India, when the Lemru Elephant Reserve was published,” he said. Sudeip Shrivastva, an environmental lawyer commenting on Baghel’s statement said the decision of Chhattisgarh government asking the Centre to withdraw Gidhmuri Paturia and Madanpur South Coal Blocks from mining list is certainly a good one but they also need to answer as to why Parsa, Kete Extension, Tara and Parsa (East) and Kete Basan (PEKB) blocks have been kept out of Final Reserve Boundary. “Except PEKB, all these blocks were part of proposed 3827 sq km Lemru Reserve. Tara has dense forest mostly and Kete Extension is 98% dense forest. Like Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan too ask for alternate block in Madhya Pradesh which will reduce transporting cost as well. But it seems private corporate are influencing decisions,” Shrivastva said. In July 2021, cabinet agreed that Lemru Elephant project will be of 1995 sq km area. The Chhattisgarh government has been considering the extension of Lemru elephant reserve area. Activists want the entire catchment area of Hasdeo River to be included in the reserve, which are natural habitat of elephant, and migratory corridor should be kept free from mining. The plan to set up the elephant reserve across 450 sq km was conceived by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government led by Raman Singh in 2005. In two years, it got the approval of the Union government. But the project never took off. The Bhupesh Baghel government revived the plan after the change of guard in 2018, initially proposing to set up the elephant reserve in north Chhattisgarh across 450 sq km. In 2020, the Chhattisgarh government decided to expand the proposed reserve to 1,995 sq km and later, initiated another proposal to increase the size further to 3720 sq km in mineral-rich north Chhattisgarh. However, the activists working in Chhattisgarh raised question over the 1995 square kilometer area of Elephant Reserve. “The 1995 sq km Lemru area map has been created in a way that most of the Hasdeo Arand coal blocks are out of its outer boundary. Obviously, the coal blocks like Parsa, Kete Extension, Gidhmuri and Paturia Dand are out of Reserve. The main catchment of Hasdeo Bango Dam is at huge risk and mining interest has prevailed over farmers and tribals,” said Shrivastva.

The results of the elections, the first set of regional polls being held with initial campaigning restricted to virtual events, will be announced on March 10.BJP president JP Nadda said the party will again get the blessings of the people. “I urge all the BJP workers to participate in this great festival of democracy with vigour and by following the Covid protocol guidelines given by the Election Commission,” he tweeted.Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav appealed to the Election Commission to ensure that regional parties get proper space on digital platforms. He said the BJP was dominating on the digital medium because of its governments at the Centre and in Uttar Pradesh, and its vast financial resources.Amid a surge in Covid-19 cases, the Election Commission has banned election rallies, roadshows, and street corner meetings till January 15. Chief election commissioner Sushil Chandra said the body will then review the situation on January 15 and take a call on allowing public rallies.The BJP hit back at Yadav’s remarks by saying that someone who claimed to be a “techno expert” was now “running away” from digital platforms.Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said the party was sure of forming the government in the state again with an overwhelming majority based on the achievements of the “double engine” government. He was referring to the BJP’s rule at the Centre and in the state.His rival, Yadav, posted couplets such as “revolution will happen on March 10 and Uttar Pradesh will see a change” to take on the BJP. The Congress, which is hoping to improve its fortunes in UP, said the party will defeat BJP governments in four states in the upcoming polls.Party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said: “On March 10 (the election results day), there will be a victory march for the youth, farmers, women, workers, traders and common people of UP. In these elections, the Congress party will fight for the rights of youth, farmers, women, workers, traders and common people. UP will fight and will win.”The Trinamool Congress, fighting for the first time in the Goa assembly polls, tweeted: “Goa is chanting in unison, “Don Fulancho Kaal, Goenchi Navi Sakal”. Stay tuned, #ANewDawnForGoa is just around the corner.”While Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, who’s in charge of Punjab, announced that the BJP is “fully prepared for the polls”, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the poll dates were announced on Saturday, but the “result has already been declared”.“In all five states the Congress will give a tough fight in this election and will retain the government in Punjab. In the four BJP-ruled states, the Cong will drub the BJP governments,” he said.“A golden opportunity has come to all five states. People are in distress because of soaring inflation. They will give a befitting reply to the BJP. For farmers, in Punjab and UP there is an opportunity to punish the BJP that has kept the man in Union government involved in death of farmers in Lakhimur Kheri,” Surjewala said.Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said his party, which is contesting in Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, is “fully prepared” for the polls.“Aam Aadmi Party is fully prepared to enter the polls now that elections dates have been announced. The AAP is going among the people with a resolve to fulfil all the basic needs including providing good education, health, electricity, water, employment to everyone. I am sure, people will vote on basic issues this time and will reject the hate politics based on caste, religion divides,” Kejriwal tweeted.Delhi deputy CM, and AAP leader, Manish Sisodia also welcomed the election commission’s decision to introduce virtual rallies for the polls. “Keeping in mind the safety of the people, everyone should cooperate with the decision taken. The AAP is preparing for the virtual rallies. We will do door-to-door campaigning and I am sure the election commission will review it as soon as Covid-19 subsides and then take an appropriate decision,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/contenders-confident-put-stock-in-digital-canvassing-strategies-101641666000898.html
08-01-2022||India||Delhi may see 35-70k Covid cases at peak, but hospitalisations to max out at 12k: IIT model||The number of Covid-19 cases in the national capital is expected to peak around January 15, with the number of daily infections reaching between 35,000 and 70,000, IIT scientists predicted on Saturday. The preliminary projections by scientists who modelled Sutra – a mathematical model developed at IIT Kanpur and IIT Hyderabad to predict a peak in Covid-19 cases – also noted that while the infection rate will be high, the peak bed requirement in Delhi will be less than 12,000. Initial data suggests the number of cases is likely to peak in Delhi between January 15 and January 20 to 35,000-70,000 cases daily on the basis of a seven-day average, the Sutra researchers said. “Hospital bed requirement is estimated to be 12,000 at its peak. It is assumed ~3.5% of the reported cases require hospitalisation for 5-8 days,” the projections, given to the Delhi government, said. Currently, with fewer than 1,600 Covid-19 patients hospitalised, Delhi has over 12,500 beds free, well within the peak of admissions predicted by the IIT model. Further, the Delhi government can scale the number of Covid-19 beds in the city to 37,000 within days if required, with a larger plan of amping up health care infrastructure to accommodate 65,000 hospitalisations currently in the works.In Mumbai, while the peak in cases is predicted to be around January 15-20, the cases are expected to rise to about 30,000 to 60,000 per day, and hospital bed requirement is also estimated to be around 10,000 at its peak. “What is important to note here is that there will only be around 12,000 hospital admissions even during the peak period. The Delhi government needs to keep a watch on hospital facilities. The numbers are not are alarming as it was during the second wave... Our estimates are projecting the worst-case scenario, so the situation is unlikely to be worse than that,” said Dr M Vidyasagar, SERB national chair, IIT- Hyderabad and member of the Sutra consortium. These predictions are being regularly monitored so that health infrastructure can be prepared for peak load, Delhi government officials said. “We are monitoring the cases very closely, and the peak in Delhi is likely in the next 7-8 days. However, we have been reiterating that the intensity of infections is mild, so the requirement of intensive care unit (ICU) beds, ventilators and oxygen could be less in Omicron infections as compared to what we saw during the Delta wave,” an official said, requesting anonymity. “But that does not mean that we get careless. Our aim should be to contain the peak infections to as low as we possibly can.” Bed occupancy in Delhi for Covid patients is less than 10% and the Capital has also substantially immunised people, pointed out Dr Suneela Garg, professor of excellence (community medicine) member of the Lancet Commission Covid India Task Force. The high vaccination rate along with relatively higher mask usage is likely to keep the infections milder in Delhi, and the number of daily infections could rise to around 35,000, she said. “In Delhi, more than 85% people have got their first dose of vaccination. The sero positivity in Delhi was also around 90% and our mask usage is also better,” Dr Garg said. “While we are expecting the cases to rise rapidly by around January 15, the peak daily cases are likely to be around 30,000-35,000. That said, the infection period currently is around five days, so the fall in the cases will also be as rapid.”Delhi on Saturday reported 20,181 cases, with the positivity rate going up to 19.6%.

Covid-19 cases in the national capital have risen more than five times in a week as a highly transmissible Omicron variant is raging across the country. "Around 5,000-10,000 self-testing kits are sold every day in Delhi and are in high demand," it reported quoting Delhi Retail Distribution Chemist Alliance (DRDCA) President Sandeep Nangia.People who are not able to get themselves tested in labs or those who are hesitant to go out for tests are among the majority of buyers of Covid self-testing kits.With demand for the kits rising, the shopkeepers have begun to face shortage as well. Kanav Nangia, co-owner of a local chemist in Delhi, the stock is not at par with the demand which results in the stock getting exhausted within a day.Though it is an advantage to have a kit handy to detect the disease at the earliest stage, a large number of people taking test at home might lead to discrepancy in data as positive cases are not being reported to the government actively.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has approved seven at-home Covid test kits so far. All these tests except one are nasal swab-based tests and are available with all chemists, online sites.Generally, these kits contain a sterile swab, disposable bag, a prefilled extraction tube and a test card. The self-testing kits available in the market are rapid antigen kits that give out the result in less than 30 minutes.The suspected patients are required to insert the swab stick in both their nostrils, then dip the swab into the extraction tube and put a few drops of the liquid from the tube onto the test card. The test provides a negative or a positive result with the help of the control lines on the test card.The cost of these kits range from ₹250 to ₹350.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sale-of-self-testing-kits-rises-in-delhi-as-covid-19-cases-spike-101641661011688.html

The company added “no serious adverse events” were reported .Announcing the trial results, the company said, “Six months after a two-dose Covaxin (BBV152) vaccination series, cell-mediated immunity and neutralising antibodies to both homologous (D614G) and heterologous strains (Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Delta plus) persisted above baseline, although the magnitude of the responses had declined.”Furthermore, neutralising antibodies against homologous and heterologous SARS-CoV-2 variants increased from 19 to 265 folds after a third vaccination, it added.Booster BBV152 vaccination is safe and may be necessary to ensure persistent immunity to prevent breakthrough infections, it added.Reactogenicity after vaccine and placebo was minimal and comparable, and no serious adverse events were reported, the company said referring to the trial results. "Based on emerging data, Bharat Biotech believes that a third dose may be beneficial to maintain the highest levels of protection," it added."These trial results provide a strong foundation towards our goal to provide Covaxin as a booster dose. Our goal of developing a global vaccine against COVID-19 has been achieved with Covaxin indicated for adults, children, two dose primary and booster doses. This enables use of the vaccine as a universal vaccine," Bharat Biotech Chairman and Managing Director Krishna Ella said.Bharat Biotech noted that Covaxin is formulated uniquely such that the same dosage can be administered to adults and children alike.On Friday, Bharat Biotech urged healthcare workers to ensure only Covaxin is being administered to the age group of 15-18 years, following reports of other vaccines, which have not been approved for children, being administered to the newly eligible group.India began vaccinating teenagers aged 15-18 against Covid-19 from January 3.

08-01-2022||India||Air Force official stabbed to death in East Champaran||BETTIAH: A junior warrant officer (JWO) of the Indian Air Force was stabbed to death allegedly by country-made liquor manufacturers at a village under Sangrampur police station in East Champaran district on Friday late evening, said the deceased Aditya Kumar’s brother-in-law Prabhakar Kumar. Speaking to HT over phone, Prabhakar Kumar said the incident occurred near Ghusiyar Bind Toli near Tiwari Tola village in Dakshiki Madhubani panchayat in Sangrampur block when he along with his father Chandeshwar Tiwari went to take stock of the situation of his agriculture field at around 7.30pm on Friday. “Some country liquor manufacturers had made his agriculture land as their route for ferrying chulai sharab (local word for country liquor) and as a result the crop was getting damaged,” said deceased’s brother-in-law, attributing the barricading of his agriculture field as the main dispute behind the murder. Aditya Kumar (44), a junior warrant officer (JWO) in 40 Wing of Indian Air Force, who was posted at Amritsar, was attacked with knife as soon as he reached his agriculture land along with his father Chandeshwar Tiwari. His father also suffered injuries in the attack, police said. Kumar was rushed to a local hospital. Later, he was referred to sadar hospital at Motihari where the doctors declared him brought dead. However, police denied the family members’ claim of involvement of country liquor manufacturers in the murder. When contacted, Abhinav Dhiman, SDPO Areraj said, “Few people have been picked up for interrogation and raids are on.” He, however, attributed the instant provocation over use of land for passage as the cause behind the attack. “In the case of preliminary investigation, we came to know the incident was result of instant provocation which occurred owing to crop damaged by few people who used it as a way to participate in kirtan (religious song ceremony). Further investigation into the matter is underway,” said DPO Areraj. Deceased’s father is yet to record his statement, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-force-official-stabbed-to-death-in-east-champaran-101641657718837.html

It should be less of an impact on the severity of the disease. We currently have in the models that we will release later, we expect about five lakh cases at the peak, which should come in during the next month," he added.As many experts in India say that the country has hybrid immunity due to which Omicron will be less effective, Dr Murray said: "What we know from a place like South Africa where there was a tremendous amount of prior infection, both Delta as well as Beta. Vaccination doses provide considerable protection for severe disease, from hospitalisation and death, which is why we think there will be many Omicron cases in India, but much less hospitalization and death than you had in the Delta wave."Speaking about the number of hospitalizations and severity due to the variant, he said: "We expect that 85.2 per cent of infections will have no symptoms. They will be asymptomatic, but amongst the cases, we still expect quite a number of them to end up in hospitals and in terms of death, cases will be much reduced. So we expect that the peak of hospital admissions in India will be about a quarter of what you had for the Delta wave, and deaths should be less of what you saw for Delta."According to some experts, further spread of Omicron may lead to other mutations. Talking about it Dr Murray said: "The thing about mutations is that they're random. So, the more transmission there is, the more potential there is for mutations to occur. But in the setting of this rapid transmission of Omicron, it's going to be very difficult in the next month or two for a new variant to meet Omicron because it's so transmissible."Dr Christopher Murray further spoke over the new variant with multiple mutations in France."There are mutations all the time, and you can identify variants with many mutations but the thing that we look for, is that within, you know, 30 to 45 days after a new mutation appears, has it spread as it spread like Omicron, so far, that mutation has been around for quite some time in France. And it has not spread so we are not currently learned about that mutation.""Omicron is 90 to 95 per cent, less severe, but there is still a segment of individuals, particularly older individuals who will get sick. So, there will be an increase. It's just a much smaller increase in hospitalizations," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/omicron-cases-to-peak-next-month-in-india-us-based-health-expert-101641651326143.html

There is no need to harbour any kind of misconceptions. RJD is a party which follows its principles and has never compromised on its ideals,” Yadav told a TV news channel. The 32-year-old heir apparent of the RJD, which is the main opposition party in Bihar, said Singh offered his party’s support to the JD(U) on the issue of conducting caste census in the state and it should not be misconstrued as a new political understanding or realignment with Kumar’s party. On Thursday, Singh said, “Remove those ministers (from the BJP) who are opposing the government. Nitish Kumar should not bow before the BJP. If there is any political impact to the government on the issues of caste census and special status to Bihar, the grand alliance is there to support him (chief minister).” Last year, a delegation of 10 parties, including the RJD, led by chief minister Nitish Kumar, met Prime Minister Narendra Modi to demand a caste census. After the Centre ruled out such an exercise, the CM has taken the stand of holding a caste count in Bihar at state’s cost and said a final decision will be taken only after an all-party meeting. Recently, chief minister Nitish Kumar said the date for the all-party meeting for the purpose will be finalised once the BJP gave its views on the matter. Yadav, however, said, “What is the need for calling an all-party meeting when the proposal of holding a caste census has been passed unanimously twice by the state assembly. Had I been the CM, I would have ordered a caste census in Bihar. The chief minister is sitting on the lap of the RSS and he would not do anything. He is a tired man and has no interest in development of the state,” Yadav said.

In the last 24 hours, the city recorded five deaths. About 82% of the fresh cases are asymptomatic which indicates the surge of Omicron over Delta in the city. A total of 133 Omicron cases were reported in Maharashtra on Saturday, taking the tally of Omicron cases in the state to 1,009Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said the need for hospitalisation and oxygen support was low. The state task force and the health department took note of this amid the rise in the number of daily cases and submitted their assessment to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.The hospitalisation data of the city reveals that the majority of those who have to get hospitalised are unvaccinated. “Out of the around 1,900 Covid patients who were on oxygenated beds, around 96% are unvaccinated and only 4% are vaccinated,” Brihanmumbai Corporation (BMC) municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal, citing data till January 6.Earlier, Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar had said when Mumbai's daily case would cross 20,000, more restrictions would be considered. “Even though 20,000-plus cases are being reported in the city regularly, more than 17,000 patients are asymptomatic. Out of the total available beds in Mumbai, more than 80% are still unoccupied and the demand for the oxygen beds is also very marginal,” the mayor clarified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-daily-infections-remain-above-20-000-no-major-change-from-yesterday-101641649540293.html
08-01-2022||India||Meet the viral, not virus Kovid||Yeh aapka real name hai kya? Abhi change kiya kya naam? – These are just a few amusing reactions that Bengaluru-based Kovid Kapoor is asked, ever since the pandemic hit, due to the stark similarity in his name and the Covid-19 virus. Inundated with calls since the last two days, the 31-year-old says that the last two years have made him conceal his real name whenever in a public place!“Unless I have to make a hotel reservation or book a ticket, I don’t give out my name,” says the co-founder of a travel website, adding, “Jahan pe naam itna important nahi hota, like a restaurant reservation, I make do with someone else’s name ya apna naam kuch aur bata deta hoon. I have already received some amusing reactions at the airport security and check in counters, many a times. Most of them are busy so they will laugh for a second, and then say something like: ‘Ye kya naam hai? Baad mein change kiya kya?” The similarity in names has even made holidaying a tricky affair for him. “After the first lockdown was lifted, we planned a trip and made a booking at a hotel. Within two hours, the hotel called me and went like, ‘Sir is this a joke? Yeh toh bahut hi funny naam hai! Are you sure?” laughs Kapoor, whose Twitter bio reads: ‘My name is Kovid and I’m not a virus.’He, however, wonders how his name suddenly started trending on social media, given that we are in the pandemic since almost two years now. Kapoor recalls, “The virus got the name Covid, in February 2020. At that time, a friend of mine sent me the WHO tweet and it was obvious that the name is similar to my name in terms of its pronunciation and spelling. It was certainly amusing to me then... But I don’t know what happened this time. I have been making and hearing so many jokes since the last one year, and some of them I tweeted three days ago and went to sleep. When I looked at my social media account again, it had gone absolutely crazy.”His wife is “not as amused” as him, he says, adding, “My wife is a bit tired of it already. She has been dealing with jokes on my name since the last two years. And since the last couple of days, I’ve been on my phone and laptop for something or the other almost all the time. So she’s sitting in the room, waiting for all this to get over!” The IIT Bombay graduate adds his parents are extremely thrilled with the sudden attention coming his way. “Yeh joke mere parents ko toh bahut saare log bolte hain: Aapko sapna aaya tha kya 1990 mein!” And as far as his employees are concerned, Kapoor informs that his team meetings can never been the same like the pre-pandemic times. He shares, “When we had team meetings to discuss the impact of Covid situation, it became quite amusing that the words Covid and Kovid would get mixed up so often that I had to lay extra emphasis in pronouncing them carefully and would often end up asking – Are you talking about Covid or Kovid?” Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meet-the-viral-not-virus-kovid-101641648656248.html

CNG prices will increase by ₹2.50 per kilogram and will now cost Rs.66 per kg. PNG will be available at Rs.39.50 per standard cubic meter (SCM) after the hike of ₹1.50 per SCM. The hike is the sixth increase in CNG and PNG prices from 2021 and the first in 2022. “In order to meet the shortfall in domestic gas allocation, MGL is sourcing additional market priced natural gas to cater to the increasing requirement of CNG and Domestic PNG segments. To partially offset the increase in the input cost of gas, MGL is constrained to increase the delivered price of CNG by Rs. 2.50/Kg and Domestic PNG by Rs.1.50/SCM in and around Mumbai,” said a statement by natural gas distribution company Mahanagar Gas Limited (MGL), an enterprise of GAIL Limited and Government of Maharashtra. Earlier, one kg of CNG was available at Rs.63.50 while PNG was available at Rs.38.00/SCM in Mumbai. Taxi associations have threatened to go on strike and have stated that if the state government does not increase the fare of black and yellow taxis then they would go on strike. “Taxi drivers cannot operate at a loss. We have already suffered a lot in 2021 and the price of CNG and PNG is increasing a lot. We have made representation to the state government and if the government does not increase the fare we will go on strike,” said AL Quadros, leader, Mumbai Taxi Men’s Union. Autorickshaw drivers’ associations have said that they would approach the state government demanding a reversal in the prices of CNG. “It is the job of the state government to ensure that the prices of CNG are not increased substantially. Fares cannot be increased as it will stretch the pockets of passengers more. We will approach the state government,” said Shashank Rao, president, Mumbai Autorickshaw Men’s Union.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cng-png-prices-hiked-in-mumbai-taxi-associations-threaten-to-go-on-strike-101641648296049.html

His remarks came a day after the West Bengal CM claimed that the project was already inaugurated by her government long time ago.“But no, neither your corona management is effective nor your statement about Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute in Kolkata,” Thakur wrote in a series of tweets in Hindi.Thakur also highlighted that Bengal is the second-worst affected state in terms of the Covid-19 spread, adding that Mamata should be worrying about it instead of indulging in subjects “she was not aware of”. दीदी @MamataOfficial जी ।अस्थायी कोविड सेंटर और विश्वस्तरीय कैंसर इंस्टीट्यूट में बहुत फर्क है और एक मुख्यमंत्री के रूप में आपसे अपेक्षा थी कि आप इस अंतर को जानती होंगी…1/3"Can you stop worrying about the credit and instead engage in Covid-19 management in the service of Bengal and maintain the dignity of the post?” he added.Following the inauguration of the institute, Banerjee yesterday reminded people that the project was associated with the state government as well. "The prime minister virtually inaugurated the project. But I would like to inform the PM that we had already inaugurated it earlier during the outbreak of pandemic when we needed a Covid centre. It helped us a lot,” news agency PTI quoted her as saying.“The PM will be happy to know that the state is funding 25 per cent of the project. We have also given 11 acre of land to the CNCI for the second campus,” she added.Banerjee, who attended the inauguration event virtually from her office, said she was invited twice by Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya.The second campus of CNCI has been built at a cost of over ₹530 crore, out of which around ₹400 crores have been provided by the Union government and the rest by the West Bengal government, in the ratio of 75:25. The campus is a 460 bedded comprehensive cancer centre unit with cutting-edge infrastructure for cancer diagnosis, staging, treatment, and care.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stop-worrying-about-credit-anurag-thakur-jabs-mamata-after-she-claims-credit-for-cancer-institute-in-kolkata-101641645562905.html

On Saturday, police said Niraj has claimed that he has been hacking and defacing websites, not only of Indian institutions but also of Pakistan. He also claimed he learnt hacking at a young age and has been doing this since the age of 15. Niraj was arrested on charges of developing Bulli Bai app which put out photos of Muslim women for auctioning. His father said Niraj used to remain always glued to his computer while his family members had no idea what he was up to. However, he said he had to visit his school principal on several occasions after Niraj's computer got confiscated but he had no idea what his son was doing on the computer. Questioning Niraj, police have come to know that he is a repeat offender, was active during the Sulli Deals investigation and had five different Twitter accounts. He has claimed to have hacked websites, police said.Watch | 'Loner, bright student': Who is Bulli Bai app creator Neeraj Bishnoi; His role in Sulli deals row exposedThe following Twitter handles have been identified, which are @giyu2002, @giyu007, @giyuu84, @giyu94 and @giyu44. Out of these, the account @giyu2002 has been found associated with one FIR registered in the Kishangarh police station of South West Delhi. Bishnoi, from the @giyu2002 Twitter handle, had made lewd comments and tweeted about auctions of women, DCP IFSO special cell, KPS Malhotra said.When the probe into Sulli Deals was going on, Bishnoi created a fake profile of a girl and tried to communicate with the investigation agency as a news reporter. Police said he was trying to plant some misinformation. This time too as three students were arrested in the Bulli Bai case, Bishnoi claimed on Twitter that he was the mastermind and manipulated his location as Nepal.Police said Niraj wanted to get publicity and there is a possibility that he was deeply involved in the Sulli Deals case. Niraj admitted to the crime and said he was proud of the app that he created. After his arrest, some old social media posts allegedly by Niraj on Quora have surfaced. The profile which apparently belongs to him replied to many questions mostly technology related. Some other questions he answeres were on Sunny leone, Aryan Khan- Navya Naveli fake MMS etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bulli-bai-niraj-bishnoi-claimed-he-has-been-hacking-sites-since-age-of-15-101641647603831.html

Pednekar earlier said that the city authorities will have to consider lockdown if daily Covid-19 cases cross 20,000. For the past two days, Mumbai has been reporting around 20,000 cases. On Friday, 20,971 new infections were reported in the city. However, on Saturday Pednekar said the number of hospitalisation is low and hence lockdown was not being imposed in the current situation. “Even though 20,000-plus cases are being reported in the city regularly, more than 17,000 patients are asymptomatic. Out of the total available beds in Mumbai more than 80% are still unoccupied and the demand for the oxygen beds is also very marginal,” she said.“We can see the transmission rate this time is higher and the positivity rate is also four times than what we have seen last year, but I urge Mumbaikars to not panic. The situation is well under control and there’s nothing to worry as the symptoms of the latest variant are mild and our medical infrastructure is well equipped to handle the cases. Instead, citizens must follow all the Covid appropriate behaviour and must not step out without their mask,” she said. Amidst the steady rise of Covid-19 cases, Pednekar visited the Covid-19 jumbo center at Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) on Saturday morning. The mayor was clad in PPE kit and went inside the facility to interact with the admitted patients.

On Friday evening, they decided to visit the new Bheraghat. The woman, Hansa Soni and her to-be daughter-in-law Riddhi Picchadia were taking selfies while standing on a rock. Hansa lost her control and fell into the Narmada river. Ridhi jumped in to save her. Both of them washed away in the strong current. During a search with the help of local swimmers, the body of Hansa Soni was found late on Friday evening while the body of Riddhi was found on Saturday.” The senior police officer said the bodies have been handed over to the family after the postmortem on Saturday. This was not the first such incident. Earlier in 2017, a boy slipped into the river while taking a selfie at Bheraghat and in a bid to save him, his sister jumped into the river and died. The district administration put a warning board for prohibiting selfies at the spot and also appointed divers to save the lives of people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-mumbai-women-drown-in-narmada-river-while-taking-selfie-101641638214508.html

A value of 4 means one infected person can spread the infection to four people, which signifies that the transmission of the infection is huge.Why is R-value 4 alarming?According to the health ministry, the R-value was 1.69 during the peak of the second wave. Earlier this week, the ministry noted that India's R-value already breached the peak of the second wave and reached 2.69. IIT Madras analysis said the R-value was close to 2.9 nationally between December 25 and December 31. From January 1 to 6, the value was recorded at 4.What Omicron peak in India could look like in terms of daily cases, bed requirement, experts predictDr Jayant Jha, Assistant Professor, Department of Mathematics, IIT Madras, told PTI that R-value depends on transmissibility probability, contact rate and the expected time interval in which infection can happen. The preliminary analysis has been done jointly by IIT Madras' Department of Mathematics and Centre of Excellence for Computational Mathematics and Data Science headed by Prof Neelesh S Upadhye and Prof S Sundar."Now, with the increase in quarantine measures or restrictions, maybe the contact rate will go down and then, in that case, R0 can decrease. So, based on our preliminary analysis, which is just based on the last two weeks, we can tell these numbers, but again, these numbers can change based on how much affirmative action is taken with respect to social gathering and all," he told PTI.What it means for 3rd waveThough the Centre has not termed the ongoing surge as the 3rd wave of the pandemic, it has acknowledged the exponential surge in the number of cases. State health ministers have said that the third wave has already set in. The IIT study predicts that the peak of the third wave will come between February 1 to 15.The study has also shown that compared to previous waves, there will be a faster and sharper increase to the peak in this wave. However, the impact of the huge vaccine coverage will make this wave different, though now there are fewer restrictions compared to teh first wave when a national lockdown was imposed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-r-naught-value-recorded-at-4-this-week-what-it-means-for-3rd-wave-101641633235722.html

Rijiju said the union home ministry has already asked Chakmas and Hajongs of Arunachal Pradesh to look for an alternative (state to stay) and urged them to support that decision.“Chakmas and Hajongs of Arunachal Pradesh do not come under the ambit of CAA because the Indian government legally brought them during 1964-1969 and settled them permanently under “Definite Plan of Rehabilitation”,” Arunachal Pradesh Chakma Students’ Union (APCSU) general secretary, Supon Chakma stated in a statement issued on Friday.He added that under this plan, the Centre, in consultation with the then North East Frontier Agency (NEFA) administration (now Arunachal Pradesh) allotted 5 acres of land to each Chakma and Hajong Family and provided them ration cards, jobs, gun license, business license, among others.“The Chakmas and Hajongs came to NEFA (now Arunachal Pradesh) much before the 31 December 2014 as cut off year of CAA and the Chakmas and Hajongs are governed by the Citizenship Act of 1955, not the CAA 2019 and hence they do not come under CAA,” he added.Chakmas and Hajongs, who are Buddhists and Hindus, migrated to India between 1964 and 1966 from Chittagong Hills Tract (CHT) of then East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) to escape religious persecution and were settled in NEFA. They were settled with a rehabilitation plan, allotted land and provided with financial assistance depending on the size of their families to help rebuild their lives. As per the 2011 Census, there are 47,471 Chakmas and Hajongs in Arunachal Pradesh. In two judgments in 1996 and 2015, the Supreme Court directed the central and state government to protect the life and liberty of Chakmas and Hajongs under Article 21 of the Indian constitution and confer citizenship to around 14,888 Chakmas and Hajongs who have been left out. Last month, Chakmas and Hajongs accused the Arunachal Pradesh government of conducting racial profiling of their communities through an exclusive census scheduled to start this month. Authorities in Arunachal Pradesh’s Changlang district, where this census was supposed to take place, however, insisted that there is no immediate plan for such an exercise and the issue is just at a proposal stage. In Friday’s statement, Drishyamuni Chakma, president of APCSU strongly opposed and condemned any such so-called alternative or relocation outside Arunachal Pradesh. “We have been living in Arunachal Pradesh for almost 6 decades i.e. 60 years and we have built our home and hearth. Arunachal Pradesh has become our motherland and relocating us outside is not acceptable,” he stated.

Police were searching for accused, Dina Dinesh and ‘Biscuit’ Mohammed Moideen, on charges of murdering M Karthik alias ‘Appu’ Karthik (32) and S Mahesh (22) on Thursday night. “The entire night we were searching for them,” said inspector general of the North Zone, Santhosh Kumar, adding that Dinesh and Moideen attacked the police. “They attacked the police using a machete and a country-made bomb.”Head constable Suresh Kumar and police constable Bharath Kumar were injured. “The police personnel have cut wounds,” he said. “Inspector Ravi Kumar was on the spot and he opened fire.”The incident took place near a bridge in the Palar river basin at around 8.10am. Police have recovered a total of five crude bombs from this location. “They flung two country-made bombs on the police out of which one exploded and one didn’t,” said another investigating officer, not willing to be named. Forensics experts were also on the spot to collect the evidence. The double murders were linked to previous enmity, police said. While two of the accused were killed in the police firing, two others, Madhu Madhavan and a woman Jessica, were arrested. Police said they belong to the same gang and are being questioned. “We will also probe deeper and find out who was making the country-made bombs for them,” the investigating officer said. The motive behind the murders were a past rivalry dating back to 2018. Dinesh was against his sister’s relationship with Appu Karthik, an officer said. So Karthik sent two of his friends including Mahesh to ask Dinesh to stay out of their relationship.“Mahesh attacked Dinesh at that time and a case was registered in 2018,” the officer said. “That case came for hearing in court on Thursday so at that time Appu Karthik told Dinesh not to appear in court and asked him to withdraw from the case. Dinesh got enraged and committed the crime against Karthik and Mahesh last night.”

08-01-2022||India||Indian-origin Sikh taxi driver assaulted, his turban knocked off at JFK Airport||In a yet another case of suspected hate crime, an Indian-origin Sikh taxi driver in the US has been assaulted by an unidentified man, who knocked off his turban and also used expletives against him outside the JFK International Airport here, according to a video on social media.The undated 26-second video was uploaded by Navjot Pal Kaur on micro-blogging site Twitter on January 4, showing a man assaulting the Sikh taxi driver outside the airport. She said the video was shot by a bystander at the airport.The person can be heard allegedly using expletives against the victim. He repeatedly hits and punches him and knocks off his turban.“This video was taken by a bystander at John F. Kennedy International Airport. I do not own the rights to this video. But I just wanted to highlight the fact that hatred continues to remain in our society and unfortunately I’ve seen Sikh cab drivers get assaulted again and again,” Kaur tweeted.Further details about the driver or the cause of the incident were not available.The video led to angry reactions by the community members.“Another Sikh cab driver assaulted. This one at JFK Airport in NYC. So upsetting to see. But it’s crucial that we don’t look away… What I am sure of is how painful it is to watch our fathers and elders get assaulted while they’re just trying to live an honest life.“For those who aren’t Sikh, I can’t put into words what it means to have your turban knocked off — or to see someone else’s turban knocked off. It’s visceral and gut-wrenching and just so disheartening to witness,” Simran Jeet Singh, author and Director for the Aspen Institute’s Inclusive America Project, tweeted.The National Sikh Campaign said, “we are only a few days into the new year and there has already been a hate crime committed against a Sikh. A bystander recorded an unidentified man attacking a Sikh taxi driver, ultimately knocking off the driver’s turban.”“No additional details have been released outside of the video, but we know this story too well. A Sikh person goes about their daily lives only to be senselessly attacked by someone. Common road rage between people can escalate when someone who is ignorant of who we are takes their disdain for our turbans and becomes violent,” it said.This is not the first time a Sikh taxi driver has been assaulted in the US.An Indian-origin Sikh Uber driver was in 2019 assaulted and racially abused in the US state of Washington in a suspected hate crime. The driver told the police that he believes his race promoted the attack.In 2017, a 25-year-old Sikh cab driver in New York was assaulted and his turban knocked off by drunk passengers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indianorigin-sikh-taxi-driver-assaulted-his-turban-knocked-off-at-jfk-airport-101641630978900.html

Saturday too was that special day when it launched a special animated doodle on the the 80th birth anniversary of the renowned English theoretical physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking.Much to the delight of many internet users, the doodle also featured a two-and-a-half-minute YouTube video narrated in the computer-generated voice of Hawking.About the latest Google doodleThe doodle depicts an animated avatar of Hawking and the letters are stylised to match the theme. Clicking on the doodle leads the users to a YouTube video.In the video, Hawking’s voice is used to narrate his life, the neurodegenerative disease and his journey to understand the universe. “My goal is simple. It is a complete understanding of the universe, why is it as it is? Why it exists at all?” Hawking’s voice could be heard as saying in the video.‘History’s most influential scientific mind’In its description about the doodle, Google said, “Today’s video Doodle celebrates one of history’s most influential scientific minds, English cosmologist, author, and theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking. From colliding black holes to the Big Bang, his theories on the origins and mechanics of the universe revolutionized modern physics while his best-selling books made the field widely accessible to millions of readers worldwide.”“Here’s to an innovator whose astronomical impact changed how the world understands the universe!,” it added.Further, Google has also thanked Hawking’s family in making the doodle and also published a note from the physicist’s daughter Lucy and sons Robert and Tim Hawking.“In the Doodle, the voice of Stephen Hawking was generated and used with the approval of the Hawking estate,” it also said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stephen-hawking-s-80th-birthday-how-google-doodle-is-honouring-the-physicist-101641621590185.html
08-01-2022||India||Khalistan separatists plan to show PM Modi as anti-Punjab||It was the run-up to voting in historic 2014 elections, when I went for an interview with then BJP president Amit Shah to Amritsar, from where his very close friend Arun Jaitley was locked in an electoral contest with then Congress leader Captain Amarinder Singh. As the aircraft banked towards Raja Sansi airport and the Golden Temple appeared on the ground, he told me that he would first like to pay obeisance at Harmandir Sahib before going to meet Jaitley for an election meeting cum lunch. Before reaching the Temple, Shah told me that he had done “Kar Sewa” as a teenager for two weeks after the complex was damaged post-1984 Operation Blue Star. Shah said: “Had it not been for them, we would not be here today.” At the Harmandir Sahib, Shah remained prostrated on ground for a while as he paid obeisance to the Holy Guru Granth Sahib. He did the parikrama and then left to meet Arun Jaitley for a Kadi Chawal lunch. The Amritsar election turned out to be an interesting with Jaitley’s protégé then sitting BJP MP from the Holy City Navjot Singh Sidhu staying out of campaign and his wife and sitting MLA Navjot Kaur Sidhu sulking through out the campaign. The internal sabotage ensured that Captain won the election with a handsome margin.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has the same views towards the Sikh community and misses no opportunity to pay his absolute reverence to the Gurus, be it in Punjab or Bihar. He also believes that Sikh community is the key to India’s integrity and prosperity. It is for this very reason that he rolled back the three farm laws on Guru Purab and ask for apology from the farmers for not being able to explain the laws and their benefit to them.Under the mask of farmers, the pro-Khalistan separatists are playing a diabolical game against India while sitting in plush environments of US, UK, Germany, and Canada. While one also understands that the game of these western countries is to keep India on its toes and tenterhooks, the larger plot is to discredit the PM and the BJP before the eyes of the Sikh and Punjabi community in India. This also serves to the electoral interest of all the political adversaries of the BJP in Punjab.Despite the extreme provocation of exposing PM Modi to a possible extremist threat from Sikh groups, very active across the border with support of Pakistani deep state, at Ferozepur, the BJP and the government will not fall into the trap of making it a communal issue. The top leadership of the RSS also understands the play very well and it is for this very reason that the BJP did not part with the Akali Dal in the previous Assembly elections in spite of open anti-incumbency against the Prakash Singh Badal regime. The Modi government and the national security planners understand the sensitivities of a border state like Punjab and also know the actors in play to create tension in the state.While it will rein in any comment from either the government or the party that can be misconstrued, India will make an all-out diplomatic effort to bring full force of justice to banned SFJ leaders like G S Pannu in US and Multani in Germany. The security agencies on the other hand have already begun to weed out the enemy within Punjab so that arms, ammunition, and Afghan heroin do not find their way from across Pakistan to fund and promote militancy in the state. With Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan facing a battle for his political survival, it is quite evident that the pressure will be deflected towards India in the coming days.Although there is absolute need to bring those who are fanning so-called Khalistan flames to book, the security agencies should also do a security review of PM Modi’s protection as 20 minutes of exposure (on Ferozepur flyover on January 5) for the most targeted man in India, thanks to inept enforcement agencies, is criminal.

Maharashtra, Delhi, West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka account for the most number of active cases in the country.The daily positivity rate of India has now reached 9.28%, while the weekly positivity rate stands at 5.66%.Also Read | 96% patients on oxygen support in Mumbai hospitals are unvaccinated: BMC chiefNew deaths due to Covid-19 continue to see a decline after 285 patients succumbed to the disease, down from Friday's 302.

This shows that the trend of increasing fresh recoveries in the country remains static, which also provides relief in the grim scenario.This rise in daily infections is being driven by the Omicron variant, which was first discovered in South Africa. Since being detected in India in December last year, cases of the highly transmissible variant have topped 3,000. The Omicron tally of the country rose to 3,071 on Saturday, with Maharashtra and Delhi holding the top slots with 876 and 513 cases, respectively.Also Read | Can recovered Covid-19 patients be reinfected with Omicron?

The long patience of positive response of the NSCN/GPRN (Government of the People’s Republic of Nagaland) cannot be considered as weakness rather than humility,” the statement said.The state government didn’t respond to the statement.Last September, the outfit issued a statement demanding the Naga MLAs of the three districts, Tirap, Changlang and Longding, withdraw support to the BJP government led by Pema Khandu and Chowna Mein. The three districts have 11 legislators, three of who are cabinet ministers. “The MLAs who fail to uphold the rights of the Nagas of Arunachal Pradesh would be considered anti-Naga,” the statement in September said.The demand was in reaction to a circular issued by the Longding district authorities informing about the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order Amendment Bill, 2021 removing the term “Any other Naga tribe”.The circular followed the passage of the bill in Parliament in August where the list of scheduled tribes in Arunachal Pradesh was amended (on the recommendations of the state government) to add several indigenous tribe names and deleted the words “any other Naga tribe” (which was there prior to amendment).The NSCN-IM’s September statement said the move “wilfully undermined, distorted the rights, identity and denied the existence of the Naga people”.
08-01-2022||India||‘Will do everything possible to defeat BJP’: Mahua Moitra amid Goa alliance buzz||PANAJI: The Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Friday hinted at a possible alliance with other opposition parties in Goa ahead of the upcoming polls with party MP Mahua Moitra in a Twitter post announcing that the TMC is willing to do “everything possible to defeat BJP in Goa”. “Rest assured, we the AITC will do everything possible to defeat BJP in Goa- @Goaforwardparty, @INCGoa @AITC4Goa and #MGP. @Mamataofficial (AITC chairperson Mamata Banerjee) has done it in the past & will not shy away from walking [the] extra mile in Goa too,” Moitra tweeted on Friday. Moitra’s tweet comes amid reports in the state, which is scheduled to go to polls sometime in February/March, that the TMC-MGP (Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party), which have already announced an alliance for the polls, is open to teaming up with the Congress and Goa Forward Party, which have announced a separate alliance for the polls. The Goa Forward Party, which until recently was calling for need to “send joint ventures of ideological differences home” in reference to the seemingly contrary ideological leanings of the MGP and the Trinamool Congress, has now struck a more mellowed tone with party president Vijai Sardesai calling for ‘team Goa’ to defeat the “BJP game plan”.“@BJP4Goa will use #COVIDThirdWave restrictions to manipulate the electoral process to grab power. We must, along with @INCGoa, @AITC4Goa and #MGP must see this danger, rise above our egos, and thwart this plan to divide and rule. This is what #Goa wants,” Sardesai tweeted on Thursday evening suggesting that the three opposition parties in Goa and the TMC were looking at mending fences ahead of the polls.The Trinamool Congress, which is the latest entrant in Goa’s political space and mostly expanded through poaching members of the Congress and the Goa Forward party, is understood to have initiated talks with both the parties but the issue of seat sharing is yet to be discussed. Earlier, reports suggested that the MGP, which had agreed to an alliance with the TMC, was less than enthusiastic about its alliance with the TMC and was leaning towards the Congress. The ruling BJP has, however, scoffed at the idea, saying that any talk of alliance only went on to prove that opposition parties weren’t getting traction on the ground.“Because they cannot cut ice with the people of Goa, they are thinking of coming together and trying to cobble up some numbers. The idea of this alliance itself is a failed idea. Their motive is only to come to power. Since TMC-MGP could not get traction. What consolidation? You come in four months and you try and say you are going to fight. You work for five years, do something for the people of Goa. The BJP will get a full majority and this is frustrating the opposition. Out of sheer frustration she (Mahua Moitra) said that all parties will come together,” minister in the BJP government Vishwajit Rane said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-do-everything-possible-to-defeat-bjp-mahua-moitra-amid-goa-alliance-buzz-101641614811385.html
08-01-2022||India||SC asks Centre to respond on PIL demanding state-wise minority determination||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday gave the Centre a month to respond to a petition for classifying religious minorities based on their population in each state and transferred to itself similar petitions pending before three high courts.In August 2020, the court issued notice to the Centre on the petition filed by Delhi BJP leader and lawyer Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay but no response was forthcoming from the Centre. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appeared for the Centre on Friday and requested for a week’s time to file response.“Can you do it in one week as you have not been able to do it so far,” remarked a bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh. It, however, extended the time and said, “As a last opportunity, four weeks’ time is granted to file response.” Upadhyay in his petition challenged the validity of Section 2(f) of the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions (NCMEI) Act 2004, that gave unbridled powers to the Centre to restrict minority benefits to five religious communities namely Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Parsees. The petition asked that the Centre be told to lay down guidelines for the identification of minority communities at the state-level “to ensure that only those religious and linguistic groups which are socially, economically, politically non-dominant and numerically inferior, can establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.” The petition has made three union ministries - Home, Law and Justice, and Minority Affairs – as parties to the petition. The court agreed to take up the matter after seven weeks. In addition, the court took up a transfer petition filed by Upadhyay seeking transfer of petitions pending on this issue from the high courts of Delhi, Gauhati and Meghalaya. Senior advocate CS Vaidyanathan, who appeared for Upadhyay, informed the court that the petitioners in the three pending petitions have not objected to the transfer. The petition pending before the Delhi high court was filed by Upadhyay. “Since the same issues are pending in the high courts, notices have been served. There is no opposition. Transfer petitions are accordingly allowed.” According to Upadhyay’s petition, Hindus are merely 1% in Ladakh, 2.75% in Mizoram, 2.77% in Lakshadweep, 4% in Jammu and Kashmir, 8.74% in Nagaland, 11.52% in Meghalaya, 29% in Arunachal Pradesh, 38.49% in Punjab, and 41.29% in Manipur. He argued that benefits available to the minorities to establish and run institutions are misused by communities which are in the majority.“The classification of religious minorities by the Centre at pan-India level has not only created a wave of inequality across different states but also encouraged those who did not belong to that minority religion, to convert themselves for social, political and economic benefits,” the petition said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-asks-centre-to-respond-on-pil-demanding-state-wise-minority-determination-101641614212227.html
08-01-2022||India||Tamil Nadu CM Stalin to hold all-party meet today on state's exemption from NEET||Tamil Nadu chief minister and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) chief MK Stalin will hold an all-party meeting on Saturday in Chennai to discuss the state's demand of exemption from the National Eligibility cum Entrance Exam (NEET) and what needs to be done next on the matter.The decision to convene an all-party meet was announced by Stalin on Thursday during the Tamil Nadu assembly session. He said the assembly passed a resolution and bill in February last year against NEET in Tamil Nadu and sent the same to governor RN Ravi. “The governor is yet to send it to President Ram Nath Kovind for his assent,” the chief minister added.Speaking during the assembly session, Stalin further stated that coaching for the pre-medical entrance examination will also benefit “rich students.” “NEET exams have made school education costlier. We cannot remain mute spectators,” he added.The DMK-led all-party meet had also sought an appointment from Union home minister Amit Shah, however, Stalin alleged that he refused the same. The Tamil Nadu chief minister termed the refusal “anti-democratic.”Tamil Nadu political parties and the Centre have been at loggerheads regarding the NEET since it was mandated in the southern state from 2017 by the Supreme Court. The previous AIADMK regime in Tamil Nadu had passed a bill in 2017 seeking exemption from NEET but it was rejected by the President. The current DMK-led state government passed the Undergraduate Medical Degree Courses Bill, 2021 in the state assembly in September, with the consent of all parties barring the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).On December 28 last year, a delegation of MPs led by the DMK submitted a memorandum to the office of President Kovind on the delay in considering the bill passed in September. The President's office had told them that the memorandum has been sent to the Union home ministry. According to latest updates, the Centre is yet to take a call on the bill.Notably, the DMK-led MPs submitted the memorandum to the President after an RTI response from the Tamil Nadu governor's office revealed that the bill, which was first sent to him, is still under consideration.Meanwhile, during his maiden address in the state assembly on Wednesday, Ravi said that entrance tests like NEET create an “unequal platform” by being “inherently discriminatory against rural students.”The DMK's parliamentary leader TR Baalu was far from impressed as he told reporters that the governor must resign for not sending the bill to the President.The BJP, on the other hand, has called DMK's stance on the NEET issue as "double standards," claiming that Shah being the home minister of the country has a lot of “workload". “It is justified if they have been trying for an appointment for ten days or so and he hasn’t met them,” Tamil Nadu's BJP general secretary Karu Nagarajan told Hindustan Times.He added that the party leadership is yet to take a call on whether Shah will take part in the all-party meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-cm-stalin-to-hold-all-party-meet-today-on-state-s-exemption-from-neet-101641607404011.html

With this, the toll of terrorists killed in the past seven days has touched 11.A team of officials from the police, the army and the CRPF launched a joint operation after they got a tip-off about the presence of terrorists at Zolwa Kralpora Chadoora of Budgam.“One of the terrorists has been identified as Waseem Mir of Nowgam in Srinagar. Based on initial investigations and documents recovered, the other two terrorists appear to be foreign nationals, however, their exact identification is being ascertained. Three AK-56 rifles were recovered from the site,” said inspector general of police (IGP) Viijay Kumar.Mir, who was active since December 2020, was involved in the killing of police officer inspector Parvaiz Ahmad on June 22 last year, said police.“The terrorists fired indiscriminately upon the joint search party. The security forces retaliated in return leading to an encounter. Later on, the CRPF also joined the operation,” said IGP Kumar.“The joint team ensured the evacuation of all civilians to the safer places.

08-01-2022||India||GitHub case: Bishnoi remorseless, said he was proud of what he created||In the last 24 hours before he was arrested on Wednesday night, Neeraj Bishnoi (21), creator of the controversial app on GitHub where doctored photographs of Muslim women were uploaded, confessed repeatedly on Twitter that he was the person behind the offensive app. He even tagged some handles on Twitter claiming that Mumbai police arrested the wrong suspects and dared them to arrest him for what was clearly a sex- and-hate crime. Bishnoi also tried to mask his identity and the reasons why he created the app. While he was at his parents’ house in Jorhat, Assam, he claimed on Twitter that he was a resident of Nepal, who lived in Sundhara, Kathmandu. He even tried to mislead investigators by claiming that he was paid by Pakistan agencies to build the app and that he had achieved his mission.The second-year B Tech student at the Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), Bhopal — the institute has been prompt in suspending him — posted these messages through a Twitter handle @giyu44 that he created on January 3 using the phone of one of his family members. Police have seized this cell phone too.Though HT could not independently verify the posts made on Twitter by @giyu22, Delhi police’s DCP KPS Malhotra confirmed that Bishnoi was the person behind the tweets. Malhotra is the chief of the IFSO (Intelligence Fusion and Strategic Operations), the police’s cyber cell unit, which arrested Bishnoi from Assam at around midnight on Wednesday. Malhotra said police have recovered forensic evidence from Bishnoi’s seized cell phone and laptop, which confirm that he created the app.As proof that he was indeed the creator of the app, Bishnoi also posted a soft copy of the mail that he supposedly received from US-based GitHub about law enforcement agencies seeking details from his GitHub account.To be sure, Bishnoi’s claim or confession before the police is not admissible as evidence in court.On Thursday evening, a city court sent Bishnoi to seven days police custody. Police officers aware of Bishnoi’s investigation said the man created the app while he was in Rajasthan to attend a wedding, in November. He returned to Jorhat, Assam on December 25, after which used the social media accounts of other suspects to promote the controversial app.Mumbai police have arrested three persons in the case, Sweta Singh (18), her friend Mayank Rawat (20), both residents of Uttarakhand, and Vishal Kumar Jha (21), an engineering student from Bengaluru. The three shared the app and promoted it on social media handles, according to Mumbai police. On Wednesday afternoon, while daring police to arrest him, Bishnoi claimed on Twitter that he misused the accounts of Singh and Jha. Whether this is the case, or they were his willing accomplies who shared his radical mindset is not known. “He created the Twitter handle @giyu44 after learning about the arrest of his online friends by Mumbai police. He has claimed that he used Sweta Singh and another suspect Vishal Jha’s accounts to promote the app. He said that he became close with co-accused Sweta Singh and also knew about her father’s death. He said he was proud of what he has created and was owning up for the crime,” said a police officer who asked not to be named. Police said Bishnoi, son of a grocer, used a laptop that he received from the Assam government, after securing over 85% in his Class 12 board exam in 2019. It isn’t known whether Bishnoi was involved in creating the first app – a similar one but with a different name – that was uploaded on GitHub in July last year. Bishnoi claimed on Twitter that he “cloned the repository” and “edited the code as well the graphics” from that app. He has also named a person who created the first app. HT is withholding the name of the person because police are yet to confirm this. The investigation in the first case registered in July last year is still in process, even as police are yet to arrest anyone. Delhi Police have maintained that they are unable to proceed in the investigation because GitHub has refused to share information related to the details of the user who created the app. GitHub did not respond to mails seeking their comments on the police’s claims.The app and its circulation on social media channels sparked outrage after which different people filed complaints with Delhi and Mumbai police. The Mumbai police and Delhi police are separately investigating the case.Meanwhile, DCP KPS Malhotra said Bishnoi had at least four Twitter handles from where he was uploading derogatory posts. He said some of the handles were @giyu2002, @giyu007, @giyuu84 and @giyu94“Giyu is the first name of a character in a game. One of his Twitter accounts @giyu2002 has been found associated with an FIR registered in Kishangarh police station, south west Delhi. From this Twitter account, he had made lewd remarks on the complainant’s picture and tweeted about the auction of the same,” said DCP Malhotra, adding, that another Twitter handle @giyu007 had come to the light, when police were probing the first GitHub case related to a similar app. Police said that Bishnoi tried to plant misinformation related to the first case and also created a fake profile of a woman(journalist) and to speak to the investigation agency.“Further, he came in contact with journalists and tried to plant his misinformation,” added Malhotra.

He was also seen being slapped and kicked by the group, while he was heard telling them that he was a Muslim. HT could not independently verify the authenticity of the video.“Dhanbad DC should probe the incident and revert with action taken report. There is no space for animosity in the state where people love to live in peace,” Soren said in a tweet, in response to a post about the incident.The victim was identified as a resident of Shamsher Nagar in Wasseypur in Dhanbad. His younger brother told HT that the man was mentally unstable, and is under treatment at Central Institute of Psychatry in Ranchi.“Only three of us live in our home. Both me and my mother do private job. We both were out when my brother left home. He has returned home after the incident. Though we are yet to decide on lodging a formal complaint against those who mistreated him, they should not have done what they did. Even if he abused them, they should not have forced him to chant religious slogan and force his to spit and lick the road. They could have handed him over to police,” the brother said.Reacting to the development, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator from Dhanbad, Raj Sinha, who was present at the protest site, said the incident should be probed in entirety.“This man came in front of us and started abusing our state president, taking his name. We asked him to leave. I don’t know what exactly happened with him after the party workers pushed him away from where we were sitting. However, it needs to be probed whether this entire thing was a conspiracy. Otherwise why would anyone just come and start abusing us,” said Sinha.The BJP legislator alleged that the incident was being highlighted for political reasons. “The CM never takes cognisance of the increasing crime in this city, but has been prompt in taking cognisance of this incident due to poltical reasons. Let him get a probe conducted,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-workers-assault-muslim-man-in-jharkhand-forced-to-chant-jai-shri-ram-cm-soren-orders-probe-101641584868214.html

Roy Barman made the statement two days after Trinamool Congress alleged that Mujibar died following injuries sustained during the political attack at his residence in Agartala while observing the foundation day of Trinamool Congress Chhatra Parishad on August 28 last year. After the incident, Mujibar was taken to Kolkata for treatment and he died of heart attack on January 5.

Roy Barman paid tribute to late Mujibar on Friday in the presence of Bengal Education Minister Bratya Basu, Trinamool Congress MP Dr. Santanu Sen and Tripura Trinamool Congress convener Subal Bhowmik. “Mujibar was beaten by miscreants badly that led to deterioration of his health. He could not recover from that. We, together, spent good time in politics before. The accused who attacked him should be booked under murder charge, “ Roy Barman told the reporters. Before joining the BJP in 2017, Roy Barman joined Trinamool Congress in 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-bjp-mla-demands-murder-charges-against-attackers-of-tmc-leader-101641584388553.html
08-01-2022||India||India sends 2 tonnes of medicines for Kabul hospital||India on Friday supplied two tonnes of life-saving medicines to Afghanistan, the third tranche of aid sent to the country since last month against the backdrop of a dire humanitarian situation exacerbated by a harsh winter. The medicines were routed through Dubai as there are currently no direct flights between India and Afghanistan, people familiar with the matter said. The aid was handed over to the World Health Organization (WHO) and will be used at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health in Kabul. The Taliban welcomed the assistance, with spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid saying in a tweet that the “Islamic Emirate is grateful to India for its humanitarian assistance and cooperation”. “As part of our ongoing humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people, India supplied the third batch of medical assistance consisting of two tons of essential life saving medicines to Afghanistan today. The same was handed over to the Indira Gandhi Hospital, Kabul,” the external affairs ministry said in a brief statement. India is committed to “continue our special relationship with the people of Afghanistan and provide them humanitarian assistance”, the ministry said noting that the country has supplied 500,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines and 1.6 tonnes of medical assistance to Afghanistan through WHO. “In [the] coming weeks, we would be supplying more batches of humanitarian assistance consisting of medicines and foodgrains to Afghanistan,” the statement said. The English language Twitter handle of the Taliban said the medicines arrived in Kabul on Friday morning. “A few days ago, India also sent 500,000 doses of corona vaccine along with many other items to Afghanistan. IEA is grateful to India,” it said in a tweet. While supplying the Covid-19 vaccines on January 1, India pledged to send another 500,000 jabs in the coming weeks. The vaccines were sent to Kabul via a flight of Iran’s Mahan Air. On December 11, the government sent 1.6 tonnes of medicines on a special charter flight that ferried 85 Afghan nationals who were stuck in India after the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. The same flight had brought 104 people, mostly Afghan Sikhs and Hindus, from Kabul to New Delhi a day earlier. India’s offer to provide 50,000 tonnes of wheat to Afghanistan via Pakistani land routes, however, has been held up because of conditions attached by Islamabad. On December 3, Pakistan said it would allow wheat and medicines to be shipped via the Wagah land border crossing in Afghan trucks, but it is yet to firm up modalities. External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a media briefing on Thursday that the Indian side is still engaged in talks with Pakistani authorities to finalise these modalities. An estimated 98% of Afghans are starving because of a spiralling economic crisis, conflict and drought, and this figure has increased 17% since August, according to the World Food Programme. The UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs warned this week that a harsh winter is aggravating already severe conditions faced by millions of Afghans.

The probe found the complaint genuine, people cited above said on condition of anonymity.The Trust got the land transferred in its name through one of its workers Ronghai, a Dalit, on October 22, 1996. The transfer was carried out without seeking approval of the district magistrate, the people said.“The Trust used Ronghai as a conduit for the land deal. Thereafter, the it got the land transferred in its name from Ronghai without approval of the then district magistrate,” one of the people said.As per the case details, some officials of the Uttar Pradesh government and their relatives have allegedly purchased land from the Maharishi Ramayan Vidyapeeth Trust.“The Maharishi Ramayan Vidyapeeth Trust, state government officials and their relatives who had bought land in Manjha Barhata and Shahnawazpur villages are under the scanner of the team probing the Ayodhya land purchase deals, involving senior officials and politicians of the state,” one of the people said.On December 22 last year, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had ordered a probe into all such land purchase in Ayodhya involving officials of the state government, their relatives and politicians.According to legal experts, registries of all those who had purchased land from the Maharishi Ramayan Vidyapeeth Trust in Manjha Barhata Trust will now stand null and void.As per Section 98(1) of the Uttar Pradesh Revenue Code, 2006, no bhumidhar (land owner) belonging to a Scheduled Caste shall have the right to transfer, by way of sale, gift, mortgage or lease any land to a person not belonging to a Scheduled Caste, except with the previous permission of the collector in writing.

Every Covid-19 patient will be considered having Omicron variant, announced state chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma.Another north-eastern state, Manipur, made Covid-19 negative test within 48 hours of arrival mandatory for entering the state by any mode of transport. It also decided to set up border Covid check posts to test passengers randomly.Odisha government on Friday announced closure of all educational institutions from January 10 after 18 students of a technical university, Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology, were found to be infected with Covid.The state government had already announced shutting of all schools from Friday. Odisha on Friday had reported 2703 new Covid cases in last 24 hours, its single-day high in last six months. The test positivity rate which was below one percent for most of December is now 3.9%.Bihar government also announced closure of schools for classes 9 to 12 till Jan 21. Now schools and colleges will only conduct online classes, a health department official said. The Goa government on Friday restricted public gatherings to a maximum of 100 persons outdoors and to 50% of the capacity of the hall/auditorium or 100 persons whichever is less, days after 50% cap was imposed on entertainment places and eateries.The Calcutta high court on Friday gave go ahead to West Bengal government to conduct Gangasagar Mela with certain conditions.

Addressing media in Guwahati, he said since December 27 there has been a surge in new COVID19 cases (on Thursday the state recorded 844 new cases and total 9 Omicron cases) and hence stricter measures were needed to control spread of the disease. Sarma said that as per government calculations, between January 20 and January 30, Assam will have nearly as many cases during the peak of the second wave last year (around 6500 cases in a day).“We assess that this time the peak might be anywhere between 10,000 to 12,000 or maybe more,” he said. The CM informed that testing would be increased from 30,000 daily at present to nearly 100,000 daily.

08-01-2022||India||Mekedatu padayatra plan:Congress hopeful of mobilising support in Old-Mysuru region||The Congress in Karnataka continued its preparations for the 10-day 100-km padayatra from Mekedatu to Bengaluru, scheduled to start on January 9, despite warnings of stern action against the party for violating covid-19 restrictions.Though the party has made it clear that the padayatra is in the “interest of the state”, analysts and others say this also provides an opportunity for the Congress to mobilise support in the Old-Mysuru region ahead of the 2023 assembly polls and other local elections, scheduled for later this year.Despite the party getting routed in other states, Karnataka offers hope to the Congress and has been key to its national revival on more than one occasion and allows the Sonia Gandhi-led party to win one back against the BJP in 2023.“I have written to the chief ministers and all other MLA requesting them to join. We are not doing something against the state and they should bless this,” DK Shivakumar, the president of the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC), said on Friday.Shivakumar and the Congress are trying to get the support for the padayatra from all sections of society including influential seers from various communities, priests and others and add pressure to initiate work in the contentious Mekedatu project which has been opposed by Tamil Nadu.The Congress is hopeful of reviving its fortunes much like what it did in 2012 when Siddaramaiah, Shivakumar and RV Deshpande (then KPCC president) led the party to a 320-km padayatra to Ballari district in the height of the illegal mining scam that involved then BJP minister, Gali Janardhana Reddy.The Congress stormed into power the following year as a divided BJP with BS Yediyurappa’s exit managed to win just 40 seats in 2013 as against 110 in 2008.However, the Congress has been a divided house as the power struggle between Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar is no secret while other factions too continue to watch the developments closely, leaving them at a disadvantage to capitalise on the discord within the Basvaraj Bommai-led BJP and the ruling party’s problems.The Congress has also grown wary of the growing closeness between the JD(S) and the BJP in the Old-Mysuru region or the Vokkaliga belt, where both parties consider the former as the common enemy.The JD(S) is the only party that has had alliances with both the BJP and the Congress and it is imperative to win a large chunk of seats in southern districts if either of the two national parties want to return to power with a full majority. The BJP has hedged its bets with the JD(S) while the Congress is keeping its distance from the former prime minister HD Deve Gowda and his former chief minister son, HD Kumaraswamy-led regional outfit.The Congress and JD(S) suffered humiliating defeats in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections as the grassroots level workers were unable to overcome their rivalries just because there was an alliance between their senior leadership.“It is not just a padayatra but a vote yatra. It is being done with the sole intention to get votes in the upcoming elections and is fooling the people in the name of the Padayatra,” Kumaraswamy said on Friday.The Mekedatu issue has evoked emotions on both sides of the border as it is an extension of the century-old Cauvery river water dispute that has defined generations in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, two of India’s most industrious and progressive states.The long-winding legal battles have been used as a political currency in the past as well as an active tool to deflect attention away from other issues both sides of the border and irrespective of the party in power.The Cauvery river basin originates in Karnataka and flows through Tamil Nadu and Puducherry before it enters the Bay of Bengal. Of the total catchment area of 81,155 square kilometers, 34,273 kilometers is in Karnataka, 44,016 square kms in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry and about 2,866 sq kms in Kerala.Karnataka has maintained that the Mekedatu balancing reservoir-cum-drinking water project is to generate 400 MW of power and additionally utilise 4.75 tmcft of water for drinking and domestic needs in the state and particularly Bengaluru.“This is not about the wellness of the state. They had no other work politically so they are undertaking this. Why didn’t they pay attention to this when they were in power? Mekedatu is not a new issue,” Munirathna, Karnataka’s minister for horticulture said on Friday.He said that this Padayatara was a drama and a political campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mekedatu-padayatra-plan-congress-hopeful-of-mobilising-support-in-old-mysuru-region-101641583427877.html

On Thursday, 125 out of 179 passengers coming from Rome in the European nation tested positive for Covid-19 at Amritsar airport.All European nations, including Italy, have been deemed as “at risk” countries by the Union health ministry. All passengers flying in from these countries have to undergo Covid-19 tests on arrival.“Total 285 passengers today (on Friday) landed at the airport through the flight that was operated by EuroAtlantic Airways and chartered by SpiceJet. A total of 172 passengers have tested positive for Covid-19 in the RT-PCR test,” said VK Seth, director, Sri Guru Ram Das Jee International Airport. Amritsar civil surgeon Dr Charanjit Singh on Friday said that such a large number of positive results led to suspicions about the lab. Singh ordered a probe against the lab. “The passengers testing positive for Covid-19 in such a large number on a second consecutive day has raised a question on the testing practices. In view of this, we have decided to test 75 passengers again,” Singh said, adding, “I have talked to the officials of the airport and asked them to initiate a probe against the lab.”All those who have tested positive on arrival here were in possession of a Covid negative report from Italy. Passengers have alleged that the lab, hired by the Centre through tendering process, was asking for money for negative reports. Jasvir Singh Uppal from Jalandhar district, who arrived here on Thursday, said, “Almost all of us are fully vaccinated and passengers got their RT-PCR tests done from different reputed labs in Italy and tested negative. Our reports are on the internet and anyone in the world can check them. I was surprised when my report turned negative at Amritsar airport. We refuse to go to a quarantine centre.”“We conducted the RT-PCR test just nine hours before boarding the flight... I have seen some passengers who gave bribe, tested negative at the airport,” he added.When contacted by HT, airport officials refused to divulge the name of the lab.Meanwhile, health officials said that as per the government guidelines, the 172 passengers who tested positive have been asked to go to institutional quarantine in their respective districts.On Thursday, several passengers who tested positive on arrival left for their homes, violating the Covid-19 guidelines. Amritsar deputy commissioner Gurpreet Singh Khaira took a strong note of the incident, asking all those who are from the district to isolate at the designated quarantine centre at Guru Nanak Dev Hospital by Friday morning.Khaira directed the additional deputy commissioner to order police to book the passengers who don’t return to quarantine facility under the Epidemic Act and the Disaster Management Act. He also warned of recommending cancellation of their passports if they don’t turn up.Till Friday, however, only three out of the 13 passengers who are from Amritsar district have isolated themselves at Guru Nanak Dev Hospital. A government spokesperson said, “The other 10 passengers have the facility at home to be properly isolated. They are isolated at home, while three have been admitted to Guru Nanak Dev Hospital.” 
08-01-2022||India||India reports 141,000 Covid cases, highest tally since March 2021||New Delhi: India on Friday saw at least 141,000 new cases of Covid-19, the highest single-day increase since May 39, 2021, or in 222 days, as the nationwide surge in infections propelled by the Omicron variant continued to soar. Friday’s case count of 141,506 means that daily cases have now grown more than 10-fold in just 10 days (there were just 9,155 new infections on December 28) – a speed of rise in infections previously unseen in the two years of the pandemic in the country. To be sure, such a sharp rise in daily infections is keeping in line with trends in Covid waves seen across the world due to the highly transmissible Omicron variant. Experts have said that while infections of the new variant, which was first discovered in South Africa in early November, are spreading a lot faster than previous iterations of the coronavirus, they are largely asymptomatic or mild, with only small fraction resulting in deaths across the world. Government officials have privately said they are working under the assumption that daily infections will surpass the record of more than 414,000 set in May, given what has happened in countries, such as the United States where daily cases have risen past 1 million. “We will clearly surpass our record shortly and reach a new peak by early February,” M.D. Gupte, a former director of the state-run National Institute of Epidemiology and an immunisation adviser to the government, told Reuters. “Given the size of our population, we will report more daily cases than the U.S. But what we have seen is that these cases are much more mild, so the need for hospitalisation and oxygen and all that is not picking up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-reports-141-000-covid-cases-highest-tally-since-march-2021-101641583127937.html

Discussions on the project date back to the time of the India-Sri Lanka Accord of 1987 but there had been no substantial forward movement for a variety of reasons, including resistance in Sri Lanka to completely leasing out the facility built by the British at Trincomalee to India. The Sri Lanka government, Indian Oil Corporation subsidiary Lanka IOC (LIOC), Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and a joint venture between LIOC and CPC signed three lease agreements on Thursday on refurbishing and developing the 850-acre oil storage facility with a capacity of nearly one million tonnes. According to the deal, 16 tanks which were already developed by LIOC since 2003 will be leased to the firm, 61 tanks will be leased to the joint venture, and 24 tanks to CPC. The lease will be valid for 50 years and there are provisions in the agreements to protect investments, people familiar with the matter said. An IOC spokesperson said CPC has a 51% stake in the joint venture and LIOC has a 49% stake. “CPC and the joint venture company of LIOC will be developing tanks in a phased manner very shortly for their respective allocated tanks,” the spokesperson said. The agreements signed on Thursday resulted in the termination of a framework agreement signed by LIOC, CPC and the Sri Lanka government in 2003 that envisaged leasing all the tanks to LIOC. The Sri Lankan side has now ensured that it has a stake in 85 of the tanks at the facility. The project will ensure energy security for both countries, especially since LIOC already plays a key role in the retail distribution of petrol in Sri Lanka, the people said. The project is also expected to blunt the fallout of the Sri Lanka government’s unilateral cancellation in early 2021 of a tripartite agreement with India and Japan to develop a terminal at Colombo port. “These agreements are another significant step in broadening the spectrum of the mutually beneficial economic partnership. It will assist Sri Lanka in developing of Trincomalee as an energy and transport hub to bolster its energy security,” one of the people cited above said. Cooperation in energy security is an important part of cooperation between the two sides under India’s “Neighbourhood First” policy, the person said. “India looks forward to full implementation of bilateral understandings reached within agreed timelines,” the person added. At the same time, it is believed the Sri Lankan side expects progress in the Trincomalee oil tank farm project will lead to forward movement on its request for urgent financial assistance against the backdrop of a severe economic crisis. Sri Lanka is eyeing a $500-million credit line from India’s Exim Bank for buying petrol and diesel from Indian suppliers, another line of credit to cover the import of food, medicines and other essential items from India, and a $400-million currency swap under the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) facility. The Trincomalee project and the credit lines were part of a four-pillar economic cooperation initiative that Sri Lanka’s finance minister Basil Rajapaksa had discussed with his Indian counterpart Nirmala Sitharaman and external affairs minister S Jaishankar during a visit to New Delhi in December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trincomalee-oil-tank-farm-deal-to-boost-energy-security-set-stage-for-further-eco-cooperation-101641583012344.html

Briefing the deliberations of the three-day meeting, RSS joint secretary Manmohan Vaidya told reporters that the meeting discussed on Bharat-centric eduction and observed that the National Education Policy should reflect the true history and spiritual diversity of India. “Having a common education policy across the nation is not, in any manner, an infringement into the diversity of the various states. Diversity should not be seen as differences between the states. India’s has been focussing on spiritual oneness. The National Education Policy has expressed our spiritual diversity from across the country,” Vaidya said. He said the policy should also strive for eradication of caste discrimination in the society and promote harmony. “The RSS has been striving for achieving social equality. The affiliated organisations would deeply study this aspect in their respective fields and give suggestions to the government. Intellectuals across the country are bringing awareness for decolonization in all fields,” he said. The representatives deliberated on malnutrition eradication especially among children and initiatives for employment generation. The meeting also discussed about the programmes to be taken up during the 75th year of Indian Independence. It called for recognising the contributions of thousands of unsung heroes including those from the SC and STs. “The organisations inspired by the RSS and working among intellectuals have documented 250 such valorous lives. Samskara Bharati has made 75 skits and dramas,” Vaidya said. The meeting discussed the steps for tackling the third wave of Coronavirus pandemic. “As many as 10 lakh people in 6,000 development blocks have been trained to serve the people during the pandemic. Sangh shakhas which were closed during first pandemic have restarted now. Compared to October 2019, Sangh has restarted its work in 93% places in the country,” he said.

08-01-2022||India||Naidu hints at tie-up with Pawan Kalyan for 2024 assembly election||Telugu Desam Party chief N Chandrababu Naidu has indicated that his party is looking for an alliance with the Jana Sena Party headed by Telugu film actor Pawan Kalyan in the next Andhra Pradesh assembly elections to be held in 2024.Naidu indicated this during his ongoing tour in his constituency Kuppam in Chittoor district. Reacting to a suggestion by party workers on Thursday that the TDP could have a pact with the Jana Sena Party in the next elections, Naidu said his party was ready to join hands with Pawan Kalyan, if there was a reciprocation from the latter.“An alliance can work out if there is a positive response from the other side. It cannot be a one-side love,” the TDP chief said.On Friday, Naidu told the media that there was a need for all like-minded political forces to come together to end the “destructive rule” of the Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy government in the state. “It is necessary to put up a united fight against the ruling party under the present circumstances,” the former chief minister said.On his comment about one-side love with the Jana Sena Party, Naidu clarified that he was only explaining about political alliances which would be worked out on mutual agreements and not in the interest of one side.He said alliances between political parties would be discussed only at the time of elections, depending on the necessity and the political situation prevailing at that time. “The TDP does not depend on alliances alone to win elections. It had won the elections and lost elections in the past irrespective of the alliances it had with other parties,” he said.The Jana Sena Party reacted cautiously to the TDP chief’s comments on the possibility of an alliance between the two parties. “So far, there have been no discussions whatsoever between the TDP and the Jana Sena on an alliance. We do not know in what context the TDP president made such a comment,” Jana Sena Party political affairs committee chairman and former assembly speaker Nadendla Manohar told HT.He said during the local body elections held in Andhra Pradesh last year, there were instances of the TDP and Jana Sena Party fighting together in some districts to counter the YSR Congress Party. “Maybe, as an extension of this cooperation in the local body elections, the TDP cadre might have made such a suggestion for an alliance in the assembly elections as well,” he said.The issue of an alliance with the TDP is expected to come up for discussion at the state executive committee meeting of the Jana Sena Party to be held at its state headquarters in Mangalagiri in Guntur district on Sunday. “We shall definitely discuss the issue. But it is too early to talk about electoral alliances at this stage,” Manohar said.The Jana Sena Party has been in an alliance with the BJP since the last general elections in 2019. In April last year, Pawan Kalyan campaigned for the BJP in the by-election to Tirupati parliamentary constituency.But after that both the parties have been adopting independent lines in their fight against the Jagan Mohan Reddy government. While the Jana Sena Party decided to stay away from the contest in the by-elections to Badvel assembly seat in Kadapa district held on October 30, the BJP fielded its candidate without consulting its alliance partner.Pawan Kalyan has also differed with the BJP on the issue of privatisation of the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant and joined the agitations of the steel plant workers. Similarly, the BJP stayed away from the Jana Sena Party’s fight against the bad roads in the state.Reacting to Naidu’s comments on the one-side love with the Jana Sena Party, BJP state president Somu Veerraju described the TDP chief as the “most opportunistic politician”. “He is known for his use-and-throw politics. He can love anybody for his convenience and later dump him after the purpose is served,” Veerraju said.The TDP had forged an alliance with the BJP in 2014 general elections and was part of the Narendra Modi-led NDA government till 2018.YSR Congress Party ridiculed the TDP chief’s comments on an alliance with the Jana Sena Party. “Naidu has no courage to go to elections independently, because he knows the TDP cannot win elections alone. It was there for everybody to see in 2019 assembly elections,” senior YSRC leader and legislator Malladi Vishnu said.He said Naidu always looks for “opportunistic alliances” with other parties to win elections. “But his wily tactics will not work even in 2024, because no political party in the state has the capacity and calibre to face the YSRC in the elections,” Vishnu said.
08-01-2022||India||Kerala police rescue abducted infant within two hours||A newborn abducted from the Government Medical College hospital in Kottayam was rescued within two hours of the crime, a Kerala police official said on Friday. The incident unfolded in the hospital gynaecology around 3pm Thursday when a woman dressed as a nurse allegedly asked the mother P Aswathi to hand over the infant to get the baby’s jaundice levels checked.When the baby was not returned even after 30 minutes, Aswathi went to the hospital authorities to ask about the same, following which police were alerted. “We immediately sealed the district border and scanned railway stations, bus terminals and private vehicles. While probing the matter, an eyewitness auto-rickshaw driver informed that he had seen a woman leaving the hospital in hurry,” said district police chief-cum-superintendent of police (SP) D Shilpa. The kidnapper, identified as Neethu Raj, and the child were taken into custody from a hotel in the city by 5pm, said Shilpa. She said that the police officers who busted the kidnapping incident in a record time will be rewarded. Sub-inspector T S Reneesh who was part of the rescue team was greeted with a standing ovation when he returned the baby to the medical college hospital. “The accused has confessed to her crime. During the investigation, Raj said that she kidnapped the baby to blackmail her lover Ibrahim Badusha. After executing the crime, she shared the pictures of the baby with Badusha and his relatives claiming that she gave birth to the baby and Badusha was the father,” said the SP, adding, that Raj and Badusha had come in contact last year through social media platform Tik Tok and had been staying together for some time. The SP said both fell apart as Badusha decided to get married somewhere else. “She told us that Badusha took her money and failed to return it. The whole drama was enacted to foil his marriage plan and live with him,” said the SP, adding, Raj was pregnant earlier, but, it was aborted. She was planning to give an impression that she gave birth to the child in a private hospital in Ernakulam and selected an easy target in Kottayam medical college hospital. The SP said she had been camping in a hotel near the hospital from January 4 and had visited the hospital multiple times before committing the crime. Police said Raj, who already has an eight-year-old son from her first marriage, purchased the nurse uniform from a medical equipment shop. The SP said Badusha has no role in the kidnapping but a separate case will be registered against him for not returning the money he took from Raj. Meanwhile, describing the entire incident as a nightmare, Aswathi said, “I almost fainted after I came to know about the kidnapping. She was quite familiar in the ward and we all thought she was a nurse.” State health minister Veena George has also sought a report from the medical college authorities regarding the matter. George also called upon the family on Friday evening. “In view of the incident, we will be increasing security in all the hospitals. Employees will have to carry their identity cards and more CCTVs will be set-up,” she said, adding, such an incident should not have been happened in first place. Meanwhile, the SP said that the entire team has been recommended for rewards.

08-01-2022||India||Kerala assault case: Court orders recording of Film director’s statement||A court in Kochi on Friday ordered recording of Malayalam director Balachandra Kumar’s statement before a magistrate in the actor abduction and assault case.Kumar, a former friend of actor Dileep who is an accused in the case, claimed two weeks back that the actor was in possession of the video of the assault on a woman actor and that he tried to influence many witnesses in the case. He also alleged that he had met the main accused in the case, Pulsar Suni, at the residence of actor Dileep in 2016 when he had gone there to discuss a film project. Later the prosecution moved a plea in the court to record Kumar’s statement under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The case relates to an incident in 2017 in which a woman actor was waylaid, kidnapped and sexually assaulted by a criminal gang in Kochi while she was returning home after a shooting assignment. Six months after the incident, Dileep was arrested and made an accused in the case. Prosecution alleged that the attack was planned at the behest of Dileep to settle an old score with the woman actor. The special investigation team probing the case questioned Kumar last week and is set to grill Dileep again. The four-year-old case took a new turn two weeks back after Kumar made claims about Dileep while talking to a Malayalam news channel. Dileep later refuted the claims, saying “he (Kumar) was using his old enmity to settle scores with him.” He said Kumar was upset with him after he refused to take up his project two years ago. Soon after the disclosure by Kumar, the prosecution moved the trial court for a fresh investigation and the court asked the prosecution to file fresh charges by January 20. New allegations against Dileep and prosecution’s demand for a fresh probe surfaced at a time when the trial court’s six-month extension given by the Supreme Court was set to expire on February 16. The state government also moved the apex court with a plea to extend the trial by six more months in view of the fresh disclosure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-assault-case-court-orders-recording-of-film-director-s-statement-101641582289516.html
08-01-2022||India||96% patients on oxygen support in Mumbai hospitals are unvaccinated: BMC chief||Mumbai: An overwhelming majority of people with Covid-19 requiring oxygen support in Mumbai’s hospitals are unvaccinated, a top city official said, offering the first clues of who may now be at higher risk despite the variant itself showing signs of reduced virulence.Doctors at city officials separately said the trends were largely being reflected at their facilities, and that most of those requiring additional support were unvaccinated people above the age of 50.“Out of the around 1,900 Covid patients who were on oxygenated beds, around 96% are unvaccinated and only 4% are vaccinated,” Brihanmumbai Corporation (BMC) municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal, citing data till January 6.Dr Gautam Bhansali of the Bombay Hospital, who is also coordinator of all private hospitals in the city, said, “In case of hospital beds, both vaccinated and unvaccinated citizens are occupants, but on oxygen beds, the majority of patients are unvaccinated. The age group of such patients is normally above 40 to 50 years.” “This shows that vaccination is very important for each and every citizen,” he added.Infectious disease expert Dr Om Srivastava, who is also a member of the Covid-19 task force said that there is a definite increase in the number of unvaccinated and partially vaccinated people who were being hospitalised with Covid-19. “Many of these patients seem to have rushed to take the vaccine after the surge in cases started, perhaps battling the initial hesitancy towards vaccination,” said Srivastava. “We have not conducted a thorough analysis, but the uptick in such patients, even on oxygen support and ICUs is visible,” he said.According to Srivastava, Omicron is largely affecting the upper respiratory area and patients suspected with Omicron may not require oxygen. While the presence of Omicron is confirmed by genome sequencing, some hospitals have started using the S-gene dropout parameter in the RT-PCR tests to indirectly indicate the variant causing the disease in the patient.“My worry is about the possibility of joint infections with both Delta and Omicron variants due to repeated exposure that could be driving some number of patients towards severe disease. We don’t have genome sequencing data to establish this, but it definitely needs to be looked at,” he said.BMC officials said they were confident that resources are adequate to deal with any surge in requirement.“We may even have 100,000 Covid active patients in Mumbai. Our oxygen consumption is only 10 tonnes. Our production capacity is up to 200 tonnes a day. We have another 400 tonnes of oxygen in storage. In the third wave, we have to understand that positivity rate or cases will not be parameter with which to gauge the situation but hospitalisation rate. The occupation of oxygen and ICU beds along with the overall bed occupancy rate is to be gauged,” said an official, asking not to be named.Chahal said 80% of the city’s Covid beds were as yet unoccupied and the situation will be reviewed if occupancy reached 50% in the coming days.“Our experts from the Covid Taskforce have told me that in Mumbai may even go up to say 40,000 cases daily. This may or may not happen but we will come out comfortably out of this considering the cooperation from citizens,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/96-patients-on-oxygensupport-in-mumbai-hospitals-are-unvaccinated-bmc-chief-101641582287732.html
08-01-2022||India||Tamil Nadu policy aims to bring women into workforce||While participating in a gram sabha in Madurai district on Gandhi Jayanti, October 2, Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin took a pledge that he will give due respect to women and children, their rights as equals, and will not engage in sexual harassment or any kind of gender violence. Now, the draft of his government’s new policy for women talks of providing jobs to about 10,000 women, who left work to take care of their families, by upgrading their skills, and a menopause leave for all women workers. According to officials, the government plans to reach out to 10,000 women, who have quit jobs for raising their family and due to lack of mobility, and help them in a second career entry. Household surveys will be conducted to estimate gender inequality within homes. Tamil Nadu’s policy comes at a time when several studies across the world show that the Covid-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected women as they have dropped out of the workforce, setting them back in their careers and cornering them into reinforced gender roles of care giving. The state policy, a first of its kind, comes 20 years after the central government had adopted the National Policy for Empowerment of Women in 2001. The policy’s core idea, according to the draft, is that women should have the “power to control their own lives, both within and outside the home” and “create an equitable social and economic order” ensuring social justice which is also central to the ruling DMK’s Dravidian ideology which has diluted over the years. “It reflects a wide range of concerns and contemporary feminist policy debates,” says Swarna Rajagoapalan, political scientist and founder of Prajnya that advocates for women’s rights. “Notable is the concern about low female labour force participation, reflected in many provisions relating to re-entry and re-skilling. I’d say that the drafting committee was really concerned about women’s labour force participation and the loss of talent through women exiting for all these reasons.”According to the policy, the rural and urban female labour force participation rate (FLFPR) in Tamil Nadu is 35.1% and 23.6%, which is higher than the national average by 15.4% and 7.5%, respectively.“Tamil Nadu has the second-largest state economy in the country, with strong and consistent economic growth averaging about 8.5% since fiscal year (FY) 2006. Women’s contribution in the paid economy is significant,” the draft policy says. The policy notes that women’s effective participation in the workforce and their transition to formal employment opportunities remain a challenge.“The policy notes that women leave the workforce for personal reasons as well as because of infrastructural failures,” says Rajagopalan. “The provisions relating to public transport (reserved seats, on-off boarding between stops and provision for storing the work paraphernalia of informal workers) are practical remedial measures. The attention to re-skilling and re-entry after career breaks mirrors a private sector concern of recent years. The policy notes the tendency of women to work for a few years and leave after marriage and suggests acquainting them with options at such a point.”The state’s policy is meant to offer financial and accommodation support for skill training to girls in any subject of their choice. It includes entrepreneurial training. “The State shall open opportunities for women and girls for upskilling especially those who had a career break,” the policy says.The state is also looking at ways for integration of technical skills in the curriculum along with providing incentives to pursue courses that will smoothen the transition from education to work for adolescent girls in vulnerable communities. Skill training in terms of upskilling and reskilling courses is being pondered for allowing women for lateral entry at a higher level after a career break. But Rajagopalan points out that though the policy draft mentions ‘Internal Committees’ in its discussions about work, it does not address the challenges of informal workers in accessing functional local committees, mentioning them just once. “This is a notable oversight for a policy so invested in enabling women’s livelihoods,” she says. Women’s health highly linked to work productivity The policy has a radical element-- menopause leave for all women. A factor not talked about much but a 2019 survey by a London-based association for human resource management professionals pegged that almost 900,000 women in the UK left their jobs because of menopausal symptoms reducing productivity.Tamil Nadu’s policy combines concerns about women’s health and work. The menopause leave can be clubbed with the one-year maternity leave, the policy says.“Women who have not availed the entire maternity leave can have the option of availing menopause leave during their career which will not extend beyond the maximum combined limit of one year.” Without mentioning period leave, the policy says that women will be eligible for sick leave category besides the casual leave for any 2 consecutive days per month which is compensatory. “This shall be applicable till attain the age of menopause,” the policy states.The policy is a 10-year plan for its present 3.2 crore women population who out numbers the male electorate in Tamil Nadu. The DMK began indicating that it will focus on women when it promised a cash dole of ₹1000 for women-headed households and when they formed the government in May, the name of this department anchoring this initiative was renamed from Social Welfare and Nutritious department to Social Welfare and Women Empowerment. The policy was drafted by an eight-member team which includes five women. It has broadly adopted WHO’s RESPECT women framework for prevention of violence against women and girls.“I see this draft policy with a holistic approach where it talks about intersectionality and gender sensitive approaches to be considered in the planning phase rather than adding any component to an existing scheme,” Sandhiyan Thiyagaran, founder of AWARE (Awareness for Women to Advocate their Rights and Empowerment) India.He says there are significant initiatives to address gender-based violence but he draws a few caveats. “Educating girls on adolescent sexual health & reproductive rights, talking about relationship awareness seems is empowering one gender without including the other (boys and men) who have predominantly been perpetuating these issues and also been victimized to perpetuate the same. We need to focus on boys on these aspects,” says Thiyagarajan. A senior social welfare and women empowerment department official said the draft has been in the making for two months. “We are creating a strong base for the government to cover women in all stages of their lives,” the official, wishing not to be identified, said. “The policy will be flexible to change as we go forward.”The department is also planning to release this in Tamil having received several requests. The deadline for the public to submit their suggestions is January 31. A committee headed by the directorate of social welfare has been constituted to study feedback and modify the policy accordingly. It will then be sent to the state government to hold further consultations with various departments that are involved in matters concerning women such as health, education and Adi Dravidar welfare department. The official said they were yet to decide on how to mobilise funds to implement the policy.

The accused include the then station house officer Jagat Narayan Singh, then sub-inspectors Akshay Kumar Mishra, Vijay Yadav, Rahul Dubey, then head constable Kamlesh Singh Yadav and constable Prashant Kumar. All accused are currently in jail.According to the charge sheet, the accused have been charged under sections 302 (murder), 323, 325, 506, 218, 201 (destruction of evidence) all read with Sections 34, 120-B and 149 of IPC (Indian Penal Code).The CBI had registered a case on November 2021 following a notification by the Uttar Pradesh government. The FIR was lodged by Gupta’s wife Meenakshi. According to a CBI spokesperson, it was alleged that on September 27, Manish Gupta checked into a hotel room in Gorakhpur, falling under the jurisdiction of the Ramgarh Tal police station.“It was further alleged that in the intervening night of September 27 and 28, 2021, at about 12:00 am, the SHO, along with two sub-inspectors and three other police personnel, entered into the room of the said hotel and started misbehaving with Manish Gupta,” he said.The spokesperson said it was also alleged that after Gupta protested, the policemen started beating him, resulting in grievous injuries. Gupta died on the spot, the CBI spokesperson said. The policemen were on the run since Gupta’s death on September 27. JN Singh and Akshay Mishra were the first to be arrested on October 10. Kanpur commissioner of police Asim Arun had confirmed their arrest at the time. The police had initially claimed that Gupta died due to injuries caused to him when he slipped on the floor due to the chaos caused by the sudden police checking.However, the post-mortem report revealed that Gupta’s body bore grave injury marks including big 5×4 cm deep and swollen wound in the middle of the forehead, clotting in the right eyelid and deep wound in the forearm.The Uttar Pradesh government on October 1 recommended a CBI probe into Gupta’s death.

08-01-2022||India||Smaller states fare better at providing MGNREGS jobs||Nine out of every ten enrolled workers have got a job under MGNREGS in the state of Mizoram in this financial year, as have 74% in Chhattisgarh. The two are among several smaller states where a wide swathe of the rural population has benefitted from the government’s flagship job guarantee scheme against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic that has shrunk economic opportunities and discouraged many workers from leaving home.To be sure, these proportions are a function of the lower absolute numbers in these states. For instance, in Bihar, the number of active workers under the scheme as on Friday was 8.97 million lakhs whereas in Mizoram, it was just around 2,70,000 . But while just 28.7% of the total enrolled MGNREGS workers found work in Bihar, 93% of those in Mizoram have benefitted, according to the government data.Former rural development secretary Jugal Kishore Mohapatra explained that the larger states have more options for economic activities. “In industrially developed or big states such as Maharashtra or Gujarat, people have many other financial opportunities to pursue. So, the participation in these states is usually low.”The official data shows that active workers out of total number of workers in Jharkhand is 40%, Karnataka, 48%, Maharashtra, 23%, and Gujarat, 31%.The corresponding proportions in smaller states is much higher. It is 84% in Tripura, 81% in the UT of Ladakh and 71% in Meghalaya.A senior official of the rural development ministry pointed out that the world’s biggest employment guarantee programme has been beneficial to the smaller states and far-flung areas with limited economic opportunities. “During Covid, these economic opportunities have shrunk further, especially in these areas. And many migratory workers have not returned to bigger cities due to fear of the pandemic, resulting in additional dependence on the job guarantee programme.”MGNREGS has generated 296 croredays of work so far nationally involving 94.3 million individual workers and the participation of 65.5 million households. As more families sought work under the Union government’s flagship job programme, only 2.45 million families have completed 100 days of work—as against 7.1 million lakhs in 20-21, 4 million 19-20 and 5.2 million in 2018-19, according to the government data.The union rural development ministry has so far spent ₹86,028 crore out of the total availability of ₹86,265 crore. With 99.7% utilization of the available funds, the ministry will now need to seek more funds from the finance ministry in the latter’s last demand for grants of FY21-22.

The three belong to the same village as the victim. We are conducting raids for further arrests. We are not revealing the identity of other named accused as it could affect their arrests.”On Tuesday, Sanju Pradhan, in his 30s, was lynched and set on fire by a mob on suspicion of his involvement in illegal felling of trees and trading in stolen wood.Sources in the police identified those arrested as Lorhe Pradhan, Tripati Pradhan and Maheshwar Pradhan.“All three belong to Chhapridipa tola of Bambarkela village, from where the victim also belonged. Lorhe and Tripati are brothers. And these are the three who had alleged that the trees Sanju had cut belonged to them,” said a police officer.A day after the gruesome lynching, Sanju’s wife Sapna Devi had said on Wednesday that he was killed by the mob in the presence of police officials who had stood by and watched.Meanwhile, a BJP delegation led by senior state leader Babulal Marandi visited Sanju’s family in his village. After meeting the family, Marandi told reporters that innocent people have been arrested in the case.“This entire issue of tree cutting is eyewash because that issue was solved last year itself.

India started the year with the vaccination of children in the age group of 15-18 years. Today, we are achieving the target of giving 1.5 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccine, and that too, in less than a year.”Health minister Mansukh Mandaviya took to Twitter saying, “ With the guidance of PM @NarendraModi and the efforts of our health workers, India has achieved the historic record of 150 crore vaccinations. Nothing is impossible when everyone contributes.”India had crossed the milestone of 1 billion Covid vaccine shots on October 21 last year.Speaking at the event, the PM added that even as Covid-19 cases were rising fast because of the highly transmissible Omicron variant, more than 90% of the country’s senior citizens have received their first dose, while around 15 million children in the age group of 15-18 years were vaccinated against the disease in the first five days of the year.However, during her address at the same event, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said that the campus at Chittaranjan institute had earlier been inaugurated by the state government in order to set up a Covid-19 facility.“For the Prime Minister’s knowledge, I would like to say that we have already inaugurated the campus. How did we do it? When Covid-19 was raging and we were in need of a centre (Covid-19 hospital), I went to the campus one day. We turned it into a Covid-19 centre as the state government had stake in it,” Banerjee said.Taking a jibe at the central government, she added, “The Prime Minister would be happy to know that the state has provided 11 acres of land and 25% of the funds for the campus. The recurring cost of ₹71 crore would also be borne by the state. That’s why, sometimes, the Centre and the states should work together for development.”Banerjee put forth a set of demands before the prime minister, underlining the need for more seats for medical students, and more IAS and IPS officers in the state. She also pointed out that Bengal needs more vaccine doses, particularly with about 40% of the state’s residents yet to receive their second dose.“We need to increase the medical seats to tackle situations like these, when more than 70 doctors in one medical college are getting infected with Covid in one go. Also, we need more IAS and IPS officers. Following your advice we roped in IAS and IPS officers from outside the state. The governor, however, raised questions without knowing that we were following the Prime Minister’s advice,” said Banerjee.Reacting to her comments, BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya tweeted, “Mamata Banerjee is incorrigible. Notwithstanding the fact that she is on path of constant, needless confrontation, she must realise that inaugurating a building as Covid facility is NOT the same as inaugurating a Cancer facility in a hospital. Imagine what Bengal has to suffer!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-achieve-milestone-of-1-5-billion-anti-covid-jabs-today-says-pm-modi-101641551025378.html

In my time at Doon School, I paid little attention to the chief guests’ Founders Day addresses.

I barely listened to Prince Philip, the chancellor, and there was no question of the alumni doing so. In fact, there was no way they could.

08-01-2022||Today's||Three reasons why the 2022 elections are important||The 2022 state polls could be called the biggest election in the country after the 2019 general elections in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi came back with a thumping majority. The elections to five states - Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Goa and Manipur - which make up for a little over one-fifth of the country’s population come at the time when the Omicron variant of Covid-19 is surging across India with 1,41,000 Covid cases reported on Friday, the highest since May 2021. This will also be the first electoral test for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after the repeal of the three farm laws. The BJP rules in four of the five election-bound states.The election results will tell us whether the BJP has been able to neutralise the resentment of farmers in Punjab, western Uttar Pradesh and the plains of Uttarakhand by repealing the three farm laws, which BJP leaders often insisted will help double farmers’ income by 2022. Data suggests that India is nowhere close to doubling the farmer’s income. In fact, earnings from the farm sector have almost remained stagnant primarily due to the rising input cost of fertilisers and labour, a reason for the palpable anger among farmers against the government.Except in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, there is a direct fight between the BJP and the Congress in Uttarakhand, Manipur and Goa, where the BJP is in power. In the 2017 election, the Congress got more seats than the BJP in Manipur and Goa but was not able to form the government. In Uttar Pradesh, the fight is being considered bipolar this time between the ruling BJP and the Samajwadi Party. In Punjab, the contest seems triangular as Congress faces stiff competition from the Aam Aadmi Party, the main opposition party in the outgoing Punjab assembly, and the Shiromani Akali Dal, which the Congress defeated with a huge margin in 2017.In a multi-layered polity where caste plays an important role, the poll results will broadly answer three vital questions. First, whether farmer protests resonated with people after the repeal; second, whether hate speeches against minorities led to polarization and third, whether high inflation and Covid management had any electoral impactFirst, the farm protests have the potential to impact 240 of the 620 assembly seats going to polls in 5 states. And, its first electoral impact was visible this week when prime minister Narendra Modi returned from Punjab without attending an election rally on Wednesday after what the Centre has described as a massive security breach. Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi has claimed that the prime minister returned as there was no crowd at the election rally. Across Punjab, activists of farmer unions are still targeting BJP leaders and are projecting BJP as a party against Punjabiyat.There is no clarity whether the decision of 20 of the 30 farm unions that participated in a year-long protest at Delhi borders to contest polls in Punjab will really have a major impact on the elections. They have not even started their campaign. The Punjab elections will also be important for Shiromani Akali Dal, which walked out of the BJP led National Democratic Alliance in 2021 after the farmer protest and is looking for its political revival. AAP continues to be resurgent in Punjab though it is yet to declare its chief ministerial candidate, a sticking point for the party’s campaign in the state.In western Uttar Pradesh, which sends 110 lawmakers to the 403-seat UP assembly, analysts are keenly watching out for Rakesh Tikait, who emerged as the face of the farmers’ voice from the region. Although Rakesh Tikait has announced that he will not contest polls, his nuanced support to any political outing could influence the elections in some regions. The BJP in 2017 assembly elections won over 80 seats in western Uttar Pradesh, the region with the highest Muslim concentration in the state. Locals say apart from farm protest, unreasonably low price of sugarcane announced by the BJP governments, increase in fertilizer costs, high electricity prices and cattle menace because of stringent slaughter rules are other issues affecting the farmers.To pacify farmers, the UP government just last week announced slashing electricity tariffs for agriculture and a decision to clear sugarcane dues worth ₹12,000 crore. In Uttar Pradesh, there is a sizeable Sikh population in terai region of Lakhimpur, Pilibhit, Sultanpur districts of Uttar Pradesh. Four farmers protesting against Centre’s farm laws were reportedly crushed under a vehicle of Ashish Mishra, BJP leader and son of union junior minister Ajay Kumar Mishra alias Teni, in Lakhimpur Kheri district in October first week.The farm protests will also resonate in 15 of the 70 assembly seats of Uttarakhand, especially in the plains of Haridwar and Uddam Singh Nagar, which have a sizeable Muslim and Sikh population. The BJP is already fighting huge anti-incumbency in the state, where it changed three chief ministers in 2021. The rival Congress is engulfed in intense infighting.Secondly, the elections will indicate if there is an impact of hate speeches against Muslims at Haridwar Dharam Sansad on December 17-19, followed by another one in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, on December 29, on elections. Political observers believe that these speeches may have been a deliberate effort before the crucial assembly polls as they were aimed at polarisation. No senior BJP leader has criticized the speakers at the Dharam Sansad for hate speeches against Muslims even as they came out in support of Kalicharan Maharaj when he was arrested by Chhattisgarh police for abusing Mahatma Gandhi at Raipur Dharam Sansad. Although the Uttarakhand police registered a case for the hate speeches on December 22 and named five speakers as accused, not even one of them has been questioned so far. Only three accused have only been issued summons so far.The third issue is governance related-- Covid management and high essential commodities inflation.During the second Covid wave in April-May 2021, at least three of the poll-bound states - Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Goa - were in national news for their handling of the Covid pandemic during the peak of the second wave. There were photographs of bodies floating in the river Ganga in several places in Uttar Pradesh and buried at the ghats of various rivers in the state. The Uttarakhand government imposed minimal restrictions for Haridwar Mahakumbh that started in April 2021 despite experts warning against allowing the gathering. The congregation was considered a major contributor to the second Covid wave in the Hindi heartland.Of course, the death of tens of thousands of people and allegations of Covid mismanagement were not limited to only these states as reports of suppressing actual Covid deaths and patients dying because of lack of oxygen emerged from several other states. But, the elections could give some insight if there is a political cost to the loss of so many lives.On inflation, the consumer price index increased by 6.8% between November of 2020 and 2021, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending June 1982. Energy prices increased by 33% in the past year, the highest ever. Petrol is being sold for over ₹100 at several places and an LPG cylinder costs slightly over ₹1,000. The 2022 election is also the first election since the central government reduced petrol and diesel prices by ₹5 and ₹10, respectively, and the results might well indicate if the price cut was enough to soothe public anger over the high cost of fuel.
