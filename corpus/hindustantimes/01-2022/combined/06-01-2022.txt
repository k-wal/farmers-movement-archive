Later in the evening, he was allowed to go home.Mumbai resident Jiten Gajaria who has nearly 20,000 followers had posted a photo of Rashmi Thackeray with a comment, ‘Marathi Rabri Devi’.

Gajaria also hosted a Twitter poll on the same subject. His post was shared by many people on Twitter, mostly those who support the BJP ideology.Gajaria’s lawyer claimed that his client was called in for questioning by the cyber police without revealing the nature of the complaint lodged with the police.

06-01-2022||Mumbai||NIA court allows Sudha Bharadwaj to stay in Thane||MUMBAI: A special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court on Thursday allowed activist Sudha Bharadwaj’s plea to stay in Thane while on bail in the Elgar Parishad case. After the Bombay high court (HC) allowed her default bail plea, the special NIA court on December 8 granted her bail. At that time, the court asked her to stay within its jurisdiction. On Thursday however, the court modified that condition and allowed Bharadwaj’s plea to stay in Thane and asked her to report to the local Vartak Nagar police station in Thane once every fortnight.Bharadwaj had moved court through her counsel Chandani Chawla saying that she was unable to find proper accomodation in Mumbai as it was expensive and that she wanted to stay in Thane with a friend. The prosecution had told the court that Bharadwaj should submit an affidavit of the person with whom she wished to stay and also an address proof.Bharadwaj was arrested on August 28, 2018, and granted default bail on December 1 by the Bombay HC, underlining that a Pune sessions judge, who granted the police a 90-day extension on November 26, 2018, to file the charge sheet, did not have the jurisdiction to do so as only a special NIA court could hear UAPA cases.The NIA court on Thursday also directed the superintendent of Taloja prison to preserve CCTV footage and provide clone copies of DVR to human right activist Surendra Gadling, who has also been arrested in the Elgar Parishad Case.Gadling argued before special NIA judge D E Kothalikar that the prisons authorities were not providing him proper medicines and had even stopped his ayurvedic medicine. His letters were also not handed over to him neither was he provided warm water to bathe despite suffering from several shoulder-related problems.Gadling accused the jail authorities of giving arbitrary medical test figures without actually checking him. He told the court that whenever the jail authorities did give proper medical facilities, he did not have any technical evidence to prove it like CCTV footage after which the court directed the jail authorities to preserve the CCTV.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nia-court-allows-sudha-bharadwaj-to-stay-in-thane-101641493477043.html
06-01-2022||Lucknow||Rly minister inaugurates dev projects, flags off Kamakhya Exp in Lucknow||Union railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Thursday announced three special trains and inaugurated coaching complex along with second entrance at Gomti Nagar railway station here even as he hailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision for the railways as pro-commoner. Soon after the inauguration, the minister flagged off new weekly Kamakhya express train between Gomti Nagar and Kamakhya (Assam). Dr Monica Agnihotri, divisional railway manager, North Eastern Railways, said two more trains would be flagged off in days to come. One would be Mumbai bound and the other Vaishno Devi bound, she added.Addressing a gathering at an event organised at Gomti Nagar railway station on the occasion, Vaishnaw said, “We must appreciate PM Narendra Modi’s vision for railways that is a pro-development. All development works are being carried out while keeping in mind the next 50 years. The PM’s aim is to facilitate the commoners, farmers, small traders and others and to provide them mobility.” He said efforts were also being made to bring post offices and railway stations together. “We have more than one lakh post offices in the country and more that 8,000 railway stations. In such a situation, we are chalking out a plan to bring both together to facilitate small traders in transporting goods from one place to another. We have also done the trial of the same facility and are still working on the integration technology,” the minister said. He said the facility will facilitate interstate goods transportation.Over the delay in re-starting passenger train service, the minister said, “We started operation of the passenger trains. But then the outbreak of Omicron variant of Covid 19 began following which we have to hold back the operations in order to check further spread of the virus.”He also launched a facility in which people can get their reservation done from post offices. The facility was launched in around 9,147 post offices in UP. The minister said presently the development schemes of more than ₹95,000 crore were running in UP and in the days to come these schemes would not only bring in development to the state but will also benefit farmers, traders and youths. Speaking at an event at GPO later, he said and India Post and the railways will work together with better cooperation in coming days. “The minister asked senior officials of India Post and Indian railways to work out a method for better cooperation,” said chief postmaster general Kaushalendra Kumar Sinha.
06-01-2022||Mumbai||UG medical registrations dip by 9K as experts attribute to delay in commencement of admission||MUMBAI Pre-admission registrations for undergraduate health science courses including MBBS and BDS have witnessed a drop by a few thousand applications this year. Figures shared by the state common entrance test (CET) cell – the admission authority – revealed that only 55,674 candidates completed the process by uploading the necessary documents and paying fees by January 5 which was the deadline. This is nearly 9,000 applications lower than the 64,645 candidates who completed the registration process in the previous academic year.In a bid to encourage more registrations, the CET cell on Thursday decided to extend the registration process by another five days till January 10. As per the new schedule, the first provisional merit list will now be released on January 13.“We have received queries from many students who could not complete the process either because they made errors while filling the online form or are still awaiting appropriate documents to attach with their form. In order to give such students more time to complete registrations, we have decided to extend the deadline,” said a senior official from the state CET cell. He added that the admission authority hopes that this extra time will be enough to encourage thousands more to complete the process.In 2019, 59,000 students registered for undergraduate medical courses, vying for 5,000 seats. This year, there are nearly 6,800 UG medical seats across government and private medical colleges in the state. While CET officials hope to attract thousands more for admissions over the next four days, experts have blamed the dip in registrations on the delay in commencement of the admission process which left not a single admission of UG or PG medical students in 2021 altogether.“Not only was the overall admission process delayed but simple registration for students and announcement of the state merit list was delayed in Maharashtra by four months. In the meantime, several students opted for admissions in neighbouring states where the process began in November itself,” said Sudha Shenoy, parent and activist. She added that in some cases, especially students with lower National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET-UG) scores, admissions were taken in other courses including engineering and pharmacy to avoid further delay.NEET-UG exams were conducted in September this year and the results were announced by the National Testing Agency (NTA) on November 1, after weeks of delay due to a Bombay high court stay. The Supreme Court is currently hearing a series of petitions filed by students questioning the validity of the implementation of EWS and OBC quota in all India quota (AIQ) seats, therefore continuing a stay on admissions to AIQ seats.The Maharashtra CET cell started pre-admission registrations only on December 30 while states like Kerala, Punjab and Odisha started registrations in November.“Several students have understood that the delay that they’ve faced this year is unprecedented and instead of waiting further, many have decided to appear for NEET exams again next year and apply for admissions. There are students who have sought admissions to BSc Computer Science courses and are planning to continue with those for the current academic year instead of wasting any more time on admissions and this is reflecting in registration figures,” said a senior official from the state Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) on condition of anonymity.
06-01-2022||Mumbai||No restrictions yet, state records over 36k cases||Mumbai The state deferred releasing a notification on the restrictions to curb the spread of the pandemic even as the state added 36,265 Covid cases on Thursday.State health minister Rajesh Tope on Thursday said that while there was no plan of shutting down local trains for commuters, a decision on night curfew and weekend lockdown will be taken at an appropriate time.“We have discussed multiple options including weekend lockdown and night curfew, but the final decision will be taken by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. There are concerns over the crowding at malls, restaurants by the youngsters after shutting down schools and colleges. The decision over the restrictions on non-essential sectors will be taken at the appropriate time,” Tope said.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on January 4 had said that the government would release an official communique the next day that would list the restrictions to be followed. Other states too have issued a host of restrictions as cases of Covid-19 surge around the country; most recently, New Delhi imposed a weekend curb. Others like West Bengal have curbed flights. Maharashtra announced closure of physical classes in higher education institutions on Wednesday.On Wednesday, Tope said that the state was considering “augmented restrictions” — for non-essential sectors and most affected places (like urban centres) — based on the recommendations of the state task force. The health department’s draft was expecting a final nod from chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.A senior official from the Mantralaya who did not wish to be named said that a government notification is yet to be issued, as the government was contemplating the current necessity of restrictions given the low rate of hospitalisation in the state. A draft notification on the impositions is being prepared, he said.“The upsurge in the cases is limited to five-six urbanised districts and there too, the hospitalization rate is very low. Until the demand of oxygen goes up and the bed occupancy is within check, we feel there is no need of panic. The restrictions can come in gradual manner and that too for the areas most affected,” said a senior minister requesting anonymity.Tope said that though the number of cases in the state was rising rapidly, especially in cities like Mumbai and Thane, the hospitalisation rate was still low. “Despite positivity rate in Mumbai being recorded at 25%, hardly 15% beds are occupied. This is unlike the second wave. Vaccination in the cities like Mumbai has played a crucial role in keeping the severity in check as people have developed antibodies to a large extent,” he said.With Thursday’s addition — three times the caseload on January 3, when it was 12,160 — the tally of cases in the state has gone up to 6,793,297. Mumbai recorded the highest number of cases at 19,780 — its highest ever — followed by Pune district which clocked 3,668 cases and Nashik, which saw 527. Mumbai Metropolitan Region, which is governed by nine municipal corporations, accounted for 30,312 or nearly 84 % of the total cases. The test positivity rate reported on Thursday was 21.28%. The state reported 13 new deaths taking the toll to 141,594.The Omicron variant was detected in 79 patients on Thursday taking the total tally of the state to 876. Of them, 381 have been discharged. Among the new Omicron variants reported, 57 were from Mumbai, seven from Thane city, while nine were from Pune district.The state started witnessing a surge in Covid-19 cases from December 22 onwards, after the daily caseload crossed the 1000-mark after several weeks. In the last 16 days, 142,332 fresh cases have been reported. The number of active cases has risen to 114,847 on Thursday, from 7,350 cases on December 22.The health minister said that the decision over the imposition of more curbs will be taken after due deliberation by the top leadership.Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar held a meeting with Tope, home minister Dilip Walse Patil, officials from the health department to take stock of the situation.Tope said that Pawar and the CM were in touch and discuss the key issues on daily basis. “Pawarsaheb took stock of the situation during our meeting with him today. He has asked us to stress upon the vaccination and convince 80 lakh people who have not taken even their first dose. He has also directed to chalk out plan for the inoculation of the fully vaccinated people with booster dose,” he added.Medical education minister Amit Deshmukh said that the government was planning to appoint doctors and health workers in government hospitals on contract basis to tide over the shortage. He said that the government hospitals across the state have sufficient beds required for the Covid-19 treatment vacant.End

06-01-2022||Lucknow||UP cabinet nod to 50pc rebate to farmers in tubewell power bills||In a major step aimed at giving relief to farmers, the state government on Thursday announced increase in subsidy to bring down to 50 per cent rebate the power tariff applicable to private tubewells owned by nearly 13 lakh farmers in Uttar Pradesh.An official spokesman said the state cabinet has approved the move. “The relief will lead to an extra burden of an estimated ₹1,000 crore on the UP Power Corporation Ltd and benefit an estimated 13 lakh consumers,” said the spokesman.According to the proposed new rates, now consumers in rural areas will have to pay Re 1 per unit instead of the present ₹2 per unit for a metered tubewell. For energy efficient tubewells, the rate will be 83 paise per unit instead of existing ₹1.65 per unit. The fixed charge has been brought down to ₹35 per horsepower instead of ₹70 for metred connections and ₹85 per horsepower from ₹170 per horsepower for unmetered connections.“Chief minister Yogi Adityanath who is committed towards the convenience and prosperity of farmers has decided to give 50% rebate in power rates for private tubewells,” the chief minister’s office (CMO) said in a tweet in Hindi.The state government at present provides subsidy to the tune of ₹11,000 crore annually to Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) for providing cheap power to tubewells. The state government will have to now increase the subsidy accordingly. Earlier this month, Samajwadi Party (SP) national president Akhilesh Yadav had announced free power to farmers for irrigation and 300 units free to all domestic power consumers if his party formed the next government in Uttar Pradesh. The Congress too has promised to bring down the power bills to half.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-cabinet-nod-to-50pc-rebate-to-farmers-in-tubewell-power-bills-101641492936209.html

06-01-2022||Lucknow||Hindus expelled from Pakistan, B’desh given land in UP: Yogi||Lucknow: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said on Thursday that Hindus expelled from Pakistan and Bangladesh and living in Uttar Pradesh, had been accommodated in the land that the state government freed from encroachers. Speaking at an event here for distribution of appointment letters to candidates selected for various posts in government services, Yogi said: “Hindus, who were living in Meerut for decades after facing expulsion from Pakistan and Bangladesh, could not afford to build their own houses or buy lands. We have given 63 such Bengali Hindu families two acres of land and 200 square yards for housing per family in Kanpur Dehat. These lands were freed from ‘bhu mafia’ (land grabbers).” Each of the 63 families was also given ₹1.20 lakh under ‘Mukhyamantri Awas Yojana’, Yogi Adityanath said. The chief minister said all the land freed from “encroachers” was brought under a ‘land bank’ and these pieces of land would be used to set up schools, industries and other businesses. “Many facilities of the Defence Industrial Corridor have also been built on these recovered lands,” he said. According to the chief minister, the state government currently has 64,366 hectares of the recovered land and it is being allotted for the poor to build houses. Yogi Adityanath had earlier said in the Legislative Council that the anti-land mafia task force had freed 67,000 acres of land belonging to the revenue department. He also said his government had introduced transparency in all government exams, thereby marking a paradigm shift in the recruitment process from the previous regime. Speaking about introducing transparency in recruitment to government services, the chief minister said without taking any names, “Before 2017, whenever vacancies were announced, the uncles and nephews used to carry out extortion up to the village level. While they used to extort, the officials involved in the recruitment process were made the scapegoats. “But... now whenever there is any irregularity in the selection process, we have not desisted from cancelling it and taking stern action against those involved.” Yogi handed over appointment letters to 57 naib tehsildars, 141 spokespersons of government colleges and 69 assistant teachers on the occasion. The chief minister claimed that the state government had so far appointed more than 1,75,000 teachers in primary, secondary and higher education departments. “Never before were so many teachers recruited. The recruitment process was completely transparent,” he said.

06-01-2022||Gurugram||Faridabad police arrest 7 for duping 187 people across country||The Faridabad police on Thursday busted a gang of cyber fraudsters who allegedly posed as bank executives, operated a fake call centre and duped 187 people from 21 states. Police said they arrested seven suspects from Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, adding that 50 cases were registered against them in Telangana, 41 in Uttar Pradesh, 21 in Delhi and 21 in Haryana in the last three months.Police identified the suspects as Abdullah (29) and Pankaj (21) of Delhi, Sonveer Rathore (25) of Bhind and Rahul (20) of Morena in Madhya Pradesh, Aman (22) of Etawah in UP, Shakti Mishra (30) of Bihar and Subhan (20) of Uttar Pradesh. Police allegedly recovered 35 mobile phones, 109 SIM Cards, 15 ATM Cards and ₹22.60 lakh from their possession.The case came to light on December 16, 2021, when one Manoj Kumar, a resident of Hirapur in Faridabad complained to police and alleged that he received a call from a person posing as a State Bank of India customer care executive who offered to increase his credit card limit to which he agreed.Manoj Kumar told police that he shared all his credit card details and personal information such as card number, CVV number, expiry date, and OTP, trusting that the caller was from the bank but within minutes ₹1.57 lakh was transferred from his account to another.Basant Kumar, station house officer (SHO), Faridabad cyber police station, said that the suspects had used a spoof app to make calls using the SBI bank customer care number. “We registered a case, but the same month, we received three more similar complaints and found that the complainants had been defrauded using the same modus operandi,” he said.Kumar said they traced the location of the mobile number to Delhi’s Uttam Nagar and started technical surveillance.Vikas Arora, Faridabad commissioner of police, said that the suspects were operating from different areas and their roles and responsibilities were divided.“Pankaj was the backbone of the gang as he was a technical expert and had knowledge of spoof apps. He had learned about it through one of his relatives who was arrested by Punjab police for similar cases and had joined hands with Abdullah who started the fake call centre,” he said.Modus OperandiThe gang members’ modus operandi was to first obtain customer credit card data from third parties. Their telecallers would then make calls to bank account holders in possession of credit cards and offer them various services. To make customers believe that the call was from the SBI’s toll-free number, the gang used a call spoofing application, said police.Police said they would collect the victims’ data and make transactions on property rental/purchase portals. The amount would get credited to the bank accounts linked to the property rental portals and later transferred to the fraudsters’ bank accounts.One of them would visit different ATMs to withdraw cash and divide it among themselves after deducting expenditure, said police.Arora said this case is one of the biggest cyber fraud cases ever busted in Haryana. “It is estimated that more than 1,000 cases would be registered against the gang across the country, they have duped people of crores,” he said.To run the business, Abdullah, Sonveer and Pankaj allegedly opened a call centre six months ago in Uttam Nagar and employed 20 tele callers. Pankaj allegedly obtained the call spoofing application through an outsider.Arora said while three of the suspects took care of operations and applications, the rest of the gang members worked on getting SIM cards and executing fraudulent money transactions simultaneously. “We will seek a forensic audit of their operation and call centre to understand the quantum of loss and to recover the amount,” he said.

To curb the development of illegal colonies, the state government in August last year also changed rules for obtaining no-objection certificates from DTCP for the registration of a plot by revenue authorities--a move that has helped curb illegal development to an extent, according to authorities.“The curb on registering small plots has helped keep illegal development in check and the ongoing drone survey will also give a clearer picture of the ground situation,” said Bhath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dtcp-recommends-firs-against-58-persons-in-gurugram-for-developing-illegal-colonies-101641492394855.html

06-01-2022||Lucknow||Akhilesh, Jayant discuss seat sharing, west UP poll equations||Samajwadi Party (SP) national president Akhilesh Yadav and his Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) counterpart Chaudhary Jayant Singh met in Lucknow on Thursday and discussed seat sharing between the two parties in western UP as weel as the Jat-Dalit-Muslim equation in the region. The RLD is the SP’s biggest alliance partner for the 2022 UP assembly polls.Jayant reached Lucknow in the late morning and spent nearly three hours, discussing the issues and strategies with Akhilesh at the Samajwadi Party’s Janeshwar Mishra Trust office.“The two leaders met and discussed to further consolidate the alliance and formulate joint strategies,” said SP state spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary.Soon after the meeting ended, both Akhilesh and Jayant tweeted the same picture of the meeting with different captions.Akhilesh’s tweet in Hindi read: “Discussing UP’s future with Shri Jayant Chaudhary.” Jayant wrote in English: “Cemented our ties for the development of Uttar Pradesh.”The SP and the RLD have been partners since the 2017 UP assembly polls. They have contested all the elections and bypolls in alliance since then.The SP had allied with the Congress in the 2017 UP assembly polls and with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. However, both the alliances had failed to work for Akhilesh. This time, Akhilesh only carried forward the alliance with the RLD and struck new partnerships with smaller regional players such as the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) and the Janwadi Party (Socialist) in eastern UP; the Mahan Dal in the Rohilkhand region, the Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party-Lohia (PSP-L) of Shivpal Yadav in districts like Etawah, Mainpuri, Firozabad, Etah, and a few smaller outfits.A person aware of the Thursday’s discussions between Akhilesh and Jayant said: “The discussions were centred around fine-tuning seat sharing between the two parties in western UP, which is the region of the RLD’s influence, and formulating Jat-Muslim-Dalit equation and combining it with the SP’s backward classes vote base.”Nearly 100 assembly constituencies in western UP have Jats as influential voters, while Muslims have influence in even more constituencies.Former MP and RLD leader Sompal Shastri, too, was present during the meeting. He had accompanied Jayant. Shastri had become the MP from Baghpat on the BJP ticket in 1998, defeating RLD’s late Ajit Singh (Jayant’s father).The person aware of the matter also said the SP would not go beyond the previously agreed upon 36 seats to the RLD, but would give SP tickets to RLD candidates, and vice-versa on a few seats where the party would field its candidates on the RLD ticket.Those in the Samajwadi Party privy to the issue said the SP-RLD alliance is strong, and Akhilesh and Jayant will announce the seat-sharing at a joint press conference in Lucknow soon after the poll notification.
06-01-2022||Lucknow||Nation won’t forgive “conspirators” of PM’s security breach: UP CM Yogi||Terming Wednesday’s breach in PM Narendra Modi’s security in Punjab a conspiracy with the country, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said the countrymen will not forgive the “conspirators”.“When the country is safe, only then we will all be safe. But some people want to break into it. The proof of it has come in front of the countrymen in the form of a ‘conspiracy’ in Punjab on Wednesday,” Yogi said while addressing people after distributing tablets and smartphones to 1200 students in a programme organised at Rudraksh Convention Centre in Varanasi on Thursday.He said the PM had talked about “Digital India” in 2014 and had announced many schemes for the youth. “India is the youngest country in the world. India has the largest number of youths in the world. In India, largest number of youths reside in Uttar Pradesh,” the CM added.“During the pandemic, I realised that students wanted to study online but they were helpless due to lack of resources. That’s when the UP government decided to provide tablets/smartphones to such youths. These devices will be provided to one crore youths of the state, including 90,000 students of Varanasi. Along with this, digital accessories will also be made available free of cost,” Yogi said.He said the direction of youth power would be the direction of the country. “India is emerging as a power in the world,” the CM said. Referring to the corona period, he said India’s corona management was appreciated all over the world. He further said the population of the US is one-fourth of India’s population but there were one-and-a-half-times more deaths there than India during the Covid period.Tablets have been made available to 10,000 children preparing for competitive exams under the Mukhyamantri Abhyuday Yojana offering free coaching to economically weaker aspirants of competitive exams in UP. This facility will also be provided to the students of medical, engineering and ITIs including graduates, he said.While talking about the restoration of Somnath temple, he said country’s first President Dr Rajendra Prasad had attended a function held to discuss revamping Somnath temple despite the then government’s opposition. He further said, however, PM Narendra Modi himself came to inaugurate Shri Kashi Vishwanath Dham Corridor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/nation-won-t-forgive-conspirators-of-pm-s-security-breach-up-cm-yogi-101641492214740.html
06-01-2022||Gurugram||Gurugram saw highest housing sales, launches in NCR in 2021: Anarock report||The city reported the highest sale of residential units in the National Capital Region (NCR) in 2021, followed by Greater Noida, according to a report by Anarock released on Thursday.The report said the city reported the sale of 11,990 units last year--a 115% increase compared to the previous year’s sales. The city also reported the maximum number of real estate unit launches across Delhi-NCR.The report said that of the 31,710 units launched in NCR in 2021, Gurugram launched 58%. In comparison, Greater Noida reported the sale of 9,580 units and the launch of 3,930 new units.According to the report, NCR’s housing sales increased by 73% from 23,210 units in 2020 to 40,050 units in 2021. During the pre-Covid-19 period in 2019, total sales in the region were approximately 46,920 units. So in 2021, housing sales in NCR have already reached 85% of the pre-pandemic level, the report said.Realtors and realty experts in Gurugram said that 2021 saw the return of the end-users and several first-time buyers. The easy availability of low-cost loans, sops announced by the government, and discounts given by developers helped the market revive.Pradeep Aggarwal, a city-based developer and chairman, Signature Group, said that the affordable segment of housing witnessed an all-time high demand in 2021. “Many end-users bought homes in the affordable segment as Covid-19 made them realise the importance of owning their own home. Gurugram has emerged as a key market for affordable housing and also independent floors--and these have really picked up. We are expecting better business in 2022,” he said.Anuj Puri, chairman, Anarock Group, said, “Of the four quarters, quarter four of 2021 was by far the best, with housing sales in the top seven cities attaining a new high of approximately 90,860 units. This was the highest quarterly sales performance since 2015.”City-based brokers said that after May 2021, the market gained momentum, and the leads generated in the next three months after May were converted into sales in the last quarter of the year.“Despite the pandemic, we are seeing that there is a correction in prices by 10% to 15% in many areas. The ready-to-move-in properties are now being sold at a premium,” said Sanjeev Thakur, a city-based broker.Another trend witnessed in the city was a higher demand for larger flats and houses. “There is a 20% to 30% increase in sales because during lockdown everybody felt that homes are very important for a family and the size of their homes should be larger. There has also been a demand for organised retail spaces, and SCOs [shop-cum-offices] have emerged as major attractions in this category, particularly to investors,” said Gurpal Singh Chawla, director, Spaze Group.
06-01-2022||Delhi||20 guests is way too less, rue wedding planners in Delhi||How many wedding guests are allowed in Delhi? “20 only, and it’s too less!” say wedding planners, ruing about the cap as per the Covid protocols in the Capital. With most weddings getting postponed for a later date due to this restriction, wedding planners in the city say it’s posing a major loss to their businesses, and one that’s tough to bear now after being on a rocky road since the start of the pandemic. “Everyone wants dhoom dhaam at the shaadi, and that isn’t possible with a presence of just 20 guests,” says Pawan Sharma, founder, The Wedding Curator, adding, “In a 20 people limited guest list, many can’t even manage to call in their immediate family members. Then the wedding just turns out to be a formality, and mostly those are opting to not back out, who had been postponing their wedding since the whole of last year; with the hope of being able to enjoy their D-Day. They aren’t left with much option at the moment. However, while we bear the loss of a cancellation, there are other expenses as well as when wedding get postponed. All work needs to start afresh, for the new dates that get finalised later. And it’s us who have to bear the office expenses, worker expenses, and I’m not in a good situation to face it all over again.” Jitesh Khana, co-founder, The Velvet Weddings, seconds the thought, and adds, “50 guests still makes sense, but the present guideline of 20 people is too less!” In an attempt to put forth their view point, a few members of the wedding industry have written to the chief minister, requesting for a meeting to discuss the issue. “We have so many venues, and where the venue size is say 4,000 or 5,000 square feet, how is it possible to have just 20 guests there to maintain social distancing? At least the number of guests can be allowed as per the venue sizes,” Rajeev Jain, managing director, Rashi Entertainment, adding, “We all associated with the wedding industry are completely with the government, and understand why have they have put such restrictions on number of guests. But we feel that weddings are the safest among all the services that have been curbed, and we would like to explain our side to the government that has done so much to protect our city from Covid. We just want that the happiness quotient associated with the weddings should continue... and we assure to take care of everything else.”On the brink of losing out big projects because of the cap on wedding guests, Reema Khatri from Wed My Way says, “Many people who had planned weddings at this time are stressed out because hotels aren’t returning the money either. We had a lot of international clients and NRIs coming in for weddings, and now they need to quarantine soon. But the families don’t even know ki shaadi hogi bhi ya nahi. If they are getting an RT-PCR done after quarantine, then what’s the issue in involving them to the guest list? We can always seat people in a socially distanced way. And if one has booked a venue for 200 people, then how can they reduce it to 20 suddenly? I feel that an RT PCR must be made mandatory for all guests, along with vaccination certificates, and these should be enough to allow people to participate in weddings that were booked last month or even before that. Otherwise, their money must be compensated.” Also in favour of approving vaccination certificates as a criteria to increase the guest limit of weddings in Delhi, Sanya Aneja from The 7 Vows, opines, “People who have weddings, did the planning months back, so why stop them now? At least let them do the weddings with more number of people. Okay, may be not 200, but at least not 20 either. Let them call their immediate families. Otherwise, it will get tough for them and us too! Due to such changes, now people are not even ready to pay advance, even for weddings planned in February!”Some from the industry, have however made peace with the situation. “It’s okay to take a financial hit than to take in our stride the loss of human lives,” says celebrity wedding designer Swati Pandya Sood, adding, “At the moment, I’m stuck overseas as I had a big destination wedding abroad, and now the client from Delhi says their guests are not willing to travel in this scenario. Imagine! I came to build the set and do the logistics since December 22, for this mega wedding. It was a huge hit that we took... but we took it because I always say: Each human life holds most weightage than any amount of ticket size.” Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/20-guests-is-way-too-less-rue-wedding-planners-in-delhi-101641492035864.html
06-01-2022||Gurugram||Will pray at six designated sites, areas with no disruptions in Gurugram, say Muslims||The Muslim community on Thursday said they will offer Friday prayers at the six designated sites and in open spaces where there were no disruptions last week by Hindu right-wing members, and also urged the district administration to deploy police personnel at these sites to ensure safety and security of those who gather to pray. Last week Muslims offered Friday prayers in the open at Shankar Chowk, Udyog Vihar, Palam Vihar, and sectors 12, 29, 44, and 45. A group of Sanyukt Hindu Sangharsh Samiti, an umbrella body of Hindu right-wing groups that is leading the protests against namaz in open spaces, gathered at Shankar Chowk before the namaz congregation assembled but were made to retreat by police teams deployed there. Hindu groups have been protesting against Friday namaz in public spaces in Gurugram for the past three years. In 2018, the administration designated 37 sites for Muslims to pray on Fridays. However, last November, the number of sites was reduced to 20 after members of right-wing groups and locals started protesting against Friday prayers and disrupted namaz gatherings at several places. Muslim groups claim that they are forced to use public spaces as there are not enough mosques in the city -- there are only 13 mosques in Gurugram. “We will, as usual, visit our designated spots to offer namaz and police will be responsible if any untoward incident happens at any of these spots,” said a senior member of Gurgaon Muslim Council, requesting anonymity. Right-wing members said they will continue to protest against namaz in the open and will ensure no one is allowed to use any public place for Friday prayers. Mahavir Bhardwaj, president of Sanyukt Hindu Sangharsh Samiti, said, “The Gurugram Imam Sanghathan had agreed to not offer namaz in the open but Muslims are again using public spaces to offer namaz, leading to confrontations. We have already agreed to six places but they are again trying to encroach on parks and grounds which will not be tolerated. Last Friday, we did not do anything but this Friday, if Muslims offer namaz in any place other than the six designated sites, we will protest there,” he said. Kulbhushan Bhardwaj, legal advisor of the samiti, said they are ready with teams and will keep a check on spots where Muslims offer namaz. “We will not allow them to offer prayers in the open and if they do, we will disrupt the proceedings,” he said. Police said they have deployed a team of 50 personnel at each spot and will ensure law and order in the city. Aman Yadav, assistant commissioner of police, said anyone caught disrupting namaz will be arrested on the spot. “No one will be allowed to visit any public place to create a ruckus. No right-wing group will be allowed to enter sites where Friday prayers will be offered,” he said. Meanwhile, Mohammad Adeeb, a former Rajya Sabha member who is leading a 21-member committee to resolve the ongoing namaz issue, on Thursday said he was planning to approach Punjab and Haryana high court to quash the FIR filed against him and two others , registered on Wednesday on the basis of a complaint filed by a right-wing activist who has been involved in protests against namaz on public land. The FIR was registered at Sector 40 police station under sections 153 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. “I am consulting my lawyer to approach the high court against the FIR registered against us. The people behind this case will have to withdraw the complaint as it is baseless and mala fide,” he said.

06-01-2022||Gurugram||Three arrested for bank robbery in Faridabad||Faridabad police on Wednesday arrested three persons allegedly involved in robbing a bank in the Sector 15 market of ₹1.84 lakh on December 22. Police said the mastermind of the gang is a former army sepoy who allegedly fled from his unit and started a marble business. Police said he later started gambling, lost money and became indebted to some people, which is why he planned to rob a bank with his associates. Police identified the suspects as Yogesh alias Billu, Rahul and Sonu of Palwal. They recovered a motorcycle, a knife, a pistol and two live cartridges from their possession. Narender Kadiyan, deputy commissioner of police (crime), said they formed five teams to probe the robbery. “On December 22, around 12.45pm, three masked men entered the Sector 15 branch of Canara Bank from the rear gate. They held the cashier hostage at gunpoint and robbed ₹1.84 lakh. The incident was captured on CCTV cameras,” he said. Kadiyan said they found crucial inputs on the footage which helped them identify the suspects. “We took the help of locals also to get some leads, following which we arrested the suspects from Palwal,” he said. During questioning, the suspects allegedly revealed that Yogesh was the kingpin of the gang. He was recruited in the army in 2009 and, in 2014, he allegedly fled from his unit. He started his business but suffered huge losses in marble trading. “He landed in bad company and started gambling and drinking with a few miscreants. He planned to rob a bank and involved his associates,” said Kadiyan. Police said they conducted reconnaissance of the bank for over 10 days and visited the bank several times to understand the layout. They told the police that they decided to carry out the robbery during lunchtime as the security guard would take a break around that time and there was no rush in the bank during that hour.

06-01-2022||Pune||IISER Pune scientist part of a research paper in ‘Nature Ecology and Evolution’||PUNE A faculty member of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, Devapriya Chattopadhyay, PhD, has contributed to a research project on the effect of colonial history and socio-economic factors on the study of fossils, and proposes steps to reduce global disparities. The project is titled ‘Nature Ecology and Evolution’ and Chattopadhyay’s input is on “Colonial history and global economics distort our understanding of deep-time biodiversity”, a collaboration with authors from Germany, Africa, South America, and the UK. A team of seven palaeontologists from Germany, the UK, South Africa, Brazil, and India, investigated how colonial history and socio-economic factors affect the global distribution of fossil data. The paper represents a collaboration that developed during the pandemic between women in STEM, across four continents. Along with the paper, the authors have released plain language summaries of the work in 20 languages. “Fossils provide an essential record of how life on Earth has evolved. However, the fossil record is incomplete, primarily because the dead remains of an organism rarely survive the vagaries of nature to emerge as a fossil. Apart from the natural scarcity of the fossils compared to the living creatures, the fate of fossils after their discovery plays a significant role in our ability to use them meaningfully to reconstruct past biodiversity,” said Chattopadhyay. The authors observe that due to historical and socio-economic factors, the post-discovery journey of fossils resulted in an uneven geographic distribution of fossils. Using scientific publication and geographic data from the Paleobiology Database (www.paleobiodb.org), which is a widely used database by palaeontologists to investigate past biodiversity patterns, the authors show that 97% of paleontological data is generated by researchers based in Northern America and Western Europe. The authors also observe that many affluent countries conduct a large amount of research abroad, often without collaboration with local researchers in the countries they are working in. The authors point out that this is a demonstration of “parachute science”, where lower-income countries are exploited for their fossils, but the higher-income countries retain the knowledge and power. “This knowledge imbalance, resulting from colonial history, transfer of fossils from the collected regions to museums of colonising countries, and unfavourable socio-economic conditions in previously colonised countries, negatively impacts paleontological research,” she added. The paper indicates that one of the most affected countries is Myanmar, as a result of the availability of amber through commercial routes that has increased the availability of amber to foreign researchers while limiting access to researchers from Myanmar. This is also observed in countries rich in vertebrate fossils, such Morocco or Mongolia, given the popularity of vertebrate fossils among palaeontologists as well as the general public. These countries, along with others such as China or Brazil, have also witnessed illegal fossil trafficking in the past.This study, led by Nussaïbah B Raja and Emma M Dunne, proposes a few steps for the paleontological community to adopt for reducing the global disparities in palaeontology. They encourage the community to develop more equitable, ethical, and sustainable collaborations based on mutual trust and respect.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/iiser-pune-scientist-part-of-a-research-paper-in-nature-ecology-and-evolution-101641491074744.html

06-01-2022||Delhi||Man, woman held at Delhi airport for smuggling gold worth ₹70 lakh||A man and a woman have been arrested at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International (IGI) airport by the customs in two separate cases, after they were found trying to smuggle in gold from Paris and Dubai, respectively. While the woman was arrested after a packet bearing a ”brown powder” was detected in her undergarments, which was later found to be gold in powder form, the man had concealed 84 gold items, including coins, pendants and rings, in his luggage and was trying to get it through the green channel undetected, officials said.In the first case, the woman passenger arrived from Dubai via a SpiceJet flight on Tuesday and was taken in for checking on a suspicion that she was carrying a contraband. Upon checking, a brown powdered substance was detected in her undergarments, which was later tested. “The powder weighing 1,070 grams was recovered. From that, gold weighing 883 grams was retrieved, with a market value of ₹39.53 lakh,” said a customs official, adding that the gold was smuggled in a powdered form to make it difficult to detect. “It was discovered while scanning the passenger and the packet appeared suspicious,” the official said.In the second case, a man who arrived from Paris was taken in for checking the same day, after something suspicious was detected in his baggage during an X-ray inspection. Customs says upon inspection, 77 gold coins, three gold bracelets, one gold ring and two gold pendants, weighing a total of 761 grams, were recovered.“The total value of the recovery is ₹30.36 lakh. Together, the recovery is close to ₹70 lakh,” said the customs department, stating that both the man and the woman have been placed under arrest as per Section 104 of the Customs Act, 1962.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-woman-held-at-delhi-airport-for-smuggling-gold-worth-70-lakh-101641490894753.html
06-01-2022||Mumbai||BMC issues fresh home isolation guidelines||Mumbai The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) issued a circular allowing asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients to be isolated at home for seven days rather than being hospitalised. With this decision, the formal home isolation period also has been brought down to seven days from the earlier 10 days in Mumbai.However, patients with severe symptoms or with comorbidities will be hospitalised basis on the clinical situation on a case-to-case basis.Further, those who cannot isolate at home will continue to be quarantined at BMC’s isolation facility. Meanwhile, the state health department has directed the district administrations to follow the Centre’s guidelines on home quarantine and hospitalisation.With the surge in cases in Mumbai for the past week, the city has seen a jump in the number of people hospitalised. Since January 1, Mumbai has hospitalised 4,688 Covid patients, according to BMC data. According to BMC officials, the decision was taken on the basis of the new and revised home quarantine guidelines issued by the Central government on January 5.The revised guidelines state that those with severe symptoms like chest congestion, fever for over three days, or with oxygen levels below 93 require medical attention.However, those choosing home isolation will require a caregiver 24x7, ideally who is fully vaccinated for being the link between medical officer and the positive patient. Also, those with comorbidities shall be allowed for home isolation, but a decision will be taken on the basis of medical evaluation.Dr Mangala Gomare, chief of public health department of the BMC, said, “These guidelines will be circulated to all hospitals where clinical symptoms will decide the criteria for hospitalisation.”Dr Gomare added, “Those with mild symptoms or are asymptomatic can be isolated at home. Our doctors from the ward war room will provide them with medical assistance. This arrangement will help us in better bed management.”The city has been witnessing a spike in Covid cases for the last 20 days and the Omicron variant is said to be the driving force. The BMC in a statement on December 31 had said that its genome sequencing had revealed that 55% of the total samples were Omicron infections.In the statement, it said that out of the total 282 samples, 13% were patients of the Delta variant, 32% of Delta derivatives and 55% of Omicron variant. Out of 282 Omicron variants, only 17 patients had to be hospitalised.Further, according to BMC officials, it is expected that now the dominance of the Omicron variant may have reached the 80%-mark. However, it will be clear in its further results of genomic sequencing. In a bid to ascertain the level of Omicron variant’s spread in the districts, the Maharashtra government is sending about 4,000 samples a month for genome sequencing from all the 36 districts of the state. The state had been sending samples for genome sequencing as part of its pact with the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB) since April 2021. Dr Pradeep Awate, the state’s surveillance officer, said that the state’s protocol has been to send 5% of the total samples that have tested positive for Covid-19 for genome sequencing. “Every month we send 100 random samples from each of the districts to study the variant,” he said. Maharashtra sends 3,600 samples monthly, which now could go up to 5,000, officials said. The state has mandated screening, testing and genome sequencing of positive samples of international passengers at Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur airports since the outbreak of the Omicron variant late last year.Meanwhile, Awate said that they would follow the guidelines issued by the Centre on home quarantine for Covid positive patients. Officials said that the patient under home isolation would stand discharged and end isolation after seven days from testing positive and no fever for three successive days. The overall treatment protocol, Awate said, would remain the same as it was in the second wave of the Covid infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-issues-fresh-home-isolation-guidelines-101641490654665.html

Now the repair work has started from the last two days,” said Mahajan.In the continuous follow-up about his complaint to railways and PMC, Mahajan was given the copy of letters that were sent by these governing bodies to each other. Whereas now both the authorities are coordinating and carrying out the repair works.Manoj Jhawar, Pune railway division spokesperson, said, “Our maintenance department engineers visited the spot and they tried to find out the reason for the water leakage. The necessary repairing works and other maintenance works are been done by our workers and now the remaining repairing will be carried out by the PMC workers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ht-impact-water-pipeline-leakage-repair-work-starts-near-sangamwadi-rto-101641490536382.html
06-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Channi’s elevation gives fillip to Cong in Rupnagar||Even though this district with historical and religious significance to Sikhs has given mixed election results in the past, the elevation of Charanjit Singh Channi as the Punjab chief minister has strengthened the Congress. The split of Akali-BJP vote bank has further boosted the Grand Old Party’s prospects in the Rupnagar district that sends three legislators to the state assembly. Chamkaur Sahib: Channi looks set for fourth termCharanjit Singh Channi’s appointment as the chief minister has further boosted his chances of getting re-elected from Chamkaur Sahib. Already a popular face among the electorate, Channi has scored a hat-trick from this reserved seat, which was a Shiromani Akali Dal stronghold. Channi had first won as an independent candidate in 2007, and saw a meteoric rise after joining the Congress. He became the leader of opposition in 2015 and has now become the CM into his third term. He knows the art to connect with the common man, and is known for resolving citizens’ issues by sitting among them. Now, at the helm of governance in the state, he has pumped a lot of funds to further develop his constituency. For the SAD-BSP, Harmohan Singh, a retired cop and son of former MLA Satwant Kaur, will challenge Channi. The AAP has again fielded Dr Charanjit Singh, who stood second in the last election. Illegal mining remains the biggest issue in the area. Rupnagar: Akali heavyweight is eyeing comebackIt is the seat that saw AAP candidate Amarjit Singh Sandoa defeat SAD heavyweight Dr Daljit Singh Cheema. However, he joined the Congress ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and then returned to the AAP fold. Owing to these flip-flops and other controversies, the AAP has given the ticket to RTI activist Dinesh Chadha, who is quite active in the area. The SAD has once again fielded former minister Dr Daljit Cheema, who despite his defeat never left the area and remains in touch with the electorate. Youth Congress president Barinder Singh Dhillon, who unsuccessfully contested the last elections on the Congress ticket, is now facing opposition from local partymen with backing of senior leaders. Improvement Trust chairman Surinder Singh is also in the fray for the Congress ticket. The segment has not seen much development in the past five years, mainly as the MLA was from the opposition. Even here, illegal mining remains a key concern. Anandpur Sahib: Development works speak for speaker Even though three-time legislator Rana KP Singh didn’t find place in the cabinet, as the Vidhan Sabha speaker, he not only wields constitutional power but also knows how to use it. Be it Captain Amarinder Singh or Charanjit Singh Channi at the helm of affairs, Rana KP is considered close to both and thus got ample funds for development projects in Anandpur Sahib. However, Youth Congress president Barinder Dhillon is creating troubles for him. In the BJP, 2017 contender Dr Parminder Sharma and former minister Madan Mohan Mittal’s son Arvind Mittal are making efforts to get the ticket. However, the split of the SAD and BJP vote bank has dented the saffron party’s prospects. As the SAD has given the seat to its new ally BSP, it has fielded Nitin Nanda, who earlier had links with Shiv Sena. His candidature is opposed by local party workers. Besides illegal mining, frequent flooding and poor potable water supply are major concerns of voters.

06-01-2022||Pune||Pune has 1.38 lakh vials of Remdesivir; FDA asks private hospitals to ramp up medicine supply||PUNE In the light of the surge in the number of Covid-19 cases, the Maharashtra Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has asked private hospitals and chemists to ramp up medicine supply in the coming days. According to the FDA commissioner, private hospitals and chemists in Pune district currently have around 28,000 vials of Remdesivir while stock at public hospitals stands at 1.10 lakh. “There is an ample stock of eight different kinds of drugs required in the treatment of Covid-19,” said Shyam Pratapwar, joint commissioner, FDA. The FDA and authorities held a meeting this week to take a review of medicine stock currently available at private hospitals. He said that as far Remdesivir, a key drug that saw a tremendous scarcity during the second wave, is concerned, there are over 28,000 vials currently available in the market in the Pune district. Besides Remdesivir, there are around 135 tocilizumab vials available. “Considering the experience during the first and second wave, we have asked private hospitals and chemists with a license to ramp up the stock of eight drugs including Remdesivir proportionate with their beds,” said Pratapwar. During the second wave, Pune and the rest of the state witnessed a shortage of this expensive and much-hyped antiviral drug, which was prescribed on large scale by doctors, leading to scarcity. This in effect also led to its black marketing and overcharging. Pratapwar said the FDA will keep a check on black marketing and illegal hoarding of the stock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-has-1-38-lakh-vials-of-remdesivir-fda-asks-private-hospitals-to-ramp-up-medicine-supply-101641490176508.html

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has now set deadline to restore all the streets in original form by January 20. The PMC standing committee chairman Hemant Rasane said, “The work is expected to be completed on time.” The PMC is rushing to complete its ambitious 24x7 water supply project. The project’s deadline is March 2023 and with the PMC election knocking at the door, the project has picked up pace. However, roads have been dug up in the old parts of the city for installation of the new pipelines. This has slowed the traffic and caused inconvenience to the public. “Roads have been dug up due to the installation of drainage lines, 24x7 water supply project, the MNGL project, which will finish by January 10-12, according to the Rasane. “The restoration of the roads will begin after that and eight to ten days will be enough for that, ”he added. The local residents from Sadashiv peth, Shiniwar peth and Shukrapar peth along with commuters passing through these areas have been complaining about bad roads for the past few months. “Once we take the Shivaji road, we run into traffic jams and the buses get delayed by at least half an hour,” said Pawan, a bus conductor“Roads have been dug in various parts of the peth area for over a month in some areas. They are taking way too long to complete the work,” complained an atuo-rickshaw driver. The installation of the pipes and the subsequent road repairing work is causing inconvenience to the local shop owners as well. “The work is taking place right in front of my shop and it has blocked the road. This has affected my business,” said the owner of a lemonade stand on Shivaji road. Drainage pipes are being installed and simultaneously roads are being repaired after the pipes have been placed in peth areas of Bajirao road and Laxmi road as well. “The installation of pipes started just a couple of days ago. There’s no certainty when the work will be completed. It can take a week or even a month,” said Arun Kutarkar, a worker at the road repairing site at Shivaji road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-sets-jan-20-deadline-to-restore-roads-in-peth-areas-101641489879334.html

Petty fights that turned violent was the major reason for murders, followed by a tie between domestic fight and pre-planned murders. In 2021, 100 cases of murder were witnessed as against 87 in 2020. Whereas, the cases of attempted murder witnessed a major jump from 138 cases in 2020 to 298 in 2021, according to the data. The number of domestic and character suspicion-based murders went up from 13 in 2020 to 21 in 2021. Cases of murder by firing increased in 2021. The recent murder of a local builder by two bike-borne men who pumped 6 bullets into him sent shock waves in the vicinity. Similarly, in another case of a family, the mothers body was found in Saswad, their child, who had a developmental disorder, was found in Bharti Vidyapeeth and the husband was found three days later in Khanapur, Khadakwasla.The Covid-19 pandemic, and the ensuing lockdowns saw a decrease in case registrations. The Pune city police also acquired two police stations to add to the existing list of 30 police stations. Amitabh Gupta, commissioner of Pune police said, “The public perception of the city police is good. People trust the police. I do not play the number game. That is all I will say about this.” Ravindra Shisve, joint commissioner of Pune police refused to comment on the issue.Crime against women, childrenThe cases of crimes against women and children also saw a spike in 2021. A total of 142 women fell prey to sexual assault in 2021. Among minor survivors of sexual assault, the number jumped from 110 in 2020 to 137 in 2021. In 2021, a total of 279 cases were registered under Section 376 of IPC and of those, 137 were under Protection of children from sexual offence (POCSO) Act .“In case of young girls in the age group of 15-17 years, and even younger, the lockdown brought with it a major shift in the way mobile phones were used. The access, and the behaviour at that age, together led to their exposure to virtual predators who pretend to be suitors. In 80% of the cases of child sexual assault and child molestation, the accused is known to the victim. They find it difficult to tell the difference between a predator and a genuine person. There are hardly any cases where the child is completely unknown like the case of those two students in a rickshaw or the Wanowrie rape case or even the Bund garden case where the sexual assault victim was 4-5 years of age,” said Shubhangi Deshmukh, special public prosecutor working in a special POCSO court. The case of a teenage girl who was kidnapped by an auto-rickshaw driver and raped by multiple men for two days was a rude reminder to the lack of security measures at the Pune railway station. The police arrested 19 people in the case and registered a chargesheet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/petty-fights-love-affairs-trigger-murders-as-pune-sees-surge-in-violent-crimes-in-2021-101641488795014.html

A total of 72,000 auto rickshaws are registered in Pune district, of which 50,000 ply.“The number may seem less but it can be due to the lockdown. However, before the lockdown, we used to get about 100 to 150 complaints in a month and we have taken action against such reckless drivers,” said deputy RTO officer Sanjay Sasane.According to officials, in April 2021, seven complaints were registered, while in July there was only one. In October, a complaint was registered against rudeness and reckless driving. In November, two complaints were registered against drivers who refused to ferry passengers. “Under the Motor Vehicle Act, section 83, we can take action against those denying to ferry the passenger to their destination and we can suspend his permit for 30 days and the license for one to six months. People have complained to us that usually they are denied at places like railway station, Swargate, Katraj, Wadgaon Budruk, Aundh, Baner, Undri, Hadapsar, and near hospitals like Deenath Mangeshkar in Kothrud,” said Sasane.He further added that the passengers can complain and write to the RTO mentioning the time of the incident, vehicle number and photograph of the rickshaw if possible at mh12@mahatranscom.in||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/rto-appeal-passengers-to-complain-about-errant-rickshaw-drivers-101641488618670.html

PMC has also started preparing for the influx of cases.Dr Sanjeev Wavare, PMC assistant medical officer of health, said that private hospitals have been informed about the rise in cases and the possibility of acquiring beds when the cases further increase.“We have verbally informed private hospitals and held meetings with officials. In the next week possibly, we will inform hospitals about acquiring beds. We are preparing on similar lines like the last wave. At least 80 per cent of beds will be acquired from private hospitals when the cases increase,” said Dr Wavare.Dr Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director at Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, said that repositioning of infrastructure, staff and medicines have been done.“We are taking similar measures like the previous waves. Medical infrastructure, staff and medicines are all re-positioned to ensure that we are tackling the wave with more efficiency,” said Dr Kelkar.Adding similar views, Abrarali Dalal, CEO of Sahyadri Hospitals, said that with cases on the rise, we have kept our facilities ready with stringent measures.“While we now have the experience of handling two waves recently, we have put all the infection control guidelines in place including allocating different staff for Covid-19 treatment facilities, adjusting their shifts, balancing and managing duties to ensure physical and mental well-being for them, arranging for their stay, arranging for isolation in case anyone from the staff gets infected etc. The regular measures and Covid-19 guidelines like temperature check will continue,” said Dalal.Dr Rajendra Patankar, CEO at Jupiter Hospital, Pune, said that all essential steps are being taken to handle the possible rise in numbers of patients and if required we are prepared to hire additional staff in case of an exponential rise in cases.“Despite Omicron being way more infectious, hospitalisation cases will not be overburdening as per the study till date. However, the challenges of the second wave are still afresh in our minds and we ought to be better prepared to handle the third wave. Hospitals on their part need to be well-equipped with sufficient beds, medical staff, doctors, oxygen supply etc,” said Dr Patankar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/hospitals-in-pune-city-gear-up-for-third-covid-wave-101641488495291.html
06-01-2022||Pune||Proposal for airport site at Purandar still stands: Pune MP Girish Bapat||PUNE A day after refusal to the airport site at Purandar from the Ministry of Defence (MoD) came to light, there was conspicuous silence from members of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, which had resubmitted a fresh proposal changing the site last year.However, Pune member of Parliament Girish Bapat, who is also a chairman of Pune Airport Advisory Committee, said if the state government expedites the process, the airport is very much possible on the old site in Purandar.According to Bapat, the MoD has not cancelled its approval for the original proposal involving a plan to develop an airport on land spanning seven villages. The state government has last year, resubmitted a fresh proposal with changes that shifted land around 10 kilometres away.Civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia in a written response to Bapat on December 31, 2021, said, “The MoD had given the NOC (no objection certificate) on August 12, 2021, with certain conditions for the new proposed site, later it cancelled the NOC vide their communication dated September 29, 2021. This has been communicated to the state government.”Scindia’s response came after Bapat wrote a letter last month attaching another letter from Mahratta Chamber of Commerce Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA) for pushing the project.“The letter only states about withdrawing clearance to the resubmitted proposal with changes. The old proposal still stands and all the clearances obtained so far are also valid. Therefore, I have decided to pursue that proposal,” Bapat said.The Pune MP stated that the Purandar airport must happen. “At my level, I am trying for this and as per my knowledge, neither state government has withdrawn original proposal nor has Centre rejected it. If everyone pushes for the original proposal, it will happen.”During the Devendra Fadnavis government, the administration had proposed an airport at the land from Munjewadi, Vanpuri, Kumbalvalan, Ekhatpur and Udachi Wadi villages. However, the resistance of farmers led by local MLA Sanjay Jagtap forced the rulers to look for alternate land in the same tehsil.The new site in Purandar tehsil where the proposed airport shifted was covered neighbouring villages: Rise, Pise, Naigaon, Rajouri, Pandeshwar, Pimpri.This was the fourth site the government was exploring for the project, which many now believe, may not be a reality for the next few years.Reacting to the cancellation of an approval, MCCIA president Sudhir Mehta had said on Wednesday that the project appears to be dead with this development.“It appears that the site clearance for the proposed Pune airport at the new location in Purandar has been cancelled by the MoD which effectively means that the project is dead. Request the state government to clarify about plans for a new airport at Pune??,” (sic) Mehta had tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/proposal-for-airport-site-at-purandar-still-stands-pune-mp-girish-bapat-101641488314420.html
06-01-2022||Chandigarh||PM security breach: Former top cops write to President, allege state collusion||Twenty-seven retired Indian Police Service (IPS) officers, including 20 former state police chiefs, have termed the Wednesday’s breach of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s security a collusion of the state machinery with so-called protesters to harm and embarrass him. “This is one of the gravest security lapses in the history of this country committed through conspiracy and collusion,” said a letter addressed to the President and signed by 27 former top cops, including former Punjab director general of police (DGP) PC Dogra and former Maharashtra DGP Praveen Dixit.Stating that the gravity of the incident and its national and international repercussion have forced them to approach the President to take “appropriate action”, the letter said: “The stoppage of the carcade of the Prime Minister for about 15 to 20 minutes in a planned manner on a flyover bridge demonstrated poor law and order in Punjab and threatens the democracy in our country.”Former Maharashtra DGP Praveen Dixit told HT that they are seeking an inquiry into the security lapse. “Media reports clearly show that it is not only a casual approach displayed by the state government but there appears to be a clear involvement of the state functionaries that has resulted in this horrific incident of security breach,’’ the letter said. The IPS officers said that the question was not particularly of the party which is ruling, as it is already a very sensitive state that is close to the international border and has recently witnessed IED blast at district courts in Ludhiana with involvement of a former Punjab cop.“We request you to take immediate action on this matter having serious bearing on the national security and state responsibility to law and order in a border state going for election in a month,” they said. Bar council seeks inquiry commissionThe Bar Council of Punjab and Haryana chairman Minderjeet Yadav has written to the Punjab and Haryana high court to take suo motu cognisance of security breach during the PM’s visit to Ferozepur. The letter demands setting up of a commission of inquiry to judiciously examine evidence, including advance security liaison reports, central and state inputs, PM’s itinerary, state security audits, police route maps, intelligence bureau clearance certificates, federal checking mechanism alternatives and contingency plans and local intelligence diaries, to find whether it was a visible breakdown of constitutional machinery in the state. This extreme action under judicial security may just be required to discipline “a rogue state government” and fix accountability for their omission and commissions, if any, it states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pm-security-breach-former-top-cops-write-to-president-allege-state-collusion-101641487234343.html

06-01-2022||Mumbai||All passengers allowed to disembark Cordelia after two days||Mumbai: Two days after Cordelia cruise ship anchored at Mumbai, 1,820 passengers and crew members, including 132 Covid positive were allowed to disembark and go home in the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday.“All the positive patients except seven were asymptomatic and didn’t have any serious co-morbidity so they were allowed home isolation. Seven patients were shifted to hotels and quarantine centres. They were residents from outside Mumbai,” Shivdas Gurav, assistant municipal commissioner from A Ward, where the ship was anchored, said.Earlier on Wednesday, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) found 139 passengers positive after testing samples collected from 1,827 passengers on board the luxury cruise ship. On January 1, 66 passengers were found to be positive when the ship was docked in Goa. While six of them were allowed to disembark in Goa, the remaining positive patients returned on board the ship to Mumbai. Over Tuesday and Wednesday, as many as 40 positive passengers with mild symptoms were moved to healthcare facilities or private hotels in Mumbai (one person, with serious symptoms was admitted to St George’s hospital), while 19, who were asymptomatic, were allowed to isolate on board the ship itself. Late Wednesday night, seven patients were moved to isolation centres as the rest of the passengers disembarked.After the ship arrived Mumbai on January 4, the BMC carried out RT-PCR tests of 1,827 passengers — the swab samples were collected till 5.30 am on Wednesday morning — and said that they would be allowed to disembark after the reports arrive. According to the details shared by BMC officials, out of the 139 positive patients, 67 were from outside Mumbai including areas like Navi Mumbai, Thane and Kalyan, 63 were crew members, and nine patients were Mumbai residents.Gurav said that passengers allowed to go home would have to undergo mandatory home isolation for seven days, and BMC officials have stamped their hands.“After the reports came up late at Wednesday night, the passengers and crew members were allowed to disembark in a phased manner. Before that medical tests were carried out on them to check if they had any severe co-morbidities,” Gurav had said.Earlier this week, Jurgen Bailom CEO and President of Waterways Tourism Private Limited that manages the cruise ship said that all passengers and crew members on board were fully vaccinated and had tested negative before coming on board the cruise-ship.“The guests that boarded the cruise last Sunday had all tested negative in their RT-PCR at the time of boarding.

It is only when one crew member and, that too someone who works at the back of the house, showed mild symptoms on board last Sunday and was immediately isolated, that all guests and crew had to undergo tests again. The results of which showed that a few guests and one crew member on board have tested positive,” Bailom’s statement read.The cruise ship that left from Mumbai on December 31 and was meant to stop at Goa, Kochi and Lakshadweep islands before sailing back to Mumbai.

06-01-2022||Patna||RJD bait for Nitish: Will back if BJP pulls the plug||In a surprise move that has raised the political temperature in Bihar, main opposition party Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) on Thursday offered its support to chief minister Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) if the latter’s ally Bharatiya Janata Party did not back it on the issue of special status for the state and a caste census. “Remove those (BJP ministers) who are opposing the government. Nitish Kumar should not bow before the BJP. If the issues of special status and caste census have any political impact on the Nitish government, the opposition’s grand alliance is there to support him. You will not find yourself alone,” RJD’s state president Jagdanand Singh told reporters. To add heft to his statement, Singh, a former minister, said, “The offer has come from the leader of opposition Tejashwi Yadav.” After the 2020 assembly polls in Bihar, the RJD emerged as the single largest party in the 243-member House with 75 seats. The BJP won 74 seats and JD(U) 45. The two parties are the major constituents of the ruling National Democratic Alliance, which also has former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi’s HAM(S) and Vikassheel Insann Party, which have four seats each.Singh said JD(U) and RJD should work together on the caste census and ministers who are against it should be sacked. “We are not going to back down on this issue which is in the state’s interest,” he said. This is not the first time that RJD has thrown a bait at Kumar. In December 2020, after six JD(U) MLAs defected to BJP in Arunachal Pradesh, RJD tried to capitalise on the acrimony between the two allies by offering to project Kumar as prime ministerial candidate for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections if he handed over the reins of Bihar to Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, who was the opposition alliance’s chief ministerial candidate in the 2020 assembly elections. In an apparent move to play an emotional card to excite CM Kumar, Singh reminded him of the “DNA barb” hurled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the run-up of 2015 assembly elections, which JD(U) and RJD fought in alliance and won.Kumar had then had promised to send 50 lakh samples of the people of Bihar for a DNA test to Delhi and accused Modi of insulting the people of Bihar. “I don’t know what happened to those tests, but nobody has the capability to test Bihari DNA,” Singh said. RJD spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwary too claimed Bihar would see a political realignment after January 14. “The development of Bihar is getting hampered because of BJP’s policy. Nitish Kumar should come with the Grand Alliance on the issue of development of Bihar. He is feeling uncomfortable with BJP, which is the largest party of the NDA, but is not supporting Nitish Kumar on these two issues,” said Tiwary. The ruling parties, however, dismissed RJD’s offer. BJP spokesperson Prem Ranjan Patel said it showed RJD’s desperation. “RJD is convinced it cannot form the government on its own. Nitish Kumar is no longer going to fall for their bait, given the way he has been humiliated by RJD,” Patel said. JD (U) spokesperson and former minister Neeraj Kumar too dismissed the idea. “Everybody knows that Jagda babu (Jagadanand Singh) has no say in the party. RJD runs on Lalu Prasad’s diktat. The party is left with no issues,” he said and asked opposition parties to have patience as BJP was part of all-party delegation that met PM on caste census. Manjhi’s HAM(S) also mocked the idea. “It’s a desperate effort by RJD to keep its flock together,” said party’s spokesperson Danish Rizwan. The Congress, which fought the 2020 polls as part of RJD-led alliance, sought to downplay the development. State Congress president Madan Mohan Jha said, “There is nothing unusual in the offer and no political inference should be drawn from it. All parties have met PM under the leadership of CM on the issue of caste census and have backed demand for special package. Today’s statement, according to me, is an extension of earlier support on the two issues,” said Jha. In 2015, RJD and JD(U) had won 80 and 71 seats, respectively. The two parties formed the government with Nitish Kumar as the CM and Tejashwi Yadav as his deputy.In 2017, JD(U) joined hands with its old ally BJP and formed the government.

The 82-page charge sheet, filed in the special court of additional district judge Lav Kush Kumar in Gopalganj by Rajesh Kumar, the investigating officer and station house officer of Mohammadpur police station, states that methyl alcohol or methanol had been used in making hooch that led to deaths in Muhammadpur and neighbouring villages. “The charge sheet was filed under sections 120B (punishment for criminal conspiracy) 328 (causing hurt by means of poison etc with intent to commit an offence), 304 (punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the Indian Penal Code and under sections of Bihar Excise Act,” said special public prosecutor Ravi Bhusan Srivastava. According to the SHO, forensic evidence and viscera reports of 12 people found that they consumed hooch in copious amount, which adversely affected their body organs. Once methanol reaches the liver, it breaks into formaldehyde and formic acid, which is more toxic. Gopalganj superintendent of police (SP) Anand Kumar told HT that of the 19 named accused, six are still absconding while one of them died in the hooch tragedy. “More than 20 people had consumed the spurious liquor at the house of one Chhathu Ram on November 2 and they all later complained of nausea, headache, restlessness and blurred vision. Nine of the dead were cremated while 12 bodies were sent for autopsy and their viscera preserve for forensic test,” the SP said.In November last year, Bihar witnessed a series of hooch tragedies in rural areas of Gopalganj, West Champaran, Samastipur and Muzaffarpur districts. Special investigation teams of police were formed to probe these incidents and submit reports in 60 days. In the ensuing crackdown, the police have raided more than 1,300 locations and arrested around 823 people and registered 698 cases, according to state police headquarters.

06-01-2022||Mumbai||Navi Mumbai sees 603% rise in Covid cases in 1 week||In the last one week, the Covid cases in Navi Mumbai have increased by 603%. According to Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) officials, the cases are expected to increase even more.The average number of daily cases reported from December 22 to December 28 was 63 with an average testing of 10,387. These increased to 443 from December 29 to January 5 with an average daily testing of 12,780. The doubling, too, has now come down to 185 days from 1,033 days.While the highest number of per day cases during the second wave was 1,400, the cases have gone beyond 2,000 on a single day for the first time on Thursday.“The third wave is spreading much more rapidly than the second wave. The good part is that the severity of the cases is much lesser than what it was during the second wave and thus there has been only a marginal increase in the hospital admissions. Of the 1,200 admissions in oxygen beds, hardly 10 are in need of oxygen supply. The maximum cases of the Covid are those with mild symptoms. As per the trend, we are expecting daily cases of around 5,000 to 6,000 in the coming days,” NMMC commissioner, Abhijit Bangar, said.Even as the hospital staff aren’t as stressed out as they were during the second wave, due to the lack of admission, the health workers working on ground are currently over-burdened. “Each and every positive case needs to have close contacts traced up to 30 people. With 2,000 per day, it means the workers have to keep a tab of 60,000 people daily and not just physically but also by typing out the reports. Sanitising the areas, sealing the buildings, conducting tests, calling people and keeping a tab of their health are becoming very overwhelming,” one of the health workers said.As of now, NMMC is sealing the floor if up to five cases are found and if more than five cases are found, the building or society is sealed. Currently, the genome sequencing of the positive cases has been stopped and all the positive cases are considered as the Omicron variant itself.With the increasing cases, all the facilities that were shut post the second wave have been reopened. Besides, a total of 550 beds of Covid Care Centre would be started in three NMMC-run schools in Ghansoli, Vashi and Airoli.Around 3,000 oxygen beds and 4,500 CCC beds are currently available with NMMC. With the admissions at three schools starting, a total of 5,050 CCC beds would be available. Meanwhile, 700 ICU beds each are available with NMMC and private hospitals. While it has been decided to keep Turbhe hospital of NMMC as non-Covid facility to cater to non-Covid related issues, Nerul and Airoli hospitals will start their admissions as and when the requirement arises. Due to the low severity of cases, the isolation centres are what NMMC plans to focus on.“The testing done per day is close to 14,000, of which 45% is RT-PCR. The testing rate would be maintained and also increased. Besides, we would also be sensitising the staff to be ready for a higher number of cases in the coming days. Currently, the active patients are around 5,000 and we need to be ready to cater to even 50,000 active patients,” Bangar added.Currently, the CCC occupancy is 21%, Dedicated Covid Health Centres (DCHC) occupancy is 15% and Dedicated Covid Hospital (DCH) is 21 %. A week back, the same was 8%, 2% and 7%, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-sees-603-rise-in-covid-cases-in-1-week-101641483273721.html

Gadkari was addressing a function organised in Sakada of Muratganj area of Kaushambi district for laying foundation stone of a six-lane bridge over Ganga to be built at a cost of ₹1,785 crore as part of the 132-km long ‘Ram Gaman Marg’ project from Ayodhya to Chitrakoot. He also inaugurated and laid foundation stones of five other projects. He said “Our thought, work and manifesto is for establishing Ram Rajya” and invoking Mahatma Gandhi he said, “Ram Rajya could be established only by uprooting casteism and communalism besides giving work to all unemployed.”Promising better connectivity of Kaushambi with Buddhist tourism circuit, the minister also announced construction of a single pillar flyover at Ajuha on the request of MP Vinod Sonkar. Besides, he also announced construction of a cable-held bridge at Phaphamau, Prayagraj and double-decker bridge in Prayagraj city akin to the one existing in Goa making it just the second such bridge of its kind in the country.

06-01-2022||Chandigarh||Alive, they teach us to love; on departing, lesson in loss||Our entire family was in the living room that night, trying our best to calm him down. But our 11-year-old golden brown Labrador, Cruz, kept roaming in circles through the lobby, howling. He would stop for a while, accept our affection, and then embark on his motions. We saw he was in dire pain. When his condition didn’t improve until late into the night, I called up his vet. As I reported his recurrent vomiting since the evening before, he said it was a stomach infection; and because of the vomiting, Cruz was dehydrated and experiencing cramps. He advised us to place a water bowl in the centre of the lobby and inject an antiemetic and painkiller to control his vomiting and pain. Being a dentist couple, we could manage the injectables ourselves, but Cruz remained restless throughout the night despite the measures. So, we took an early morning appointment with the vet. With the attendant’s help, we lifted his 34kg frame onto the vet’s table. The doctor took his vitals, withdrew blood specimens to ascertain the ailment. While we waited for the investigation results, Cruz was already feeling better with the glucose and saline going into his body through the drip. The vet administered some antibiotics directly into his drip on seeing the investigation report. The medicines seemed to have worked well on Cruz. Back home, basking in the pleasant December morning sun in the garden, he dozed off. But by night, he was back in agony, doing the circles, yet again; this time visiting every nook and corner of the house: Our open kitchen, bedrooms and study. Amazingly, he even pushed open the door of the puja room and stood before the deities for some time. My wife, daughter and maid slept in the living room that night and caressed him to sleep alternately. Being an early riser, I was pleased to see him sleeping, with both his front and hind legs outstretched on the floor. Out of love for that cute pose, I went closer to cuddle him. However, I couldn’t notice the routine heaving of his body, nor could I hear any breathing sounds. I bent down and placed my finger on his nose, but there was no trace of air, either. Instinctively, I patted him on the head to wake him out of his slumber but still couldn’t experience any movement. Momentarily, I realised he was no more. I didn’t have the courage to break the news to the rest of the family, as no one expected such an eventuality. However, as I sat down near him, the entire episode of how we lost him five years ago on Diwali evening flashed before my eyes. Cruz had strayed out of our open gate by hearing the constant cracker noises. We kept looking for him the entire night but to no avail. Finally, we advertised his picture in a local newspaper in Ambala. A week later, we received a call from an unknown number claiming they had seen a pet of this description at a location close to their house. As we went to that place and pressed the doorbell, he was all over us even before the owner could fully open the gate, barking and wagging his tail. But this time, I knew no adverts or efforts could bring him back. So now on, we’ll have to live with his memories. Writer Roger Caras’s words echoed in my mind, “Dogs are not our whole life, but they make our lives whole.” vikasdeepak23@gmail.com The writer is an Ambala-based prosthodontist||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/alive-they-teach-us-to-love-on-departing-lesson-in-loss-101641481653599.html
06-01-2022||Mumbai||Thane sees highest single day spike of 2,180 Covid cases; TMC to seal buildings||The Covid cases have seen a spike of over 400% in the last six days with Thursday seeing the highest single-day spike of 2,180 cases. The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has given directives to seal any building that has more than 10 positive cases. These buildings will also be declared as containment zones.The corporation has also asked the hospitals to ensure that the beds are not unnecessarily occupied by patients who do not need hospitalisation, action will be taken against hospitals that are found admitting patients with mild or no symptoms. TMC has issued a circular asking mild and asymptomatic persons to home quarantine. As of now, around 10% to 12% of the active cases are hospitalised, informed the civic officials.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has already started sealing buildings with more than 20% positive cases. Thane city has been seeing a spike in cases since the last week of December. Till mid-December, the cases were in the range of 40-50 daily. The city, however, saw 149 cases on December 29, 255 on December 30 and 336 on December 31.Since then, the cases have increased to 2,180 on January 6. The second wave spike was 2,100 in mid-April. Sandeep Malvi, additional municipal commissioner, TMC, said, “We will start sealing buildings with more than 10 positive cases and declare the said building as containment zone from Thursday. I have asked all the assistant municipal commissioners to ensure this is followed in their wards. As of now, we are testing 1:15 persons, which will be increased when needed. We will also test the entire building if many people are found positive.”TMC has issued guidelines for the society stating that if a society has less than 10 cases, then the RT-PCR of the people staying on the floor with positive cases will be conducted on fifth and seventh days. The people staying on the floor below and above, where the positive cases are found, will have to get their own RT-PCR done on fifth and seventh days. If there are more than 10 cases, TMC would conduct RT-PCR of the people on the floor with positive cases while the residents of other floors will have to get their antigen tests done. TMC has also increased daily testing from 1,500-2,000 tests in December to 7,000-8,000 at present. Malvi said that the health workers have also initiated a house-to-house survey in several wards to find out if there is anyone with symptoms.The city, at present, has more than 9,000 beds while the active cases are 5,615. However, the officials claimed that only 10-12% of these require beds so far. Out of the 5,615 active cases, 553 are admitted at present, 68 out of which need oxygen beds.Malvi added, “We are also sending a letter to the hospitals asking them not to hospitalise people who do not need hospitalisation for a long time. If the Covid patient does not have fever and his oxygen level is normal, he/she can home quarantine. Those hospitalised will also follow home isolation for seven days after being discharged. This will ensure that beds are not unnecessarily occupied. As of now, we have sufficient beds to treat Covid patients. We will be taking action against hospitals that admit patients who do not require hospitalisation.”The doubling rate of cases is 140 days at present while the positivity rate as on January 5 was 22.54%.Dr Santosh Kadam, President, IMA, Thane, said, “We have to accept that the third wave has set in and need to take extra precautions. The civic body is geared up with sufficient hospital beds and medicine for now. They have also increased the testing. Apart from this, the residents also need to get tested immediately if they show any symptoms like cold, fever or cough among others. Many people fear getting tested due to the restrictions. However, they will put their family and others at risk by delaying the tests.”He added that if people stick to wearing masks and avoid going out in crowds, the cases will start showing a decline in a month.
06-01-2022||Mumbai||Residents claim MSRDC delaying installation of suicide barriers on Vashi Bridge||Local residents and activists from Vashi have claimed that the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) is delaying the installation of suicide barriers on the two bridges on Vashi Creek Bridge.A large number of people either die by suicide or attempt to do that by jumping off the bridges every year.Vashi police said that nearly 30 suicide attempts were averted on the bridges in 2021 alone. The number of people who actually died by suicide is not clear as many of them take place when no one is around.In the latest incident, a 16-year-old girl from Chembur jumped off the old bridge on Tuesday afternoon. A local fisherman rescued her and rushed her to the NMMC Hospital in Vashi. She was later handed over to her family members after a counselling session at the police station. This is the first case of an attempt to suicide so far this year.Ramesh Chavan, senior inspector of Vashi police station, said, “People come from different places of Mumbai and Navi Mumbai to commit suicide by jumping off these bridges. The local fishermen and the officials from the traffic department saved nearly 30 people last year. During counselling, they talked about different issues such as depression, failed relationships, domestic violence among others that instigated to take such steps. So this has become a very serious issue in Vashi. We have been writing to the MSRDC for the past several years, requesting them to take the requisite measures. But nothing has been done until now.”Madhukar Patil, a 47-year-old activist from Vashi, said, “The length of each of these bridges is around 1.8 km. So, the installation of the suicide barriers cannot be a huge project for the MSRDC. Taking the alarming number of people jumping off the bridges into consideration, they should install the barriers as early as possible.”An MSRDC official said, “The tendering process for installing the suicide barriers is on and the work at the site will be started just after completion of that process. Once started, it will take us only 45 days to finish it. We have allocated a budget of ₹3.50Cr for the task.” MSRDC is developing two new bridges (three lanes each) on the Vashi creek bridge to decongest the Sion-Panvel Highway in that area. On the upcoming bridges, they have decided to develop 1.5m tall concrete walls on the sides, and hence there will be no need for suicide barriers.
06-01-2022||Mumbai||Rs8 only to cover 50km on electric cycle – Navi resident’s success story||Umesh Shripat Alone, a 58-year-old resident of Khanda Colony, has managed to successfully transform his regular bicycle into an electric cycle.On his regular bicycle, he used to take around 40 minutes to travel 10km to reach his office in CBD Belapur. Now, on his electric cycle, he covers the same distance in only 24 minutes. A senior technician with the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL), Alone had initially started cycling to his workplace as a form of physical exercise. However, he used to struggle to manage his time with the regular bicycle. So, he started exploring different options of cutting down the travel time without ditching his cycling habit.“As a technician by profession, I had the basic ideas of running a light vehicle by using a chargeable battery. I also watched a few videos of such vehicles and those really shaped up my ideas,” Alone said.“In the first half of 2020, I spent around ₹35,000 to purchase a DC battery, an electric motor, an accelerator and the other necessary materials. By using them, I kept on trying to transform my regular bicycle into an electric one, and succeeded after nearly two months,” Alone added.Alone’s success story was, however, not known to many people until his electric cycle was exhibited in a road show of such vehicles conducted by the MSEDCL last month. His efforts received accolades throughout the event, and his senior also felicitated him at the end of it.“With a fully-charged battery, I can travel around 50km on this cycle. Its speed is around 25km per hour and anyone, with basic training, can ride it. The best part is that I can still use it as a regular bicycle. I often pedal when I am not in a hurry and that has helped me keep myself in good shape. Charging the battery takes only two units of electricity and that costs around ₹8. So, just by spending ₹8, I can travel up to 50km on this cycle,” he added.When asked about his future plans, Alone said, “I am retiring in December this year. With more free time in hand, I will try to modify this cycle. I will try to use a small generator and thereby recharge the battery while it is still on the move.”
06-01-2022||Mumbai||Keep a close eye on symptomatic cases, hospitalisation rate: Task force||Mumbai The test positivity rate shot up drastically in Mumbai from 11% in the last week of December to over 30% on Thursday. However, the state’s Covid task force said that test positivity may not be a crucial parameter during the ongoing Omicron-driven wave. The more consequential parameters to consider are symptomatic positivity, rate of hospitalisations, oxygen and ventilator requirement, according to the task force. “We already know that Omicron is a highly transmissible variant and it is likely to infect a large number of people. Therefore, we should not panic,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the Covid task force. He further added that the trends should be defined by symptomatic positivity which means how many people with symptoms are testing positive, the rate of hospitalisations, and the rate of oxygen and ventilator use. “The rise in these parameters should worry us and drive our interventions,” he said. Of the 48,518 new Covid infections detected in Mumbai between January 1-5, only 5,497 or 11% were symptomatic, according to the data collated by the civic body. “The impact of this variant will be clear in the next two weeks,” said Dr Joshi adding that people should not panic and rush to hospitals unless they have acute symptoms, co-morbid conditions and desaturating oxygen levels. According to virologist Dr T Jacob John, as the number of infections rises, the test positivity rate is bound to go up. “There is no surprise in that. The test positivity rate is a crude measure of the increasing cases and can be influenced by the doctor’s judgement of whom to test or the overall testing strategies. Our observations should now be focussed on the breakthrough and re-infections, how many of them or other susceptible populations are requiring hospitalisations and the number of patients developing a serious disease,” he said. Mumbai’s hospitalisations have risen steadily in the past few days. As of Thursday, over 5,998 patients were admitted to hospitals and jumbo facilities, including over 1,983 patients on oxygen support and nearly 421 on ventilator support. A fortnight ago on December 20, the number of patients in hospitals stood at 865, those on oxygen support were 379 and those on ventilators were 154. Dr Prince Surana, chief executive of Mumbai’s Surana Group of Hospitals, said that a small number of patients are turning up with symptoms like acute cough and fever and those with co-morbidities are being admitted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/keep-a-close-eye-on-symptomatic-cases-hospitalisation-rate-task-force-101641479553419.html

After the incident, Jedaroll stayed inside Gurdwara Nanaksar in the village for at least 25 minutes, before locals detained him and handed him over to the police about 2:30am on Thursday. Police sources said the accused had been in the village for the past 3-4 days. He had been working at a house in the village for taking care of animals, but was told to leave when he applied black ink on his face, making the household suspicious. SSP-rural Rakesh Kaushal told a press conference, “The accused entered the gurdwara around 1pm. He lifted the Guru Granth Sahib from the Peera Sahib (the Takht or holy seat of the holy scripture) and placed it on a table used for keeping ‘Karah Parshad’. He came out of the shrine with the Rumala Sahib, Chaur Sahib, Gutka Sahib and other religious things.” He added, “He was caught, thrashed and detained while coming out, with the entire sequence of events caught on CCTV of the gurdwara. SP (investigation) Manoj Thakur was sent to the spot to protect the life of the accused. Around 200 Sikh activists had gathered on the spot and wanted to punish the accused. To ensure evidence was not destroyed our team moved slowly, but finally convinced the Sikh activists to hand over the accused to us, which was done about 2:30am on Thursday.”The SSP said the accused had no document to prove his identity. “Our teams are working to establish his antecedents and to trace his family,” he said. On Wednesday, the police had said that he appeared mentally unfit. The SSP added, “As of now, we can’t say that he is mentally ill. He will be examined mentally and physically.”Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Harjinder Singh Dhami has sought that the police work to reveal the conspiracy behind the incident.

06-01-2022||Pune||Leopard cubs reunite with mother in fields of Junnar||PUNE In a successful rescue and conservation effort by Wildlife SOS and the Maharashtra Forest Department, a pair of 45-day-old leopard cubs found in a sugar cane field in Nirgude Village in Junnar taluka were reunited with their mother recently.Local farmers, while harvesting their sugar cane crops, had spotted the cubs.Accustomed to finding lost leopard cubs during sugar cane harvesting season, and aware of the need to take quick action, the villagers immediately contacted the forest department, who later brought the cubs to the Wildlife SOS Leopard Rescue Centre for medical examination.Farmers in Junnar taluka are used to witnessing young leopard cubs taking shelter in sugarcane fields. The tall, dense sugarcane stalks provide adequate cover for the leopards but leave their cubs at risk of being found by people working in the fields.The cubs, one male and one female, are around 45-days-old. Wildlife Veterinary Officer, Wildlife SOS Dr Nikhil Bangar conducted a detailed examination for ticks and injuries and found the cubs to be healthy.Ajit Shinde, range forest officer, said, “We are glad to see that people are becoming aware and sensitive towards the wildlife that share the surrounding habitats. Today, more people are reaching out to us for help when they encounter leopards and other wild animals in the area.”The SOS and the forest department facilitated the reunion by placing the cubs in a safe box, close to where they were discovered and installed a remote controlled camera trap to document the reunion process. Dr Bangar said, “The mother must have been searching for her cubs, as within a few minutes she was able to sniff them out. On reaching the box, she patiently waited to ensure no danger stood in the way, and then she used her paws to tip it over. She then moved her cubs to a safer location. Wildlife SOS makes every effort to make such rescue and reunion operations possible.”Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder and CEO of Wildlife SOS, said, “Over the years, Wildlife SOS has partnered with the state forest department to conduct many workshops and awareness modules which have shown significant results, indicated by the increasing number of phone calls we get for rescuing distressed wildlife. It has been our sincere effort to mitigate conflict in these areas, and we are incredibly grateful to the forest department for being such a staunch support and the local residents, who are keeping avoidance and mitigation teachings in mind when dealing with wild animals.”Why do leopards prefer sugarcane fields?From December to March, the weather conditions favour sugarcane cultivation. The tall and dense grass of sugarcane offer close to an ideal home to the leopard. Maharashtra is home to a large population of wild Indian leopards (Panthera pardus), who often find a safe abode among the tall sugarcane crops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/leopard-cubs-reunite-with-mother-in-fields-of-junnar-101641478353155.html
06-01-2022||Chandigarh||PM security breach: Narendra Modi faced outburst of farmers in Punjab, says Navjot Sidhu||A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi skipped a rally at Ferozepur amid rain and security breach, Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu on Thursday took a dig at him as well as former chief minister and Bharatiya Janata Party’s new ally Captain Amarinder Singh, claiming that the two could manage only 500 people for the high-profile event. Addressing a political rally in Barnala, Sidhu said that the opposition faced by the PM on Wednesday was an outburst of Punjab’s farmers. “I want to ask the Prime Minister that our farmers were holding protests for more than a year at the borders of Delhi. However, your media did not speak a word, but when you (PM) were stuck for 15 minutes, it is making noise... Why these double standards?” said the Congress leader, while referring to the row over Modi’s cavalcade getting stuck on a flyover due a farmers’ blockade en route for the Ferozepur rally.Also read: Punjab DGP responsible for PM security lapse: Ferozepur Cong MLA Pinky“It is an outburst of Punjab’s farmers. Modi Ji, you promised to double the income of farmers, but snatched what farmers had. Your supporters are installing flex boards to thank you for repealing the three agriculture laws, but the laws were scrapped under farmers’ pressure,” said Sidhu.Taking further potshots, the Punjab Congress chief said: “The Prime Minister of the country came to address a rally, but only 500 people were standing there. However, a (former) CM, Amarinder Singh, was giving a lecture to empty chairs. It was shameful. I never saw such an incident in my entire life.” Sidhu also lashed out at Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal, and alleged that both he and Amarinder were speaking the “language of Narendra Modi”.
06-01-2022||Mumbai||The new year starts on a warmer note for Mumbai||Mumbai The new year started on a warmer than usual note for the city, with both day and nighttime temperatures touching their highest average readings in at least five years, as per India Meteorological Department (IMD) data for the first six days of January.The average daily maximum temperature between January 1 and January 6 this year stood at 32.8 degrees Celsius as compared to 30.22 degrees Celsius in 2021, while the average daily minimum stood at 21 degrees Celsius, up from 20.62 degrees Celsius in 2021.This is the highest average maximum recorded in the first week of January since 2016 when Mumbai saw daytime temperatures touch a mean of 33.64 degrees Celsius. In terms of minimum temperature, this year marks the highest average in at least 10 years and indicates the possibility that this January may turn out to be one of the warmest in recent years.Confirming this trend, DS Pai, who heads the climate research and services division at IMD in Pune, said, “This has everything to do with wind direction. If you look at the wind patterns above Mumbai and the larger Konkan, winds are not blowing directly from colder regions up north, and are sometimes blowing from the south, sometimes from the east. So, there is a phenomenon of advection which is bringing heat into the region, instead of cooling it down,” said Pai.Mumbai’s maximum temperature on Thursday stood at 29.5 degrees Celsius, down from 31.5 degrees Celsius the day prior, while the minimum stood at 21 degrees Celsius, down from 21.4 degrees Celsius the day prior. As per the IMD’s seven-day forecast for the city, the daytime maximum will hover between 30 and 31 degrees Celsius until January 12. The nighttime minimum during this period will range between 20 and 21 degrees Celsius.Meanwhile, air quality dipped over the last two days and entered the ‘poor’ category of the air quality index (AQI). As per the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research’s (SAFAR) network of 10 monitors in the city, the AQI on Thursday evening stood at 225, close to the previous day’s index value of 228.“Poor air quality is typical at this time of the year because winds are not strong enough to disperse the accumulated particulate matter pollutants. There will be an increase in wind speeds when the temperature rises, which may happen in the next few days by about a degree or so. It should lead to an improvement in air quality,” said an official with the IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai. BOX:AVERAGE MAX. & MIN.

The train to Velankani on January 7 stands cancelled, said Kamal Bansal, chairman of Tirth Yatra Vikas Samiti."Further, trains of pilgrims, including those for Kartarpur Sahib route as well as Amritsar, Ayodhya and Rameshwaram later this month, have also been cancelled," Bansal said."The decision to suspend the scheme for the time being has been taken due to rising number of Covid across the country. It will restart when the conditions are suitable," said a senior Delhi government officer.Under the Mukhya Mantri Tirth Yatra Yojna, people aged 60 years and above are sent on pilgrimage on 15 routes fully sponsored by the Delhi government. The government pays for travel, accommodation and other expenses of each pilgrim who can also take along an attendant with them.The scheme, halted due to the second wave of COVID-19 last year, was resumed with a train of pilgrims leaving for Ayodhya on December 3. Pilgrims also went to Rameshwaram and Dwarka before the pandemic acted as a brake on the scheme.The scheme launched in July 2019 has been a "big hit" among Delhi's senior citizens, particularly women, that is evident from around 25,000 pending applications under it, Bansal said.In order to clear the backlog of applicants, 11 trains each for different pilgrim places were planned in January, February and March. However, now the whole plan is disrupted, he said.Under the scheme, the Delhi government sanctioned ₹81.45 crore of which ₹66.92 crore were spent in 2020-21. So far nearly 38,000 senior citizens benefitted from the scheme, the government told the Delhi Assembly session.The applicants under the scheme require a certificate of residence from their MLA concerned.

06-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab DGP responsible for PM security lapse: Ferozepur Cong MLA Pinky||Ferozepur City Congress MLA Parminder Singh Pinky on Thursday said state police chief Siddharth Chattopadhyaya was directly responsible for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s security breach during his visit to the district on Wednesday. Also read: 160 passengers on chartered flight from Rome tested in Amritsar. 125 are Covid+vePinky said the Ferozepur episode was a huge embarrassment for the Congress-led Punjab government and the state leadership should have taken immediate corrective measures in national interest. Modi had to return to Delhi on Wednesday without laying the foundation stone for development projects worth more than ₹42,000 crore after protesters blocked the Ferozepur-Moga highway on which the convoy was moving. The PM’s security decided not to proceed further on the highway, cancelling his scheduled public address after the foundation stone laying function. MLA Pinky said Punjab home minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, who is also the deputy chief minister, should have worked diligently with the DGP to ensure that the PM’s daylong visit in the state was in order. “The PMO is not just about an individual but a national institution and it must be protected. Three dynamic leaders Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and Beant Singh were assassinated. The security of dignitaries should be handled beyond political courses. It is a matter of shame that the Punjab Police administration failed to provide a safe passage to the PM and heads must roll for the unprecedented lapse,” said the two-time legislator. Pinky said farm union activists were just holding a peaceful protest on or near the highway as they had a genuine grouse against the Centre and the BJP leadership. He said the BJP leaders should avoid politicising the security breach as chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi is a sensitive and able administrator. “When the PM was travelling via road to reach Ferozepur for an official event, it is the duty of the DGP to ensure the motorcade travels without any disruption. The DGP failed to ensure an emergency contingency route if the marked road route had protesters. Being head of the department, the DGP acted in a negligent manner,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-dgp-responsible-for-pm-security-lapse-ferozepur-cong-mla-pinky-101641469412160.html
06-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi HC rejects plea seeking postponement of civil services (main) exams||NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Thursday dismissed a plea seeking postponement of the civil services (main) exams, saying it is not inclined to interfere with the schedule despite a surge in Covid-19 cases.The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), which conducts the exams, cited a careful review of the pandemic situation on Wednesday, and said they will be conducted as per schedule from Friday. As many as 19 candidates appearing for the exams moved the court for the postponement citing an imminent risk of getting infected and losing a valuable attempt to clear it. Some candidates pleaded that it was their last attempt to appear in the examination. The exam is scheduled until January 16.“I am not inclined to interfere with the decision. I am dismissing the petition,” said Justice V Kameswar Rao while declining to grant relief. He added that a detailed order would be uploaded later.The case was mentioned on Wednesday before a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh who granted an urgent listing for it for Thursday.On Thursday, the UPSC told the court that all the preparations have been made and the exams cannot be postponed at the last moment. It said out of 9,156 candidates, 9,085 have downloaded their admit cards. The UPSC’s lawyer told the court the exams were behind schedule and a lot of precious time has been lost.“It (postponement) will have a cascading effect. The impractical, hypothetical situation is being projected by the candidates. Tomorrow, the exam is starting. All preparation is complete. Our supervisors have reached. These are 9,000 candidates across various centres, “ the lawyer said.Anushree Kapadia, who appeared for the petitioners, told the court the centres allotted for the main examination are mostly in the metro cities or state capitals, which are densely populated and face a surge in Covid 19 infections.In their plea, the petitioners said there was no proper pre-examination testing. “Temperature checks can be cheated by taking paracetamol. If few candidates attempt examinations with Covid-19, then it might result in infecting all candidates as they have to spend six hours writing papers in the same room. Further, once infected, candidates will be prohibited from writing subsequent papers, as per UPSC policy. They also risk spreading to others including their families.” The petition added that authorities have not come out with any modality to prevent the risk of Covid infection among the candidates while taking the examination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hc-rejects-plea-seeking-postponement-of-civil-services-main-exam-101641468811940.html

06-01-2022||Pune||Taste of Life: When ‘Sir John Barleycorn’ became popular in Bombay and Poona...||When ‘Sir John Barleycorn’ became popular in Bombay and Poona... “His name is Sir John Barleycorn, Who makes both beer and bread. What would do all that now are born, If Barleycorn was dead?” wrote a “well-wisher” of Sir John Barleycorn in “The Arraigning and Indicting of Sir John Barleycorn, Knt.” in 1785. A few decades later, in the latter half of the nineteenth century, newspapers and brochures in Bombay and Poona started mentioning Sir John Barleycorn quite frequently. He should be invited to the country, and allowed to “roam freely” in the Presidency, they said. There was a clamour that he be given a permanent residency in the Presidency. Who was Sir John Barleycorn? And what led to his sudden popularity in Bombay and Poona? Sir John Barleycorn is a song from the “English Dancing Master” (1651). The eponymous protagonist is a personification of barley and of the alcoholic beverages made from it: beer and whiskey. In the song, he suffers indignities, attacks, and possible death that correspond to the various stages of barley cultivation, such as reaping and malting. According to the song, his neighbours vowed that Sir John should die, so they hired ruffians to “plough him with ploughs and bury him”, this they did, and afterward “combed him with harrows and thrust clods on his head”, but did not kill him. Then with hooks and sickles they “cut his legs off and the knees”, bound him like a thief, and left him “to wither with the wind” and he died not. They now “rent him to the heart”, and having “mowed him in a mow” sent bravos to beat him with clubs, and they beat him so sore that “all the flesh fell from his bones”, but yet he died not. To a kiln, they next hauled him and burnt him like a martyr, but he survived the burning. They crushed him between two stones but killed him not. Sir John bore no malice for his ill-usage but did his best to cheer the flagging spirits even of his worst persecutors. John Barleycorn has been used as a symbol or a slang term for alcohol for the last four centuries. Several pubs in the South of England are called “John Barleycorn”. Jack London’s 1913 autobiographical novel “John Barleycorn” takes its name from the song and discusses his enjoyment of drinking and struggles with alcoholism. Barley, the source of malt liquor and whiskey, takes a prominent place in British – Indian history. How many difficulties have been smoothed over by a friendly drink would never be known, nor could it be estimated how much comfort it has given to those Anglo-Indians depressed by loneliness and overwork in a bad climate. In the days of the East India Company, it was usual to send out several criminals, sentenced to death in England and respited, to be turned loose on any newly discovered shore by the early mariners. A batch of these Newgate birds, as they were called, generally went out with each Indian fleet. In the “Good Old Days of the Honorable John Company”, WH Carey states that in 1780 “drunkenness, gambling, and profane swearing were universally practiced”. Complaints in public journals testified that all classes of Europeans made Christmas festivities a “plea for absolute drunkenness and obscenity of conversation, that is, while they were able to articulate at all”. The Honorable East India Company undoubtedly did all that was possible to keep their servants on the straight and narrow road and were occasionally successful. An effort was made, with little success, to check the mortality brought about by heavy drinking, by encouraging the use of tea. The sale of beer was restricted, so the Europeans had no option but to turn to “burnt wine, punch, and arrack”. Very soon the Europeans cultivated a strong liking for the native intoxicants and hence manufacture of liquor was largely prohibited in the lands ruled by the British. One of the first to lead the petition to let natives and Europeans make malt liquor in India was Tom Cringle, who wrote a letter in a Bombay newspaper with an elaborate scheme to make beer and ale in Poona. This letter made John Barleycorn a popular name and inspired several others to make a similar petition in Bombay and Poona. Tom Cringle was the nom de plume of William Walker (1838-1908), a Scottish-born Australian writer, also known as William Walker of Bombay. The nom de plume was derived from “Tom Cringle’s Log” published pseudonymously by Michael Scott in Blackwood’s Magazine. Walker wrote a series of letters between 1850 and 1860 in several newspapers in Bombay and Poona, which were compiled in a volume published in 1863. The ninety letters compiled in the volume provide a wide-ranging overview of contemporary life in the Bombay Presidency and include reports on Indian farming, tramways, the burning of “Hindoo dead”, the Indian Mutiny, the Colaba refuges, and reports on Walker’s stay in Poona. There is an account of the “Madras” on its voyage from Bombay to Aden, notes on Merchant Seamen, shear hulks, and even the Atlantic Telegraph Cable. One of the letters includes “A Tiger Adventure” involving the author hiding behind a curtain while being stalked by a tiger, his only weapon being his lit cigar. The letter invoking John Barleycorn and requesting his presence in Poona was written by Walker on November 23, 1857, in Bombay. It is not known which newspaper published it. The letter starts with a solemn appeal – “Who has not sacrificed to the honour of John Barleycorn in this thirsty clime? I have heard of some ardent devotees who at one sitting have walked off with 12 bottles under their belt, and found no damages to repair in the morning. Do this with brandy and you corrode the coats of the stomach; with wine, and you are half poisoned and wholly dazed; with gin, you injure the kidneys; with champagne, in the morning your head feels like a basalt boulder. But John Barleycorn made our railways; builds bridges, ships, and steam – engines, like a good, honest, useful fellow he is. He strengthens the stomach and gives vigour to the muscles. The Parsees merit the compliment of being the most Europeanised of all the natives in Bombay, - it is to John Barleycorn they owe the honour. Beer follows an Englishman as steadfastly as the daily sun shines on him, but it only follows him in barrels and bottles and is thereby rendered twice as dear as it should be. Only for the paternal care of honest John Company, his soldiers would never be able to taste their national beverage, and would thus be driven to indulge in arrack, which fires the brain and wastes in the strength, in lieu of adding to it, as does malt liquor.” Walker then rues the fact that “since malt liquor has been supplied by the East India Company to the canteens of their army, a very large decrease of drunkenness has followed.” “Owing to the nearly prohibitory price of beer, our poorer English brethren cannot taste it. Why should it not be plentiful enough to enable the ships of the Indian Navy to take a few barrels of it up the Persian Gulf, to invigorate the stomachs of their crews during the burning heat of a Bushire summer?” he asks. He then proceeds to put out an elaborate plan to start a brewery at Poona. More about this the next week. Chinmay Damle is a research scientist and food enthusiast.

Also read: CCS takes up PM security breach in Punjab, Prime Minister meets PresidentCalling the incident “unfortunate and shameful for all of us”, Rana Gurjit said that there was a security lapse and responsibility should be fixed. “The PM should not have been insulted.

He said that farmers have a right to protest, but the DGP should have made arrangements (for smooth passage). “Did the DGP and the home minister take interest? Did they keep an alternative route? People will ask these questions,” he said, refusing to say anything more on the matter as the chief minister has ordered a probe by a two-member committee. Rana Gurjit also said the central agencies were equally responsible. “I want to ask the central agencies what homework they had done. Were they not aware about the weather forecast for the day? What was their plan for an alternative route? There should be an inquiry into these lapses,” he said. The cabinet minister also advised the BJP leaders to show maturity and not to overplay the incident. “We are a border state and there should no dirty politics on this,” he added.

A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh heard the plea and a detailed order was awaited.Swamy sought setting aside and revocation of any action or decision or grant of any further approvals, permissions or permits with respect to the Air India disinvestment process while claiming it was “arbitrary, illegal and against the public interest”. He said the process was rigged in favour of one of the parties. He claimed that Tata Sons was given an undue advantage in the process. The Centre and the Tatas have rejected Swamy’s claim.On Tuesday, the court had reserved its order after hearing the arguments.Swamy maintained that he was not opposing the policy of disinvestment and believed in the idea of a free market, but was raising the issue of “impropriety, illegality, misconduct and corruption” in the process.“I am in favour of disinvestment, but this is gigantic corruption in my view. I am complaining about the rigged procedure. It is rigged in favour of Tata companies,” he said on Tuesday.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, said Swamy’s petition was based on “misconceptions” and does not require consideration.
06-01-2022||Chandigarh||PM security breach: Punjab BJP chief wants state home minister, DGP sacked||A day after the security breach during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Punjab visit, a state BJP delegation called on governor Banwarilal Purohit in Chandigarh on Thursday and demanded that deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, who holds the home portfolio, and acting police chief Sidharth Chattopadhyaya be sacked immediately for the lapse. Also read: CCS takes up PM security breach in Punjab, PM to meet President“It is a deep-rooted conspiracy in which the life of the country’s Prime Minister was at stake. We have demanded that the governor sack the state home minister and the DGP immediately,” Punjab BJP chief Ashwani Sharma, who led the delegation of party leaders, told mediapersons outside Raj Bhawan. Stating that the breach in PM Modi’s security was enough to prove that law and order had collapsed in Punjab, he said, “The way information about the route plan of the PM was leaked to the protesters and the manner in which our buses (carrying supporters to the rally) were not allowed to enter Ferozepur smell of a deep-rooted conspiracy by the Channi government. The response to this rally was a threat to the Congress.” He said how could it be a coincidence that chief minister Channi, deputy chief ministers Randhawa and OP Soni and chief secretary Anirudh Tewari besides acting DGP Chattopadhyaya were not present to welcome the Prime Minister, which they have to according to the protocol. On the demand of President’s rule in the poll-bound border state, Sharma said: “This government has already been rejected by the people and the model code of conduct is likely to be in place in four-five days. This government is already on its way out.” On Wednesday, the PM’s convoy was stuck for 15-20 minutes on a flyover 30km from Ferozepur due to a blockade by protesters. The Prime Minister, who was travelling by road from Bathinda airport to Ferozepur, had to call off the BJP rally in Ferozepur. Returning to Delhi, PM Modi said to state government officials at Bathinda airport: “Apne CM ko thanks kehna, ki me Bathinda airport tak zinda laut paya.” Later, the BJP blamed the ruling Congress government for sabotaging the PM’s scheduled programme and for the major security lapse.

He, however, ruled out imposing any lockdown in the national capital.Jain said Delhi is in a “comfortable position” in terms of hospital bed occupancy and added that no death due to Omicron has been reported in the city.Talking about the precautions to be needed during the spread of Covid-19 in the national capital, Jain had emphasised on home isolation of asymptomatic persons who came in contact with infected people."Corona patients in home isolation should take care of these things: isolate yourself from other members of the household; stay in a well-ventilated room with cross-ventilation; wear a triple-layer mask; take special care of cleanliness; keep yourself busy, talk to family and relatives on phone from time to time," he tweeted on Wednesday.It was in response to revised guidelines issued by the Union health ministry. It stated that home isolation of Covid-19 patients will end after at least seven days from testing positive and no fever for three successive days. Also, there is no need for re-testing after the home isolation period is over.The number of people under home isolation in Delhi was 11,551 on Wednesday, a day the national capital recorded 10,665 cases with a positivity rate of 11.88 per cent and eight deaths.The national capital has recorded a huge spike in the number of Covid-19 cases. The Delhi government has attributed the surge to the highly contagious Omicron variant. According to Jain, the third wave of Covid-19 has hit the city.According to official data from the Delhi government, 65 per cent of samples, whose genome sequencing reports came out between January 1 and 3, were found to have the Omicron variant as against 28 per cent from December 1 to 31.Amid the rise in cases, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia announced a return of the weekend curfew as the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) decided to reimpose some more restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-over-14-000-covid-cases-expected-today-minister-says-lockdown-not-needed-101641451152452.html
06-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi-NCR begins prepping for third wave: All hands on deck!||It’s no longer far fetched to assume that we are on the brink of the third wave. Looking at the rapid speed with which Covid cases are increasing in Delhi-NCR, it would be difficult to think otherwise. But that doesn’t mean that the residents are throwing themselves into a state of frenzy of hoarding up! Having been through the many lockdowns in the past, many say they are now aware of how to cope up with what’s needed and what’s not, when indoors. So does this mean, their priorities are on point now? Here’s what they are planning to do in order to flatten the curve of Covid spike.Convincing house helps to stay overA big part of prepping for the third wave has been about being cautious as to who comes home, says Pooja Saran, a make up artist from Greater Kailash. “I have a part time nanny and since the cases have increased in the city, I have requested her to stay with us if the number continue to grow at the same speed. I need to make sure that the kids are take care of, so that I can continue my work, but at the same time I can’t risk anyone coming in from outside at this point of time. Also, it’s also not safe for her to travel everyday. Keeping my fingers crossed that she agrees,” she says.N95 masks onlyNeha Godara, a Gurugram-based chartered accountant, says she is back to masking up properly whenever stepping out. “The Covid cases had reduced so much that I, like many others, had started wearing cloth masks and was using those ones only even when outdoors. Now, however, I’ve purchased a fresh lot of N 95 masks, which are the best to keep the virus at bay as per the medical experts. In this situation when it’s at times important to go out, to get maximum safety, I feel all of us should mask up properly, and wear double masks if possible,” she says.Nutritious diet to fight the virus After several rounds of ordering in momos, pizza, biryani and what not, Delhiites are finally shifting their focus to some healthy eating. “It all starts with what we eat,” says Meeta, a Dwarka-based nutrionist, who is making sure that her family follows an immunity boosting diet. “We have stopped consuming outside food, processed foods and even reduced sugar intake in all forms. We have also increased the consumption of green vegetables. My entire family now drinks juice of natural giloy, every morning on an empty stomach. Also, we are eating the meals on time, adding a variety of foods, and focusing on good quality protein and fats. Besides, we have an early dinner by 7.30pm and are following an eight hour night sleep schedule to stay fit. I’m advising a similar diet and routine to all my clients as well,” she adds.Not hoarding, but stocking upSaloni Kachru, an HR professional from Gurugram, says she and her partner have cut down on the number of rounds to the supermarket. “We are making sure to buy all the essentials we need in one go, so that we don’t require to step out again and again or even order online every day. Some might feel that it’s early to do this, but I feel the earlier we are in keeping ourselves enclosed, the better will be in stopping the spread of virus at an unimagined level. Of course this doesn’t mean that you start hoarding stuff like people did last time! But at least buy your one month groceries and medicines in one go, so that you limit your contact with the delivery personnels,” she opines.Sanitising and sun drying mode on Dimple Kumar, a blogger from Safdarjung Enclave, has got back to sanitising everything before allowing it to come inside her house. “We have all heard that this Omicron has a rare transmission from the surfaces, but why take a chance? So, I’m back to sun drying all the vegetables that I buy. After washing them thoroughly, I spread them in the balcony, and alongside soak in some winter sun myself. I’m also sanitising the other packed groceries that we order online. It is indeed a time consuming process, but nothing is more satisfying than knowing that your hygiene quotient is on point,” she says.Meeting family sans partiesHealth comes before anything, says Garima Jain, a homemaker from Noida, adding, “I’m now setting out to meet just my parents and my in laws, at the moment. This is a tough time and we need to be very careful and not oganise dinner or get-togethers because the person who is carrying the virus is mostly not even aware of it, and that makes the situation very dangerous. In my family, we have decided to not have too many people together, whenever we meet now. If sacrificing a little fun, by avoiding social gatherings and meeting, can help us stay healthy, then it’s nothing as compared to the cost of falling sick and recovering. Thanks to technology, we can all see each other via video calls and all. So a little patience will pay off big time. It’s tough to say no to a party invitation, but I have a nine-month old and I say clearly say that I will not be taking any chances!” Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhincr-begins-prepping-for-third-wave-all-hands-on-deck-101641448128730.html

Also read: PM security breach: Punjab Police ignored intelligence, ‘Blue Book’ rulesAn official spokesperson said that the committee would comprise Justice Mehtab Singh Gill (retd) and principal secretary, home affairs and justice, Anurag Verma. The committee shall submit its report within three days, the spokesperson said. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Modi’s convoy was stuck on a flyover near Ferozepur for 15-20 minutes due to a blockade by protesters. The PM, who was travelling by road from Bathinda airport due to the inclement weather, had to call off his plans to address the BJP rally in Ferozepur. Returning to Delhi, Modi said to state government official at Bathinda airport, “Apne CM ko thanks kehna, ki me Bathinda airport tak zinda laut paya.” Chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi denied the allegations of any security breach of the Prime Minister saying that he did it have any information about the change of route of the PM. “We had asked them (PMO) to discontinue the visit due to bad weather conditions and protests. We had no information of his (Prime Minister Narendra Modi) sudden route change. There was no security lapse during the PM visit,” Channi said on Wednesday evening at a press conference. The incident triggered a political blame game with the BJP accusing the ruling Congress government in Punjab of sabotaging the PM’s scheduled programme and for the major security lapse. Former Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, who is a poll ally of the BJP, sought Channi’s resignation, saying that the Punjab government cannot provide smooth passage to the Prime Minister of the country and that too just 10km from the Pakistan border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-govt-sets-up-high-level-committee-to-probe-pm-security-breach-101641447626475.html

The daily count of cases has shot up more than 30 times over the last 10 days in the state. On Wednesday, West Bengal reported 14,022 infections compared to 439 on December 27.A Chief Justice Prakash Shrivastava-led division bench of the high court urged the government on Wednesday to consider the plea seeking the cancellation of the Ganga Sagar Mela.“The state government has been asked to file an affidavit on Thursday when the matter comes up for hearing again,” said lawyer Srijib Chakraborty, who represents the petitioner.Millions of pilgrims are expected to attend the Mela to take the holy dip at the confluence of the Ganga and Bay of Bengal on the occasion of Makar Sankranti on January 15 while elections to municipalities in Asansol, Bidhannagar, Siliguri, and Chandannagar will be held on January 22.West Bengal registered the peak of the second Covid-19 wave on May 14 last year after the assembly elections ended. The daily count of cases shot up to 20,846. Health experts blamed gatherings of people without caring for safety norms or the surge.

06-01-2022||Patna||Bihar man, 84, says he took 12 jabs; govt disputes claim||MADHEPURA/PATNA: Health authorities in Bihar launched a probe after Brahma Dev Mandal, 84, a retired postal employee who hails from Orai village in Madhepura district, claimed to have received 12 anti-Covid vaccine shots during the last 11 months.Bihar government officials have disputed Mandal’s claim.Mandal says he used his Aadhaar ID, his mobile number and his wife’s voter ID and her phone number to get the 12 jabs.Dr Amarendra Pratap Shahi, a civil surgeon from Madhepura, disputed Mandal’s claim, saying that the CoWIN portal that is used for the Covid-19 vaccination process doesn’t allow multiple registrations on a single Aadhaar ID. “CoWIN does not allow multiple registrations using the same Aadhaar number. Besides, presently, a maximum of four beneficiaries can be registered on each mobile number,” said Dr Shahi. Dr Shahi, who visited Puraini village on Wednesday to meet Mandal, later said the octogenarian failed to show him any vaccination certificate to support his claim of being jabbed 12 times against Covid-19. “He sounded slightly mentally unsound to me,” said Dr Shahi. To be sure, the doctor has called upon the medical officer in-charge of Puraini’s primary health centre to verify the facts and submit a report in 24 hours’ time. Mandal says he took 12 shots of Covid-19 vaccine as part of his efforts to dispel misgivings about the jab among the villagers, who he claims were reluctant to take the shot. Mandal, who claims to have noted down the date and time of all 12 jabs, said he took his first shot at Puraini PHC on February 13 last year.

Before this, 11,206 fresh infections were reported on April 4, 2021, which was then the single-day highest case tally after the pandemic outbreak.With these, Mumbai's tally of Covid-19 cases jumped to 8,33,628.Also Read | BMC asks 142 pvt hospitals to prep with full capacity to handle Covid-19 surgeThe overall growth rate of coronavirus disease cases in Mumbai is 0.78 per cent and the doubling rate of patients is 89 days.Three deaths were also reported in Mumbai on Wednesday taking the tally to 16,384.Dharavi, which was a Covid-19 hotspot last year, recorded 81 cases on Wednesday, which is also the highest since April 4, when the slum recorded 99 cases.The BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities have identified four wards where the spike in cases is particularly concerning.

06-01-2022||Delhi||Spike in infections upends plans for regular learning in Delhi schools||Amid a spike in Covid-19 cases in the Capital, schools are staring at another round of extended closure. Many schools that had earlier planned to hold classes and assessments on campus have now altered their plans for the next few weeks as they brace for another round of online classes.Schools in Delhi had reopened for students of all grades in November last year. Last week, the Delhi government ordered the closure of all schools as it implemented the yellow alert of its Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) amid a spike in Covid-19 cases.School heads said that while online classes are taking place, the disruption of normal classes for the past two years is widening the learning gap and taking a toll on the mental health of students in the absence of peer-to-peer interaction.Sudha Acharya, the chairperson of the National Progressive Schools’ Conference, a conglomerate of over 120 private Delhi schools, said it seemed unlikely that schools will reopen before February.Acharya, who is also the principal of ITL Public School, Dwarka, said that the surge in cases and the subsequent closure of schools has derailed teaching plans. “We had to call off a recent workshop that we had planned for the capacity building of teachers. In the current situation, nothing can be planned. It seems that schools might continue to remain closed till March if we go by previous Covid-19 waves,” said Acharya.She added that some stakeholders are of the view that the CBSE Term 2 board exams may also be postponed further if the Covid-19 situation did not improve. The CBSE Term 1 exams concluded in November-December last year. The Term 2 examinations are scheduled to take place in March-April, depending on the pandemic situation at the time.Schools said that the closure had put a question mark on practical exams that are conducted on campus for board students. “While theory can be taught online, practical sessions and exams require students to be on campus. Whenever schools reopen, conducting practical exams will be our first priority,” said Acharya.Tanya Joshi, principal of the Indian School, said that the school will hold a meeting to deliberate upon the manner in which teaching and learning will continue in the coming days. “The situation doesn’t look good. From our past experience, we know that schools will be the last to reopen. Amid this uncertainty, we will need to ensure that we are making the best use of resources and will have to recalibrate our approach,” said Joshi.Besides the logistical challenges of changes in timetables and assessments, schools are also worried about the impact of school closure on the learning gap. Since April last year, schools have been asked to shut four times on account of Covid-19 and pollution. The repeated disruptions are bound to exacerbate the already existing learning gaps, school heads said.Laksh Vir Sehgal, principal of Bal Bharati Public School, Ganga Ram Hospital Marg, said while the school was hoping that the upcoming wave might not last for long, an adverse impact on learning gaps and social skills of children was expected. Many students in grades below 6 in the school have not returned to campus since the pandemic first started in March 2020.“There are going to be a lot of learning and developmental gaps due to the pandemic-induced closure. Children learn a lot from their peer groups. Their social growth depends on their interaction with one another. Covering these gaps will be a big challenge whenever schools reopen,” said Sehgal.The impact of prolonged school closure on the mental health of children is a concern that experts and stakeholders have raised time and again. Schools say that the absence of peer-to-peer interaction is impacting students who are increasingly becoming more reclusive. “Children’s mental health has been badly affected. There is a huge communication gap between parents and children. Children have become reclusive. They are confined in their shells and parents are reaching out to us to flag the changes in their personalities,” said Acharya.Experts continue to emphasise the need for engagement with students in small peer groups. Anubha Rajesh, chair professor at Jamia Millia Islamia’s Centre for Early Childhood Development and Research, had earlier told HT that it was crucial for schools to adopt innovative ways of engagement with students. “Online teaching is not the solution but only an alternative in the prevailing situation. We have to focus on the online capacity building of teachers as well as sustain peer interaction among students. We need to build small groups of students for the improvement of their psychological and social well-being through sustained engagement so that they have support. However, once the situation improves, offline mode of learning is the best,” said Rajesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/spike-in-infections-upends-plans-for-regular-learning-in-delhi-schools-101641430358583.html
06-01-2022||Delhi||Delhiwale: Monument’s secret charm||The whole world comes to see Humayun’s Tomb. The monument must be beautiful. You ought to head to Humayun’s Tomb for another beautiful reason, too. Just outside the gate is an eight-year-old snack stall that sells one of Delhi’s best chhole kulche (with butter).The crowd around Mr Jasbeer’s modest establishment this afternoon attests to the deliciousness of his signature delicacy. A family of sightseers who just emerged out of the monument are eagerly standing around the stall. The entire enterprise is mounted on a bicycle. The stove to heat the kulchas, as well as the giant brass cauldron filled with the pre-cooked chhole, are placed on a wooden case that is firmly installed on the cycle’s carrier. The wooden case’s broad sidebars serve as makeshift tables for diners to eat in comfort.Delhi’s street cuisine is so sophisticated that it is difficult to come across an unsatisfying chhole kulcha. Mr Jasbeer makes it exceptionally well. May be it’s his last-minute tricks that take the dish into a state of sublimity. Just before he hands over a chhole bowl to a customer (30 rupees per plate), he squeezes half a lemon onto it, adds chopped onions and tomato slices, and concludes the act by placing a green chilli pickle on the top. This pickle is heavenly; Mr Jasbeer makes it at his home. In fact, apart from the bakery kulchas, everything else is made in his one-room house in nearby Sarai Kale Khan. A former “beldar” (labourer), the soft-spoken Budaun native says he gets up every morning at five – along with wife, Sushma — and they jointly carry out the preliminary cooking for the day ahead. The four kids stay asleep at that hour.A few minutes after this chat, the stall suddenly empties of people. Mr Jasbeer exploits the spare moments by ladling out an ample portion of the cooked chickpeas from the cauldron onto a small pan, which he places on the stove’s slow fire. He adds a spoon of water to “further soften the chhole”, throws in a bit of black salt and coarse red chilli powder, plus a good amount of chopped onions and tomatoes, along with a fistful of fresh dhaniya leaves. He stirs the dish with a furious movement of his hand, like a pianist nearing his sonata’s final moments. The next moment, the stall is again circled by a crowd. Mr Jasbeer serves daily from noon till 7pm, after which he pedals the stall back to his waiting wife.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-monument-s-secret-charm-101641428458113.html

06-01-2022||Chandigarh||PDP opposes ‘curbs’ on pilgrims at Vaishno Devi||The People’s Democratic Party on Wednesday strongly criticised the administration for its “casual approach” to regulate pilgrims rush at the Vaishno Devi shrine. On Saturday, 12 pilgrims were killed and 15 others were injured in a stampeded at the cave shrine. In a statement issued here, spokesperson of the party, Anil Sethi, said that the administration seems to have woken up from its slumber after the catastrophic incident of stampede, but the measures are being taken from within the four walls of civil secretariat and Raj Bhawan without understanding the ground realities. “Curbs and restrictions seem to be the only way this administration takes refuge under,” Sethi said, adding, “The administration has come up with the dictate making it mandatory for all the pilgrims to make online registration prior to visiting the shrine putting disadvantage to the thousands of visitors who are not aquatinted with the technology.” He said that instead of finding the loopholes and fixing the problems on the ground, the officials at the helm of affairs have just shifted the blame on the visitors, who might have arrived at the cave shrine for blessings on the eve of new year. “At present, the pilgrims were free either to get themselves registered online or on their arrival at Katra town,” he said, adding that as per the new direction only the pilgrims with online registration would now be allowed to the shrine. Quoting media reports, the PDP leader said that restricting the number of pilgrims to 25,000 per day was another curb the administration was imposing. “Pilgrims from across the country wait for the festival seasons to visit the holy shrine and the proposed restrictions would only create hindrance for the visitors,” he added. He said that the government and the shrine board should instead focus on the widening of the 13km long track, strengthening of the existing infrastructures and putting in place the required security apparatus in order to avoid such incident in the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pdp-opposes-curbs-on-pilgrims-at-vaishno-devi-101641423264787.html

06-01-2022||Delhi||Closure of schools will have devastating consequences for children: Education body||The National Coalition on the Education Emergency, a consortium of individuals and organisations that work on Right to Education and have been advocating for the reopening of schools, on Tuesday said that the closure of schools would have devastating consequences for children. The group noted that a number of governments including Delhi had ordered the closure of schools while others were planning to do so despite the fact that schools had only opened recently after remaining mostly closed since March 2020. Schools in Delhi had reopened for students of all grades in November last year. Last week, the Delhi government ordered the closure of all schools as it implemented the yellow alert of its Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) amid a spike in Covid-19 cases. “It is evident that the absence of structured learning opportunities has caused severe academic regression, young children have forgotten habits of learning; basic reading and numeracy skills have been affected, and we are seeing a huge dropout as a result,” the group said in a statement issued on Tuesday. The statement has been endorsed by 18 education activists and individuals from forums such as the Right to Education Forum, All India Primary Teachers Federation, Council for Social Development, among others. While making a case of continued learning in schools, the group said that the closure of schools since the beginning of the pandemic had caused “devastating consequences for the nutrition, health and education” of many children. It said that instances of child labour, early marriages and domestic violence against children had also increased. “Complete lockdown has severely affected our economy and jobs earlier. School lockdown will similarly harm our children, and that too, over the long term. Keeping schools open is necessary to reduce this serious harm and resume the processes of learning. Schools must be the last to close and the first to open,” read the statement issued by the group. While outlining that online classes had not been very effective, the group said that “online education will continue to be a meaningless ‘option’. Suraj Kumar, educationist and one of the signatories, said that a vast majority of children did not have access to online classes and was being deprived of learning due to the prolonged closure of schools. Kumar said that it was crucial to reopen schools for children to learn and grow under the guidance of teachers. “Online education cannot be a replacement for school. People in cities might still have phones but in villages and many other remote areas, most people don’t have access to smartphones. Children are losing precious time due to the closure of schools,” said Kumar. The group also suggested using a graded response to the coronavirus waves. It said that schools in urban areas can be asked to operate at 50% capacity while following Covid-19 protocols when the test positivity rate crosses 5%. If the test positivity rate crosses 10%, medium-sized schools can be asked to function with staggered timings. It said that widespread school closure should only be considered if a large number of severe cases affected children. The group also proposed that in-person attendance should be encouraged but not made compulsory so that parents are not forced to send children to school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/closure-of-schools-will-have-devastating-consequences-for-children-education-body-101641419664652.html
06-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi’s east civic body panel rejects all tax hike proposals by commissioner||The East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has decided to reject all the tax hike proposals made by the municipal commissioner Vikas Anand. With the upcoming municipal elections due in April this year, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led elected wing has decided that the move to increase tax by 2-3% as well as the introduction of new taxes such as betterment tax and professional tax will be declined. Bir Singh Panwar, the EDMC standing committee chairman, while delivering the budget proposal worth ₹3,970 crore for 2022-23 on Wednesday, stated that the standing committee has disallowed any tax increase proposal moved by the commissioner and the corporation will focus on increasing its internal sources of revenue. The standing committee is the final decision-making panel for the financial decisions which are taken up by the general body meeting of corporation.Currently, the financially strained east MCD’s 80% expenditure goes towards paying salaries while 59% of its revenue sources come from the state government in the form of tax allocation and grants. On November 26, 2021, the commissioner proposed a 2-3% hike in property tax for residential properties in east Delhi. The commissioner also pushed for a hike in ‘theatre tax’ and tax on the sanction of new building plans, addition of 5% education cess, introduction of two new discretionary taxes-- betterment tax and professional tax--in order to improve the financial health of the civic body.Panwar said when the civic body was constituted a decade ago, the then Delhi government had assured that a financial package will be provided to the disadvantaged corporation to make it financially viable, but no assistance was ever provided. “If any organisation is forced to start its journey in a financial crisis, the crisis remains perpetual. The Delhi government has always tried to financially cripple the east corporation. The Covid pandemic has made the situation even more challenging as sources of revenue have gone down while burden of additional work has been put on us,” the chairman said. He added that the rules framed by the Delhi government do not allow the municipal councillors to undertake development work in unauthorised colonies, while there is no such restriction on MPs and MLAs. “East Delhi has the most backward areas in its jurisdiction as 87% of the region comprises unauthorised areas while only 13% region is planned, which makes it even more difficult for the corporation to deliver services in the most densely populated part of the city,” he added.Panwar listed several welfare schemes for the next financial year including a 25% or ₹25,000 subsidy for the installation of composting plants or a waste processing unit by residential bulk waste generators, phasing out of garbage receptacle points by installing 38 fixed compactors, 76 mobile waste compactors and 60 material recovery facilities, and the promise of a long-term plan for tackling pollution sources in trans-Yamuna areas. He added that a technology park is being developed by EDMC in New Jaffrabad ward, and will showcase technologies to tackle floating waste material in Kasturba drain. Panwar announced that other east Delhi drains including SSBL drain, Gokulpuri drain and Gandhi Nagar drain will be added to the project. “We will also upgrade the 12MW Ghazipur waste-to-energy plant so that it can be used to its full capacity. A 2,000TPD waste processing integrated facility in Ghonda-Gujran will be completed by December 2022,” he added.The budget lists several steps to deal with the rise in the number of enrolments in municipal primary schools during the pandemic. EDMC operates 354 primary schools with more than 200,000 students. “We will add English medium sections and upgrade all the schools to Nigam Pratibha level. Funding for a foreign training scheme has been proposed, under which initially two teachers will be sent to foreign universities in 2022-23. EDMC will also provide a ₹10,000 subsidy to each teacher to buy laptops for online classes. The engineering department will add more classrooms due to increasing enrolments while the process for hiring new nursery teachers is underway,” he added. Under the remunerative projects cell, the corporation has decided to set up a PPP cell, invite tenders for 37 surface parking sites and levy revenue from EV charging points and cell on wheels.The cash-strapped corporation has repeated several old projects in the current budget including upgradation of SDN hospital, smart classrooms and PPP-based models to manage municipal parks.The standing committee has cleared a proposal to set up a waste-to-art park in East Delhi. This will be third such park in the city after the waste-to-wonder and Bharat Darshan parks.Manoj Tyagi, the leader of the Opposition in EDMC, said the budget proposal made by chairperson was “laughable”. “If we compare the revenue streams to pre-pandemic years, all their collections are down. In parking sector, property tax, advertisement, the corporation is not able to increase the internal sources due to corruption. They should stop blaming the Delhi government for all of their failures. Sanitation is the basic obligatory function and despite privatisation of waste collection, our Swachh ranking remains one of the poorest in the country,” he added||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-east-civic-body-panel-rejects-all-tax-hike-proposals-by-commissioner-101641419424875.html

06-01-2022||Chandigarh||BKU (Krantikari) says they had no plans to block PM Modi’s way||Activists of ultra-Left farm organisation Bhartiya Kisan Union (Krantikari) staged the sit-in on the Moga-Ferozepur highway that blocked the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s cavalcade on Wednesday. While taking the responsibility for the protest on PM cavalcade’s route, organisation’s general secretary Baldev Singh Zira said, “We were not aware that PM would travel by road as we were told, he would reach the rally site by a helicopter. We were already protesting on the spot and came to know about the PM’s journey only after his cavalcade had taken a U-turn,” he said, adding around 500-600 farmers were at the protest site. Sources in different farm organisations, however, said that the plan was to stage a sit-in outside DC offices in the districts against PM’s visit, however, as news of PM travelling to the rally venue by road spread, activists of BKU (Krantikari) blocked the highway on a flyover near the Piareana village. An office-bearer of a farm body on the condition of anonymity said, “They (BKU Krantikari) should have shown restraint and waited for the January 15 meeting of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) for further course of action,” he said. BKU (Krantikari) has some influence in pockets of Zira, Ferozpur and Rampura Phul area. Surjit Singh Phul, who heads the organization, was not available for a comment. Phul was booked under the sections of Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) and had remained in jail for almost five years. According to Zira, the protest was planned for not accepting the demand for formation of a committee on minimum support price (MSP) that PM had promised when he made announcement for repeal of the three farm laws in November last year. “There is no action against the accused in Lakhimpur Kheri incident, rather two farmers have been arrested. The government has not dismissed the (Union minister of state for home) Ajay Mishra from the cabinet, despite his son Ashish Mishra being chargesheeted,” he added. 
06-01-2022||Noida||Greater Noida: Cab driver held for killing passenger, escaping with belongings||A 32-year-old cab driver was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly killing a 45-year-old passenger by pushing him in front of a speeding heavy vehicle and escaping with his belongings, in Jewar in November 2021, police said.The victim was identified as Utkarsh Singh, an engineer from Ghaziabad’s Indirapuram, said police officials, adding that the suspect -- identified as Rakesh Kumar, a native of Bulandshahr -- is a resident of Shakti Khand 4 in Indirapuram.Sudhir Kumar, station house officer (SHO), Dankaur police station, said that Singh booked a cab manually from Mathura to Indirapuram on November 7, 2021. “The driver suddenly stopped his car during the ride near the Jewar toll plaza, saying there were some issues with the vehicle. When the passenger got down from the vehicle, the driver pushed him on the road and a speeding vehicle coming from the same direction ran over him,” Kumar said. The suspect escaped with five bags the victim was carrying. Police received a call from a passerby, who informed them about the accident. The victim was taken to a private nearby hospital where he was declared dead.A case was registered against the suspect under Indian Penal Code (IPC) Section 302 (murder) at the Dankaur police station. “We scanned CCTV footage of nearby areas and identified the cab. We also scanned the victim’s call records and found that the suspect had called him that night to pick him up for the ride from Mathura to Indirapuram.

06-01-2022||Chandigarh||Rain, PM Modi’s absence spoil BJP’s Ferozepur rally||The Bharatiya Janata Party’s Ferozepur rally that was projected as the mega launch of party’s election campaigning ended up a damp squib due to rain and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s inability to reach the venue due to ‘security breach’.Prime Minister Modi’s rally was much-awaited as the saffron party is contesting the state elections independently (without Akali Dal) for the first time. All eyes were on the rally as there were expectations that Modi may announce mega projects to woo the agrarian community that is annoyed with the BJP since three contentious farm laws were introduced in 2020.But PM’s cavalcade got stuck as protesters squatted on the road near Ferozepur’s Piareana village, less than 10 kms from the rally venue. After assessing safety issues, PM’s security agencies decided to return without visiting Ferozepur.Modi could not enter Ferozepur city even as the state authorities had deployed nearly 10,000 security personnel for today’s event. There was heavy security in the city and roads leading to Ferozepur district headquarters were either sealed or subjected to intense screening of commuters after Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee had given a call to oppose PM’s visit. Similarly, the rain played a spoilsport for the event. Inspite of a forecast of rain and possible hailstorm in Ferozepur and adjoining districts on Wednesday, the programme was not changed. It was raining since early morning and the venue was damp and slushy. There was no cover and only a small number of people made it to venue on a cold afternoon. People were seen using chairs and political placards to protect themselves from the rain as most chairs remained unoccupied. Several Union ministers, including Mansukh Mandaviya, Hardeep Puri, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat were camping in Ferozepur to make Modi’s address a big event.In his address, the state BJP president Ashwani Sharma said several buses ferrying party supporters from different districts were stopped by Punjab Police at various places. Sharma said the police authorities buckled under the political pressure to let mobs to block roads leading to the rally venue.After waiting for over one-and-a-half hours for the PM from the scheduled arrival time, the organisers abruptly announced the culmination of the rally at 2.35 pm, without stating why the star attraction could not turn up at the venue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rain-pm-modi-s-absence-spoil-bjp-s-ferozepur-rally-101641415465390.html

06-01-2022||Noida||5 new police stations opened across Noida; 22 police stations in GB Nagar so far||The Gautam Budh Nagar police on Wednesday started operating five new police stations in Noida -- Phase 1, and sectors 63, 113, 126 and 142 for better maintenance of law and order there. These police stations will operate from police check posts in their respective areas till their offices are completely built.At present, there are 22 police stations in Gautam Budh Nagar -- six in Noida Zone, six in Noida Central, nine in Greater Noida, and one women police station in Sector 39.Alok Singh, police commissioner of Gautam Budh Nagar, said that the Uttar Pradesh government in August 2018 announced to set up the new police stations in the district. “These five new police stations have been carved out of the existing stations, for better policing,” Singh said.The Phase 1 police station has been carved out from Sector 20, Sector 63 from Phase 3, Sector 113 from Sector 49, Sector 126 from Sector 39, and Sector 142 from Surajpur and Phase 2 police station areas. The Phase 1 police station will operate from the Harolla check post, Sector 126 police station from the Okhla check post, Sector 113 from the Sector 116 check post, Sector 63 from the Block C check post in Sector 63, and Sector 142 from the Sector 144 check post till their buildings are developed, Singh added. Police said the office buildings of the five police stations will be developed within the next two years.“Land for these police stations has been allotted. The Phase 1 and Sector 142 police stations will be developed by the Uttar Pradesh Police Awas Nigam, and the other three stations will be developed by the Uttar Pradesh Rajkiya Nirman Nigam,” the commissioner said, adding that these police stations will have two-storey state-of-the-art buildings, which will have facilities like a reception, a women’s help desk, a complaint room, a surveillance room, a staff room, an arsenal, a store room, a washroom, a lockup, among others. The campus will also have a separate housing complex for the police personnel. The police commissionerate has deployed five police personnel as in-charges of these new police stations. Singh also said that one more police station in Noida has been proposed, and four other stations in the Jewar airport area. “The land for the four police stations in Jewar has been allotted,” he added.Rajendra Kumar, sub-inspector at the Sector 126 police station, said that the check post covers limited areas and these stations have larger jurisdictions. “Now, we will be able to file FIRs in the police station. This will certainly help the locals. Earlier, complainants had to visit the Sector 39 police station to register FIRs,” Kumar said. KK Jain, secretary general of Federation of Noida residents’ welfare association (FONRWA), said that the new police stations will ensure safety of the residents. “This will also deter the anti-social elements from committing crime in the area. We had urged the government to set up these new police stations. The government has delivered on their promises,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/5-new-police-stations-opened-across-noida-22-police-stations-in-gb-nagar-so-far-101641414624173.html
06-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi top cop Asthana says PIL against him driven by ‘personal vendetta’||Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana has submitted in the Supreme Court 31 tweets posted against him by advocate Prashant Bhushan in the last four years, as the 1984-batch IPS officer claimed that the challenge to his appointment as the national capital’s top cop was driven by “personal vendetta” and “vengeance” of NGOs CPIL and Common Cause, both represented by Bhushan.In an affidavit filed in response to CPIL’s petitions challenging his appointment as Delhi Police commissioner on July 27, Asthana highlighted that CPIL and Common Cause have been consistently picking on him out of malice and an “unknown agenda” following his appointment in the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) as a special director in October 2017. “The conduct of the petitioner (CPIL) herein in maligning the image of Respondent No.2 (Asthana) ever since his appointment in CBI is evident from the following facts and it can be satisfactorily concluded that the petitioner is carrying out personal vengeance against him. These petitions are, therefore, not bonafide public interest litigations but are a flagrant abuse of process and forum that is this Hon’ble Court,” stated the affidavit.It detailed five cases in which Common Cause and CPIL moved the apex court since 2017, raising questions over Asthana’s appointment in CBI; sought his removal as special director in CBI; demanded a probe against him in connection to a bribery case; and finally, through the fresh petitions, filed in August and November 2021, challenged his appointment as commissioner.“The aforesaid petitions were followed by a scathing social media campaign against Respondent No.2 (Asthana) maligning his reputation on multiple social media platforms, which corroborates the apprehension of the answering respondent that these challenges to his appointment were solely a result of some personal vendetta held by the petitioner,” added the affidavit, asking for dismissal of CPIL’s petition. The senior police officer then highlighted Bhushan’s tweets when petitions against him were filed and decided by the top court since 2017. “It is pertinent to mention here that the dates of filing and decisions in the petitions listed in the table above are suspiciously similar to timeline of the tweets between October 22, 2017 and July 28, 2021. True copies of the snapshots of tweets are annexed,” stated the affidavit. Asthana has attached with his affidavit screenshots of 31 tweets posted against him by Bhushan, who has argued all the five cases against him in the Supreme Court on behalf of the NGOs. “This sustained and strategic maligning of the answering respondent’s character further goes on to show the malafide of the present petitioner in carrying out a personal vendetta against the answering respondent. Hence, the present petition is another attempt in furtherance to the personal vendetta and is not even remotely in the interest of general public,” asserted Asthana in his reply. Asthana took charge as commissioner of Delhi Police on July 28, 2021. His appointment for one year came just four days before his superannuation on July 31. Before his appointment, the Indian Police Service officer was granted an inter-cadre deputation to a cadre comprising Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Mizoram, and Union territories other than Andaman and Nicobar, and an extension of service.CPIL, in its writ petition on August 2021 before the top court, alleged several illegalities in the inter-cadre deputation and extension of service, and claimed the appointment breached the condition stipulated in the Prakash Singh case because Asthana did not have a minimum residual tenure of six months.The other petition by CPIL before the Supreme Court on November 2021 is an appeal against the Delhi high court’s October 12 judgment affirming Asthana’s appointment.The Union government, in its response to CPIL’s petitions filed on Tuesday, justified Asthana’s appointment underlining that there was a “compelling need” to have someone like him head the police force of Delhi, taking into account the national capital’s “extremely challenging situations” of public order, policing issues, and their implications on national security.The Centre had also sought dismissal of CPIL’s petition, calling the NGO a “busybody”. “The petitioner keeps on selectively filing petitions and such selection of selected public interest...are beyond comprehensions...,” it said.On Wednesday, the matter came up before a bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and AS Bopanna and it was adjourned for a detailed hearing in the week starting January 11. Meanwhile, explaining his appointment as the Delhi Police Commissioner, Asthana maintained that it was done following a well-settled procedure which was also adhered to when eight previous police commissioners in Delhi were appointed. “However, appointment of Respondent No.2 (Asthana)is the only appointment ever challenged by the petitioner herein, for the reasons best known to them. It is evident from this selective criticism and specific challenge with respect to the respondent’s appointment that the petitioner has a specific, malafide and unknown agenda,” he claimed in the affidavit.Asthana further relied upon the the Delhi high court’s October 12 judgment affirming his appointment while pointing out that Delhi, being the capital of India, has its own characteristics, peculiar factors, complexities and sensitivities, which are far lesser in any other Commissionerate. “Any untoward incident in the National Capital or a law-and-order situation will have far reaching consequences, impact, repercussions and implications not only in India but across the international borders. Thus, it is imperative that ‘free movement of joints’ is given to the central government for appointment of Commissioner of Police, Delhi, keeping in mind the complexities obtaining in the Capital,” emphasised the affidavit.It added that the Supreme Court’s 2016 order in the Prakash Singh case, requiring a police chief of a state to have at least six months of service left, applies only to the director general of police or police heads of states but not to Union territories such as Delhi. This was the view taken by the Delhi high court as well. On the challenge to his inter-state cadre deputation and extension of service, the affidavit maintained that the rules provide for inter-cadre deputation of all India service officers by the central government, which also had the power to give service extension to officers on valid grounds. Prashant Bhushan said, “I have personally observed Asthana’s undesirable role in various capacity in police force and CBI, besides his closeness to the central government. I, therefore, commented on those aspects in my tweets. However, the challenge to his appointment as Delhi Police commissioner is purely on legal grounds. Also, I may have personal views on somebody but CPIL and Common Cause have a governing body and a committee that decide on filing of cases in courts.” 
06-01-2022||Chandigarh||Amritsar: Villagers detain ‘sacrilege’ accused in Ajnala||The situation at Bhangupur village falling under the Ajnala sub-division turned tense on Wednesday after a person allegedly committed sacrilege in the village gurdwara.The accused, who appears to be in his 20s, was caught by the village people and has been kept in a room of the gurdwara.A large number of Sikh activists who reached the village soon after the incident are not allowing the local police to arrest the accused. They are demanding that the accused should be interrogated in public.The incident took place at 2 pm when Gurdwara Nanaksar’s granthi Hardial Singh was not present there. According to the police, the accused, who appears to be mentally unsound, was found stealing the “Rumala Sahib” and “Chaur Sahib”. The accused was thrashed and detained in a room of the gurdwara sahib.As soon as the police got the information about the incident, the superintendent of police (SP -investigation) Manoj Kumar and deputy superintendent of police (DSP), Attari, Ravinderpal Singh, along with heavy police force reached the spot. However, the police team was not allowed by the people gathered to arrest the accused, demanding his questioning in public.“The accused has not been telling his identification. He appears mentally unfit. Those who caught the accused have told us that he consumed some pills, apparently drugs, immediately after being caught. The Sikh activists have demanded his interrogation in their presence, but we have a system and we can’t interrogate an accused in public. We are yet to file a case in this regard, as the Sikh activists have repeatedly been demanding his questioning before giving their statements,” said SP Manoj Kumar, adding that their teams were keeping a strict watch on the spot and the situation was under control.A police official said the accused appears to be from Uttar Pradesh (UP) or Bihar and they haven’t found any document from which he could be identified from his possession. The DSP said it was a case of sacrilege and they will take further action as per the law.The SP said, “We have questioned the accused, but he is not giving any satisfactory replies. We are also in talks with Sikh activists and the incident would be investigated thoroughly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amritsar-villagers-detain-sacrilege-accused-in-ajnala-101641414504475.html

He said the government would also reintroduce the pre-2004 pension scheme for government employees and remove all pay commission anomalies. He was interacting with the farmers and employee wings of the party and also met the members of the Mulazam Front at a joint meeting here. Sukhbir referred to his party as pro-farmer and pro-employee because he said it had always led them to the path of progress and resolved all their grievances. The former deputy CM asked for suggestions from farmers and employees so that they could be included in the party’s manifesto.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/if-voted-to-power-sad-bsp-will-ensure-msp-for-vegetables-sukhbir-badal-101641414444420.html
06-01-2022||Chandigarh||No relief to SAD leader Bikram Majithia in drugs case for now, next hearing on Jan 10||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader and former Punjab minister Bikram Singh Majithia, 46, failed to get a stay order against arrest in a drugs case from the Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday even as the court asked the state government to file “specific response” on the issues raised by him by January 10. The high court bench of justice Lisa Gill heard his plea for one-and-a-half hours. A battery of lawyers led by Supreme Court advocate Mukul Rohatgi and senior advocate RS Cheema appeared for Majithia and pressed for interim protection. It was argued that apart from the fact that there is “inexplicable delay” in lodging of the FIR, the criminal case itself could not have been lodged because, if at all, any material had indeed surfaced against him, it was incumbent upon the authorities to have firstly sought permission of the competent court before proceeding against him. A fresh FIR could not have been registered as the matter was being investigated both by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Special Task Force (STF) as well as the committee constituted under orders of the high court in a suo motu plea pending since 2013. No action for all these long years was taken, it was submitted, adding that the present FIR was vitiated by “political and ulterior motives”. The petitioner has no criminal record and is a mainstream politician and undertakes to join the investigation, fully cooperate with the investigating agency and abide by any conditions which may be imposed by the court, it was undertaken. On the other hand, former Union minister P Chidambaram-led state government’s team and had referred to fresh statements recorded by the police of Niranjan Singh, former deputy director, ED, and Jagdish Singh Bhola, prime accused in 2013 drug haul case, arguing that there is “specific, sufficient and clear cut” material to connect Majithia with the offences alleged. The bench of justice Lisa Gill, taking note of arguments from both sides, deferred the hearing for January 10, seeking a written response from the state government. However, the court has not passed an order on interim protection to Majithia. On December 24, a Mohali court had dismissed Majithia’s plea, observing that though his claims are of “political vendetta” but he himself was a powerful person in state politics till 2017 during the SAD rule. Majithia was booked by the Punjab Police on December 20 under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, including Sections 25 (punishment for allowing premises), 27 (A) (whoever is financing any activities pertaining to narcotic drugs) and 29 (party to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence). Majithia’s whereabouts are not known. The plea terms the criminal case “election stunt” and further alleges that the government has changed three police chiefs in three months to get this FIR registered. The plea also accuses Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu of indulging in “unwarranted propaganda” and deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa of demonstrating “intense hatred” towards him. The plea also refers to the controversy involving ADGP SK Asthana, claiming that he refused to investigate the matter and raised questions whether the matter can be investigated, STF report being sealed before the court, superseded by other reports and whether an investigation can be initiated without the permission of the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/no-relief-to-sad-leader-bikram-majithia-in-drugs-case-for-now-next-hearing-on-jan-10-101641414384290.html

06-01-2022||Delhi||Most Omicron patients have mild symptoms: Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain||On the day that Delhi recorded over 10,000 new Covid infections, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain assured people that most people contracting the Omicron variant of Covid-19 are reporting mild symptoms and that the government is closely monitoring the rise in cases. He also said that no lockdown will be imposed in the city for the time being. Addressing a press conference on Wednesday, Jain said that Delhi is rapidly recording Covid cases, with the Omicron variant being the primary cause of the increase. He said that global data showed that the Omicron variant is less dangerous than the Delta variant. “People coming from abroad are the ones who are most affected by the omicron variant. Until now, no patient is in critical need of oxygen, and the majority of patients have mild symptoms,” Jain said in the press briefing. He added, “The government is keeping a close eye on the situation. This is the fifth wave to hit Delhi, and the third for the entire country. For the time being, the situation in Delhi is under control. In Delhi’s hospitals, there are plenty of beds available.” Quoting from official data, Jain said that Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital currently has 650 beds set aside for Covid patients, of which only 20 are occupied. The occupancy rate being around 2-5%. In Delhi, 782 coronavirus-infected patients have been admitted to hospitals. When the cases were equal in number, there was a 15% occupancy rate of beds in the previous wave of Corona, which is around 3% in the current situation, he said. “There was no need for all patients’ genomes to be sequenced; it was just a research process to see if Omicron was spreading in society or not. Because the majority of the patients are Omicron positive, there is no need to perform genome sequencing on all of them. However, random samples’ genomes are still being sequenced,” he said. He also said that there will be no lockdown in Delhi for the time being; construction work will continue as usual; there is no need for workers to panic; some restrictions have been imposed in the interest of public health. Delhi has taken the most stringent steps in the country to stop Corona, such as weekend curfew, shutting down colleges and schools, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/most-omicron-patients-have-mild-symptoms-delhi-health-minister-satyendar-jain-101641414205839.html

06-01-2022||Noida||In a first, RERA allows transfer of rights between firms for project completion||The Uttar Pradesh real estate regulatory authority (UPRERA) has allowed the “transfer of majority rights” in the realty project -- Bizlife -- in Noida’s Sector 62 from an old promoter to a new one who wants to finish and deliver the delayed project in time, said officials on Wednesday.The move will not only safeguard the interests of buyers but also enable the new promoter to deliver the same according to the rules.The UPRERA has allowed the change under Section 15 of the RERA Act, said the officials.“We have allowed this kind of a transfer of majority rights from an existing promoter to an intending promoter in a company under Section 15 of the RERA Act for the first time. The existing promoter was unable to construct and deliver the proposed project, so we had to bring a new promoter and also got the consent from the majority of the buyers to do so,” said Rajive Kumar, chairman of UPRERA.This project -- Bizlife -- is located in Noida Sector 62 spread over a 20,000-square-metre area. The project started in July 2017, with a completion deadline of October 31, 2023. On November 8, 2021, the transfer of majority rights from the existing company to the new one was done along with the consent of 519 out of the total 750 allottees. According to the proposal submitted before the RERA, the work at the site has been at standstill for four years and the move was crucial for the revival of the work as two-third buyers, including the association, had given their consent for the transfer, Kumar added.Now, the new intending promoter -- Urbanac Building Technologies -- will build and deliver the stalled project according to the UPRERA rules, said the order.The Solutrean Building Technology Limited (SBTL) allegedly failed to deliver the commercial project.“The Urbanac Building Technologies will be responsible to follow all the terms and conditions under the Uttar Pradesh Real Estate Regulatory Act,” said Kumar.In the past, the RERA allowed the buyers’ associations and the contractors to finish stuck projects in the state including Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad among others.“There are at least 12 such cases where we have allowed the buyers associations to make arrangements, paving way for the delivery of stuck realty projects in Noida and Greater Noida under sections 7 or 8 of the Act. But, for the first time, we have used Section 15 of the Act and it may open a window for other projects, which are stuck and the same model can be followed,” said Kumar.Paritosh Goel, managing partner, Urbanac Building Technologies, said, “Strengthening the confidence of all the investors and buyers, our priority will be to implement the approved project rehabilitation plan as soon as possible and proceed with the construction work.”Sandeep Sahni, chairman of Solutrean Building Technology Limited, said, “This is the first such acquisition in the district and we want to assure the existing allottees that we will take every step for the betterment of the project. We will soon start the project site, once the remaining formalities of the UPRERA are completed. We will set up the office, rename the project, and begin the construction work soon after the approval of the new map.”

06-01-2022||Delhi||Cases hit 10k-mark in Delhi, positivity rate at almost 12%||Delhi on Wednesday reported eight Covid-19 deaths, last recorded in June last year when the second wave of the virus was abating, according to government data. Fuelled by the Omicron variant of coronavirus, the number of infections also nearly doubled on Wednesday as compared to the day before, with cases crossing the 10,000 mark and the test positivity rate shooting to 11.88%.Data released by the government on Wednesday showed that Delhi recorded 10,665 new cases, out of 89,742 samples that were tested. The last time the city saw such a high number of new infections was during the peak of the second wave on May 12, 2021, when the number of daily infections climbed to 13,287. The city’s positivity rate also touched 11.88%, last seen on May 14, 2021 (12.4%).On Tuesday, three deaths and 5,481 new infections were reported, and the positivity rate was recorded at 8.37%.Delhi government data shows that nine people had died of Covid-19 in December, 2021. In comparison, seven people died of the infection in November, and four in October.Even as the number of cases rose exponentially this week, Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain urged people to not panic.“With the arrival of Omicron, Covid is rapidly spreading; we are constantly monitoring the situation and are fully prepared to take any necessary steps,” Jain said on Wednesday.He added, “People coming from abroad are the ones who are most affected by the Omicron variant. Until now, no patient is in critical need of oxygen, and the majority of patients have mild symptoms.”Government data also showed that as on Wednesday, 782 patients were admitted to hospitals. However, 551 were either asymptomatic or showed mild symptoms. Twenty-two patients showed severe symptoms and required ventilator support and 140 showed moderate symptoms and required oxygen support. The number also included 69 patients who were suspected to be infected.These numbers underline global trends that the Omicron variant appears to be more transmissible but less virulent, and that the variant of concern (VOC) does not crowd hospitals like the Delta variant did.“Covid-appropriate behaviour needs to be followed at all times and since the infections are minor, there is no need to panic. In the case of healthy adults who are vaccinated, the chances are that they would either be completely asymptomatic or show only mild symptoms,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of community medicine department at the Safdarjung Hospital.

06-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi govt expedites plan to augment Covid beds by 35K||The Delhi government has pushed its Covid beds augmentation plan and cancelled all leaves, except medical, granted to its staff as the daily count of infections almost doubled on Wednesday to hit 10,665, compared to Tuesday’s 5,481, and hospitalisations went up by about 47% in a single day.The services department, in an order issued on Wednesday, cancelled the leaves granted to all officials and staff to ensure there was no manpower shortage to deal with the crisis.As an immediate measure, the Delhi government has planned to escalate its Covid-19 beds to least 35,500, of which about 10,000 would be at its own hospitals and those run by the three municipal corporations, 3,775 beds at the Central government-run hospitals, 14,000 at private facilities and 7,777 at Covid Care Centres. So far, about 10,300 Covid-19 ICU beds have been identified, data compiled by the Delhi government showed.“The Omicron variant is more contagious and going by global trends, children are also likely to get infected by it. Therefore, the government is also arranging about 2,262 paediatric Covid beds and 858 ICU beds for children,” said a senior government official asking not to be named.Delhi government’s health department also issued an order on Tuesday, directing escalation of bed capacity in nine Covid hospitals in the city. The order proposed to increase the beds at the Indira Gandhi Hospital from 1,181 to 1,500, at Lok Nayak and affiliated facilities from 650 to 750, at Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital and affiliated facility from 600 to 750, and at the Burari hospital from 300 to 400.At the Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital, the number of beds was proposed to be increased from 150 to 300 and at the Ambedkar Nagar Hospital, the bed count will be increased from 135 to 200. Apart from this, at Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital, Deep Chand Bandhu Hospital and Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar hospital, the number of beds will to be increased from 100 each to 150.“It seems hospitalisation rates are relatively low. We are watching the situation very closely. In Delhi, the hospitalisation rate is about 3.7% or close to 4%. This is the early input that we have. Compared to this, last year and even in 2020, the typical hospitalisation rate was close to 20%. But please remember, even though the Omicron variant causes a mild infection, if the number of Covid-19 cases increase exponentially, the number of hospitalisations will also increase in proportion. That is why we need to stop this or slow down the pace of this surge as much as possible,” said Dr VK Paul, NITI Aayog member (health) in a press briefing on Wednesday.According to the government’s daily Covid bulletin, tests went up from 65,487 on Tuesday to 89,742 on Wednesday, even as the positivity rate touched 11.88% on Wednesday.Private testing facilities in the city said they have been stretched to their maximum capacity since the second Covid wave, and added that the government agencies should work towards ramping up testing facilities at government hospitals.“To increase capacity we need trained manpower, space, equipment and finances. The testing capacity has been stretched to its maximum limit since the Delta wave. We are running short of manpower, large number of doctors, even as paramedics and lab hands have fallen prey to the virus. We are working at best that we can. The government should also increase the capacity in government hospitals,” said Dr Navin Dang, microbiologist and founder of Dr Dang’s Lab.A second senior government official said that a review of the testing infrastructure is being planned in a day or two. “As of now, no such lag on test results have been reported. But we are monitoring the situation closely. In any case, we are ensuring that all districts and medical centres have adequate stocks of rapid antigen test kits. Besides, we are also checking at all medical stores to ensure Covid home test kits are available in enough quantities for people to buy,” the official said who asked not to be named.As of date, the national capital had 790 metric tonnes of liquid medical oxygen available. In addition, there is also a buffer stock of 442 MT. A total of 89 PSA plants have been commissioned so far in the city, and another nine will be commissioned by the end of this month, according to the government data.About 691 ambulances of which 320 are cabs-turned-ambulances are operational in the city, the data showed. “The response time is less than 15 minutes for around 1,500 calls at present. Each ambulance has an oxygen support system including a children mask and Ambu bag (used to deliver positive pressure ventilation to a person struggling to breathe). All the vendors have been kept on high alert, and they will provide 250 ambulances on a notice of 1-2 days,” the second official said.Driving licence tests to be suspendedTransport minister Kailash Gahlot on Wednesday announced that due to the surge in Covid-19 cases, the state transport department will be suspending all driving tests and learner’s licence tests in Delhi. Fresh appointments wouldn’t be provided and existing appointments would be rescheduled.“Considering rising Covid cases and the recent DDMA guidelines, all appointments for DL & LL tests (fresh & existing) at all RTOs will be suspended from tomorrow (6.1.22). Details for rescheduled dates will be sent to all applicants via SMS. We will extend the validity of existing LLs,” Gahlot tweeted.However, all other online ‘faceless’ services will continue and fitness tests of commercial vehicles would also be provided.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-expedites-plan-to-augment-covid-beds-by-35k-101641413604022.html
06-01-2022||Noida||With 510 fresh Covid cases, Noida sees nearly 4 times jump in daily infections||With 510 fresh coronavirus cases reported on Wednesday, Noida recorded a nearly four times jump in the single-day tally of the infections, as compared to 140 infections reported on Tuesday.The active Covid case tally now stands at 1,110, with 929 cases being added in the first five days of January 2022, said the district health department. In view of the increasing Covid cases, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s event scheduled to take place in Gautam Budh Nagar on Thursday to distribute tablet phones and smartphones among fresher college students has also been cancelled. The district last crossed such a high-mark, with 457 fresh Covid cases reported on May 17 last year, during the peak of the second wave of Covid-19.Gautam Budh Nagar has reported a total of 64,651 cases and 468 fatalities so far. As of now, all active Covid patients in the district are showing mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, are most of them are in home isolation. “16 Covid patients are admitted at the Noida Covid hospital, but none of them is on oxygen support or are in critical condition. Most of them have been isolated because of the mandates, or because they do not have adequate arrangements to isolate themselves at their homes. We are closely monitoring our bed requirements and the severity of the cases, and as of now, there is thankfully no rise in the need for ICU admissions,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate. Noida is the only district which has more than 1,000 active cases and thus the restrictions have been imposed in the district. With over 500 cases, the positivity rate now stands at 8.2%. Within 10 days, the positivity rate in Noida has gone from less than 1% to over 8%. A total of 1,771,293 tests have been conducted in the district so far.He also said that the Noida Covid Hospital’s capacity can be expanded up to 400 beds, and alternate arrangements could be made according to the requirements. With active Covid cases going over the 1,000-mark, Uttar Pradesh has imposed restrictions in Gautam Budh Nagar from Thursday (January 6), which includes a night curfew from 10pm to 6pm. Additionally, gyms, water parks and swimming pools will also remain shut, though no restrictions have been imposed on salons. Cinema halls, restaurants and other food joints will be allowed to operate at 50% capacity; and wedding ceremonies and other events in open areas will also be held at 50% capacity. Physical classes till Class 10 have also been suspended till January 14 this year, and those in the 15-18 age group -- who have taken the Covid jab -- will be given a two days’ holiday. “We will impose these restrictions strictly, and we have not added anything to the state’s order since it is quite comprehensive. However, we hope that the people will also follow self-regulations and refrain from any unnecessary contact. It is best to stay at home as much as possible, and avoid crowding. We have also asked our nigrani samitis, RWAs and AOAs to ensure that the norms are followed in their areas,” said Suhas LY. Meanwhile, there are no restrictions at tourist and religious places such as temples, monuments, zoological parks and sanctuaries, except for ensuring a help desk and visitors using masks and sanitisers mandatorily. IT/ITES firms have been asked to encourage working from home policies for as many employees as possible. The state government has also fixed rates for Covid-19 tests and CT scans for all government and private hospitals. If any establishment is found overcharging, action will be taken against it. A rapid-antigen test will be priced at a maximum of ₹250 and TrueNat test will cost ₹1,250 at all private labs. For the RT-PCR test, home collection by a private lab will cost a maximum of ₹900, samples given at the centres will cost ₹700 and samples collected by a government centre to be sent for testing to a private lab will cost ₹500. Additionally, a 16-slice CT scan will cost a maximum of ₹2,000, 16-64 slice CT scan will cost ₹2,250 and those with over 64 slices will cost ₹2,500.The district has also increased testing from around 4,000 samples last week to 6,000 samples at present. However, daily tests being done are still less than the target of 7,900 set by the state government.

This comprises 8,138,593 men, 6,759,534 women and 1,032 third gender voters.“The increase in the number of third gender voters also demonstrates the positive result of intense efforts made by the electoral machinery towards ensuring an inclusive electoral roll,” Singh said.The electoral rolls is significant this year because the three municipal corporations in the city – North, East and South – are due to go to polls in April.Of the 70 Assembly constituencies in Delhi, Matiala is the largest with 431,337 electors, and Delhi Cantonment is the smallest with 107,734 electors.

06-01-2022||Gurugram||Gurugram namaz row: Land grab case against three Muslims||The Gurugram Police on Wednesday registered an FIR against three people, including Mohammad Adeeb, a former Rajya Sabha member who is leading a 21-member committee to resolve the ongoing namaz issue on alleged charges of disrupting communal harmony and attempt to grab government land in Sector 40.Police said the first information report (FIR) registered at Sector 40 police station under sections 153 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code names Adeeb, Abdul Haseeb Qasmi and Mufti Mohammad Salim Qasmi. All three accused are members of Gurgaon Muslim Council which has been negotiating with the administration over allotment of sites for Friday namaz and land for building mosques.Adeeb denied the allegations and said he was shocked to know about the case registered against him. “Police have registered a case on the complaint of a person who was recently arrested by them for disrupting namaz in Sector 37. He was also arrested twice earlier, but on his complaint a case has been registered. However, despite our repeated complaints, the police has not registered a single case against members of Hindu right-wing outfits. Why the administration and police is being biased? It is unfair,” he said.The other two said they were equally shocked, and added that Adeeb will speak on their behalf. Aman Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (Sadar), said they have registered the case against three persons after they received a complaint from Bharti. “We have already filed cases against Bharti for disrupting namaz and have taken action against other right-wing members. It is a baseless allegation that we are biased and have not taken action against people disrupting namaz,” he said. Kuldeep Singh, station house officer of Sector 40 police station, said Dinesh Bharti, a resident of Friends Colony locality in Gurugram alleged that the accused were trying to grab a land used as a graveyard by the locals. The land was acquired by Huda a few years ago. “A few families have already buried bodies of their ancestors there, but the three people named in the FIR are planning to construct a mosque there following which a Hindu activist approached the police and gave a written complaint,” Singh said. Bharti, president of Bharat Mata Vahini, alleged, “On January 2, I read a report in a Hindi daily that these people announced the construction of a mosque in Sector 40. I, along with other members of the Vahini, spoke with a few residents who said that these people wanted to encroach upon the land. Similarly, they want to grab land between village Kanhai and Jharsa which belongs to Huda and was earmarked for a market.” Bharti has been arrested thrice in the past for disrupting namaz at several sites. He was last arrested from Sector 37 on December 16, and was released on December 23 from Bhondsi jail. “We have not targeted any religion, but we will not let anyone grab and misuse public land. They (accused) are misleading people and trying to disrupt communal harmony,” he alleged. Adeeb said they have complained to police five times in the last three months, including against Bharti, over disruption of namaz every Friday, but no action has been taken. Adeeb approached the Supreme Court in December with a petition to initiate contempt proceedings against the Haryana chief secretary and the state’s director general of police over the Friday namaz row. 
06-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi issues first caste certificate to son based on mother’s credentials||Changing an age-old system, the Delhi government has started issuing caste certificates and other related documents to single mothers. On Tuesday, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia handed over the first caste certificate issued on a mother’s credentials. This was the first time that the son of a single mother belonging to the Scheduled Caste received a caste certificate based on his mother’s caste certificate in Delhi after an eight year struggle, Sisodia said. The deputy CM said the change was made possible due to the intervention of Karol Bagh MLA Vishesh Ravi who followed up the matter with the district administration for over a year, and even raised the matter in the Delhi assembly. “Due to his persistent intervention Geeta Devi’s child received an SC caste certificate based on her caste certificate. Not only Devi, but thousands of single SC/ST mothers like her will benefit from this,” Sisodia said. Previously, SC/ST caste certificates were issued based only on the father’s caste certificate or paternal side documents. Due to this, several single mothers couldn’t get SC/ST caste certificates for their children. “Many times they had to face harassment from the ex-husband/ in-laws to get a caste certificate for their children. Many children of single SC/ST mothers couldn’t get their caste certificate despite growing up in a deprived and vulnerable environment. They couldn’t receive even their basic rights such as reservation and scholarships due to lack of caste certificates,” Ravi said. Devi is one such single mother who had been struggling to get a SC caste certificate for her child for the past eight years. She said her application was rejected multiple times due to lack of her child’s father’s caste certificate. She said she approached Ravi about a year ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-issues-first-caste-certificate-to-son-based-on-mother-s-credentials-101641413124011.html
06-01-2022||Chandigarh||Ludhiana gym owners unhappy over shutdown order||The fitness industry, which has been ravaged by multiple Covid-induced lockdowns over the last two years, has suffered yet another blow after the state ordered the closure of gyms in the wake of the spike in virus cases.Gym owners say business had just started picking up again when the gyms were closed down again – a decision which has brought several establishments to brink of closure. As per the latest orders, gyms in the state (except those being used by sports persons participating in international, and national-level contests) will remain closed till January 15. There are around 1,000 gyms in Punjab, of which 100 are in Ludhiana. Fitness sector unfairly targeted: Gym owners Asserting that the fitness industry was being unfairly targeted, Punjab Gym Welfare Society general secretary Pardeep Appu said, “How will we pay the rent, power bill and salary for the staff if we remain closed? No restrictions have been imposed on political rallies where thousands of people converge, nor has any other sector been closed down. Only the fitness sector has been unfairly targeted. Last year, Varinder Kohli, a city-based gym owner had died by suicide due to financial constraints. Now, the government is pushing gym owners and their staff towards starvation and debt.” Another gym-owner, Jagdish Sra of Model Town Extension, said, “Most gyms are run in rented accommodations. We have to pay a hefty rent and bear fixed charges such power bills. With the gyms closed, there were a lot of disputes between landlords and tenants. The closure of gyms will lead to unemployment and will push the youth towards drugs or other antisocial activities.” The proprietors say they are taking all precautions to prevent the spread of the virus, and are happy to stagger customers’ arrival, if need be. Agitation on the cardsSaying that fitness sector will not take the orders laying down, Gym Ekta Welfare Association director Ramesh Bangar said, “The ruling Congress will have to face the consequences of this lockdown imposed on the fitness industry in the upcoming assembly elections. The sector will be forced to raise an agitation, if gyms are not opened soon. If not at full capacity, the government should allow us to operate at 50% capacity.” Meanwhile, experts said that it was important to close gyms to stop the spread of the virus. Civil surgeon Dr SP Singh said that the restrictions had been imposed in the wake of the spike in cases. “Gyms had to be closed down as people work out in closed environment and use the same machines, which can cause the infection to spread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-gym-owners-unhappy-over-shutdown-order-101641413004093.html
06-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi govt says omicron patients can isolate at home according to revised rules||Delhi government from Wednesday will allow Covid-19 patients infected with the Omicron variant to also isolate at home, following the union health ministry’s new guidelines. Senior Delhi government officials said following the centre’s home isolation guidelines, the home care for Omicron patients will be handled by the same private firm that was roped in by the government during the second wave. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday said according to the health ministry’s new guidelines the number of isolation days has been reduced from 14 to 7 for all newly detected patients that are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. “According to the union health ministry’s guidelines, Covid patients now have to isolate themselves for seven days instead of 14 days. In these seven days, if the patient shows no symptoms for three straight days, then they can be discharged from the home isolation without getting a Covid test done,” Jain said. The new set of guidelines released by the centre said that for a patient to be eligible for home isolation, they should be clinically assigned as a mild or asymptomatic case by the treating medical officer. The caregiver of the patient should ideally be fully vaccinated and be available to provide care on 24x7 basis. A regular communication link between the caregiver and the medical officer is required for the entire duration of the home isolation. Elderly patients (those aged above 60 years) and those patients with co-morbidities such as hypertension, diabetes , heart disease and chronic lung, liver or kidney disease will only be allowed to isolate at home after proper evaluation from the treating medical officer. A senior Delhi government official said on Wednesday that while the Capital will largely follow the Centre’s guidelines, all district magistrates have been asked to handle the existing home isolation cases. All the new isolation cases will be handled by a private healthcare service provider, which was managing the care of home isolation patients in Delhi on behalf of the government in the second wave. “The DMs will handle the existing home isolation cases and the private agency, which was handling the home isolation care for us in the second wave as well, will handle the new isolation cases. They will essentially call the patients every day and take stock of their health, if they need a consultation with a doctor that will be arranged etc,” the official said. On Wednesday, after the centre’s guidelines were issued, all district magistrates were directed to allow home isolation for Omicron cases. Till now, for Omicron cases—the latest Covid-19 variant of concern, which is known to be 5.4 times more infectious than the Delta variant—only institutional isolation was being allowed even for asymptomatic and mild cases. Health experts has underlined the need for revised home isolation policy for Omicron cases so that as the infections continue to surge, needy patients are not denied admissions. Dr JA Jayalal, former president of the Indian Medical Association, said home isolation should be the focus of the governments for the Omicron wave. “The hospital beds should be reserved for severe cases; for patients that require oxygen and ventilator support. Otherwise the healthcare system will collapse,” Dr Jayalal said. Dr Jugal Kishore, head of community medicine department at the Safdarjung Hospital, said that streamlining of hospital beds will be required considering the new Omicron variant is highly infectious. He also said that if a member of your family is tested positive of this new variant, there is no need to panic as the symptoms are usually mild and period for which symptoms are seen among patients is also shorter—around two to three days. “In this variant we are seeing that symptoms are mild and for this we do not need to hospitalise patients. While transmission of this variant is high, there is no need to panic. Even if you happen to contract the infection, this will help your body build better antibodies. Scientists world over are saying that getting a mild infection is a good way to build antibodies,” Dr Kishore said.

06-01-2022||Delhi||As strike continues, SDMC asks new contractors to register themselves||Facing a prolonged strike from contractors’ unions over non-payment of pending dues, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Wednesday decided to allow the registration OF more new contractors in its tendering process.The SDMC contractors’ union has been on strike since November 2021 over the non-payment of dues for the past three years. With municipal elections approaching, the pressure from municipal councillors to showcase development works is growing in the executive wing.On Wednesday, the SDMC spokesperson said that the corporation has allowed the registration of new contractors registered with the central public works department (CPWD), the state public works department and other urban local bodies (ULBs) in the tendering process. “With the decision, contractors registered with CPWD, state PWDs and ULBs are eligible to participate in the e-tendering process of the SDMC. As part of the current system, the SDMC allows only registered and enlisted contractors under various categories in South, North and East Delhi Municipal Corporation to participate in the tendering process,” a senior engineering department official explained.“The step has been taken for better competition and higher quality standards in the tendering process and completion of work. The enlistment rules laid down by SDMC will be applicable to newly registered contractors. The parties will have to be registered on e-tendering website www.etendersgov.in,” the spokesperson said.Leader of the House Inderjeet Sehrawat said that enlisting more contractors will improve the quality of work as more parties will be able to participate in the process. “We have held a meeting with the striking contractors’ unions on Tuesday. Payments worth ₹160 crore have been made this year, and while we are facing an acute financial crunch, we are able to release ₹20-25 crore every month. A solution to the strike will also be found soon,” he added.Netra Kumar Sharma, the head of All SDMC Contractors’ Association said that the expansion of the list is being undertaken to create pressure on the protesting contractors. “We are also being threatened and notices of blacklisting and debarment are being sent to contractors. The corporation has pending dues worth ₹450 crore for the works which have been completed in the last three years. The association has submitted a memorandum to the corporation regarding the threats of debarment being issued by the executive engineers. This is a violation of our basic right to protest. If this does not stop, we will have to move court,” he added.Earlier, HT had reported that municipal councillors have been raising the issues of pending development works over the last two months due to the strikes during the committee and House meetings even as the municipal elections are due in April this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/as-strike-continues-sdmc-asks-new-contractors-to-register-themselves-101641412763959.html

However, on the demand of the non-teaching staff, the new panel, headed by dean research SK Tomar, cleared seven of these cases on Wednesday.The development was confirmed by president of the Panjab University Staff (Non-Teaching) Association (PUSA), Honey Thakur, who attended the meeting. A member of the panel, on condition of anonymity, said, “Seven cases were cleared by the panel during the meeting, while there was some issue with the documentation of two other cases and they will be asked to provide the requisite documents.”After the panel headed by the DUI had deferred the appointments, non-teaching employees had started a protest on December 27 and also held a protest march on Monday.According to sources, even the minutes of the meeting, which was held in December, were not documented, following which a new panel was constituted to take up the matter.

06-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Cyclists’ fatalities last year were highest since 2016||While the total road accident fatalities in Chandigarh in 2021 were lower compared to the pre-Covid years, the number of cyclists dying was the highest since 2016, according to the data compiled by the traffic police.As many as 16 cyclists were killed on city roads last year, the highest since 2016 when there were 28 such deaths, even as the city is working on a Public Bike Sharing (PBS) project to encourage cycling among residents.In 2017, the number of cyclist deaths had lowered to 13, further to 11 in 2018, while 10 cyclists each were killed in the subsequent two years.Talking about the reason behind the spike last year, Kamaljeet Singh Soi, member of National Road Safety Council, said, “Cycling picked up amid the pandemic, especially during the lockdown, which may be behind the increase in fatalities.” Soi added that before encouraging cycling, the administration should ensure the right infrastructure for cyclists, as the average main roads were not safe for them. “Further, cyclists should also adhere to traffic rules and wear helmets to protect themselves from head injury,” he said.Deputy superintendent of police (DSP, Road Safety) Jaswinder Singh said just ensuring the right road infrastructure wasn’t enough, as traffic awareness was also crucial. “Last year, a pedestrian was killed on a Zebra crossing. This reflects the need for increased awareness among commuters regarding the right of way, adhering to lanes, and various road signs and markings,” he added. On traffic police’s initiatives, senior superintendent of police (SSP, Traffic) Manisha Choudhary said, “We have recommended cycle tracks wherever they are missing and are conducting drives for cyclists to encourage the use of dedicated tracks. We have also advised improved visibility of these tracks for all road users. Further, the administration is considering penalising cyclists who don’t use the tracks.”In 2021, the traffic police had also issued over 2,500 challans to commuters for driving on footpaths and cycle tracks.Meanwhile , NP Sharma, chief general manager of Chandigarh Smart City Limited, that launched the PBS project in the city, said, “An awareness campaign for cyclists, to encourage safe riding, is in the works. The administration is also working on a draft cycling policy to further improve safety of cyclists.”As part of the four-phase project, the city will get 5,000 cycles and 617 docking stations, making it the densest cycle-sharing project of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhcyclists-fatalities-last-year-were-highest-since-2016-101641412653917.html

06-01-2022||Chandigarh||Third Covid wave to reach peak by January-end: Report||With Covid again emerging as a threat, a report that the Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH), had submitted to the Punjab health department over a week ago suggests that by Wednesday (January 6), the state will see around 1,000 cases a day. According to the premier health institute’s report, the third wave will reach its peak by January-end and cases will witness a down-trend by the second week of February.CMCH principal Dr Jeyaraj Durai Pandian said the community medicine department had compiled the report. Dr Clarence J Samuel, community medicine department head, at the CMCM said, “Each day, we are now seeing 40% increase in cases. To date, we do not have the genome sequencing report to establish that the current spread is due to the Omicron variant of the virus. However, the speed at which the virus is spreading is enough to suggest that it is Omicron.”Epidemiologist and Punjab’s nodal officer for covid-19 Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said, “Pathankot and Patiala are the worst-hit districts in terms of Covid cases, Ludhiana is also seeing a surge of patients.”Dr Bishav Mohan, a member of the Covid task force, who is with the Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH), said, “In certain cases, patients reach us when the virus has already infected the lungs. As this time, the virus spreads faster, so the danger of organ damage is higher. Technically, this is called cytokine storm.”Dr Samuel also attributes the gap in the period of vaccination to be one of the causes behind the sudden spike in cases. “There are a significant number of people who did not get the second dose of vaccine, expecting that the virus will never return. It is important to get vaccinated as it will mitigate the risk of serious illness. The government is also launching booster doses,” said Dr Samuel.“The opening of schools and colleges had proved to be the driver during the second wave. This time, the prevalence of infection will be more while the percentage of hospitalisation over the previous wave will be low. There will, however, be considerable stress on hospitals. Health authorities must remain alert,” said Dr Pandian.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/third-covid-wave-to-reach-peak-by-january-end-report-101641412645737.html

06-01-2022||Other||Markets in Gurugram finding it tough to implement vax mandate||While the vaccination mandate announced by the government is being implemented in shopping malls and offices, traditional markets like Sadar Bazar and sector markets are finding it difficult to implement the rule.The Haryana government had announced last month that only fully vaccinated persons will be allowed to enter public places such as malls, markets, and government offices from January 1.Market associations said that they have asked individual shopkeepers to check shoppers’ vaccination certificates and also ensure strict masking, their open design and lack of security guards make it difficult for them to enforce discipline. Shopkeepers and market associations want the government to intervene and send teams to take action against violators.Bablu Gupta, president, Sadar Bazar Market Association said that the area was accessible from multiple roads and it was not possible for traders alone to enforce the vaccination rule. “A trader can’t ask for certificates but only request people to follow rules. Our members are asking people to mask up and follow norms, he said, while criticising the government for not consulting the business community while taking such decisions.Traders said that authorities must understand that limiting business hours would hit their bottomlines and many of them were already facing losses due to two years of the pandemic. “We are with authorities in this drive but our viewpoint should also be heard,” said Gupta.In Sector 23, representatives of the market association said that they are depending upon the wisdom of the shop owners and visitors to prevent the spread of Covid-19. “A major eatery in our market has set up a sound system outside the shop and is warning people constantly,” said Gunjan Sharma, general secretary of the Sector 23 market association.Sharma said that there was a need for more enforcement by government authorities as many people were violating the shop closure timings. “We can’t perform the role of police, neither do we have the ability to deploy security guards on our own in the entire market,” he said.Trader bodies also said that the closed design of malls was helpful in securing those areas, but markets spread over acres or along roads needed a different strategy.Rakesh Malik, president, Sector 22 market association, said that their team visited major shops in the market and asked everyone to follow the vaccine mandate and other Covid norms. “We will be keeping a regular watch on our members as Covid-19 is spreading like wildfire in Delhi-NCR,” he said.On Wednesday, Gurugram recorded 1,166 fresh Covid-19 cases, of which 12 were of the Omicron variant.When asked about the enforcement of the vaccine mandate and other Covid-19 norms, the health department on Wednesday said that teams will be delayed in all public places to ensure people don’t violate rules.“Strict action will be taken against individuals and institutions who violate norms. Thursday onwards, incident commanders appointed by the district administration will visit markets, public and private places and ensure strict adherence to norms. All visitors and those employed in an establishment must be vaccinated,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram.

Those who tested positive for the ‘variant of concern’ include a 17-year-old Aggar Nagar resident, who had returned from France on December 27, and two Raikot residents, aged 35 and 38, who had returned from the United Kingdom on December 28. Civil surgeon Dr SP Singh said the foreign returnees had landed at Indira Gandhi International Airport, New Delhi, where they were tested for Covid. The three patients were asked to isolate themselves after they tested positive, and their reports were sent for genome sequencing. “The patients’ condition is stable and they are exhibiting mild symptoms,” he said, adding that the contact tracing procedure had been initiated. 203 new infections, 8 micro-containment zones formed As many as 203 people tested positive for the virus on Wednesday.

Now, the number of active cases in the district stands at 490, of which 468 people are under home isolation. Twenty patients are undergoing treatment at private hospitals, two have been admitted to government health facilities, while one patient is also on the ventilator.To grapple with the sudden spurt in cases, the health department has established eight micro containment zones – Baba Than Singh Chowk, Basant Vihar, Maya Nagar, Pakhowal Road, Madhopur, Shdhwan Bet and Aggar Nagar.Salaries of NHM employee withheldThe salaries of 400 health workers, including National Health Mission (NHM) doctors, nurses and other paramedical staff, who have been protesting for over a month have been withheld. The NHM employees have been demanding regularisation of services. The civil sugeon said the salaries were withheld on the orders of the authorities. The NHM employees’ protest had had crippled the health infrastructure of the district, particularly sampling and vaccination. Earlier, vaccination was carried out at around 50 to 80 centres’, but since the NHM employees went on strike, the number of centres have been reduced to 10 -15 which has caused winding queues at vaccination centres. Similarly, against the 7,000 to 10,000 samples being collected each day earlier, only 2,000 to 2,500 samples are collected in a day now.Clash at vaccination counter, cops deployedWith people thronging vaccination counters, a scuffle took place at the civil surgeon office where people were seen jostling and hackling each other. After the scuffle broke out, vaccination was stopped, and the cops were called. Inoculation, then proceeded under the watchful eyes of the cops. Meanwhile, 538 teenagers were vaccinated in the 15-18 age group at 15 centres in the district on Tuesday. Around, 1,228 minors have been vaccinated over the last three days.Week at a glanceThe new cases have taken the district’s Covid count to 88,247, of which 85,638 people have recovered.Date Cases January 4 103January 3 56January 2 40January 1 37December 31 18December 29 11||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-sees-another-big-covid-spike-three-test-ve-for-omicron-101641412343985.html

One such shelter has already been established at the green belt near Durga Mata Mandir (Jagraon bridge), while talks are underway to set up two more at the railway station and bus stand.The decision has been taken as low footfall is being witnessed at the MC’s four permanent shelters, even though transportation facilities are being provided to ferry the homeless. The temporary shelters are now being set up at places where there is a larger population of homeless people.MC officials stated that the temporary shelter has a capacity of around 30 people and has been made using waterproof material. Mattresses have also been provided. MC staff have been deputed to keep a check on anti-social activities.One of the officials said that there are four permanent night shelters - at Haibowal dairy complex, near Clock tower, Moti Nagar and in Millerganj near Manju cinema, having capacity of over 220 people. However, low footfall is witnessed, as the homeless are reluctant to travel till these locations. Also, they find it convenient to stay at their respective places, as people offer food and blankets to them. Filthy mattresses and unhygienic conditions in and around the shelters are also a reason behind low footfall. MC additional commissioner Aaditya Dachalwal, said,”The temporary shelter has been established near Jagraon bridge and we are in talks with the railway and bus stand authorities for setting up shelters in their respective premises. Zonal Commissioners have also been directed to ensure proper arrangements at the permanent night shelters.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-mc-setting-up-temporary-night-shelters-amid-rise-in-mercury-101641411864379.html

Moreover, many of them face connectivity issues, due to which they miss out on important lectures.”Offering a solution, a few schools have asked students to participate in group studies or jointly attend classes with those having necessary resources. “We already have WhatsApp groups of students and their class teachers. Those who don’t have access to smartphones have been suggested to visit the house of those who do and jointly attend classes. Physical classes are thus always a better option, but closing schools was the need of the hour”, stated the principal of another government school.Meanwhile, schools have prepared the latest schedules for online classes. “Since the final exams are nearing, our target is to take classes of at least three subjects in a day. Our online classes amid the second wave were a great success, since all the teachers jointly worked towards keeping the students in touch with academics. Our teachers have made their schedules and online classes have already resumed,” said Taskim Akhtar, principal of government school on Cemetery Road.The schools have also planned special classes pertaining to a 100-day online campaign initiated by the central government. “Along with the schedule of the mainstream syllabus, the time table for classes related to the Centre’s special reading campaign has also been prepared,” said Florence, principal of GSSS Jamalpur.A teacher said, “After the reading campaign kicked off on January 1, students were supposed to have a library period daily.

At Ambedkar Hospital, eight doctors and two nurses tested positive over the last week.“The situation is very grim and is only expected to get worse from here. A large number of the medics who are getting infected are junior doctors because they are the ones who interact with patients the most. At this juncture, because we will probably have to live with the virus for a while, the government needs to make arrangements to hire more doctors and ensure that they get ample time to quarantine after their Covid duties. Otherwise, the entire healthcare system will collapse,” said a senior doctor at Lok Nayak Hospital, requesting anonymity.As the number of daily coronavirus infections among doctors continued to rise because of the highly infectious Omicron variant, Lady Hardinge Medical College and its affiliated hospitals issued a circular on Tuesday directing that medics exposed to Covid patients will have to continue to work till they produce a positive RT-PCR report.“Anyone who is exposed to a positive case of Sars-CoV-2 will have to continue work with a tightly fitted mask maximum possible social distancing, preferably more than one metre, irrespective of the degree of exposure,” the circular read.It added, “...They should get tested with RT-PCR as soon as any symptoms develop. Depending on their RT-PCR report they may be advised for home isolation (if positive) or continue to work (if negative).”The circular also said that home isolation for five days will be allowed for asymptomatic and mild cases among healthcare professionals in affiliated hospitals, seven days of isolation after discharge will be allowed for moderate infections and 10 days after discharge for severe cases. Severely infected doctors will not be allowed to stay away for more than 17 days.“They have not conducted NEET-PG counselling and now they do not have doctors. They want the existing doctors to work even after contracting the infection. Is this how we treat our frontline professionals?” said a doctor, who did not want to be identified, from one of the affiliated hospitals of Lady Hardinge Medical College.The NEET-PG (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test -Postgraduate) counselling process, based on which doctors were to be assigned hospitals, was delayed due to several reasons, including cases in the Supreme Court over reservations for economically weaker sections. The Supreme Court will be hearing a plea challenging the OBC and EWS quota introduced for NEET counselling or medical college admissions on Thursday.A nurse from the Hindu Rao Hospital, which is run by the north Delhi municipal corporation, said that the hospital was already short of manpower and the existing staff does not get their salaries regularly.“We are risking our lives every day and not even getting remuneration for the work we do. The nursing staff is overworked and over-exposed. There is no salary, let alone overtime pay. How do you expect healthcare workers to fight this battle against Covid, if you are sending us to the frontline with sticks and stones?” said the nurse, requesting anonymity.Medics at private hospitals are also heavily exposed to the infection.“We have ensured strict compliance to PPE (personal protective equipment) and that reduces the risk significantly. We have also sealed the most common areas where people gather because that can easily become a hotspot. We are also ensuring very tight screening,” said Anil Vinayak, group COO (chief operating officer), Fortis Healthcare.The Indian Medical Association on Wednesday said, “...doctors are expected to have 5-10 times more Covid infections as compared to the general public.”The association released a list of suggestions for government and private hospitals to follow, in order to ensure the safety of doctors. The list included—Covid duty of resident doctors should not exceed eight hours a day and seven days, after which they should be quarantined for 10-14 days in an accommodation prescribed by the hospital, there should be a provision of taking care of their mental health, in the event of a Covid duty doctor falling ill hospitals should immediately admit the doctor to the respective hospital, and in case of untimely death, the status of Covid martyr should be given to the deceased doctor and financial assistance should be provided to the family.“These measures are being suggested so that the safety of doctors can be ensured to a great extent, because doctors are the backbone of Indian health services during the pandemic,” IMA said on Wednesday.Dr KK Talwar, former head of the Medical Council of India, who was also heading the Punjab government’s expert group on Covid during the second wave of the pandemic, said the Delhi government should start identifying intern doctors and nurses who can be roped in when the surge begins and there is a shortage of manpower.“We had tried something similar in Punjab during the second wave. Intern doctors and nurses are trained hands. The government needs to make a plan from now to make teams of such interns who can be roped in when the situation becomes worse. Apart from this, doctors from all departments should also be put on Covid care. For instance, during peak surge, other departments such as community medicine or surgery are fairly free, so they can also be put on Covid duty. But this will have to be planned in advance,” Dr Talwar said.

06-01-2022||Mumbai||Anil Deshmukh’s default bail plea untenable: ED||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday filed an affidavit before the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court, opposing the default bail plea of former home minister, Anil Deshmukh.The ED in its affidavit said that Deshmukh’s plea was devoid of merit and liable to be rejected as it was against settled principles of law. The agency maintained that a default bail plea cannot be considered once the charge-sheet and supplementary charge-sheet has been filed within the stipulated period of 60 days from the date of arrest of the concerned accused. Special PMLA judge R N Rokade adjourned the plea to January 11 for hearing both the sides. The ED said that Deshmukh was arrested under section 19 of the PMLA in accordance with the law, under reasonable belief that he was guilty of the offence of money laundering.The ED in its reply said, “It is submitted that the concept of statutory bail/default bail cannot be considered once the charge-sheet and supplementary charge-sheet have been filed. The supplementary prosecution complaint against Deshmukh and 11 others has been filed on December 29, 2021, within a period of 60 days from the date of arrest.”Deshmukh was arrested by the ED in a money laundering case on November 2, 2021 and sought default bail on grounds that the special court did not take cognisance of the ED’s supplementary charge-sheet against him, within a period of 60 days, as stipulated under section 167 of the Criminal Procedure Code.The ED reply read, “It is further submitted that the question of cognisance is not relevant for ascertaining the right of default bail of the accused persons under section 167 (2) of the CrPC since the section is only for completing the investigation within the stipulated time period. It is a well settled law that default bail cannot be granted merely on grounds that cognisance had not yet been taken within the statutory prescribed time period even though the report and the complaint have been filed as per the provisions of the act.”“It is submitted that the stage of cognisance is a stage that occurs after filing of the criminal complaint (charge-sheet). It is submitted that the right to default bail is dependent upon completion of investigation which is a stage that comes before the taking of cognisance,” the ED reply stated.The former Maharashtra home minister on Tuesday moved for default bail through his counsel, advocate Aniket Nikam. He said that he was arrested on November 2 and excluding the date of his first remand, the period of 60 days had since elapsed. He was ready to accept bail bonds and that there was an embargo in continuing his further remand under section 167 of the CrPC. He said that though the ED had filed a charge-sheet against him, the court had not taken cognisance of it, so he should be granted default bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/anil-deshmukh-s-default-bail-plea-untenable-ed-101641411204075.html

An enforcement team, assisted by police, demolished 20 shops and 50 plinths at Baskusla village, they said. RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement) said that an illegal colony was being developed over 10 acres of land, and the plots were being developed to accommodate primarily industrial units. “Notices were given to the colonisers in the past and an FIR was also registered in the matter, but the construction was not stopped. The enforcement team demolished 20 shops that were constructed illegally,” he said. The DTCP officials said that around 50 plinths constructed on the land, boundary walls and a road network were demolished with the support of around 100 personnel from the Gurugram police. “It has been made clear to the violators that if construction is carried out again, then separate FIRs would be registered against each of them,” said Bhath. In a separate development, an enforcement team of the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) on Wednesday carried out a demolition drive in Sector 23 where 30 shops constructed illegally over the authority’s land were demolished. The HSVP officials said that a demolition drive was carried out on the directions of estate officer - 1. Sandeep Lot, junior engineer, HSVP, said that an enforcement team started the demolition drive in the morning and cleared the area of encroachments in about four hours.

06-01-2022||Lucknow||IIT-Kanpur launches project to develop advanced artificial heart||The School of Medical Research and Technology (SMRT) of IIT Kanpur has announced the launch of Hridyantra, a challenge-based programme to develop advanced artificial heart also called Left Ventricular Assist device (LVAD) for patients with end-stage heart failure. A left ventricular assist device (LVAD) or artificial heart is a pump used in patients with end-stage heart failure as a bridge while awaiting a heart transplant or as a destination therapy for those unable to go in for a transplant. It is an implantable battery-operated, mechanical pump, which helps the left ventricle (main pumping chamber of the heart) pump blood to the rest of the body. The programme has been launched in collaboration with nation’s leading hospitals and will be steered by a team of innovators with relevant experience selected under the mentorship of a task force comprising industry experts, the institute said in a press release. “The programme that provides an innovative platform for enterprising problem solvers will not only enrich the health ecosystem of the country, but will also lead the way in interdisciplinary biomedical research and innovation. This is also a step towards realizing the vision of an Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) by supporting indigenous talent with critical R&D support,” said IIT-K director prof Abhay Karandikar. Prof S Ganesh, deputy director of IIT Kanpur and overall in-charge of SMRT said, “The execution of this unique competition based programme will commence with the deployment of a multi-disciplinary team of fellows who will undergo clinical immersion at Narayana Health Hospitals for understanding the clinical nuances associated with cardiac surgery. Upon its completion, the fellows will move to IIT Kanpur to begin the product development process.” The deputy director furthers said so far LVADs have to be imported and are very expensive. The aim of the initiative is to bring down the cost through indigenous technology at the same time not compromise on the quality. The challenge to develop India’s first LVAD system will be open to basic sciences, medical and engineering graduates or graduates of any stream with relevant experience, according to the press note. Selected candidates will receive a fellowship and a milestone based ownership in the commercial entity once the LVAD is successfully commercialized and launched. The project is seed-funded by Padma awardee Sudha Murthy and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). IIT-Kanpur has created a task force that includes engineering faculty members from IIT Kanpur, industry experts from the USA and clinical experts from Narayana Health, All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Delhi (AIIMS Delhi), Apollo, Fortis Healthcare, Medanta, KIMS and UN Mehta Heart Institute to train the selected fellows on developing the artificial heart.

These videos, which protesters and the BJP leaders have uploaded, show that a few party workers also managed to sneak into the PM’s cavalcade. In one of the videos, people are seen raising slogans, both for and against Modi. A video that a Chandigarh-based journalist uploaded on twitter, a group of youngsters is seen chasing the PM’s cavalcade, as the cars took a U-turn and to go back on the flyover. Another video captures the U-turn of the cars itself, with the person shooting the video commentating, “Oh Dekho Mod Ditta Modi, (See, we have forced Modi to turn back).” The same video also shows two youngsters moving on the road under the flyover, just beneath the PM’s car. No policemen, however, is seen standing near or under the flyover to check any activity. Jalandhar BJP leader, Amit Taneja, whose car was struck on the same road in which the PM’s cavalcade was coming back, uploaded a video showing how the PM was being ‘ill-treated’. Modi is visible in his car in the video. Spot where PM was stuck had been problematic since morningThe road where the PM was struck, and finally could not cross, had witnessed high drama since morning, sources said. Punjab Police sources said that just half-an-hour before the PM was to cross, the spot had seen a clash between protesters and BJP workers. In a video that National Commission for Scheduled Castes chairman Vijay Sampla uploaded on his Facebook page, a group of protesters are seen attacking the BJP cavalcade on the same spot. “We had, twice, told the Punjab DGP that our buses had been stuck at the same spot for two hours. Still, the PM’s cavalcade was cleared to cross from the same road,” said BJP state general secretary Dr Subhash Sharma. Other BJP leaders present on the spot, where Modi was stuck, claimed that previously the protesters had been sitting at the toll point near the flyover, but they shifted to the flyover, just a few minutes before the PM’s cavalcade reached.

The purpose of these companies was to run the ambulances through a centralised call centre and also provide manpower including drivers and technical staff.In the petition, it was stated that in case of spread of the pandemic, there may be a requirement of ambulance staff 24*7 and in order to maintain shifts of eight hours there is need of around 27,090 drivers and technical staff each for running 102 and 108 ambulances every day. However, only 6,000 drivers and technicians are hired by the company.Senior advocate RK Ojha assisted by advocates Gaurav Bishan and Sandeep argued, “During the second wave many ambulance drivers got infected and were quarantined for 14 days. If such a situation arises again, the state government and service providers must ensure sufficient staff for proper ambulance service in the state.The petitioner had requested that for each ambulance, at least three drivers and three technical staff be appointed for their regular shift of eight hours as any shift of more than eight hours will overburden drivers and technical staff, increasing the risk of accidents and mishaps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid19-cases-spike-hc-seeks-up-govt-reply-on-pil-on-adequate-ambulance-staff-101641410544060.html
06-01-2022||Mumbai||BMC to private hospitals: Prepare for maximum capacity of beds to treat Covid patients||Mumbai: Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal has directed 142 private hospitals in the city to prepare for the worst-case scenario as Covid-19 cases go up drastically in the city. Chahal has asked all private hospitals to prepare beds anticipating further surge. According to BMC officials, the third wave is expected to last in the city for four to five weeks on the basis of the experience in South Africa, where the Omicron variant was first detected. The civic officials say, as maximum cases are being reported from high-rises, there is a surge in demand for beds at private hospitals. Further, in a circular issued on Wednesday, it was informed that 80% of the total beds and 100% ICU beds shall be kept reserved for COVID-19 patients, as per the rule earlier. The BMC added that no asymptomatic patient without comorbidity be alloted beds in private hospitals, and that discharge period for asymptomatic patients shall be three days, down from the earlier seven days period. The circular also warned hospitals against overcharging patients failing to which action shall be taken under the Epidemic, Act 1897 and Disaster Management Act, 2005. According to BMC data, out of over 35,000 beds in the city, 5,104 are occupied and the bed occupancy rate is 14.4%.Chahal in his message to 142 private hospitals of the city has said, “Considering the fact that approximately 10-12% patients are symptomatic everyday, the requirement of hospital beds is likely to increase sharply now. Since more than 95% cases are being detected from non-slum areas, there is tremendous demand for seeking beds in private hospitals. Patients are reluctant to go to Covid jumbo hospitals and BMC hospitals.”Chahal also informed, “It has come to my notice that symptomatic Covid patients are pointing out the need for Covid beds in private hospitals. Therefore, all private hospitals are hereby directed that they shall immediately spruce up the number of Covid beds to the highest level which existed during the peak of the second wave in 2021.”According to the directions issued by Chahal, all private hospitals shall restore their peak level of Covid beds by January 10 following this BMC staff will start inspecting private hospitals from January 11 2022 onwards to cross check if the number of Covid beds in each private hospital has been restored to its peak level earlier. In the context of the third wave, Chahal in his message further to the private hospitals said, “I wish to place on record that private hospitals have done outstanding work in handling the pandemic in Mumbai since May 2020. Therefore, I humbly request all private hospitals to rise to the occasion and maintain their credibility in the eyes of citizens of Mumbai. I would also like to mention here that the present third wave of Covid in Mumbai may not last for more than 4 - 5 weeks as per experience of South Africa.”Dr Gautam Bhansali of Bombay Hospital who is nodal officer of all private Covid-19 hospitals in the city said, “There are 142 private hospitals in the city who have around 5,000 beds active at the moment. At Bombay Hospital, we have 45 beds empty on Wednesday afternoon. However, in the coming days private hospitals will be able to offer 11,000 active beds for handling COVID-19. Considering the turnaround time is very less, we will be able to discharge every patient within 4-5 days. Hence, bed availability will not be an issue.”Meanwhile, on the third wave lasting for more than 4-5 weeks, Dr Rahul Pandit of Fortis Hospital who is also a member of Maharashtra Covid-19 Task Force said, “We all also feel the same considering that is how the behaviour of viruses has been so far in the past. There is a high chance that the same pattern might be this time.”Further, in a circular issued on Wednesday, it was informed that 80% of the total beds and 100% ICU beds shall be kept reserved for COVID-19 patients, as per the rule earlier. The BMC added that no asymptomatic patient without comorbidity be alloted beds in private hospitals, and that discharge period for asymptomatic patients shall be three days, down from the earlier seven days period.

The Congress has a stronghold in Mohali assembly seat with its MLA Balbir Singh Sidhu, also former Punjab health minister, having a hat-trick of wins under his belt from this seat since 2007. In the Dera Bassi constituency, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has held firm for three decades. The Kharar assembly seat, which was created only in 2012, went to the Congress in the assembly polls that year. In 2017, Kanwar Sandhu of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) emerged as the winner. In the current political scenario, the BJP and the Captain Amarinder Singh faction, are also in the picture and all three seats are expected to see a multi-party contest. Mohali and Kharar assembly seats are under Anandpur Sahib parliamentary constituency; Dera Bassi is in Patiala parliamentary constituency, reports Hillary Victor.MOHALI: ALL CONGRESS FOR PAST THREE POLLSSitting MLA Balbir Singh Sidhu of the Congress has won the seat three times in a row since 2007, and after the party formed the government in 2017, he was awarded a cabinet berth. His clout rose under the then chief minister Amarinder Singh; and he managed to install his brother, Amarjeet Singh Sidhu, as Mohali mayor. When Charanjit Singh Channi became the chief minister, Sidhu was dropped from the state cabinet; later, Channi and Sidhu decided to patch up, and he was even assured of a Congress election ticket from Mohali. AAP has already declared former mayor and real estate baron Kulwant Singh as its candidate from Mohali. The SAD and the BJP are yet to declare their candidates. In municipal corporation elections in 2021, the Congress won 37 of 50 seats; the Azad group, led by former mayor Kulwant Singh, won 11 seats. Both the BJP and the SAD drew a blank. KHARAR: CM’s HOME-TOWN TO SEE HIGH-STAKES BATTLEThe home-town of Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, stakes are high in this semi-urban constituency, which is located on national highway-21. In 2017 polls, Kanwar Sandhu secured victory, with Congress’ Jagmohan Singh Kang finishing second. This time, the AAP has already fielded Punjabi singer Anmol Gagan Mann. Other parties are yet to name their candidates. In the civic body elections, of 27 seats, Congress got 10; SAD got eight, with AAP bagging one and Independents bagging eight. With Channi’s elevation as the CM, the town has become an epicentre of protests, much to the chagrin of commuters. DERA BASSI: SAD STRONGHOLD, BUT CONG TASTED WIN IN 3 CIVIC BODIES Located on the Chandigarh-Delhi national highway, Dera Bassi assembly constituency has always remained a stronghold of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD). Former Punjab cabinet minister Captain Kanwaljit Singh was a strong leader, with the Akalis triumphing over the seat for three decades and more. NK Sharma, sitting SAD MLA won the elections in 2012 and 2017. Congress candidate Deepinder Singh Dhillon finished second in both the elections. The AAP has already declared Kuljeet Singh Randhawa as candidate, with other parties yet to name nominees. In civic body elections in April 2021, the Congress won Dera Bassi, Lalru, and Zirakpur. In Dera Bassi and Lalru, the Congress had tasted victory after a decade; in Zirakpur, it won after two decades. With the BJP also expected to field candidates, the contest will turn multi-cornered.

The panel will assess the awareness of legal proceedings among children alleged to be in conflict with the law, and children in conflict with the law residing in various observation homes across the capital. It will also take stock of the cases of various children and the duration of their stay in the institutions.“The inquiry panel shall inquire into the identification of issues and challenges experienced by such children in securing bail or release (where applicable) and in securing leave, quality and effectiveness of legal services available to them and their experiences with the police,” stated the circular of the inquiry issued by DCPCR on Monday.It also said that the panel would visit observation homes, interact with children, their families, and examine the case files as part of its inquiry. The inquiry report is expected by mid-February 2022.Welcoming the move, experts said that the inquiry could lead to a better understanding of the challenges faced by families and children. “One can put in place lawyers to take up cases of children in conflict with the law but at the same time, it is crucial to ensure that services required under the law are provided to families of such children. An inquiry into the manner in which the services work is welcome,” said Bharti Ali, director of HAQ: Centre for Child Rights, a child rights NGO.Ali said that legal aid for children required that lawyers stay in regular touch with children, keep families updated about the developments in the case, and ensure that the child is not forced to plead guilty. “An inquiry into the way the legal aid system works is happening for the first time. The findings of the inquiry can be used for strengthening the legal aid system,” said Ali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/child-rights-body-sets-up-inquiry-into-legal-challenges-faced-by-kids-in-conflict-with-the-law-101641410244449.html

As per the revised voter list, which was published by the district election office on Wednesday, now the total number of registered voters in the district stands at 46,02,812 whereas in the last assembly elections there were 43,37,119 voters in the district, informed ADM (Administration) Harsh Dev Pandey. Following the campaign carried out under systematic voter’s education and electoral participation (SVEEP) program, under which the work of adding new voters was done continuously, the district now has over 2.65 lakh more voters. A day before the publication of the final list, the administration got the list matched with that of the last election, he added. According to the voter list, the maximum numbers of voters are in the Allahabad West assembly constituency of the district. There are a total 4,54,293 voters in this assembly seat. Women voters are also highest in this assembly constituency with the count standing at 2,06,355 women voters. Even if the electoral rolls of the 2017 assembly elections are matched, Allahabad West seat was at the forefront. This time 37,994 new voters have been added in this assembly seat.Following Allahabad West, Pratappur stands second in terms of adding new voters. In this assembly constituency, 31,272 new voters have been added. Likewise, 31,195 new voters have been added to the list in Handia and 26,718 in Allahabad North assembly constituency.

A maximum of 19,900 new women voters have come forward in Allahabad West assembly constituency. This time the Election Commission had emphasised on increasing the count of women voters. The result of the efforts is visible in the final voter list of Prayagraj district. The difference is evident in terms of even Bara, Phaphamau, Soraon and Pratappur assembly constituencies. If the count of male voters is compared to women voters in these assembly constituencies, then names of around 3,000 to 4,000 new women voters have been added to the voter list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-polls-2022-over-2-65-lakh-new-voters-added-to-list-in-prayagraj-district-101641410065247.html

06-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi Police bust gang involved in hacking online competitive exams; 6 held||The Delhi Police on Wednesday said they had busted an interstate module involved in hacking into various online competitive examination websites, including graduate management admission test (GMAT) and joint entrance examination (JEE), solving candidates’ papers and manipulating their results--for which they charged hefty fees.Six members of the gang, including a fugitive wanted by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Haryana Police, were arrested by the Intelligence Fusion and Strategic Operations (IFSO) unit, following 10-day-long raids across Delhi, Mumbai, Gurugram, and Jaipur. Fifteen laptops and nine mobile phones were seized from the arrested persons, the police said.The arrested men include hackers, solvers, trainers, and coaching institute owners. The investigation so far has revealed that the syndicate was instrumental in helping 18 candidates clear the GMAT exam and around 500 candidates clear other exams over a period of about three years. The gang charged each client between ₹5 lakh and ₹20 lakh.They helped a candidate, who was actually a police decoy, score 780 out of 800 marks in the GMAT, said deputy commissioner of police (IFSO) KPS Malhotra.“The arrested fugitive, Raj Teotia, carried ₹1 lakh reward from Haryana Police for his arrest. He was also wanted by the CBI. Teotia had been part of this syndicate for nearly five years. He had even hired Russian hackers to hack into the examination sites. Three Russians, including a woman, were in touch with him. They had stayed at his Faridabad house between 2019 and 2020. The trio left India after the first lockdown in 2020,” said Malhotra.The other arrested persons were identified as Arshad Dhunna and his brother Salman Dhunna, both from Mumbai, Hemal Shah from Gujarat’s Gandhi Nagar (currently residing in Mumbai), Kunal Goel from Delhi, and Mohit Sharma from Haryana’s Karnal.A few weeks ago, DCP Malhotra said, the IFSO team received information that some syndicate, involved in the unauthorised access of various competition exams, was charging hefty amounts for getting candidates desired scores in reputed online examinations. These syndicates were advertising or claiming to have access to online examinations of GMAT, JEE, Cisco- Associate, Professional, Specialty, IBM-All Exams Comptia - All exams EC Council-CEH, CHFI, and CCISO etc, he said.The team contacted the alleged hackers through a decoy for cracking the GMAT exam. The hackers agreed on the payment of ₹5 lakh and the decoy deposited the token money in their bank account. On the day of the examination (December 26), the suspects asked the candidate to download the software “Ultraviewer” through which they gained remote access to his laptop. They also connected the candidate’s laptop to the solver, who attempted the whole examination and evaded detection from the proctor and other safety measures. The hacker got access to the laptop and disguised the remote access file as the system file. The decoy candidate, a police officer, scored 780 out of 800, which is in the 97th percentile and could have gotten him admission to top MBA colleges worldwide, said DCP Malhotra.After witnessing what the suspects were capable of, the team members, through technical investigation, located and arrested three of the suspects, the Dhunna brothers, and Shah, from Mumbai on January 1. They were primarily involved in striking the deal with the decoy and then connecting the decoy customer with another module of the syndicate, which gained access to his system and solved the exam. Their interrogation led to the arrest of Goel, who had arranged the solver for the trio. Goel led the police to the solver, Mohit Sharma, who was arrested from Gurugram.Police said Goel and Sharma had been active for nearly one and a half years. Sharma revealed that he was lured into the gang by Teotia.Teotia was arrested from Jaipur on January 3, the police said.Police said Arshad, 39, is a BCom graduate and is running a firm involved in CISCO training (CCNA and CCNT) while his 28-year-old brother Salman is a BTech graduate and is a partner in Arshad’s business. Shah,42, managed payment issues and played the role of negotiator with clients. Goel, 39, also runs a similar network training institute in Delhi’s Tilak Nagar. Sharma, 35, is a B.tech graduate who tutors GMAT aspirants. In 2020, he became a solver, they said.DCP Malhotra said that 33-year-old Teotia from Faridabad dropped out of a BA course and started working in private companies. In 2017, he started hacking online examinations in Agra. He started similar labs in Jaipur and Kota with other partners. Later, his examination centre was blacklisted but he opened new ones at different locations.“At one point in time, he got in touch with Russian hackers. He had even gone to Russia to meet hackers in 2018. Russian hackers developed a tool for remotely accessing the online examination system. Teotia disclosed that he and his associates remotely hacked recruitment exams of government organisations as well,” added the DCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-bust-gang-involved-in-hacking-online-competitive-exams-six-held-101641409885168.html
06-01-2022||Mumbai||Malwani module: NIA court accepts guilty pleas, convicts both ISIS recruiters||MUMBAI: A special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court on Wednesday accepted the guilty plea of the two accused booked for radicalising youth from Malwani in Malad to join the banned terror outfit Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and held them guilty under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). The special court has now posted the case for hearing the convicts and their lawyers on the quantum of sentence on Friday.Special NIA judge A T Wankhede on Wednesday accepted the pleas of Rizwan Ahmed, 25, and Mohsin Sayyed, 32, and held them guilty under IPC 120 B for conspiracy, section 18 of UAPA for conspiracy, section 20 of UAPA for being a member of a terrorist organisation, section 38 of UAPA for having committed offences related to membership of a terrorist organisation, and section 39 for offences related to support given to a terrorist organisation. The judge told the accused that he will decide their quantum of sentence after hearing both sides on Friday. The accused face punishment ranging from five years’ imprisonment to a life term.The two accused had pleaded guilty before the court mid-trial in the first week of December. The court had by then already examined 39 of the 220 enlisted prosecution witnesses.Sayyed had submitted in his plea filed before the judge, “I have been lodged in prison since the last six years, and that I was influenced by the videos and propaganda of ISIS which was widely circulated on the internet. Due to the said material, I tried to flee the country to join ISIS. I was unsuccessful after which I was arrested by the police. That while in prison reflecting upon my actions, I realised my mistakes and sincerely regret my errors. I am remorseful and regretful for my acts of omission and for commission of unlawful acts. I have suffered greatly due to my mistake and I wish to rectify it and start a new life and be a better person and take care of my old ailing parents and my family who have also suffered due to my error. I want to return to the mainstream and rehabilitate myself. My conduct in jail was satisfactory and there is nothing adverse against me. I am pleading guilty voluntarily without any pressure, threat, coercion; inducement or undue influence; and that I understand the consequences.”While Rizwan Ahmed had submitted in his plea filed before the judge, “I want to to return to mainstream society and rehabilitate. I am having clean antecedents; even my conduct in jail was satisfactory and there is nothing adverse against me. I am remorseful for the acts alleged against me and undertake not to indulge in similar acts in the future. I was merely involved in propagation of the banned terrorist organisation and was never involved in any type of violence or killings. I may be sentenced for the period already spent in jail by me. I belong to a very poor family and have a wife and two minor children, and aged parents to look after. I have already undergone six years in jail and further punishment would cause great prejudice to my wife, old ailing parents and minor children.”NIA special prosecutor, Prakash Shetty had said that the court should accept the unconditional pleas.Sayyed and Ahmed are both facing trial for instigating youth including Ayaz Sultan, Mohsin Abdul Bashir and Noor Mohammad from Malwani to join the Islamic State in 2015. Maharashtra ATS and later the NIA claimed that Ahmed was the second-in-command of the ISIS wing in India. The agencies said that the duo instigated, intimidated and influenced vulnerable Muslim youth of Malwani (Malad), Mumbai, with a view to compel them to become Fidayeen or leave for Hijart with the ultimate objective of motivating them to join ISIS. The agencies claimed that the youth were hard-core followers of the ISIS ideology and its members, and had conspired with absconding accused persons Ayaz Sultan and Yusuf Al-Hindi to propagate the ideology and propel youth to join ISIS. Sultan had even managed to get a visa in 2015, and gone to Kabul and joined the terrorist outfit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malwani-module-nia-court-accepts-guilty-pleas-convicts-both-isis-recruiters-101641409823856.html
06-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi shivers at season’s lowest max temperature||Delhi witnessed overcast and gloomy conditions on Wednesday. Light rain persisted throughout the day, and maximum temperature fell to 15.7 degrees Celsius, four notches below normal -- the lowest maximum temperature recorded so far this season, according to India Meteorological Department. However, the minimum temperature was recorded at 10.9°C -- four notches above normal.The rain, coupled with low clouds also created a haze that prevailed during the day, keeping visibility between 400 and 1,200 metres, which led to a slight deterioration in air quality, despite the rain, IMD scientists said.Delhi’s air quality index was recorded at 397 (very poor) according to Central Pollution Control Board’s daily 4 pm bulletin, up from Tuesday’s reading of 378 (very poor). Safdarjung, Delhi’s base station for weather data, received 7.3mm of rainfall between 8.30am and 5.30pm on Wednesday, and Palam and Lodhi Road stations recorded 6.1mm and 6mm rain respectively. The IMD, despite the lowest maximum of the season, did not classify it as a ‘cold day’ in Delhi, stating that the criteria for the minimum temperature was not met. The IMD classifies it as a ‘coldwave’ if the minimum temperature is 4.5 degrees below normal, or when it drops to 4 degrees or lower. Similarly, it classifies a ‘cold day’ when the maximum is 4.5 degrees below normal, along with the minimum at 10 degrees or lower. On Wednesday, Delhi’s minimum was 10.9 degrees – four notches above normal. “This is the lowest maximum of the season so far, however, it is not a cold day as the minimum was above 10 degrees. The low clouds and consistent rain did not allow the maximum temperature to cross the 15-16 degree mark and we can expect a similar spell on Saturday, with perhaps an even more rain and wind speed,” said RK Jenamani, scientist at IMD.He said the visibility improved to 1,200 metres by afternoon at Palam, but it remained around 400 to 500 metres at Safdarjung. The IMD has forecast light rain on Thursday as well. But, Jenamani said there were good chances of the sun coming out during the day. “It will be cloudy and we will see some drizzle activity, but the maximum will be around 20 degrees on Thursday. From the night again, it will become overcast and the intensity of rain can increase gradually, peaking on Saturday,” he said.Prior to this, Delhi’s lowest maximum temperature was recorded on December 19, when it fell down to 17.8 degrees Celsius. It was also the season’s only ‘cold day’ so far, with the maximum at the time, five degrees below the normal mark. The air quality is also expected to see an improvement, with wind speeds likely to pick up between January 6 and 8, the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar), a government forecasting body, said.Gufran Beig, founder project director at Safar, said when temperatures are low during winter and there is a drizzle, there are chances of the air becoming heavier, and instead of removing pollutants immediately, it traps local pollutants in the air. “There was a slight haze and the pollutants remained trapped in the air longer. This is possibly why the AQI increased slightly, but an increase in wind speed and the gradual impact of the rain will lead to an improvement in air quality by Thursday,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-shivers-at-season-s-lowest-max-temperature-101641409645058.html
06-01-2022||Mumbai||Cordelia cruise: 139 more Covid positive||Another 139 passengers of the Cordelia cruise ship, currently docked in Mumbai, tested positive for coronavirus on Wednesday, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) reported.This is in addition to the 66, including crew members, who tested positive on MV Empress on January 1, forcing it to return to Mumbai. A total of 205 persons on the ship have now tested positive.The BMC collected 1,827 samples on Tuesday after the ship docked at Green Gate port in South Mumbai’s Ballard Pier. The luxury cruise ship had reached Goa’s Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) on New Year’s eve. On January 1, a crew member developed flu-like symptoms and tested positive on a rapid antigen test, following which 66 members on-board also tested positive for the virus. Of them, six crew members were allowed to disembark in Goa and were admitted to a local hospital in Vasco Da Gama for treatment.Earlier on Wednesday, BMC shifted 41 passengers out of the ship and admitted them to various civic-run isolation centres and hospitals in the city. While most of them had mild symptoms, one passenger was transferred to St. George’s Hospital for treatment.“The patients have been shifted to facilities like the Richardson and Crudas in Byculla, Suncity residency, Pacific residency and other private hotels at their own expenses,” said an official.The remaining 19 were allowed to stay back on the ship as they were largely asymptomatic and were with families. They were isolated inside the ship itself, another senior official confirmed.Shivadas Gurav, assistant municipal commissioner from A-ward (where the ship is anchored) confirmed the development.“Most of the patients that have tested positive are asymptomatic. We have passed the reports to the operator of the cruise which will carry out further health test to check if they have other co-morbidities or not. If a patient is fully asymptomatic and doesn’t have any co-morbidities then he/she will be allowed to go home with a stamp on his hand so that they follow isolation norms and protocols. If anyone is co-morbid and has serious symptoms, then he/she will be transferred for treatment,” said Gurav.All the passengers who tested negative are being allowed to disembark the ship, Gurav said.“The BMC officials present at the port has put a stamp on the hands of the passengers who have tested negative so that they compulsorily follow home quarantine for seven days and the local ward office will track their health status,” he said.The cruise ship with over 2,000 passengers left from Mumbai on December 31 and was meant to stop at Goa, Kochi and Lakshadweep islands before sailing back to Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cordelia-cruise-139-more-covid-positive-101641409643852.html

06-01-2022||Mumbai||Education minister: No physical classes in colleges till Feb 15||Mumbai: The Maharashtra government announced on Wednesday that all physical classes in colleges and universities across the state will be stopped and online classes will start with immediate effect till February 15 on account of the surge in Covid-19 cases. Examinations scheduled in this duration will also be conducted online except in Gondwana, Jalgaon and Nanded universities, as regular power supply is an issue in these districts.“The safety of students, teaching and non-teaching staff is utmost important for us. Following the directives of the chief minister, we have decided to stop physical classes in colleges and universities until February 15. The exams scheduled in this period will also be held online. The decision on the examination scheduled to be conducted post February 15 will be taken in the coming days,” state higher and technical education minister Uday Samant said.The minister held a virtual review meeting with district collectors, divisional commissioners and vice chancellors of various universities to assess the situation on Tuesday. “A virtual meeting with all divisional commissioners, district collectors and vice chancellors was taken to review Covid-19. We discussed the safety of the students, parents, professors and non-teaching staff and a decision will be announced on Wednesday evening,” Samant tweeted after the meeting on January 4.The state will allow 50% of the teaching and non-teaching staff to attend work while the rest will be required to work from home. “This is being done to ensure they are not infected with the virus,” Samant said in a virtual address on social platforms on Wednesday.The decision applies to all universities including deemed, self-financed and private universities.Samant said students between 15 to 18 years as well as teaching and non-teaching staff who are yet to be vaccinated must get their jabs at the earliest. “Those teaching and non-teaching staff who are yet to be vaccinated will be directed to get vaccinated as early as possible. Since the Centre has allowed children between 15-18 years of age, it means colleges and polytechnics need to ensure their first and second year students will be vaccinated. This can be done by holding vaccination camps in consultation with district collectors.” “We want to reopen colleges and varsities after February 15 and want students, parents, teachers and non-teaching staff to cooperate with the state government by following all Covid norms so that third wave can subside at the earliest,” he said.Physical classes for college and university students across the state were restarted on October 20 after being closed for over one-and-a-half years due to the pandemic. The state allowed fully vaccinated students to attend physical classes, but asked colleges to make the provision to broadcast lectures live as well.City colleges welcome moveThe state government’s decision has brought cheer and relief to students as well as colleges, many of who have personally contracted Covid in the last one week.While the official announcement by the state government came only on Wednesday, several colleges had already decided to move their physical classes into online mode amidst rising cases. “We reached out to the education department and enquired if the college principal can take a call to shut college and conduct online classes instead. Immediately, a decision was taken and staff and students were informed that classes, as well as ongoing practical exams, will be conducted online only,” said Hemlata Bagla, principal KC College, Churchgate. Post-Christmas break, all classes starting January 3 have been conducted online and the non-teaching staff has been requested to attend college at 50% attendance only.“Every second person in our college was under the weather and symptoms are so similar to flu, no one was sure what they had. Post-Christmas, we decided to move classes online because only a handful of students were ready to come for physical classes. I’m glad the government took the call to shut college campuses,” said Marie Fernandes, principal of St Andrew’s College Bandra. She herself is currently unwell and is awaiting her test results, she said.In October 2021, state education minister Uday Samant announced the reopening of colleges in hybrid mode and requested colleges to bring back fully vaccinated staff and students for physical classes in a phased manner starting October 20. All MU affiliated colleges had been conducting hybrid classes since then and a handful of institutes have been conducting offline exams for smaller batches.Recently, a handful of colleges came under fire for conducting offline classes as well as exams in January. Students of Mithibai College, Narsee Monjee College as well as the Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies (NMIMS) have been raising objections against the decision of respective college managements for conducting physical exams amidst rising Covid-19 cases among students and staff.“There have been cases where students have caught the virus by attending lectures and despite bringing this to the notice of college authorities, nothing was changing. We are glad the government finally gave clarity in this matter and shut down college campuses,” said the parent of a student of NMIMS.Krutika Desai, principal of Mithibai College in Vile Parle told HT that the institute has been taking all necessary steps to ensure students’ safety. “Every protocol on paper is being followed religiously and despite that, a student tested positive after failing to avoid public functions a day before exams. Our college has been insisting on physical exams for the advantage of students but now with the latest announcement, we might have to opt for postponement of offline exams,” she said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/education-minister-no-physical-classes-in-colleges-till-feb-15-101641409225357.html
06-01-2022||Lucknow||Local SP leader killed in Balrampur district, cops probe political angle||Local Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Feroz Khan alias Pappu, 46, was murdered by masked assailants in Balrampur district late on Tuesday night, police officials said on Wednesday. After attacking him with blunt object, the assailants slit his throat barely 20 meters from his house, police said. Pappu was the former chairman of Tulsipur Nagar Panchayat, a position currently held by his wife, Kahkasha Feroz. Pappu was preparing to contest the assembly elections from Tulsipur constituency and was seeking ticket from the Samajwadi Party. Superintendent of police (SP), Balrampur, Hemant Kutiyal said the assailants struck as Pappu was walking towards the lane of his house on Jarava road. “He had just returned from Lucknow around 11 pm and had begun to walk towards his house around 11 pm after parking his vehicle outside the lane,” Kutiyal said. Kutiyal said some eyewitness told the police that two masked assailants attacked him from behind on the head with some blunt object. He said the assailants slit Pappu’s throat with a sharp weapon, leaving him no chance to pull out his licensed pistol to protect himself. Another police official privy with investigation said scanning of the CCTV footage revealed that five assailants were present outside the lane but only two of them attacked Pappu. The assailants also took away the victim’s licensed pistol after the crime, police said. Police said the locals rushed Pappu to Tulsipur community health centre where he was declared brought dead. Pappu’s aide Musheer informed the police about the incident and later his family members registered an FIR against unidentified people in this connection. Political angle Police feels crime could be linked to Pappu’s political aspirations and his desire to contest the upcoming assembly polls. The police officials said the incident took place when Pappu returned from Lucknow after meeting some people to ensure a assembly ticket for himself from the Samajwadi Party. Role of another politician who too had similar aspirations and felt that Pappu could spoil his political plans is being probed, police said. Police is also looking into personal and professional reasons for the murder too, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/local-sp-leader-killed-in-balrampur-district-cops-probe-political-angle-101641409224046.html
06-01-2022||Chandigarh||Covid: 196 PGIMER doctors, staffers test positive in 10 days||As many as 196 healthcare workers, including doctors, were found positive for Covid-19 at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) in 10 days (from December 26 to January 4), the hospital authorities confirmed on Wednesday.As many as 87 (44%) are doctors, with most of them resident doctors. Also, a total of 90 healthcare workers, including 37 doctors, were found infected on January 4 (Tuesday) alone. For the PGIMER, an institute of national importance, the high positivity rate among staffers is an added worry as it already suffers from inadequate staff to cater to patient load from across the region. Since the pandemic broke out in March 2020, 2,300 health workers of the institute, including doctors, nurses and sanitary staff, have been tested positive, with some getting reinfected in the second surge and in present spike.Dr PVM Lakshmi, professor, Community Medicine and School of Public Health, PGIMER, said: “The healthcare workers, especially doctors and nurses, come in direct contact with hundreds of patients daily. Not only from the Covid-19 ward or emergency ward, but staffers of almost all the departments are found infected.”Dr Lakshmi said that in the peak of the first and second wave of the pandemic, maximum of 50 to 60 healthcare workers were found positive in a single day. “Ninety cases reported on Tuesday is the highest single-day count so far. Some employees were found positive on Wednesday as well, but the data will be compiled on Thursday,” she said.98% +ve staffers double vaccinatedAs per data, 193 healthcare workers of the total 196 infected have taken both doses of the Covid vaccines. Of the remaining three, one has taken only one shot while two have not taken even the first dose yet.“Vaccination is definitely helping in controlling the severity of the infection. None of the 196 infected staffers required hospitalisation. All are isolated either at their homes or institutional isolation centres, with mild symptoms,” said Dr Lakshmi. GMCH, GMSH docs Covid +ve too Meanwhile, seven doctors have tested positive at the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, in the past two days. Also, on Tuesday, two doctors of the Civil Hospital at Sector 22, and two doctors and a clerk of Government Multi Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16, were found positive for Covid-19.During the first and second wave, the cases were increasing gradually, but this time there is a sudden spike. Dr Lakshmi said it is definitely the beginning of the third wave.“But, we cannot say if it is driven by the Omicron variant, as the last genome sequencing reports showed Delta as the dominant variant. To check the variant of concern among the PGIMER staff, we will send some fresh samples for genome sequencing,” she said, adding that Chandigarh and neighbouring states will witness a peak in January, as earlier the cases peaked within 10 days of doctors testing positive in large numbers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-196-pgimer-doctors-staffers-test-positive-in-10-days-101641408928905.html

The BJP councillors are staying at the Circuit House run by the Himachal Pradesh Tourism Department Corporation near Hotel Peterhoff in posh Willy’s Park area of Shimla.The rooms for councillors were booked in the names of different BJP ministers and legislators, it is learnt. According to sources, the Himachal Pradesh Police have deployed tight security around the Circuit House and are keeping a strict vigil over the guests. Most councillors stayed indoors throughout the day amid rain, while a few went out to take a stroll on the empty roads. “Our entire family is here; I cannot divulge the names of those staying here, “ said a BJP councillor, on the condition of anonymity.Chandigarh BJP chief Arun Sood alleged that the AAP was spreading rumours of three BJP councillors coming forward to support the AAP. “It is to show that the party’s flock is together. We want to tell them (AAP) that our councillors cannot be bought,” he said. NUMBER GAMEIn the municipal corporation elections result declared on December 24, the AAP had bagged 14 seats, while the BJP got 12, the Congress eight and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) a lone seat in the 35-member House. With Congress vice-president Devinder Singh Babla along with his councillor wife Harpreet Kaur Babla switching sides to the BJP, the number of saffron party votes has gone up to 14, which includes the vote of Member Parliament and ex-officio member Kirron Kher. With this, both the AAP and BJP have an equal number of votes.On Tuesday, both BJP and AAP had filed nominations for mayoral polls, while the Congress abstained. Anju Katyal is in the fray from the AAP, and the BJP has fielded Sarabjit Kaur Dhillon. To get elected, they would need 19 votes of the total 36. In case the Congress abstains from voting, then 15 votes will be needed, making the lone SAD councillor’s vote the game-changer.However, if the SAD councillor also abstains from voting, then there will be a tie and the mayor will be picked through a draw of lots. SAD councillor Hardeep Singh said: “I am holding a meeting with the party high command on Thursday, and I will vote according to their directions.”Congress spokesperson Rajesh Sharma said that the final decision on voting will be taken by the party along with the councillors on January 7. “All councillors will be returning from Jaipur on that day,” he said. Meanwhile, AAP’s Chandigarh unit president Prem Garg said that if the Congress abstains from voting, it will be an “illegal and immoral” act that is not good for democracy. The AAP has earlier suggested to the Congress to elect mayors from the two parties alternately.

He congratulated the women recruits for completing their training successfully. During his address, the CM said the state government had decided to recruit 20 percent women in the police force soon after coming into power in 2017. He said several experiments had been done on the policing front with the help of women cops which had been appreciated by other states. The CM said only 6000 recruits could be trained in different police training centres across the state before 2017 but now as many as 15428 recruits were being trained at a time. He said as many as 1.28 lakh recruitments had been made in the police force since 2017. After taking salute from the all women parade, the CM inaugurated the new building of Lucknow police commissionerate and the new buildings constructed at 33 other reserve police lines through virtual medium.

06-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi airport’s British-era runway refurbished||Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport operator Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) refurbished a British-era runway, the airport’s first runway built during World War II, and handed it over to Air Traffic Control (ATC) for commercial operations on December 24.Runway 09/27 was the first-ever runway built at the Delhi airport for military purposes and has now been transformed into a modern one for commercial use, authorities said. According to authorities, the newly rehabilitated runway has a design life of 20 years and will be instrumental in handling increased air traffic movement (ATM) once it reaches pre-pandemic level.Delhi airport is India’s biggest and busiest domestic and international airport with three terminals. The newly rehabilitated runway complies with Category-I (CAT-I) Instrument Landing System (ILS), which assists pilots during the landing of an aircraft in low visibility conditions.DIAL undertook the rehabilitation work of Runway 09/27 as part of Delhi airport’s phase expansion project. Post the completion of phase 3A expansion work, an official said, the Delhi airport’s passenger-handling capacity will increase to 100 million passengers per annum (MPPA) and the airside capacity will be enhanced to handle 140 MPPA.“DIAL has successfully completed the rehabilitation work of Runway 09/27 and its taxiways. The British-era runway was rehabilitated for commercial operations as part of DIAL’s effort to enhance the infrastructure and passenger experience at Delhi airport to make it future-ready. The newly rehabilitated runway will have a design life of 20 years, and be instrumental in handling the increased air traffic movement (ATMs) once pre-pandemic level traffic returns to Delhi airport,” said Mr I Prabhakar Rao, deputy managing director of GMR Group, which runs DIAL.DIAL refurbished the 2,816-metre-long and 60-metre-wide runway, including milling down the entire length of the runway’s flexible pavement to a depth of 60mm and overlaying it with Polymer Modified Bitumen (PMB).Polymer modified bitumen (PMB) is bitumen combined with one or more polymer materials that enhance the mechanical properties of the bitumen. PMB can withstand heavy-duty traffic and extreme weather conditions.Runway 09/27, which is on the northern side of Delhi airport, comprises a network of nine taxiways of which six are connecting taxiways and three are rapid exit taxiways (RETs).All the existing lights of the runway and taxiways (around 850) have been upgraded to LED systems for higher efficiency and reliability as a part of the rehabilitation work. DIAL is constructing drains (around 7.3km-long) on both sides of the runway, to cater for the runoff water from the newly rehabilitated runway and its associated taxiways.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-airport-s-british-era-runway-refurbished-101641408443723.html
06-01-2022||Mumbai||City may lose an acre of green space for EVM warehouse||Mumbai The urban development department this week issued a public notice proposing to delete 3,846.08 square meters of land (just under an acre) from the ‘Natural Area’ classification in the Development Plan (2034) for the Greater Mumbai region.They have decided to do this to make way for the construction of a warehouse to store electronic voting machines (EVMs) and voter-verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT) machines. The land parcel in question, located in F/N Ward (Matunga east), is currently being used as a temporary depot by the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation (MMRCL).However, environmentalists have opposed the move on grounds that the land parcel is covered under the Centre’s coastal regulatory zone (CRZ), and that no such development may be permitted there. It has also been pointed out that the said plot was part of a larger green belt in Mumbai’s 1991 Development Plan, which has since been shrunk and taken over for development on all sides. In 20 years that the adjoining lands have all been developed, a natural water body has been paved over to make way for the monorail depot and a terminal for trucks has been developed into multi-storey buildings and the size of the larger green belt area has also been reduced, a comparison of satellite images between 2013 and 2022 shows.In a letter to the deputy director, town planning on Wednesday, environmentalist Zoru Bhatena pointed out that “the said plot abuts a saltwater creek and falls under CRZ-II on the landward side of the High Tide Line and cannot be developed for a govt office nor a Warehouse under the CRZ Regulations.” He explained that since the entire vicinity of this ‘Natural Area’ has been developed rapidly over the last 20 years, it is all the more important to protect and preserve the few open, green spaces that remain.“The DCR 2034 defines a ‘Natural Area’ as an environmentally sensitive zone where buildable development is permissible for uses as notified by the union environment ministry. Since the plot falls under CRZ on the landward side of High Tide Line and is not developable for the purpose of either a warehouse or a government office, the state government is indirectly proposing a type of change in land reservation -- under the Maharashtra Regional Town Planning Act -- that is not in consonance with the law,” said Bhatena, whose letter also states that “a government office/EVM & VVPAT machine warehouse can be built anywhere in Mumbai. There is no requirement that such a warehouse can be built only at this spot.”Environmentalists also pointed out that the MMRCL is duty-bound to restore the area to its natural state after temporary use, as mandated by an undertaking it gave to the Bombay High Court as part of a 2017 writ petition, in which it was stated that “MMRCL will ensure that there is no dimunition/attrition in the extent of tree cover in the areas affected by the Metro construction.” To propose built-up development on the banks of a seawater creek will lead to an increase in the region’s flood risk, and runs counter to the DP 2034’s requirement for flood control measures, environmentalists said about this development.The deputy director, urban development, has not yet responded to HT’s request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/city-may-lose-an-acre-of-green-space-for-evm-warehouse-101641408083676.html
06-01-2022||Other||Modi cancelled rally due to vacant chairs in Ferozepur, claims Ugrahan||Sangrur Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan) burnt the effigies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 16 districts of the state to oppose his visit to Punjab. Later, with Modi going back without visiting Ferozepur, union leaders claimed that Modi cancelled his visit there as chairs were lying vacant at the rally venue. Joginder Singh Ugrahan, state president, BKU Ugrahan, said, “The PM gets information of every second and he was aware that chairs were vacant at the venue. Though the BJP had already planned a limited gathering, there was no impressive crowd in the rally.” The Ugrahan group held a massive rally at the Sangrur grain market, amid rain, and burnt the effigy of the PM opposite the district administration complex.Ugrahan also appealed to farmers to unite ahead of the state assembly elections, as ‘political parties only make promises of freebies’ but he emphasized to change the system.“As we dump crops in grain markets but never get their adequate prices, we also dump our votes to traditional political parties. Political parties, however, do not fulfil promises. A few farmer unions are also trying to get political power in next state assembly elections. Even if BKU (Rajewal) chief Balbir Singh Rajewal becomes the CM, he cannot change the fate of the people of the state. The need of the hour is to change the system,” Ugrahan claimed.“I want to warn that we have won only one battle against the three black laws. We should not become overconfident. We need to save agriculture, education and other sectors. The unity of farmers can free jailed farmers like Manjit Singh Dhaner and save our future,” he added.Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan, state general secretary of the Union, said farmers held massive protests in Punjab to oppose the PM’s visit, because the Centre did not suspend minister of state Ajay Mishra (in Lakhimpuri Kheri case) but is arresting farmers. “The government is also escaping from providing MSP and quashing FIRs registered against farmers in Delhi and other parts of the country,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/modi-cancelled-rally-due-to-vacant-chairs-in-ferozepur-claims-ugrahan-101641408025166.html
06-01-2022||Lucknow||Political parties in Uttar Pradesh gear up for digital campaign amid Covid surge||Political parties in Uttar Pradesh have started preparing to run a digital election campaign after a surge in Covid-19 cases across the state.The move comes in the background of Uttar Pradesh recording 2,038 fresh Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, taking the tally of active cases in the state to 5,158.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Samajwadi Party (SP), the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Congress are strengthening their information technology (IT) infrastructure to hold virtual rallies as well as digital public meetings on various social media platforms, including Twitter, You Tube and Facebook.During its three-day visit to Uttar Pradesh in December, the Election Commission of India had said that all political parties wanted polls on schedule following all the Covid-19 protocols. “While announcing the schedule for the assembly elections, the poll panel will take cognizance of the Covid-19 situation in the poll-bound states. A decision on curtailing big political rallies and holding virtual rallies will be taken according to the Covid-19 graph,” Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sushil Chandra had said. The commission will also take notice of the Allahabad high court’s request to defer the assembly elections in the state as well as to ban rallies and public meetings in view of the growing concerns over the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, he had added. BJP state unit spokesperson Sameer Singh said the party is organising digital and virtual meetings with its workers across the state during the Covid pandemic. Party offices in the 75 districts and 18 divisions up to the booth level in Uttar Pradesh are equipped with devices to conduct virtual meetings, he said, adding that regular feedback is being collected from party workers to strengthen the infrastructure. The BJP rallies and public meetings are available on all the social media platforms. In view of an increase in the Covid-19 cases or ECI’s instructions, the BJP is geared up to hold virtual public meetings, he said. Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) national general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra said in view of the surge in Covid-19 cases, the party delegation had told the ECI to curtail big rallies and road shows organised by the rival political parties in various districts.Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati has plans to launch her party’s election campaign after ECI announces the poll schedule. And, in view of the Covid spike, the BSP will also make preparations for holding digital public meetings, he said. The BSP is using various social media platforms to communicate with party workers and supporters across the state, Mishra said.Samajwadi Party state spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said the party has geared up its information technology infrastructure. Along with party leaders, office bearers and workers, senior party leaders are interacting with the supporters across the state through the digital medium as well as social media. The public meetings and rallies of SP national president Akhilesh Yadav are streamed on various digital mediums, he said. The SP had told ECI to hold the assembly election on time by following the Covid-19 protocol, he further said.UP Congress Committee president Ajay Kumar Lallu said in view of the sudden surge in the Covid-19 cases, the party on Wednesday sent a letter to ECI to direct political parties to hold small, nukkad (street corner) meetings, chaupal and door-to-door campaign. The Congress has started preparations for holding virtual public meetings and the party is interacting with its workers and supporters on all the social media platforms, he said. A political observer, Manoj Kumar Singh, said that after the second wave all the political parties organised an extensive election campaign as well as rallies and road shows across the state since July. The BJP and SP have completed the first and second round of the election campaign. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, as well as BSP national general secretary SC Mishra, have addressed public meetings in various districts. With an increase in Covid-19 cases, the political parties should follow the Covid protocol and focus on digital meetings, he said. 
06-01-2022||Lucknow||SP youth leader’s hoarding creates a flutter in Prayagraj||PRAYAGRAJ: A hoarding put up by a Samajwadi Party leader claiming ‘Fark Saaf Hai– Bhajapa Saaf Hai’ (difference is clear, BJP is gone)i created quite a stir here on Wednesday, ahead of the 2022 UP assembly elections. The SP youth leader installed the hoarding at the busy Subhash Crossing in the heart of the city in an apparent reply to BJP’s much-hyped hoarding with tagline ‘Fark saaf hai’ and also to woo the voters. The hoarding carried two pictures with the title “2017 ke pehle and 2017 ke baad” (before and after 2017) and “Fark saaf Hain—Bhajapa saaf hain” (Difference is clear, BJP is gone) showing former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav distributing laptops among 18 lakh students and ‘2017 ke baad’ showing ‘Hathras ki beti ko kerosene se jalaya ( daughter burnt alive)” and ‘Mahila ka cheerharan (woman disrobed)’. Sandeep Yadav, state vice-president of Samajwadi Yuvjan Sabha who put up the hoarding said, “The BJP has constantly been making attempts to malign the image of SP among people of the state by levelling baseless allegations. I have installed this hoarding to give a befitting reply to the ruling BJP.” He said that the BJP had done nothing for the people of the state and its leaders were fooling them in the name of development. The SP leader also slammed the BJP over its hoardings under the theme of “Fark Saaf Hai” and accused the ruling party of misleading people over development and religion. Countering the charge, BJP leaders said the SP leaders had lost their cool, sensing defeat in the forthcoming assembly polls. Senior BJP leader and state co-convener (Media) Ashish Gupta said, “People of the state are well aware of the deteriorating law and order situation in the state before 2017. Two slogans “Khali plot hamara hai (empty plot is mine)” and “Jis gadi mai laga Sapa ka jhanda, usme baitha hai ek gunda (Vehicles with SP flag carry goons)” were common before the 2017. Meanwhile, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav also tweeted in Hindi that “BJP government has disappointed the people after turning Sangam city as capital of unemployed where once youngsters (aspirants) across the country used to arrive to make preparations to get jobs”. He also referred to Tuesday night’s incident where youths took out a march, claiming youths had made it clear that BJP would be wiped out from the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/sp-youth-leader-s-hoarding-creates-a-fluttter-in-prayagraj-101641407963837.html
06-01-2022||Delhi||Central Vista avenue races to completion ahead of R-Day||New Delhi: With just three weeks left for the Republic Day celebrations, work on the Central Vista, where the parade will be held, is almost complete, said two senior officials with the ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA).The Ministry of Defence and the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) are making arrangements for the parade.“For the Republic Day parade, the construction work is complete. The Rajpath, pathways adjacent to it, lawns, canals, parking lots, etc are ready. Currently, arrangements for the Republic Day parade are being made. The canals have been repaired, but water will be filled later on,” said a senior ministry official who asked not to be named.The redevelopment of the Central Vista Avenue, part of the Centre’s ₹13,500-crore Central Vista redevelopment project, started in February last year. The project was to be completed by December end.While large parts of the ₹608-crore project have been completed ahead of the parade, pedestrian underpasses at Janpath and India Gate and amenity blocks will be completed after January 26, said a second senior ministry official.There are four pedestrian underpasses and eight amenity blocks planned along Rajpath; work on these will be completed after the parade.According to a spokesperson for HCP Design, Planning and Management Private Limited, the consultant of the entire Central Vista redevelopment project, “Only the area required for the Republic Day Parade will be accessible to the public this time. Some facilities, such as the amenity blocks and underpasses, will be completed later.”CPWD officials said a lot of work has been carried out to upgrade the infrastructure and make it pedestrian-friendly.In a written reply, the HCP spokesperson said that the avenue lawns have been refurbished and pathways along Rajpath and across the lawns paved with Lakha Granite. The heritage light poles along Rajpath have been refurbished and new light poles near the lawns and canals have been installed. New signages have been put in place for better directions.According to the HCP spokesperson, “A total of 16 permanent bridges have been constructed over the canals for cross connectivity between the lawns on either side of the canals and to aid VIP and VVIP movement during the parade.”An important part of the revamp was to construct the underground utility ducts. “Provisions for all new underground utilities are in place. For the Republic Day parade, underground utilities will be used for power supply, public announcement systems, Parade Control System, and for Doordarshan, All India Radio and MTNL,” said the HCP spokesperson.When contacted, Shapoorji Pallonji Engineering and Construction, contractor for the Central Vista Avenue redevelopment project, refused to comment.While the road relaying work at Rajpath is complete, CPWD officials said work on nearby arterial roads is being carried out.A senior CPWD official said, “At C-Hexagon near India Gate and Janpath, we have completed the road relaying work and will be starting the work at Mansingh Road next week. We can’t do it now due to the weather.”As per forecasts by the India Meteorological Department, Delhi is expected to receive light rain every day until Sunday, with peak intensity expected on Saturday.According to defence ministry officials, the practice for the parade will start from January 7, though in batches, and full rehearsals will happen as per old schedule. A senior Delhi Traffic police official said, “Rehearsals for the parade will happen on January 17,18, 20 and 21. This followed by full dress rehearsal on January 23. We will make necessary traffic arrangements for it. Routine traffic diversions will be made, like every year, during the parade.”For the parade, CPWD will be installing a new modular multi-tiered seating system (also called bleachers). “Around 30,000-32,000 bleachers will be installed,” said a CPWD official, requesting anonymity.Defence ministry officials quoted above said no decision has been taken on the capacity of audience as of now. “We are regularly monitoring the Covid situation in Delhi. All Covid protocols will be followed during the parade. Social distancing will be ensured, so the capacity may be lower than usual,” the official said.Last month (December 2), in a written response to a question in the Lok Sabha, minister of state at MoHUA Kaushal Kishore said that the physical progress of Central Vista Avenue stands at 60% and the project will be completed by December 2021.Apart from the avenue itself , the construction work of the new Parliament building is going on and is expected to be completed before the winter session this year. The work on the Common Central Secretariat and the Vice-President’s enclave has also started.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/central-vista-avenue-races-to-completion-ahead-of-rday-101641407604257.html

06-01-2022||Lucknow||Jayant, Akhilesh likely to hold meeting on seat sharing for UP polls||Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) chief Chaudhary Jayant Singh and Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav are expected to meet in Lucknow in a day or two to end the purported logjam over seat sharing between the two parties for the UP polls, RLD leaders aware of the developments said.“We guess that Chaudhary Jayant Singh is arriving here on Thursday to have a meeting with SP national president Akhilesh Yadav to finalise the seat sharing between two poll partners for assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh,” a senior RLD leader said here requesting anonymity.The crucial meeting will take place amid speculation about Jayant being somewhat unhappy with his SP counterpart for the latter not agreeing to the seat sharing formula as being put forward by the former. Jayant’s silence over the raids being conducted at the SP leaders’ premises and the premises of traders allegedly close to the SP is also being seen as an indication of all not being well between the two leaders.According to party leaders, Jayant is demanding 40 Jat dominant assembly seats in western UP, while the SP is not ready to commit more than 28-30 seats to it, a situation that has resulted in a stalemate. “The SP is changing its stand every now and then,” another RLD leader said.“It is not only offering a fewer number of seats than what we are demanding, but also insisting that on some of the seats SP candidates contest on the RLD poll symbol. We are obviously not ready for this because of which an announcement on the seat-sharing is getting delayed,” he added.Senior RLD leader and party national general secretary Trilok Tyagi, however, denied reports about there being any major differences over seat-sharing or any other issue between the two parties.“The seat sharing issue will be sorted out by Jayant Chaudhary and Akhilesh Yadav in a day or two,” he claimed. The alliance between the parties, Tyagi claimed, was firm and sought to scotch rumours that the BJP was trying to stop the RLD from going with the SP.Jayant and Akhilesh Yadav last met at the latter’s residence in Lucknow on November 11, 2021 to give a final shape to the alliance.After the meeting, two leaders did put out tweets confirming finalisation of the poll partnership, but the seat-sharing issue still remains unresolved even as the Election Commission is gearing up to declare the poll schedule soon.The RLD, it is said, is trying to get as many seats out of the alliance as possible whereas the SP, the senior partner, is doing the reverse by taking the minimalist position on the seat sharing issue.Jayant is believed to be more confident of his party performing well in western UP this time because of a “favourable” political climate created by the farmers’ agitation that continued for around a year in the region. He also hopes to get sympathy votes due to the death of his father and party founder Chaudhary Ajit Singh in April last year.“This is probably the reason why Jayant has taken a maximalist stand on the seat sharing issue without being pragmatic,” a Samajwadi Party functionary said. 
06-01-2022||Delhi||Phone mechanic held for hoax PCR van robbery call in east Delhi||A 51-year-old TV and mobile phone mechanic was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly making a hoax call about a police patrolling (PCR) van being robbed by four motorcycle-borne men outside Vivek Vihar police station on Monday night, police said, adding that no such carjacking had taken place anywhere in the city.Police said the suspect was arrested from his home after a technical investigation.Police identified the arrested man as Anil Jain, a resident of Gandhi Nagar in east Delhi. He has been booked for giving false information under Indian Penal Code’s Section 182, said deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram.On Monday around 10.45pm, Jain called the police control room and claimed that four men on two motorcycles snatched a mobile phone and a patrolling van from one sub-inspector Bane Singh outside the Vivek Vihar police station. Jain also claimed that the registration number plates of the two motocycles of the robbers were covered with mud.Two recordings of the calls began circulating on social media from Tuesday morning. When senior police officers, including the DCP, were contacted, they clarified that no such incident had taken place and they were not aware of any such call either. However, on Wednesday, the city police confirmed receiving a hoax call at the police control room and registering a case.Although Jain switched off his mobile number, the investigating team collected its call records from the concerned service provider and analysed it and traced Jain. “We interrogated Jain and arrested him after confirming that he made the hoax call. His voice was identical to that of the person who made that fake call,” said DCP Sathiyasundaram.“Jain claimed that he made the hoax call in an inebriated condition. He used the name of his brother-in-law, Vimal Jain, while making that call. When our police personnel called him back on the mobile number and began enquiring about the incident, Jain switched off his cellphone,” said DCP Sathiyasundaram.
06-01-2022||Pune||Pune police gets one day custody of Kalicharan Maharaj||PUNE The Pune police were granted one day’s police custody of a self-proclaimed godman on Wednesday, accused of making threatening and religious inflammatory statements at an event organised by a Hindutva organisation in Pune on December 19, 2021. The police had sought police custody of seven days for various reasons, including to record a voice sample of the arrested man. The man was identified as Kalicharan alias Abhijeet Dhanajay Saraag, 43, a resident of Shivajinagar in Akola. He was brought to Pune by the police on Wednesday morning from Raipur, Chattirsgarh, where he was booked for making offensive remarks about Mahatma Gandhi. The decision was granted by Judicial Magistrate First Class MA Shaikh in the presence of public prosecutor Yogesh Kadam and defence lawyer Advocate Amol Dange. Khadak police station officials and the judge ensured that journalists were not allowed inside an open courtroom. The police formed a chain outside the court to prevent reporters from entering. Kalicharan was speaking at an event organised by the Samasta Hindu Aghadi, led by Milind Ramakant Ekbote, who is also facing charges in at least two cases of causing violence in Bhima Koregaon in 2018. On December 19, between 7pm and 10pm, the godman spoke at the event held at Natubaug ground in Shukrawar peth. The godman made comments against members of the Muslim and Christian communities. “The arguments advanced by he defence were that the arrest is illegal as procedure of 41(a) of CrPC was not followed as per the Arnesh Kumar guidelines as punishment is less than 7 years. The police are duty-bound to issue notice and then arrest a person if there was possibility of tampering of evidence. As per remand report nothing is to be recovered at the instance from the accused. This is a politically motivated FIR. The FIR is filed after delay of 10 days. In this matter, notice was issued to all accused under Section 149 of CrPC and police officials were present on the spot and they could have arrested the accused under Section 151 of CrPC. However, they did not act on the spot as no such words have been uttered so the delay was to register a preplanned FIR,” said Advocate Dange. However, video recordings of the speech are available with the police for the event that was themed “Shivpratapdin - celebration of Afzalkhan’s assassination”. A complaint has been lodged by a police official. Along with Ekbote and Kalicharan, the others accused in the case include Mohanrao Shete, Deepak Babulal Nagpure, Captain (retired) Digendra Kumar. They have been booked in a case registered under Sections 295(a) (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class), 298 (uttering any word or making any sound etc with intention to wound religious feelings), 505(2) (statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred of ill-will between classes) and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code at Khadak police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-police-gets-one-day-custody-of-kalicharan-maharaj-101641398306367.html
06-01-2022||Chandigarh||Heavy snowfall in Himachal hits road traffic, power supply||Heavy snowfall in the higher reaches of Himachal Pradesh since Tuesday night has brought life to a standstill in the remote areas of tribal Kinnaur, Lahaul and Spiti, Chamba, Kullu and Shimla districts.A total of 248 roads, including two national highways, a state highway and the Rohtang tunnel, have been blocked for traffic due to inclement weather. Maximum 137 roads are closed in Lahaul and Spiti district. Atal Tunnel at Rohtang Pass has been closed after a foot of snow was recorded at the North Portal, Sudesh Kumar Mokhta, the director of state disaster management authority, said. The 3,978m Rohtang Pass has got more than four feet of snow. Multhan in Kangra, Prasher Lake in Mandi and Rakchham in Kinnaur also got 1ft of snow each that is still continuing. Sangla got 10 inches of snow, while Chanshal, Kalpa, Gulaba and Shikari got 8 inches each. Solang near Manali got 7 inches of snow, Jalori Jot 6 inches, Koksar and Sissu 5 inches each, Dodra Kwar 3 inches and Pangi valley 2.5 inches. Triund, the trekkers’ destination above Dharamshala, also received snow, while the Dhauladhar Range wore a white mantle. Shimla SP Monika Bhutungru said the road from Kufri to Fagu has been completely blocked due to snowfall. People travelling between Shimla and Theog may use the Bhekhalti-Mashobra route. We suggest to avoid unnecessary travel during night time, she said. More than 160 transformers, including nearly 66 in Chamba, were hit due to the snowfall, causing the suspension of power supply in the remote areas. At least 39 water supply schemes, 32 in Chamba alone, have also been affected. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur has urged tourists and local residents to avoid travelling to snowbound areas. He said the departments concerned are working to restore water and power supply besides reopening roads in the affected areas at earliest. Rain in Manali and Dalhousie; Keylong coldest in state The middle and lower hills experienced moderate to heavy rainfall. Dalhousie got 41mm of rainfall, Manali 40mm, Bhunter 32mm, Palampur 24.6mm, Dharamshala and Chamba 20mm each, Mandi 12.2mm and Shimla 11.6mm. The fresh spell of snow has led to maximum temperatures falling by several degrees. The minimum temperatures were 3-4 degrees above normal. Keylong was the coldest place in the state with a night temperature of minus 3.1°C followed by minus 1°C in Kufri. Kalpa recorded a low of minus 0.6°C, while the minimum temperature in Manali was 1.2 °C and Dalhousie 1.3°C. The meteorological department has issued a ‘yellow’ alert for heavy rain and snowfall over the weekend. “Heavy snowfall is likely in the districts of Chamba, Kangra, Kullu, Lahaul and Spiti and Kinnaur and heavy rainfall is expected in Una, Hamirpur and Bilaspur on January 8 and 9,” said Shimla MeT centre director Surender Paul. It may cause disruptions of essential services like water and electricity supply and communications, he said, adding the low visibility conditions would prevail and there is also possibility of landslides in the hilly regions. 
06-01-2022||World||UK identifies rare case of avian flu in a human||Health officials in Britain said Thursday they had identified a rare case of avian flu in a person, as the country battles its largest-ever outbreak of the virus among birds.Transmission of avian flu from bird to human is very rare and has previously only occurred a small number of times in Britain, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said.The infected individual, in southwest England, was said to be "well" and was self-isolating, it added."The person acquired the infection from very close, regular contact with a large number of infected birds, which they kept in and around their home over a prolonged period of time," the UKHSA said in a statement."All contacts of the individual, including those who visited the premises, have been traced and there is no evidence of onward spread of the infection to anyone else."The agency noted the risk to the wider public from avian flu remained "very low" but cautioned people not to touch sick or dead birds.Britain culled around half a million birds in 2021 as it grappled with what Environment Secretary George Eustice has called the country's "largest-ever" avian flu outbreak.Alongside culling, the government rolled out new rules in December requiring keepers to ensure all captive birds are indoors and follow strict biosecurity measures to try to stem the spread of the virus.However, officials have voiced concerns that wild birds migrating from mainland Europe during the winter months may be carrying the disease.Geese, ducks and swans are among the wild bird species known to have been affected, while a number of birds of prey are also confirmed to have died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-identifies-rare-case-of-avian-flu-in-a-human-101641492692856.html
06-01-2022||World||Clashes in largest Kazakh city, Moscow-led troops arrive||Bursts of gunfire echoed through the streets of Kazakhstan's largest city on Thursday as Moscow-led troops arrived to help quell mass unrest that left dozens dead and hundreds detained.Fighting in Almaty continued a day after protesters stormed several government buildings, with an AFP correspondent hearing regular eruptions of gunfire from the direction of a central square.Local media reports said security forces had cleared demonstrators from the square and other key government buildings, but there were also reports of gunfire elsewhere in the city.The first units of Russian forces from a Moscow-led peacekeeping force had meanwhile arrived in Kazakhstan, the Russian defence ministry said, after the Kazakh government appealed for help.Long seen as one the most stable of the ex-Soviet republics of Central Asia, energy-rich Kazakhstan is facing its biggest crisis in decades after days of protests over rising fuel prices escalated into widespread unrest.Armed protesters have fought running battles with government forces, with officials saying 748 security officers have been wounded and 18 killed, including two who had their heads cut off.'So terrifying'Burnt-out vehicles littered Almaty's streets, several government buildings were in ruins and bullet casings were strewn over the grounds of the presidential residence, which was stormed and looted by protesters on Wednesday."I didn't know our people could be so terrifying," Samal, a 29-year-old nursery-school teacher, told AFP near the residence.Under increasing pressure, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev appealed overnight to the Russia-dominated Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), which includes five other ex-Soviet states, to combat what he called "terrorist groups" that had "received extensive training abroad".Within hours the alliance said the first troops had been sent -- including Russian paratroopers and military units from the other CSTO members -- in its first major joint action since its founding in 1999."Peacekeeping forces... were sent to the Republic of Kazakhstan for a limited time to stabilise and normalise the situation," the CSTO said in a statement, without specifying the number of troops involved.The Russian foreign ministry said it saw the unrest as "an attempt inspired from outside to undermine the security and integrity" of Kazakhstan.In the worst reported violence so far, police said dozens of people were "eliminated" in overnight battles with security forces at government buildings in Almaty.Over 2,000 detainedThe interior ministry said police had "moved forward to clear the streets" and detained about 2,300 people so far.Officials said more than 1,000 people had been wounded in the unrest, with nearly 400 admitted to hospital and 62 in intensive care.Protests spread across the nation of 19 million this week in outrage over a New Year increase in prices for liquid petroleum gas (LPG), which is widely used to fuel cars in the west of the country.Thousands took to the streets in Almaty and in the western province of Mangystau, saying the price rise was unfair given oil and gas exporter Kazakhstan's vast energy reserves.The full picture of the chaos was unclear, with widespread disruptions to communications including mobile phone signals, the blocking of online messengers and hours-long internet shutdowns.The protests are the biggest threat so far to the regime established by Kazakhstan's founding president Nursultan Nazarbayev, who stepped down in 2019 and hand-picked Tokayev as his successor.Tokayev tried to head off further unrest by announcing the resignation of the cabinet early on Wednesday, but protests continued.New fuel price limitsAs protests escalated, authorities declared a nationwide state of emergency until January 19, with curfews, restrictions on movements and bans on mass gatherings.The government made another concession on Thursday, setting new fuel price limits for six months, saying "urgent" measures were needed "to stabilise the socio-economic situation".Much of the anger appeared directed at Nazarbayev, who is 81 and had ruled Kazakhstan since 1989 before handing power to Tokayev.Many protesters shouted "Old Man Out!" in reference to Nazarbayev and several witnesses confirmed to AFP that a statue of the ex-leader had been torn down in the southern city of Taldykorgan.Western countries have called for restraint on all sides, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken calling his Kazakh counterpart to urge a "peaceful, rights-respecting resolution to the crisis".Kazakhstan, which tolerates little real opposition, is a key ally of Russia but has also sought good ties with the West and China.A major oil and gas exporter and one of the world's biggest producers of uranium, the country has signed lucrative deals with international energy companies.Critics say widespread corruption has meant little of that money reaching ordinary people, with average monthly salaries in the country of less than $600 (530 euros).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/clashes-in-largest-kazakh-city-moscow-led-troops-arrive-101641492049767.html
06-01-2022||World||One year on, Trump backers recall 'incredible' Capitol siege||One year ago to the day, they descended upon Washington in the thousands, gathering to protest the result of a presidential election they claim was rigged.The US Capitol came under attack, leaving the country wounded.As President Joe Biden delivered a speech assailing Donald Trump for the mayhem, people who participated in the events of January 6, 2021 gave AFP their accounts of a day that shocked the world.Republican recalls 'euphoria'"January 6 was incredible," says Samson Racioppi, a 40-year-old Republican Party stalwart who rented several buses to drive people to Washington from his home state of Massachusetts.The day began with outgoing Republican president Trump addressing a sea of supporters waving "Trump 2020" flags in the biting cold near the White House.Trump fired up the crowd with a defiant speech, repeating his false claims that he won the November election over Democrat Joe Biden."I remember the actual feeling of that day of euphoria," said Jim Wood, a military veteran who came to Washington from New Hampshire. "Seeing all the people."Before Trump finished speaking, Wood, who is in his 60s, headed towards the Capitol, where Congress was certifying Biden's election victory.Thousands of others did the same and an enormous crowd quickly assembled around the brilliant white dome of the Capitol building.'Let's go!' as crowd surges"Then all of a sudden, you heard, I guess, from my remembrance, screams of, you know, 'Let's go, let's go, let's go,'" said Glen Montfalcone, who also came to Washington from Massachusetts."And then kind of anarchy started happening," Montfalcone added."People were pushing, pushing, pushing. 'Go go, forge forward, forge forward,'" he said. "And so we all did, we all forged forward and just started entering into the area, and then up the stairs."All three men insist they did not enter the Capitol itself. They could be risking prison if they admitted they did.Hundreds did swarm the building, however, including a tattooed, half-naked man wearing horns and a fur hat.One protester was shot dead by police.The world watched live, aghast, as the citadel of American democracy came under assault.Wood said the televised images he saw broadcast the next day at breakfast were "demonizing" and that the vast majority of the protesters remained outside the Capitol.During the next few months, two competing narratives would arise.Trump supporters claim it was a peaceful protest against a "stolen" election.Police officers who fought with the mob, Democratic lawmakers and even some Republicans called it "terrorism."FBI at the doorIn the wake of January 6, law enforcement launched a nationwide sweep for participants in the assault on the Capitol.Montfalcone has had FBI agents turn up at his door. Several friends have been arrested.At his law school, students unsuccessfully attempted to have Racioppi thrown out.In Washington, a House of Representatives committee is investigating what has been described as an insurrection or a coup attempt.The January 6 participants reject this characterization of the day.On the contrary, Racioppi says proudly, "this is something I'm going to tell my grandkids about."He remains convinced, like many Republicans, that the 2020 election was "stolen" from Trump, despite the absence of any credible evidence this occurred.Likewise Wood, an Air Force mechanic who spent years working on B-52 bombers, insists the election was fraudulent.Of Biden, he says, "I don't consider him the president of the United States."Racioppi said January 6 was just a skirmish in an ongoing conflict."We're looking at it as if it's a war, right?" he said. "We're going to cause as much political damage to the left and the people who support tyranny as possible."Would he do it again?"Of course I would do it again," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-year-on-trump-backers-recall-incredible-capitol-siege-101641491549261.html
06-01-2022||World||2 killed in Sudan as thousands protest against military||Two Sudanese protesters were killed on Thursday while taking part in the latest mass demonstrations demanding a transition to civilian rule after a coup, medics said.One of the slain demonstrators took a "live bullet to the head by the putschist forces as he took part in demonstrations" in the capital's twin city of Omdurman, said the Central Committee of Sudan Doctors, part of the pro-democracy movement.The second, who also has not been identified, "was hit by a live bullet to the pelvis" during the Omdurman protests, the medics added.The latest killings bring to 59 the overall death toll since the October 25 military coup, the committee added.Their deaths came a day after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken appealed on Twitter for Sudanese security forces to "cease using lethal force against demonstrators & commit to an independent investigation."Singing, beating drums, and holding up posters of others killed in demonstrations since the military takeover, protesters in the capital Khartoum shouted defiant slogans against the army.Many protesters in Khartoum were seen wounded and struggling with breathing difficulties due to the heavy firing of tear gas, according to the witnesses.The military takeover -- one of several in Sudan's post-independence history -- has been accompanied by a security forces crackdown that has also wounded hundreds.Demonstrators -- who have at times marched in the tens of thousands -- remain undeterred."We will not stop until we get our country back," shouted one protester, Samar al-Tayeb, 22.Other demonstrators set fire to tyres to create burning barricades on the streets.Crowds were marching towards the presidential palace in Khartoum when security forces fired volleys of tear gas that formed thick and choking clouds, witnesses said.Protesters hurled back stones at security forces, they added."Our marches will continue until we restore our revolution and our civilian government, even if martyrs fall among us," said Mojataba Hussein, a 23-year-old protester.Call for dialogueThe power grab by military chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan more than two months ago dismantled a precarious power-sharing arrangement between the military and civilians established in the wake of the April 2019 ouster of longtime autocrat Omar al-Bashir.The protests on Thursday came days after prime minister Abdalla Hamdok resigned, leaving the military fully in charge. Hamdok had been held under house arrest for weeks following the coup, before being reinstated in a November 21 deal after international pressure.The protest movement called the November pact a "betrayal" for providing what they said was a cloak of legitimacy for Burhan's coup, and kept up its rallies.When Hamdok stepped down on Sunday, he said Sudan was at a "dangerous crossroads threatening its very survival".Western nations say the solution is dialogue, a point made in a tweet Wednesday by Blinken.He said: "To overcome the current crisis in Sudan, we and our partners strongly urge stakeholders to commit to an immediate, Sudanese-led, and internationally facilitated dialogue."Protests in several citiesDemonstrations on Thursday again took place in other cities as well as the capital, witnesses said."The authority is that of the people," protesters chanted in Wad Madani, demanding soldiers "go back to the barracks".In Atbara, protesters called on Burhan to "hand over the country's keys and leave," witnesses said.Crowds in the central state of North Kordofan chanted "No, no to military rule" while waving and draped in the national flag.Others also took to the streets in Central and South Darfur states, according to witnesses.On Tuesday the United States, European Union, Britain and Norway warned the military against naming their own successor to Hamdok, saying that without involvement of "a broad range of civilian stakeholders" such a move could plunge the country into conflict.On Thursday, state-media quoted Burhan's media adviser Taher Abouhaga as saying, in an apparent reference to the absence of a government: "The void must be filled in the least possible time."Burhan last month issued a decree allowing security forces to arrest individuals "over crimes related to the state of emergency", effectively banning street protests.But the rallies continue.Web monitoring group NetBlocks said the mobile internet was cut from mid-morning Thursday, and wider internet access and phone lines were also disrupted, a tactic repeatedly used in an attempt to disrupt activists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-killed-in-sudan-as-thousands-protest-against-military-101641491339607.html
06-01-2022||World||Dozens of protesters, 12 police personnel dead in Kazakhstan protests||Security forces killed dozens of protesters and 12 police died during extraordinarily violent demonstrations in Kazakhstan that saw government buildings stormed and set ablaze, authorities said Thursday. One police officer was found beheaded in escalating unrest that poses a growing challenge to authoritarian rule in the Central Asian nation.Despite the severe response by authorities, protesters took the streets again in the country’s largest city, Almaty, a day after breaking into the presidential residence and the mayor’s office there. Police were also out in force, including in the capital of Nur-Sultan, which was reportedly quiet, and Russian troops were on their way.Video from the Russian news agency Tass showed police firing intensely on a street near Republic Square, where demonstrators had gathered, though they could not be seen in the footage. Late Thursday, Tass said protesters had been swept from the square but that sporadic gunfire in the area continued.Earlier, Russia’s Sputnik news service reported that shots were fired as police surrounded one group of about 200 protesters in the city.In the unrest on Wednesday, “dozens of attackers were liquidated,” police spokeswoman Saltanat Azirbek told state news channel Khabar-24, using a term common to describe the killing of people thought to be extremists by law enforcement. Twelve police officers were killed and 353 injured, according to city officials cited by the channel. The Interior Ministry said 2,000 people have been arrested.Tens of thousands of people, some reportedly carrying clubs and shields, have taken to the streets in recent days in the worst protests the country has seen since gaining independence from the Soviet Union three decades ago. Although the demonstrations began over a near-doubling of prices for a type of vehicle fuel, their size and rapid spread suggest they reflect wider discontent in the country that has been under the rule of the same party since independence.The government on Thursday announced a 180-day price cap on vehicle fuel and a moratorium on raising utility rates — an attempt to address the economic issues that catalyzed the protests, though it was unclear what, if any, effect the moves would have.The president has vacillated between attempts at mollifying the protesters, including accepting the resignation of his government, and promising harsh measures to quell the unrest, which he blamed on “terrorist bands.”Worries that a broader crackdown could be on the horizon grew after he called on a Russia-led military alliance for help. Severe interruptions to internet service and cellphone service also raised concern and made it difficult — sometimes impossible — for news of what was happening inside Kazakhstan to get out.The airports in Almaty and one other city have also been shut.The military alliance, the Collective Security Treaty Organization, said early Thursday that it would send peacekeeper troops to Kazakhstan at Tokayev's request.The operation is the first military action by the CSTO — an indication that Kazakhstan's neighbors, particularly Russia, are concerned that the unrest could spread.Russia and Kazakhstan share close relations and a 7600-kilometer (4700-mile) border, much of it along open steppes. Russia's manned space-launch facility, the Baikonur Cosmodrome, is in Kazakhstan.The size and duties of the force have not been specified. Russia has already begun sending forces, according to the CSTO, which also includes Kazakhstan, Armenia, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. But Kyrgyzstan's presidential spokesman, Erbol Sutanbaev, said his country's contingent must be approved by parliament and said that the troops would not take actions involving demonstrators.It was not immediately clear if any of the Russian forces had arrived in Kazakhstan.The unrest was also causing worry elsewhere. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke by telephone with his Kazakh counterpart, Mukhtar Tileuberdi, and “reiterated the United States’ full support for Kazakhstan’s constitutional institutions and media freedom and advocated for a peaceful, rights-respecting resolution to the crisis,” said State Department spokesman Ned Price.France condemned the violence and called for “de-escalation and responsibility” from all parties involved, including the CSTO.China is also likely to be concerned. Kazakhstan shares a 1,800 kilometer (1,000 mile)-long border with China’s Xinjiang region, where Beijing has launched an all-out campaign to quash separatist sentiment among Muslim minority groups who share cultural, religious and linguistic links with the peoples of Central Asia.However, at a daily briefing Thursday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin appeared to dismiss any possibility of China becoming involved in the current crisis, in line with Beijing strict official non-interventionist policy.“What is happening in Kazakhstan is the country’s internal affair (and) we believe that the Kazakh authorities can solve the issue properly,” he said.Tokayev has imposed a two-week state of emergency for the whole country, including an overnight curfew and a ban on religious services. That is a blow to Kazakhstan's sizable Orthodox Christian population who observe Christmas on Friday.Of the five Central Asian republics that gained independence following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan is by far the largest and the wealthiest, spanning a territory the size of Western Europe and sitting atop colossal reserves of oil, natural gas, uranium and precious metals. In addition to its long border with Russia, it also shares one with China, and its oil and mineral wealth make it strategically and economically important.But despite Kazakhstan’s natural riches and a solid middle class, financial hardship is widespread, and discontent over poor living conditions is strong in some parts of the country. Many Kazakhs also chafe at the dominance of the ruling party, which holds more than 80% of the seats in parliament.The protests appear to have no identifiable leader or demands. Much of the anger displayed in recent days was directed not at Tokayev, but at Nursultan Nazarbayev, the country’s first president who continued to wield enormous influence after his 2019 resignation. Protesters shouted “Shal ket!” (“Old man go”), an apparent reference to Nazarbayev, who dominated Kazakhstan’s politics and whose rule was marked by a moderate cult of personality.At the start of the year, prices for the fuel called liquefied petroleum gas roughly doubled as the government moved away from price controls as part of efforts to move to a market economy.The price cap for LPG announced by the government Thursday is 75 tenge (17 cents) per liter; at the start of the year, the average price was about 120 tenge (27 cents).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dozens-of-protesters-12-police-personnel-dead-in-kazakhstan-protests-101641490499731.html
06-01-2022||World||Omicron may be less severe in young and old, but not 'mild': WHO||The more infectious Omicron variant of Covid-19 appears to produce less severe disease than the globally dominant Delta strain, but should not be categorised as "mild", World Health Organization (WHO) officials said on Thursday.Janet Diaz, WHO lead on clinical management, said early studies showed there was a reduced risk of hospitalisation from the variant first identified in southern Africa and Hong Kong in November compared with Delta.There appears also to be a reduced risk of severity in both younger and older people, she told a media briefing from WHO headquarters in Geneva.The remarks on the reduced risks of severe disease chime with other data, including studies from South Africa and England, although she did not give further details about the studies or ages of the cases analysed.The impact on the elderly is one of the big unanswered questions about the new variant as most of the cases studied so far have been in younger people."While Omicron does appear to be less severe compared to Delta, especially in those vaccinated, it does not mean it should be categorised as mild," director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at the same briefing in Geneva."Just like previous variants, Omicron is hospitalising people and it is killing people."He warned of a "tsunami" of cases as global infections soar to records fuelled by both Omicron and Delta, healthcare systems are overwhelmed, and governments struggle to tame the virus, which has killed more than 5.8 million people.'BILLIONS COMPLETELY UNPROTECTED'Tedros repeated his call for greater equity globally in the distribution of and access to vaccines.Based on the current rate of vaccine rollout, 109 countries will miss the WHO's target for 70% of the world's population to be fully vaccinated by July, Tedros added. That aim is seen as helping end the acute phase of the pandemic."Booster after booster in a small number of countries will not end a pandemic while billions remain completely unprotected," he said.WHO adviser Bruce Aylward said 36 nations had not even reached 10 percent vaccination cover. Among severe patients worldwide, 80% were unvaccinated, he added.In its weekly epidemiological report on Thursday, the WHO said cases increased by 71%, or 9.5 million, in the week to Jan. 2 from a week earlier, while deaths fell by 10%, or 41,000.Another variant B.1.640 - first documented in multiple countries in September 2021 - is among those being monitored by the WHO but is not circulating widely, said the WHO's technical lead on Covid-19, Maria van Kerkhove.There are two other categories of greater significance the WHO uses to track variants: "variant of concern", which includes Delta and Omicron, and "variant of interest".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-may-be-less-severe-in-young-and-old-but-not-mild-who-101641486556133.html
06-01-2022||World||It takes only 20 minutes to get Covid if you are wearing a cloth mask: Study||The effectiveness of different types of masks is again on the radar as the spread of Omicron has once again proved the necessity of an effective first shield of defence. According to recent observations made by scientists and experts, cloth mask may not provide enough protection against the virus.According to American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, N95 masks are the best to offer maximum protection against the transmission of the virus. It takes at least 2.5 hours to transmit the infection from one person to another person if the infected person is not even wearing a mask. If both are wearing N95 masks, then the virus will take 25 hours to transmit. Surgical masks offer better protection than the cloth mask though data shows that if the infected person is not wearing a mask and the second person is wearing a surgical mask, then the infection can transmit in 30 minutes.As Omicron spreads, time to upgrade your mask. Why? Experts explainWhile many people choose cloth mask over N95 for comfort, experts recommend pairing cloth masks with surgical models. Cloth masks with just one layer can block larger droplets but small aerosols don't get blocked by a cloth shield. A cloth mask or a surgical mask won't make much of a difference if the variant is highly transmissible.Why cloth masks may not be effective against OmicronOmicron is the most fast-spreading variant of SARs-CoV-2. People with two and three doses of vaccinations are getting infected by the infection. So, the first line of defence needs to be activated with Covid-appropriate behaviour starting with masking. Data shows if two persons are not wearing the mask and one of them is infected, then the infection will spread in 15 minutes. If the second person wears a cloth mask, then the virus will take 20 minutes. If both are wearing cloth masks, then the infection will spread in 27 minutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-takes-only-20-minutes-to-get-covid-if-you-are-wearing-a-cloth-mask-study-101641485254024.html

But its proximity to the Middle East, its location on the energy transit roads, and its position on the Bab al-Mandab Strait all make this country of great importance for global powers,” the foreign affairs website The Diplomat had reported earlier.The region, according to Reuters, is threatened by instability in South Sudan, where China has substantial oil investments, and by Islamist militancy in Somalia, which frequently spills over into deadly attacks on civilians in neighbouring Kenya, where China also has substantial investments.Wang’s announcement comes as US Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa Jeffrey Feltman, a veteran diplomat, prepares to step down this month after more than nine months in the job, dominated by the crisis in Ethiopia and a coup in Sudan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eye-on-india-china-to-appoint-special-envoy-to-horn-of-africa-101641474392999.html

The organisers of the festival made the announcement on Wednesday."Despite the most ambitious protocols, the Omicron variant with its unexpectedly high transmissibility rates is pushing the limits of health safety, travel and other infrastructures across the country," organisers said in a statement.They added, "The festival's in-person Utah elements will be moving online this year. While we're disappointed to not provide the full hybrid experience and gather in-person as intended, audiences this year will still experience the magic and energy of our festival."The Sundance Institute added how difficult the decision was to make given that "as a nonprofit, our Sundance spirit is in making something work against the odds. But with case numbers forecasted to peak in our host community the week of the festival we cannot knowingly put our staff and community at risk. The undue stress to Summit County's health services and our more than 1,500 staff and volunteers would be irresponsible in this climate."New films, extended reality ("XR") programming, artists conversations and more content will all be accessible through virtual portals, they added.Sundance had planned to institute COVID safety measures such as requiring booster shots as well as negative test results, plus banning food and drink at screenings.Organisers were hopeful that Sundance could proceed in person, given that domestic movie theatres have not yet closed in the wake of the new variant -- and in fact, Sony's 'Spider-Man: No Way Home' continues to drive the public to the cineplex in record pandemic numbers.Sundance, of course, is not just a series of spartan film screenings. Panel discussions, filmmaker dinners, late-night after-parties and hospitality lounges all draw creative and industry players over the 10-day event.Other notable events recently affected due to the Omicron surge include the Grammy Awards, the Palm Springs International Film Festival, the film academy's annual Governors Awards, and the planned broadcast of the Critics Choice Awards.Sundance held a virtual edition in 2021 and offered select physical screenings in markets across the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sundance-film-festival-to-go-virtual-due-to-omicron-surge-101641470413166.html

Ransoms for hostages sometimes run into hundreds of thousands of dollars.In November, Chinese authorities issued a travel advisory warning their citizens and companies against travel to “high-risk” areas in Nigeria and other parts of Africa.The state of security across Nigeria has deteriorated under President Muhammadu Buhari, a retired military general who served as Nigeria’s military head of state during 1983-1985 before returning to power in 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/three-chinese-nationals-abducted-in-nigeria-police-say-101641468784227.html

"Rejecting cookies should be as easy as accepting them".In its statement, the watchdog said it had found that the facebook.com, google.fr and youtube.com websites didn't allow the refusal of cookies easily, citing Google's video-streaming platform.The CNIL said the two companies had three months to comply with its orders or face an extra penalty payment of 100,000 euros per day of delay.These include the obligation for Google and Facebook to provide French internet users simpler tools for refusing cookies, in order to guarantee their consent.The CNIL said that while Google and Facebook provided a virtual button to allow the immediate acceptance of cookies, there was no equivalent to refuse them as easily."People trust us to respect their right to privacy and keep them safe. We understand our responsibility to protect that trust and are committing to further changes and active work with the CNIL in light of this decision," a Google spokesperson said.Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.CNIL's previous record fine in 2020 also targeted Google and amounted to 100 million euros.At the time, the CNIL found that Google's French websites didn't seek the prior consent of visitors before advertising cookies were saved on computers and failed to provide clear information about how it intended to make use of them.Kiefer said the issues have been resolved since then.In 2020, the CNIL strengthened consent rights over ad trackers, saying websites operating in France should keep a register of internet users' refusal to accept cookies for at least six months.It also said internet users should be able to easily reconsider any initial agreement concerning cookies via a web link or an icon that should be visible on all the website pages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-hit-with-150-million-euro-french-fine-over-cookie-breaches-101641466847727.html

It drew the ire of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as well. During a press conference on Wednesday addressing the ongoing fifth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic due to the Omicron variant, he described the behaviour of the passengers as “completely irresponsible”.That approximately 150 passengers who were aboard that flight on December 30 are now stuck in Mexico. Sunwing has cancelled their return flight following the uproar. Other carriers have followed suit, including Air Canada and Air Transat. The latter tweeted that it confirmed that the unruly passengers “will be denied boarding based on our legal and regulatory obligations to ensure the safety of both our passengers and crew, which is our top priority”.The partying group, which included prominent social media influencers and participants in reality TV programmes and others, may face further action from Canadian authorities.In a joint statement, minister of transport Omar Alghabra, minister of health Jean-Yves Duclos, and minister of public safety Marco Mendicino said they were “aware of unacceptable behaviour and cases of non-compliance with mask wearing and other air safety requirements that occurred on a privately chartered flight from Montréal to Cancun on December 30, 2021”.“Our government takes reported incidents such as these very seriously. We have directed our respective departmental officials to immediately launch an investigation into these allegations of non-compliance with Covid-19 and air safety rules and regulations,” they added.The actions of the passengers have angers many Canadians as the incident came to light as several provinces are reimposing restrictions and Quebec has also reintroduced an overnight curfew.The ministers warned that if non-compliance was determined, passengers could face fines of up to 5,000 Canadian dollars ($3,917).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trip-to-mexico-for-violating-covid-norms-canadian-airlines-refuse-to-fly-back-150-passengers-101641467191614.html

Africa CDC director John Nkengasong told a news conference that he was encouraged by the way South Africa, the first to detect Omicron strain, handled the latest Covid-19 wave driven by the new variant of concern."We are very encouraged with what we saw in South Africa in this period," Africa's top public health official said."The period where we are using severe lockdowns as a tool is over, we should actually be looking at how we use public health and social measures more carefully and in a balanced way as the vaccination increases," he added.Countries around the world are tightening restrictions amid the spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant but have avoided severe lockdowns given the low level of hospitalisations.

Yuzhou, a city of 1.1 million in the same province, is also under a lockdown.The northwestern city of Xian, already locked down for two weeks, reported 63 local Covid-19 cases for Wednesday, up from 35 a day earlier.More than 42,000 residents of Xian including close contacts continue to be under quarantine.All international flights in Xian’s Xianyang International Airport were halted from Wednesday, the Xinhua news agency reported on Thursday; domestic flights had been suspended earlier.The ongoing outbreak in the city has been linked to a passenger who came on a flight from Pakistan.In a rare admission, state media reports said Xian epidemic prevention policy has come under criticism for being too strict.“We were woken up in the middle of the night by a knock on the door and told to pack up and leave, without further explanation,” an anonymous resident was quoted as saying in Chinese state-run media.Posts about a pregnant woman who lost her baby after waiting outside of a local hospital, bleeding, triggered an outcry on Chinese social media. Two Xian health officials were given warnings for not doing their job well due to the incident.The general manager of the hospital was suspended, with a few other staffers removed from their roles, the reports said.The mainland reported 132 new locally transmitted Covid-19 cases in all, the national health commission (NHC) said in its daily report on Thursday.Besides the cases in Henan and Shaanxi, five local infections were reported from the eastern province of Zhejiang.Flights for Beijing from Yiwu, a global hub for small commodities in Zhejiang province, were indefinitely suspended on Thursday.More regions and cities are taking pre-emptive measures ahead of the Games and the Chinese New Year holidays.The central Chinese city of Wuhan where the first cases of Covid-19 were detected in late 2019 announced closer monitoring of people entering the city with those responsible for manning inter-provincial highways being put on alert.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases on the mainland had reached 103,121 by Wednesday till date with the death toll remaining at 4,636, according to the NHC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-more-curbs-in-central-china-xian-suspends-international-flights-101641465760583.html

This has led to the resignation of Kazakhstan's government, news agency Reuters reported. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev called the demonstrators "a band of international terrorists", and requested the intervention of peacekeeping troops from Russia and allied countries.Demonstrations are rare in the country but took place infrequently in the 2000s.January 2021 - The protests beginning on January 2 have left Kazakhstan’s largest metropolis, Almaty, in flames as protesters took down the statue of first President Nursultan Nazarbayev. Kazakh protests have been sparked by the steep hike in the price of liquified petroleum gas (LPG), the country's main car fuel. This is accompanied by higher interest rates and explosive inflation in recent years.Twelve cops have been killed as thousands of people take on the street holding violent protests.Also Read | Explained: How Kazakhstan protests started and the bigger pictureJune 2019 - As protests broke out against the change of president from longtime leader Nursultan Nazarbayev to Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, about 500 people were arrested in 2019. Young activists were at the forefront of this movement as they chanted mantras like "No to the dictatorship" and “shame, shame, shame!”, exclaiming they have a choice on how the country should be run and who should run it.April 2016 - Fuelled by the change in Kazakhstan’s Land Code, around 4,000 people holding unauthorised protests across the country. The new law allowed foreigners to buy Kazakh agricultural lands for 25 years.One protestor in Aktobe city told BBC, "After 25 years, they will stay for 65. After 65 their descendants will take Kazakhstan's citizenship and our descendants will be their slaves."Police detained several people including two Reuters reporters for a short duration before releasing them.On May 5, almost two weeks after the protests began, the government had to concede defeat and order a moratorium on some provisions of the land code.December 2011 - Known as the Zhanaozen massacre, 14 protestors were killed as during a clash with the police in the oil town of Zhanaozen on Kazaksatan’s independence day.

06-01-2022||World||Canada: Rise in admissions of infants with Covid-19 in hospitals||Four major Canadian paediatric hospitals have warned that with “the rise of Omicron, hospitals are starting to see a disturbing, potential new trend - admissions of infants with Covid-19”.The four hospitals, CHEO in Ottawa, The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, McMaster Children’s Hospital in Hamilton and Kingston Health Sciences Centre in Kingston, made that statement in a joint release issued on Wednesday.Since the middle of December, two of the hospitals, CHEO and McMaster admitted six babies under the age of 12 with COVID-19 infections. Prior to that, the statement said, “it was a rare occurrence that an infant was hospitalised for Covid-19 infection”. At CHEO, it added, vaccination status in these particular cases is being tracked, all the admitted infants’ mothers had not been jabbed against the coronavirus.The joint statement was also an appeal to expectant women to get vaccinated for the health of their children. The hospitals said they are “encouraging anyone who is pregnant to get vaccinated against Covid-19 for the protection of their baby, as well as themselves”. There are as yet no vaccines available for infants.“Infants are especially at risk because they have an immature immune system that has difficulty in combating disease. And if the mother has not been vaccinated or infected, they do not have the protection of maternal antibodies transferred during the third trimester of pregnancy,” it noted. They also said that it had been well studied in other infectious diseases like flu and whooping cough that maternal antibodies resulting from vaccination provided protection for the first six months of a child’s life.Addressing a concern that may have led to vaccine hesitancy among some pregnant women, they also pointed out that research showed there was “no evidence that Covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy is associated with any adverse pregnancy outcomes”.“Pregnant individuals are considered a high-risk population for Covid-19 complications, based on higher rates of Covid-19 hospitalisation, ICU admission, and death compared with non-pregnant individuals of the same age,” the statement also said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-rise-in-admissions-of-infants-with-covid-19-in-hospitals-101641453806804.html

It’s fellow Canadians as well.”The Canadian government has also instituted vaccine mandates requiring proof of being jabbed for travelling by air, train and on cruise ships, and some provinces bar those without vaccination certificates from accessing some facilities like gyms, bars, nightclubs, restaurants, as well as sports and entertainment events.Case levels in Canada continue to be of concern as its chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam tweeted on Wednesday, “Covid-19 cases have rapidly accelerated, with #Omicron now predominating and widespread across much of the country. The latest 7-day average of 40,696 cases/day is a 78% increase over last week.”According to official data, about 82% of the population has received one dose of a Covid-19 jab, with nearly 77% being fully vaccinated. A booster programme is also under way for those aged above 18 years. Vaccination uptake in Canada is among the highest worldwide.In his criticism of those choosing not to get vaccinated, Justin Trudeau added, “When people are seeing cancer treatments and elective surgeries put off because beds are filled with people who chose not to get vaccinated, they’re frustrated.”“When people see that we are in lockdowns or serious public health restrictions right now because of the risk posed to all of us by unvaccinated people, people get angry,” he said.Canada’s healthcare system has come under pressure in the latest wave: While hospitalisations and deaths remain lower than previous outbreaks, the very transmissible Omicron variant has led to large numbers of medical personnel infected and unavailable.With molecular tests now restricted in several jurisdictions to symptomatic or hospitalised patients, Canada has been struggling to meet the demand for testing and has turned to rapid antigen kits. Trudeau also announced that 140 million such kits will be distributed to the provinces and territories this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-in-canada-justin-trudeau-criticises-antivaxxers-101641450087129.html
06-01-2022||World||Why AUKUS is good for containing Chinese belligerence in Indo-Pacific?||France is still nursing a grievance over Australia nullifying a USD 59 billion air independent propulsion (AIP) submarine deal and opting out for nuclear powered conventional weapon attack or SSNs submarines with US and UK under the September 15, 2021 AUKUS pact.While Paris may have legitimate reasons for being upset with Australia for renegading on the submarine deal, the emerging picture in Indo-Pacific clearly shows that AIP submarines would have been a half-measure in containing a belligerent China under all powerful President Xi Jinping. Given the strategic environment in Indo-Pacific and South China Sea in particular, the Australian choice for an SSN is definitely a better option in tackling a rapidly growing PLA Navy and Chinese intermediate range ballistic missile arsenal.The state of strategic play is such that India also has no choice but to go for long-range nuclear-powered submarines and delivery platforms as it is only a matter of time when the Chinese carrier force will be patrolling the Indian Ocean. With two nuclear submarines already operational and third one a work in progress, India also is building a leverage in case PLA decides strong arm tactics on the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control (LAC), like it did in May 2020.If one overlooks the noise over Australia scuttling the French submarine deal, it is not very difficult to understand why Canberra decided the nuclear option as it is a deterrent to Chinese Taiwan ambitions. Today’s signing of security pact between Japan and Australia, once World War II adversaries, with the bottom line on convergence in Indo-Pacific is also a step in the direction to ask China to mend its aggression. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison described the agreement “will underpin greater and more complex practical engagement between the Australian Defence Force and the Japanese Self-Defence Forces.” Juxtapose the new security pact with AUKUS and Quad and the larger picture emerges on the Indo-Pacific with India having a logistics agreement with all the Quad partners.Rather than viewing AUKUS from a French commercial perspective, the Australian nuclear powered conventional attack submarines will be an answer to the massive deployment of DF-21 and DF 26 series of ballistic missiles by the PLA on Chinese east coast to prevent US aircraft carrier enter the South China Sea in the worst case scenario over Taiwan. Given the range of these ballistic missiles, the US aircraft carrier force will have to operate outside the first chain of islands after China or else be on the cross-hairs of these PLA delivery platforms. While US and Russia were bound by the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty since 1987 and before suspension in 2019, the PLA has built a massive intermediate range ballistic missile arsenal with its propaganda media nick-naming DF-21 and DF 26 as carrier killer and Guam killer weapons.With the advent of Australian nuclear submarines, the Chinese missile sites on east coast will be threatened by the sub-surface attack platforms which can stay under water for months together in South China Sea or the Indo-Pacific. Fact is that AUKUS is a game-changer for Indo-Pacific as even the latest AIP diesel submarines must surface, in effect betraying their positions, in weeks for charging their batteries. Thus, from a strategic perspective, the Australian nuclear attack submarines with conventional ballistic missiles as deterrents will allow US aircraft carrier to operate between Chinese coast and first island chain and also enforce laws of the seas and freedom of navigation in South China Sea. As China is threatening Taiwan on a daily basis by breaching its air defence identification zone, it is for the US to speed up the SSN production for Australia as time is running out for Taipei and the security of Indo-Pacific.
06-01-2022||World||Explained: How Kazakhstan protests started and the bigger picture||Many cities across Kazakhstan have been witnessing unrest as thousands of protesters took to streets against the sharp increase in price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), which most Kazakhs use as car fuel.The price rise came as the country ended a gradual transition to electronic trading for LPG to halt state subsidies for fuel and let the market dictate prices.Even though the government announced on Tuesday that fuel prices will be reduced to a level even lower than before the increase, and on Wednesday President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev sacked his cabinet, the protests are continuing.What is the main issue?The fuel market reform was first broached in 2015 came into effect at the start of the month. It sought to remove state price caps for butane and propane - often referred to as 'road fuels for the poor' due to their low cost - while making sure the local market was well supplied.Previous subsidies had created a situation when Kazakhstan, a major oil producer, regularly faced shortages of butane and propane.When prices were fully liberalised on January 1 (Saturday), the government expectations were that supplies to the domestic market would rise and help address the chronic shortages.But the measure backfired, as prices nearly doubled overnight to 120 tenge per litre.Where did the protest start?The popular anger spilled over first in western Kazakhstan, an oil-rich area, over the weekend. By Tuesday, the entire country was under its grip.The anger among the public was already running high because of rising inflation which was closing in on 9% year-on-year - the highest in more than five years - leading the central bank to raise interest rates to 9.75%.The resource-rich country of 19 million is estimated to have a million people living below the poverty line.The protests have yet to have an impact on Kazakhstan's oil production.Eight cops killed in protestsEight police and national guard troops were killed in the unrest on Tuesday and Wednesday, according to Russian news agency Sputnik.Demonstrators have taken control of the airport in Almaty, Kazakhstan's biggest city, news agency Reuters reported, leading to cancellation of flights.President Tokayev said in a televised speech that foreign-trained "terrorist" gangs were seizing buildings, infrastructure and weapons, and had taken five aircraft, including foreign ones, at Almaty airport.A resident of Almaty told Reuters that vodka was being distributed at the main square in Almaty. "There is complete anarchy in the street," he added.A Russia-led security alliance of ex-Soviet states will send peacekeeping forces to Kazakhstan, Armenia's prime minister said on Thursday.The Nazarbayev angleInitially sparked by anger at a fuel price rise, the protests have quickly spread to take in wider opposition to President Tokayev's predecessor Nursultan Nazarbayev, who retained significant power as “Leader of the Nation” despite quitting in 2019 after a nearly three-decade rule.Nazarbayev, 81, has been widely seen as the main political force in Nur-Sultan, the capital which bears his name. His family is believed to control much of the economy, the largest in Central Asia. He has not been seen or heard from since the protests began.Footage emerged on social media which showed protesters chanting below a giant bronze statue of Nazarbayev, strung with ropes, which they later pulled down.Nazarbayev, who has been removed from his powerful position by Tokayev in a bid to placate the protesters, still has the support or Russian president Vladimir Putin.The government response to the protestKazakh authorities imposed a nationwide state of emergency and sent military units to fight what Tokayev called “terrorists”.The state of emergency gives Tokayev the power to impose a curfew, ban protests, and restrict internet access to quell the rare show of dissent in Kazakhstan.There was an internet blackout around the country by Wednesday after a day of mobile internet disruptions and partial restrictions, according to NetBlocks, a London-based monitoring agency.The bigger pictureThe action marks the second major move by the Kremlin in as many years to shore up an ally facing upheaval. In 2020, President Vladimir Putin stepped in to back Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko’s crackdown on popular protests, which drew sanctions from the US and its allies.The Kremlin has regularly condemned street protests in former Soviet states, labeling them attempts by the West to use “colour revolutions” to overthrow governments.Russia is facing “strategic instability on both flanks and it can’t afford to get distracted,” Alexander Baunov, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center, wrote on Facebook. “Just as Russia was encroaching on Ukraine, suddenly there are protests across Kazakhstan, which might need saving.”State Department spokesman Ned Price called Kazakhstan a “valued partner” and said the US was following the situation closely.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-how-kazakhstan-protests-started-and-the-bigger-picture-101641437247491.html
06-01-2022||World||Kazakhstan declares state of emergency nationwide||Kazakhstan on Wed-nesday declared a nationwide state of emergency after protests over a fuel price hike erupted into clashes and saw demonstrators storm government buildings.Russian news agencies Interfax, TASS and RIA Novosti reported the state of emergency, quoting a statement shown on Kazakh state television. States of emergency had earlier been imposed in the epicentres of the rallies - financial capital Almaty, the Mangystau province, and capital Nur-Sultan.Earlier in the day, Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev vowed to take tough action to quell deadly protests that posed into the biggest challenge to the country’s leadership in decades. The demonstrations started over the weekend in western Kazakhstan over a jump in fuel prices but quickly spilled into broader discontent drawing thousands to the streets across the country.In the former capital, Almaty, both city hall and the president’s residence were ablaze after protesters stormed the buildings on Wednesday, Interfax reported.“I intend to act as harshly as possible,” Tokayev said in a national address, law-enforcement officers were killed in the line of duty, he said, blaming the protests on “financially motivated conspirators”.Some of the protesters called for the country’s first president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who for over three decades has been the major political force in the country, to let go of the reins of power and chose Tokayev as successor in 2019. Tokayev, whose primary residence is in the capital Nur-Sultan, initially sought to appease protesters by imposing price caps on motor fuels for the next six months and accepting his government’s resignation. He also declared a state of emergency in and around Almaty, Nur-Sultan and the oil-rich Mangystau region, but the measures failed to ease the tensions.Tokayev also announced that he was taking over as head of the Security Council from Nazarbayev and pledged to stay in the capital “whatever happens”.Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko discussed the unrest in Kazakhstan in separate conversations on Wednesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, the Belarusian news agency Belta said.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said that Kazakhstan could solve its own problems and it was important that no one interfered from the outside.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kazakhstan-declares-state-of-emergency-nationwide-101641435028329.html
06-01-2022||World||French Prez sparks backlash by berating unvaccinated||French President Emmanuel Macron took Europe’s aggressive stance against the unvaccinated up a notch, saying he wants to “piss off” people who don’t get their Covid-19 shot.“We will continue to do this, to the end. This is the strategy,” he said in an interview. He added that means “limiting as much as possible their access to activities in social life”.The comments sparked an angry response from opposition politicians in France, and led to parliament suspending a debate on new virus restrictions. Some lawmakers are demanding that PM Jean Castex shows up to explain the remarks.The verb used by Macron in the interview- “emmerder” in French - is informal slang commonly used to insult people. It can also mean to hassle, or annoy.French politicians expressed dismay at Macron’s comments. Valerie Pecresse, presidential candidate for Conservative Party The Republicans, said on CNews she was “outraged by his comments” and that “insults are never a good solution”.Meanwhile, France hit another record for new cases on Wednesday, AFP reported, citing comments by health minister Olivier Veran at the national assembly. New infections totalled about 335,000, Veran said, according to AFP, up from 271,686 on Tuesday.Poland’s president tests Covid+ for second timePoland’s President Andrzej Duda has tested positive for Covid-19 but has no serious symptoms, an aide said on Wednesday. The aide, Pawel Szrot, said on Twitter that Duda was under medical observation but feels well.Duda, 49, has been vaccinated against the coronavirus and received a booster shot last month, Szrot said. He previously tested positive in October 2020.Bulgaria’s foreign minister Teodora Genchovska has tested positive for Covid-19 amid a sharp rise in new infections in the Balkan country, the foreign ministry said on Wednesday.Genchovska, who has been vaccinated with two doses, will remain under doctor’s supervision, the ministry said in a statement without elaborating.Chinese govt orders mass testing in ZhengzhouChinese health authorities on Wednesday imposed a partial lockdown and ordered mass testing for Covid-19 on a city of 12 million people in central China even as the locked down city of Xian reported a sharp drop in new infections. Millions of residents of Zhengzhou, the capital city of the central Chinese city of Henan, lined up to be tested on Wednesday after the city reported 11 domestic infections this week.Pfizer, BioNTech to develop shingles shotPfizer and Germany’s BioNTech will develop an mRNA-based vaccine for viral infection shingles, collaborating for the third time after the success of their Covid-19 vaccine based on the same technology.The companies said on Wednesday they expect to begin clinical trials of the shingles vaccine, which will combine Pfizer’s antigen technology and BioNTech’s Messenger RNA platform technology, in the second half of 2022.Austrian police said they had raided two dozen homes on Wednesday, seizing equipment and placing 22 people under investigation on suspicion of forging vaccine certificates, weeks before Covid vaccines become mandatory.One in 20 people in UK had Covid: Official dataMore than one in 20 people in Britain had Covid-19 in the last week of 2021, the highest infection rate recorded during the pandemic, official data showed on Wednesday.An estimated 3.7mn people had the virus, up from 2.3mn the previous week, as the Omicron variant surged nationwide, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.British PM Boris Johnson announced on Wednesday that compulsory Covid-19 tests required by overseas travellers no earlier than 48 hours before arriving in England will be scrapped from Friday morning.With inputs from Sutirtho Patranobis||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-prez-sparks-backlash-by-berating-unvaccinated-101641434912995.html
06-01-2022||World||Novak Djokovic denied entry to Australia amid Covid-19 vaccine outcry||Novak Djokovic was denied entry to Australia after border officials overruled a vaccine exemption that sparked a national uproar and underlines the complex alignment of federal and state Covid-19 policies that’s become a hallmark of the nation’s pandemic journey.The tennis star, who was due to contest the Australian Open this month despite doubts over his vaccine status, provided insufficient proof to enter the country under current pandemic rules, the Australian Border Force said Thursday. While he was earlier granted a medical exemption to enter the state of Victoria, the federal government revoked that decision after officials questioned the athlete for hours at Melbourne Airport.“Mr Djokovic failed to provide appropriate evidence to meet the entry requirements to Australia, and his visa has been subsequently canceled,” the ABF statement said. “Non-citizens who do not hold a valid visa on entry or who have had their visa canceled will be detained and removed from Australia.”Djokovic’s lawyers are appealing the decision and he’s been moved to a Melbourne hotel while that process takes place, the ABC and Sydney Morning Herald reported. He is chasing a record 21st Grand Slam victory after winning nine Australian Open singles titles, including the past three tournaments.The backflip is the latest example of the confusion surrounding Covid guidelines that are plaguing both officials and citizens as case numbers continue to surge. Throughout the pandemic, states have largely set their own policies on the entry of overseas and local visitors, as well as lockdowns, but the federal government ultimately decides on who can enter the country. “There are no special cases: rules are rules,” Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters in Canberra. “If you are not double vaccinated and not an Australian resident or citizen, you cannot come.” The disparity between state policies has caused upheaval during the holiday period, with some states demanding tests and different requirements for residents from other regions. The two most populous states, New South Wales and Victoria have loosened entry restrictions for both overseas and local visitors even as the omicron variant has seen case numbers surge in recent weeks, with hospitalizations also slowly climbing. Melbourne AngerThe initial exemption for Djokovic, who has previously criticized vaccine mandates, sparked criticism and anger in host-city Melbourne, which became the world’s most locked-down city during the pandemic. The player was among a handful of competitors granted medical exemptions for the tournament, the first of the four annual Grand Slam events, which begins Jan. 17. Arriving players and support staff from overseas who have a valid medical exemption can follow the same rules for travelers into Victoria state who are fully vaccinated, though face some greater restrictions on entering sensitive settings such as schools. It’s a marked departure from the experience of the world’s tennis elite in 2021 where 14-day hotel quarantine in Melbourne was required with strict rules around daily testing and close contacts. Australia’s Covid-Zero strategy to eliminate coronavirus infections in the community has now been abandoned in all but one of the eight states and territories, with the nation recording more than 64,000 new cases on Wednesday.Victoria state, which includes Melbourne, has a double-dose vaccination level of 93% for those over 12 years of age. On Thursday the state reported a record 21,997 new Covid-19 infections, with hospitalizations rising to 631. While many Victorians will welcome the Covid rules being applied to overseas sportspeople as well as themselves, the denial of Djokovic’s entry into the state hasn’t gone down well in his native Serbia.  “I told our Novak that the whole of Serbia is with him and that our authorities are taking all measures to stop the maltreatment of the world’s best tennis player in the shortest possible time,” President Aleksandar Vucic said in an Instagram post translated from Serbian. (Updates with PM comment, more detail from 6th paragraph)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2022 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/novak-djokovic-denied-entry-to-australia-amid-covid-19-vaccine-outcry-101641434052023.html
06-01-2022||World||Bases housing US troops in Iraq, Syria come under attack||Iraqi military bases hosting US troops in Iraq's western Anbar province and the capital of Baghdad were hit by Katyusha rockets Wednesday while in Syria, eight rounds of indirect fire landed inside a base with members of the US-led coalition, the Iraqi and US militaries said.No casualties were reported in the three attacks, part of a series that began on Monday, the anniversary of a US airstrike that killed top Iranian general Qassim Soleimani in Baghdad two years ago.According to an Iraqi officer, an Iraqi base housing US troops in the western Anbar province was hit with five Katyusha rockets on Wednesday evening; three other rockets fell outside the base's parameter. The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said US-led coalition forces at the base were forced into shelters by the barrage.There was no immediate comment from the coalition, which is in Iraq to help fight the Islamic State group.Later Wednesday, a previously-unheard of group in Iraq calling itself Qassem al-Jabarayn claimed responsibility for the Ain al-Asad attack. The group vowed in an online post to keep up attacks until the full withdrawal of U.S. forces.Since Soleimani’s death, Iran-backed militias in Iraq have become increasingly unruly and disparate, although some analysts argue the militias have splintered only to allow them to claim attacks under different names to mask their involvement.Earlier Wednesday, the Iraqi military said a rocket launcher with one rocket was located in a residential district in western Baghdad, an area used in the past by Iran-backed militias to fire at the airport.In eastern Syria, the rounds hit a base run by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces with a small coalition advisory presence. The coalition said in a statement there was minor damage.Coalition forces, acting on intelligence, responded by firing six rounds of artillery towards the point of origin of the attack just outside the eastern town of Mayadeen, a stronghold of Iran-backed fighters, the statement said.The statement said “Iran-supported malign actors fired ... from within civilian infrastructure with no regard for civilian safety.” It said that hours earlier, U.S.-led coalition forces had observed several launch sites near the base known as Green Village. Coalition forces conducted several strikes to eliminate the threats, it added.“The Coalition reserves the right to defend itself and partner forces against any threat, and will continue to do everything within its power to protect those forces,” said Maj. Gen. John W. Brennan, Jr., commander of the joint task force.John Kirby, Pentagon press secretary, said Wednesday that the military has been preparing for stepped-up attacks in Iraq around the end of the year.“We’re very mindful of the threat environment and it is very dynamic right now,” he said. Kirby said the attacks could be related to the anniversary of Soleimani's killing or a reaction to the continuing presence of American forces in Iraq — but likely are a combination of both.Iranian-backed militias have wanted all US troops out of the country, and many believed that would happen by the end of the year.On Monday, two armed drones were shot down as they headed toward a facility housing US advisors at Baghdad airport. Two explosives-laden drones targeting an Iraqi military base housing US troops in western Anbar province were destroyed on Tuesday.The 2020 US drone strike at Baghdad’s airport killed Soleimani, who was the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force, and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy commander of Iran-backed militias in Iraq known as the Popular Mobilization Forces.Pro-Iran Shiite factions in Iraq have vowed revenge for the killing and have conditioned the end of attacks against the US presence in Iraq on the full exit of American troops from the country.The US-led coalition formally ended its combat mission supporting Iraqi forces in the ongoing fight against the Islamic State group last month. Some 2,500 troops will remain as the coalition shifts to an advisory mission to continue supporting Iraqi forces.The top US commander for the Middle East Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie warned in an interview with The Associated Press last month that he expects increasing attacks on US and Iraqi personnel by Iranian-backed militias determined to get American forces out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bases-housing-us-troops-in-iraq-syria-come-under-attack-101641428123195.html
06-01-2022||World||North Korea says hypersonic missile tested to modernise weaponry||North Korea said Thursday it has successfully launched a hypersonic missile as part of efforts to modernise its strategic weapons systems, days after leader Kim Jong Un vowed to bolster his military forces despite pandemic-related difficulties.Wednesday's test, the North's first known weapons tests in about two months, indicates that the country will press ahead with plans to build powerful, sophisticated missiles rather than returning to disarmament talks anytime soon.The official Korean Central News Agency said the Central Committee of the ruling Workers' Party expressed “great satisfaction” at the results of the missile test observed by leading weapons officials.It's the second known test-flight of a hypersonic missile since North Korea first tested such a weapon last September. It wasn't immediately known if both are the exactly same type of hypersonic missile.“The successive successes in the test launches in the hypersonic missile sector have strategic significance in that they hasten a task for modernizing strategic armed force of the state,” a KCNA dispatch said. The word “strategic” implies the missile is being developed to deliver nuclear weapons.Hypersonic weapons, which fly at speeds in excess of Mach 5, or five times the speed of sound, could pose crucial challenges to missile defence systems because of their speed and maneuverability.It's unclear whether and how soon North Korea could manufacture such a high-tech missile, but it was among a wish-list of sophisticated military assets that Kim disclosed early last year, along with a multi-warhead missile, spy satellites, solid-fuelled long-range missiles and underwater-launched nuclear missiles.The North's latest launch was first detected by its neighbours.The US military called it a ballistic missile launch that “highlights the destabilising impact of (North Korea's) illicit weapons programme”. South Korea and Japan expressed concerns or regrets over the launch. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reiterated that North Korea should resume talks with other countries.A US-led diplomacy on North Korea's nuclear programme remains stalled since 2019 due to disputes over international sanctions on the North. The Biden administration has repeatedly called for resuming the nuclear diplomacy “anywhere and at any time” without preconditions, but North Korea has argued the US must first withdraw its hostility against it before any talks can restart.During last week's plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers' Party, Kim repeated his vow to expand his country's military capabilities without publicly presenting any new positions on Washington and Seoul.The North's advancing nuclear arsenal is the core of Kim's rule, and he's called it “a powerful treasured sword” that thwarts potential US aggressions. During his 10-year rule, he's conducted an unusually large number of weapons tests to acquire an ability to launch nuclear strikes on the American mainland.But his country's economy has been faltering severely in the past two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the sanctions and his government's own mismanagement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-says-hypersonic-missile-tested-to-modernise-weaponry-101641428163099.html
06-01-2022||India||Withdraw Covid curbs; will affect trade, livelihood: DK Shivkumar to CM||Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president DK Shivakumar Thursday wrote to Karnataka chief minister (CM) Basavaraj Bommai asking him to withdraw the official government order on closure of bars, pubs, hotels, restaurants and resorts during the weekend curfew from Friday 10pm till Monday 5am throughout the state as it will affect the business, trade and livelihood of lakhs of people. In a letter to the chief minister, copies of which have been released to the media, Shivakumar said that the closure of the hotels, restaurants and other establishments will also affect people depending on them for their food besides seriously affecting the livelihood, business and trade. The letter came after Shivakumar said on Wednesday that the new regulations from the government affect the small business owners in the state. “For the past two years, their condition has been difficult. For their (BJP’s) political gains, because of the grudge they have against us (Congress), they are hurting businessmen. The tourism sector, drivers, street vendors are being targeted. It is as good as them getting murdered, and the government is responsible for it,” Shivakumar has said. Meanwhile, on Thursday, state home minister Araga Jnanedra asked the Congress leaders, to not go ahead with the march. Speaking to the media, he said, “I am asking them to drop the idea or postpone it. Coronavirus is spreading again and their padayatra might cause havoc. If they don’t listen to us or follow the law, we will be forced to enforce it strictly.” The march from Mekedatu to Bengaluru, a distance of around 179 km, will cover 15 Assembly constituencies before culminating with a public meeting at the Basavanagudi grounds in the state capital. Hitting back at Jnanedra, DK Shivakumar said that there was no question of cancelling or postponing the padyatra and the minister was free to do “whatever he wants”. “I know the home minister well. Who is he to threaten us? We are not scared of anyone. We will walk from Cauvery river in Mekedatu to Bengaluru as planned earlier. There will be no violation of Covid-19 guidelines. We are taking all precautions,” Shivakumar said. The Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president added that he and the rest of the senior leadership in the party were ready to go to jail but will not back down from taking out the padayatra for the Mekedatu project in violation of the Covid-19 guidelines that has banned all rallies, protests and political events in the state. Meanwhile, Opposition leader Siddaramaiah has said that there is no bar on only two people walking on the road. “Only Shivakumar and I will walk for 10 days. There is no need for our party workers and others to join us. It is organised by the Congress. But we are inviting everyone to join us. We don’t want to go against the rules. But the state government which is scared is using illegal methods to harass us,” the former CM said. Responding to the Congress leaders, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said that he doesn’t want to respond to the dramatic dialogues of the Congress leaders. “The law is same for everyone… let us set aside DK Shivakumar for now, he is a friend. But Siddaramaiah was the chief minister, now the Opposition leader and a person who was one the guardians of the rule of the law. I hope he will respect the regulations and pandemic laws,” Bommai told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/withdraw-covid-curbs-will-affect-trade-livelihood-dk-shivkumar-to-cm-101641493595166.html
06-01-2022||India||HT THIS DAY: January 7, 2000 — Power breaks down in N. India||New Delhi- A SNAG in the zonal power grid this morning had a cascading effect and left most of northern India in the grip of one of its worst power cuts. Between 10.05 am and 10.30 am, the entire national Capital was “power-dead”. Delhi Vidyut Board officials said the entire network convulsed because of tripping that apparently originated in Dadri. The localised tripping sparked off a “heavy jerk” that resulted in voltage levels sinking abysmally. Generating units and transmission lines on the grid tripped down the line and the frequency came down to 46 hertz from the optimal 50 hertz. Such was the impact of the sub-par frequency, the generating units of Badarpur, IP station and Rajghat in the Capital were rendered non-functional. The gas-turbined part of IP station was the first to recover, about half an hour after it went dead. Power was then prioritised to emergency services such as hospitals. Today’s power breakdown was more widespread and of longer duration than the one that hit the national Capital on December 12 following a similar case of tripping on the Northern Grid. The low frequency today had a snowballing effect on the thermal plants in Panipat and Ropar in Haryana and the hydro-generation power units of Bhakra Beas Management Board. According to officials, though power generation was partially restored at the BBMB plants and the Panipat thermal plant by the evening, the Ropar thermal plant could not be brought back to life even eight hours after it went dead. To add to the woes caused by the power breakdown, Chandigarh experienced its coldest day, with the temperature never topping 10.2 degree Celsius and falling as low as 5.2 degree C during the day. Delhi was relatively better off, with a high of 16 degree and a low of 5.2 degree. Train services on the Delhi-Ambala-Ludhiana-Amritsar-Jammu sector were severely hit by the power failure. Over 20 trains were delayed for over three hours. Electric engines had to be replaced by diesel-powered ones. The normalisation of power supply to Delhi, officials said, was adversely affected by delay in restoration of supply from the Madola sub-station, the national Capital’s single biggest power provider. Over 1,300 of the 1,500 MW of power supplied from the Northern Grid to the Capital is channelled through this sub-station. The generating units at Badarpur took longer and “only three of the five units have been synchronised till now,” DVB officials said, more than eight hours after the crisis began. Senior officers of the Northern Region Load Despatch Centre (NRLDC) held a meeting following the breakdown. The cause of the start of the tripping is being investigated, officials said. DVB officials said they had to resort to loadshedding as there was a shortage of 700 mw during peak-demand hours and about 300 mw otherwise. Powerless with a capital ‘P’•The power breakdown on Thursday proved a great leveller. Even VVIP areas of New Delhi were affected•Traffic lights were on the blink, throwing Delhi’s already stretched roads into disarray•Residents of Ashok Nagar in West Delhi were not impacted by the failure of the Northern Grid. They have not had power for the last 28 hours•Even after many parts of the Capital had power restored in the evening, voltage was so low and this precluded use of most motor-driven and electronic equipment•Long queues were the order of the day in petrol pumps across the Capital. Without electricity, the state-of-the-art pumps were inoperative.

06-01-2022||India||Air India sale: HC scraps Swamy’s plea challenging divestment process||New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Thursday dismissed Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Rajya Sabha member Subramanian Swamy’s plea seeking to set aside the Air India disinvestment process, saying that the valuation of the national carrier saw keen competition and was not tailor made or rigged in favour of the Tatas. The court said the plea is “wholly devoid of merit” as the policy decision to disinvest the national carrier was taken after “following transparent procedure through multi-layered decision making”. In October last year, the Centre accepted the highest bid made by a Tata Sons company for 100% equity shares of Air India and Air India Express, along with the government’s 50% stake in ground-handling company AISATS. Claiming that the process was “arbitrary, illegal and against public interest”, Swammy had sought a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the Air India disinvestment process. Swamy had alleged that the entire bidding process was rigged and one of the parties, Tatas, was given undue advantage, a claim vehemently refused both by the Centre and the corporate giant. In his plea filed through advocate Satya Sabharwal, the senior BJP leader submitted that a consortium led by SpiceJet was the other bidder but insolvency proceedings are going on against the airline in the Madras high court. Hence, SpiceJet was not entitled to bid and therefore, effectively there was only one bidder, he alleged. On Thursday, rejecting the Swamy’s argument, a bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh said that Spicejet Limited was neither a member of the consortium nor an “affiliate” on whose net worth, any of the members of the consortium had relied on, to meet the financial capability criteria of the bidding process. “One of the bidders who submitted the financial bid was a consortium in which the lead member was Ajay Singh, but, in his individual capacity,” the court noted. The court also said that the process of bidding was not tilted towards the Tatas as seven expressions of interest (EOI) were received in December 2020 and two bidders submitted the financial bid in September, 2021. Swamy had also contended that an investigation is ongoing against AirAsia Ltd for breach of Foreign Direct Investment and it has direct and indirect control over Talace Private Limited, a Tata Sons subsidiary that won the bid for acquiring Air India. However, the court dismissed the claim and said that Talace Private Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of Tatas and neither of them have any criminal proceedings in connection to AirAsia’s FDI breach. “Both Respondent No 6 (Talace Pvt Ltd) as well as Tata Sons Limited are Indian entities and therefore, no question arises of violation of Foreign Direct Investment Policy, in any event. Moreover, AirAsia (India) Private Limited has no interest in M/s Talace Private Limited, who is the highest bidder,” the court said. It added that no charge sheet has been filed in any criminal proceedings against AirAsia (India) Private Limited or M/s Talace Private Limited or Tata Sons Limited, as on date, in the matter pertaining to AirAsia and accordingly there is no ground for its disqualification. “In fact, in our view, the said petition is wholly irrelevant and unconnected to the present controversy,” the court added. The court said Swamy’s contention that Air India, which was a profitable enterprise until 2004, should not have been privatised neither appeals it nor is even germane to the issue of corruption as the disinvestment process was given in principle approval in 2017. The court said the challenge to the process was “highly belated” as argued by the Tatas. “This was a policy decision by the central government, taken after due deliberations, at various levels and is not open to interference in judicial review by this court… more particularly in the absence of any illegality or arbitrariness being established by the petitioner, in the decision making process..,” the court said. It accepted the submission of Solicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta, who had argued that Air India was incurring losses to the tune of ₹20 crore on a daily basis. “We also find merit in the stand of respondents that they have been working towards closing of the disinvestment process, at the earliest and any further delay shall cause loss to the public exchequer, besides creating uncertainty amongst the existing employees, with regard to their future prospects and it needs no gainsaying that public interest shall be adversely affected,” the court said. The bench said that the apprehension of rigging and corruption in the disinvestment process was based on a news report that the Union government has sought Parliament’s nod to infuse over ₹62,000 crore to its company that holds Air India’s debt, liabilities and some non-core assets, whereas in October, 2021, department of investment and public asset management secretary had stated that net liability on government after Air India’s privatisation amounted to ₹28,844 crore. The court said the article is self-explanatory and indicates the balance amounts due, including interest liabilities towards working capital and aircraft loans, lease rentals, owing to the oil companies and to the Airports Authority of India and does not read in the manner sought to be read by Swamy. The government signed the share purchase agreement with Tata Sons on October 25 last year for the sale of Air India for ₹18,000 crore. The Tatas would pay ₹2,700 crore in cash and take over ₹13,500 crore of the airline’s debt. The Tatas beat the ₹15,100-crore offer from a consortium led by SpiceJet promoter Ajay Singh and the reserve price of ₹12,906 crore set by the government for the sale of its 100% stake in the loss-making carrier.

06-01-2022||India||Security lapse', 'political gimmick': Who said what on alleged breach during PM's Punjab visit||A war of words has broken out between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress party after Prime Minister Narendra Modi cut short his Punjab over an alleged security breach during his visit to the Ferozepur district on Wednesday.Reacting sharply to the incident, several BJP leaders including Smriti Irani, Union minister Amit Shah have slammed the ruling Congress government led by Charanjit Singh Channi. Meanwhile, several opposition leaders have alleged conspiracy to defame Punjab which is set to hold assembly elections this year.Taking the severity of the incident into consideration, the ministry of external affairs has constituted a panel to probe serious lapses in security during the visit that led to the exposure of VVIP to grave risk. The Punjab government has also announced a two-member committee to probe the incident.Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called on President Ram Nath Kovind to brief him about the alleged breach. The Supreme Court also took note of the matter.What happened?On Wednesday, PM Modi was scheduled to inaugurate various development projects in the Ferozepur district. During the event, he was also scheduled to address a rally. However, it was cancelled abruptly.According to the statement by the home ministry, the PM landed at Bathinda in the morning from where he was scheduled to go to the National Martyrs Memorial at Hussainiwala by helicopter before the inauguration event.But the visit got hampered due to the rainy weather and poor visibility, security officials decided to take the road to visit the memorial. This eventually led to PM's convoy being stuck at a flyover for 15-20 minutes as activists of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Krantikari) blocked the road near village Piareana on Ferozepur-Moga road as part of their protest.Faced with the blockade, the PM's convoy drove back to Bathinda airport, resulting in the event being cancelled.Who is to blame?The central government has blamed the Congress government in Punjab for the breach. Punjab Chief Minister, however, claimed that a last-minute change of travel plans by the PM led to the situation and there was no security threat to him.What do protesting farmers say?On Thursday, the chief of a farmer outfit, which had blocked the route of the convoy in Ferozepur, said his group was told by the district police chief that the Prime Minister would be travelling by this road, but “we thought it was a bluff to get the road vacated," according to a report by ANI. “We initially thought they were bluffing us. The PM will not come. (If he comes) he will come by air as a helipad was set up there,” said Surjeet Singh Phul as per ANI report.Punjab governmentThe Punjab government has denied that a breach of security took place during the incident. Addressing a press conference on Wednesday, chief minister Channi also said that according to the initial itinerary of PM Modi's visit, there was no mention of a visit by road. "Elections are near, and it is common for people to block roads. Neither did any attack take place, nor was there any threat. It is wrong to say that the Prime Minister was in danger," he said.CongressTargeting the Prime Minister, the Congress earlier in the day tweeted: "Is it a security lapse for Punjab Chief Minister Channiji? You could also meet the protesting farmers, move forward towards the rally, but you had to create a political gimmick and defame Punjab. But like your black laws, black intentions have collapsed."प्रधानमंत्री जी - क्या ये पंजाब के मुख्यमंत्री चन्नी जी की सुरक्षा में चूक है?आप भी प्रदर्शन कर रहे किसानों से मिल सकते थे, रैली की तरफ आगे बढ़ सकते थे, मगर आपको राजनीतिक हथकंडा रचना था और पंजाब को बदनाम करना था।मगर आपके काले कानूनों की तरह काले मंसूबे भी ध्वस्त हो गए। pic.twitter.com/LPibTb0wydDemand for impartial probeMaharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik and Sikkim Chief Minister Prem Singh Tamang were among those who demanded an impartial probe into the turn of events in Punjab on Wednesday.Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) president and former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayawati said the security lapse during the prime minister's visit to Punjab was "extremely worrisome" and called for a "high-level, impartial probe" to punish the culprits and ensure that such incidents do not recur in the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/security-lapse-political-gimmick-who-said-what-on-alleged-breach-during-pm-s-punjab-visit-101641489214481.html
06-01-2022||India||Odisha woman who died a week after stroke tests positive for Omicron: Official||BHUBANESWAR: A 45-year-old housewife who died in a Bolangir hospital in Odisha on December 27 tested positive for the Omicron variant of the coronavirus disease, a senior Odisha health department official said on Thursday.She is the second person infected with the Omicron variant in the country to have died. A 73-year-old man suffering from multiple co-morbid conditions who died on December 31 was earlier classified as the first death due to the Omicron variant in the country. The Odisha woman died four days earlier.The government is treating the woman’s death to be caused by the Omicron variant of Covid-19 in line with the Supreme Court ruling on Covid-19 deaths that covers anyone dying within 30 days of testing positive for Covid, said Odisha’s director, health services, Dr Bijoy Mohapatra.Bolangir’s chief district medical officer Dr Snehalata Sahu said the woman from Agalpur block was admitted to the Bhima Bhoi Medical College and Hospital on December 20 after suffering a stroke.“After undergoing treatment at the hospital for two days, she was referred to Veer Surendra Sai Institute of Medical Sciences and Research hospital in Burla of Sambalpur district where she tested positive for Covid-19 on December 22. Her swab samples were sent for genome sequencing to Bhubaneswar, but before the results could be known she passed away on December 27,” said Dr Sahu.The Institute of Life Science in Bhubaneswar, which does genome sequencing of Covid, confirmed on Thursday that the woman was infected with the Omicron variant.Odisha has so far confirmed 71 Omicron cases, of which 5 have recovered.Dr Sahu said a health team has been sent to the woman’s house for contract tracing and will collect the swab samples of the family members.“She was asymptomatic and came to the Bolangir hospital for treatment of stroke. However, we are yet to find out whether she died due to heart attack or Omicron infection,” the CDMO said.The confirmation of Odisha’s first Omicron death came on the day the state recorded 1,897 cases, 50% more than the figure reported by the state on Wednesday. The daily positivity rate which was below 1% for most of December has risen to 2.62%.Dr Mohapatra said the State is likely to see a spurt in the Covid-19 growth rate over the next few days. “Omicron variant of the virus is prevalent in most parts of the State. Hence, the number of cases will increase further in Odisha in coming days like all other states of the country,” said Mohapatra.Mohapatra said at least 27 lakh people in the state are yet to get their first shot of the Covid vaccine while around 26 lakh people are yet to get their second dose.Odisha has suspended physical classes in schools across the State up to class 12 from January 7 to February 1. The class 10 summative assessment examination of class 10, which started on Wednesday, will continue.Night curfew from 9pm to 5am has been imposed in all urban centres of the state.

The ministry announced that the committee will be led by Sudhir Kumar Saxena, secretary (security), Cabinet Secretariat.The two other members are Balbir Singh, Joint Director, intelligence bureau, and S. Suresh, IG, special protection group (SPG).The committee is advised to submit the report at the earliest, the ministry said.Prime Minister Modi's scheduled visit to National Martyrs Memorial at Hussainiwala and a programme in Ferozepur got cancelled after his convoy was stuck on a flyover for 15-20 minutes on Wednesday. The home ministry stated that the convoy was stuck on a flyover around 30 kilometres away from the memorial of freedom fighters as the road was blocked by some protestors."This was a major lapse in the security of the Prime Minister,” the ministry said in a statement following the incident.While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has blamed the Congress-led Punjab government over the alleged security breach, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi has maintained that there were no lapses in the security. Channi argued that the road was blocked by some unarmed protesting farmers, saying they were no threat to life for PM Modi.A state BJP delegation earlier called on Punjab governor Banwarilal Purohit and demanded that deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, who holds the home portfolio, and acting director-general of police Sidharth Chattopadhyaya be sacked immediately over the alleged security lapse.Samyukt Kisan Morcha said in a statement that some affiliated farmer organisations had announced a symbolic protest over the arrest of Union minister Ajay Mishra Teni and other outstanding demands. SKM stated that farmers had no concrete information that the PM's convoy was going to pass through the flyover where it got stuck."It's clear from video of the occasion that protesting farmers didn't even make any effort to go towards PM's convoy. Only a group with BJP flag& raising 'Narendra Modi Zindabad' slogan had reached near that convoy. Therefore, threat to the life of PM seems completely concocted," it claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-forms-3-member-committee-to-probe-into-pm-modi-s-security-lapse-101641483189509.html

China’s state-run media also played up New Year celebrations by People’s Liberation Army (PLA) troops at Galwan Valley, the scene of a brutal clash in June 2020.Also Read: In China moving goalposts, India sees a not-so-new plan to drag Ladakh frictionExternal affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said the government has been closely monitoring the construction of the bridge on Pangong Lake by the Chinese side. “This bridge is being constructed in areas that have been under illegal occupation by China for around 60 years now. As you are well aware India has never accepted such illegal occupation,” he told during a regular media briefing.The government has been taking “all necessary steps to ensure that our security interests are fully protected”, Bagchi said. As part of these efforts over the past seven years, the government has been significantly funding for developing border infrastructure and “completed more roads and bridges than ever before”, he said.These actions have provided much-needed connectivity to the local population and logistical support to the armed forces, and the government remains committed to this objective, he said.Recent satellite imagery has shown that the Chinese bridge spanning a narrow section of the 134-km lake is nearly complete. Experts believe it will drastically reduce the time needed by the Chinese side to move troops and equipment from in-depth bases to forward locations near the LAC.Referring to the letter written by the Chinese embassy’s political counsellor to Indian MPs and ministers over their participation in the event focused on Tibet, Bagchi said: “The substance, tone and tenor of the letter are inappropriate. The Chinese side should note that India is a vibrant democracy and [the] MPs, as representatives of the people, undertake activities as per their views and beliefs.”He added, “We expect the Chinese side to refrain from hyping normal activities by [the] MPs and complicate further the situation in our bilateral relations.”The Tibetan Parliament-in-Exile and the India Tibet Coordination Office had organised a dinner reception on December 22 to announce the revival of the All-Party Indian Parliamentary Forum for Tibet. The meeting was attended by social justice minister Ramdas Athawale, minister of state for skill development Rajeev Chandrasekhar, and nine members of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, including Maneka Gandhi, Jairam Ramesh and Manish Tewari.Subsequently, the Chinese embassy’s political counsellor, Zhou Yongsheng, sent the letter to the MPs and ministers expressing his country’s concern over their participation in the meeting.Also Read: At Line of Actual Control counter China’s belligerence | Editorial“As is known to all, the so-called ‘Tibetan Government in-exile’ is an out-and-out separatist political group and an illegal organization completely in violation of China’s Constitution and laws. It is not recognized by any country in the world. Tibet has been an inseparable part of China since ancient times, and Tibet-related affairs are purely China’s internal affairs that allow no foreign interference,” the strongly worded letter said, adding that the lawmakers should refrain from providing support to “Tibetan independence” forces.Bagchi also referred to the Chinese side naming 15 places in Arunachal Pradesh last week, and described it as a “ridiculous exercise to support untenable territorial claims”.He said, “Calling Tuting as ‘DouDeng’ or river Siyom as ‘XiYueMu’ or even Kibithu as ‘Daba’ does not alter the fact that Arunachal Pradesh has always been and will always remain an inalienable part of India. We hope that instead of engaging in such antics China will work constructively with us to resolve the outstanding friction points in areas along the western sector of the LAC in India-China border areas.”

With Thursday's surge, the positivity rate in the city stood at 29.90%. On Wednesday, Mumbai reported 15,166 new infections which was the highest daily count since the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020. On Thursday, as it was expected, the daily caseload breached the 20,000-mark. Mumbai's Dharavi, which is Asia's biggest slum area, on Thursday reported 107 fresh infections, which is also the highest in Dharavi since the beginning of the pandemic.On April 4, 2021, Mumbai had logged 11,163 Covid-19 cases, which was the highest daily spike before Wednesday.Will Mumbai see a huge spike in Covid cases in 10 days?

The spokesperson for the ministry of external affairs told a regular press briefing that the bridge is being constructed in areas that have been under illegal occupation by China for around 60 years.HT earlier reported on the emergence of satellite images showing the construction of a new bridge by the Chinese side linking the north and south banks of Pangong Lake. The bridge over the narrow section of the 134 km lake is reported to be almost complete and is expected to enhance the road connectivity for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA).“Government of India monitoring this closely. This bridge is being constructed in areas that have been under illegal occupation by China for around 60 years. The government is taking steps to ensure our security interests are protected,” MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said.The ministry also dismissed the reports of Chinese soldiers hoisting its national flag in Galwan Valley as “factually incorrect”. Chinese state media earlier posted videos of PLA soldiers hoisting their national flag at an unknown location, claiming it was Galwan Valley.“Media houses in India have released pictures contradicting the claim,” Bagchi said.The ministry also flagged the tone and tenor of a letter by the Chinese embassy to Indian lawmakers over their participation in an event hosted by the Tibetan Parliament-in-Exile. The Chinese embassy had asked some of the members of the All-Party Indian Parliamentary Forum for Tibet to refrain from providing support to Tibetan forces.“The substance, tone and tenor of the letter are inappropriate. The Chinese side should note that India is a vibrant democracy and Indian MPs as representatives of people undertake activities as per their beliefs,” Bagchi said.“We expect the Chinese side to refrain from hyping the normal activities by Indian MPs and complicate further the situation in our bilateral relations,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/area-under-illegal-occupation-for-60-years-india-on-chinese-bridge-over-pangong-lake-101641472744356.html

The National Commission for Women on Thursday said it has taken cognisance of the incident and chairperson Rekha Sharma has written to UP DGP to immediately investigate the veracity of the viral video and take appropriate action."@NCWIndia has taken cognizance of the incident. Chairperson @sharmarekha has written to @dgpup to immediately investigate the veracity of this viral video and take appropriate action. The action taken must be apprised to the Commission at the earliest," it said in a tweet.The workshop took place in Uttar Pradesh's Muzzaffarnagar. HT Online did not independently verify the authenticity of the viral video. This video is too disgusting to post. But I think this should reach everyone! Shame on you #JavedHabib pic.twitter.com/aP9HJjYiJ9In the vial video, Jawed Habib can be seen using his saliva as he was parting the hair of the woman and said, 'If you don't have water...this spit has life." There were instant reactions from the audience which, however, turned into thunderous applause. Another video of the woman recounting the experience has also surfaced on social media. In that video, she identified herself as Pooja Gupta, an owner of a beauty parlour. "Yesterday I attended a workshop of Jawed Habib sir. There he invited me on the stage to give me a haircut and he misbehaved with me. He said if there is no water in your parlour, you can use spit. I did not get my haircut. It's better I will go to my streetside barber and get a hair cut, but won't go to Habib's," Pooja Gupta said. In an interview to TV channels, the woman said, "I attended the workshop to learn something. But he was not answering my questions. Then he called me to the stage to teach hair cutting. He pushed my head, I objected and said I have cervical issues. Then he spat twice on my hair and said that if you don't have water in your parlour then you can spit. My husband was making the video. After I came down from the stage, Habib's assistant said he was just joking."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/video-of-jawed-habib-spitting-on-woman-s-hair-goes-viral-women-s-commission-takes-note-101641471514497.html

Their response to every proposal from the Indian side has been different. Their goalposts keep changing and we aren’t even sure which of their proposals should be taken seriously,” one of the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.Beijing’s dithering has continued despite a decision at the last meeting of the India-China Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs on November 18 that the 14th round talks between military commanders should be held at “an early date to achieve the objective of complete disengagement from all the friction points along the LAC...in accordance with the existing bilateral agreements and protocols”.At the 13th round of talks between military commanders, the people said, the two sides were close to forward movement on disengagement at Hot Spring. However, the Chinese side was represented by the deputy to the corps commander, who stayed away, and the deputy was not authorised to make a decision, the people added.A statement issued by India after the last talks had noted that “the Indian side...made constructive suggestions for resolving the remaining areas but the Chinese side was not agreeable and also could not provide any forward-looking proposals”.These tactics adopted by China, coupled with mounting evidence of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) beefing up infrastructure, roads, bridges, helipads, dual-use airports and missile and air defence positions on its side in Ladakh sector, has forced the Indian security establishment to conclude that the Chinese side is not serious about the negotiations.“They seem intent on dragging this process out. They aren’t serious about disengagement,” a second person said, referring to the Chinese side’s responses to the agenda items communicated by the Indian side.Tens of thousands of Indian and Chinese troops have dug in for the second successive winter in the Ladakh sector, with no immediate signs of an end to the standoff that began in May 2020 and resulted in the first fatalities along the LAC since 1975. Twenty Indian soldiers and at least four Chinese troops were killed in a brutal clash at Galwan Valley in June 2020.The two sides withdrew frontline troops at Pangong Lake and Gogra last year after several rounds of talks, but there has been no headway in disengagement at other friction points since August 2021. India has linked the normalisation of overall ties with China to the resolution of the standoff.The latest evidence of the PLA settling in for thelong haul was satellite imagery showing a new bridge being built to link the north and south banks of Pangong Lake in order to drastically cut down the time needed to deploy large numbers of troops from positions in depth to key friction points. The Chinese side has also built or improved roads and bridges in multiple sectors, including repaving existing roads constructing alternate routes.India China friction pointsThe area between Depsang and Chumar has several friction points. PLA troops have sought to block Indian patrols for more than two years in the strategic Depsang region, some 30 km south of Daulat Beg Oldi, which is home to a key airbase. Depsang also witnessed a three-week-long standoff in 2013.At Chumar, the key problem has been Chinese construction activities around Chepzi-Chumar road. This area too witnessed a brief face-off in 2014 that began on the eve of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to India.Another friction point is Demchok, which too witnessed a standoff in November 2016.

What scientists say||Mumbai is expected to cross 20,000 Covid cases on Thursday, Maharashtra Covid task force member Dr Shashank Joshi said urging the citizens to mask up and avoid unnecessary travel. India is seeing an exponential rise in the number of daily Covid infections, contributed by the huge spike being recorded by the states. Maharashtra on Wednesday reported 26,538 fresh Covid cases; the tally in Mumbai was 15,166. The city is likely to add around 20,000 cases on Thursday, Dr Joshi said on his social media. Mumbai expected to cross 20k cases today ,stay home if not essential ,properly mask and stay connected with your doctor if symptomatic. Be Vigilant ,Be Alert Stay Safe .Most cases are still mild 🙏Protect the vulnerables🙏Be Responsible 🙏Analysing the case trajectory of Mumbai, IIT professor Manindra Agarwal said the current parameter values suggest that a peak is going to take place around January 15, which is around 10 days away. "Need to wait for a few more days for parameters to stabilise (of course, if lockdowns are imposed, it will change the parameters again)," Agarwal wrote on his social media. According to his projection, Mumbai will record over 25,000 daily infections between January 15 and January 20. In the last week of January, the curve will start to be flattened and in the middle of February, the number of cases will again go below 5,000. Agarwal, however, said India's trajectory is rising faster than it was projected earlier.Also Read: Maharashtra won't see 100% lockdown as of now, says health minister Current parameter values suggest a peak around 15th Jan.

Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar on Tuesday said a lockdown will be necessary if the daily Covid-19 cases in the city cross 20,000. Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday said 100% lockdown is not required in the state as hospitalisation has not gone up.Maharashtra health department on Thursday said there is no consideration of lockdown as of now. Further lockdown-like restrictions will be considered only if the medical oxygen demand goes beyond 800 metric tonnes per day.The Union health ministry has noted that the increase of Covid-19 cases in the country is exponential with Omicron emerging as the dominant strain in cities.Scientists and experts are saying that the coming few weeks are crucial. As seen in other countries, the Omicron-driven surge is not staying for long. Since a surge has already begun in India, experts think it will peak in the coming two weeks and then will gradually die down.Niti Aayog member (health) Dr VK Paul said, "In Denmark, the UK and South Africa, cases started declining within a month or a month and a half. We cannot say this clearly for our population. How it behaves will depend on past infections, the vaccination status and our own characteristics and population density. It cannot be extrapolated that just like the cases behaved there within a month, it will happen here also.""Saying it at this stage that it will go on till which point and for how long will be premature. If any scientific data comes, we will share it. I would not venture into that except to say that like the previous waves, different parts of our nation will be in different stages. It starts in some states and then goes on and on. We are watching the dynamics of the pandemic carefully," Dr Paul added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-mumbai-see-a-huge-spike-in-covid-cases-in-10-days-what-scientists-say-101641468590224.html

He said the government is in constant touch with experts and will go by their recommendations. “We are closely monitoring the situation. As of now, there is no need to shut schools and colleges. The government will go by the advice of the core committee on pandemic and experts’ opinion,” he said in the state capital. After neighbouring Tamil Nadu and Karnataka tightened measures to check the spread of the new variant, there was pressure on Kerala as well. Experts last week said night curfew would not do any good in Kerala as travel and movement during night hours was limited in the state. On Thursday, the country witnessed a big jump in Omicron cases with highest single-day rise of 495, taking the total number of cases to 2630. Maharashtra topped with 797 cases, Delhi 465, Rajasthan 236 and Kerala 234. The country also reported highest number of new coronavirus cases on Thursday, 90,928, the highest in six months. On Thursday, the state reported 50 new cases of Omicron taking the total to 280. This is the highest single-day tally since the first case of Omicron was reported on December 7. Of the new cases, 45 came from at-risk countries and 5 came from low- risk countries, said the minister. Among new cases, 18 are reported from Ernakulam, Thiruvananthapuram 8 and Pathanamthitta 7 cases. Among the 50 new cases, the maximum (13) came from the United Arab Emirates. The minister asked people to continue to be careful. “The time is not right to lower our vigil. We have to ensure Covid-appropriate behavior strictly,” said the minister adding the state is well prepared with enough oxygen stock and beds. Experts have warned that Omicron cases would peak in the state in two months.The government said it has taken enough precautions to meet the exigency.

There were 19 children below the age of five on the flight. Children under 5 years of age are exempted from post-arrival testing, according to the union health ministry guidelines on international travel.An airport official said the 160 remaining passengers this flight were tested for Covid-19 using the RT-PCR test at the airport.“160 passengers were tested after arrival out of which 125 of them have tested positive.” one official at Amritsar airport said.“These 125 passengers of the chartered flight are being sent for institutional quarantine in their respective districts,” said VK Seth, airport director of Amritsar airport.Initial reports of the large number of passengers testing positive for Covid-19 suggested the plane was operated by Air India. The airline rebutted this version. “Several media houses has reported that passengers of Air India flight from Rome to Amritsar have been tested Covid positive. This is wrong and baseless.

A doctor from Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on Thursday also raised concerns on the same, saying that the capital city "cannot handle" the burden of overwhelmed medical staff."Say, we have 25 million (people) in Delhi, even if 1% hospitalised, Delhi NCR cannot handle it," Dr P Sarat Chandra, professor of neurology at AIIMS, was quoted as saying by ANI. "We cannot have a double jeopardy of health care workers also collapsing," he added.Stressing on the need to protect our healthcare workers, Dr Chandra said in his unit "almost 50 per cent residents are sick, they have mild symptoms, but they have not been able to work...We cannot afford doctors falling sick." "They (medical staff) have to take full precautions because they are the frontline soldiers," Dr Chandra stressed.Further speaking, the professor urged everyone to actively follow health protocol to curb the rapidly spreading infection. "Even if 1 per cent of the population requires hospitalisation, it would be a huge number. So it's our responsibility to not let our guards down thinking it's a mild infection," he also said, as per the ANI report.Over a score of medical staff in Delhi have tested positive for viral infections over the last few weeks, according to a report by news agency ANI. In AIIMS, at least 50 doctors have tested Covid positive, while 26 others have been diagnosed with the disease at the Safdarjung Hospital.In Ram Manohar Lohia hospital, forty-five healthcare workers, including 38 doctors, have contracted Covid in the last few days, ANI reported quoting officials.At the North Delhi Municipal Corporation-run Hindu Rao Hospital at least 20 doctors have contracted Covid while at the Delhi government-run Lok Nayak Hospital it is seven, according to the report.Meanwhile, in view of the alarming spike in daily Covid cases, the Delhi government on Wednesday increased the number of beds at nine hospitals.

The flight had 179 passengers on board. This comes amid heightened testing at all airports across the country, especially those that receive international passengers. India earlier identified several countries as ‘at risk’ in the wake of the outbreak of Omicron. Italy was one of them.Airport director VK Seth has confirmed the number of passengers who were found Covid positive on Thursday.  The flight was a chartered flight though earlier it was reported that it belonged to Air India. "Several Media houses have reported that Passengers of Air India flight from Rome to Amritsar have been tested covid positive. This is wrong and baseless. Air India doesn't operate any flight from Rome currently," Air India tweeted.The Centre on Thursday wrote to 9 states and UTs to step up testing as the country is battling possible a fresh wave of the pandemic. Punjab is one of the states where insufficient testing has been flagged.On Thursday, India recorded the biggest single-day jump of 495 Omicron cases, taking the total tally of the new variant to 2,630, according to the health ministry data. Health ministry officials have said that in bigger cities Omicron has become the predominant strain.So many passengers testing positive like a cluster outbreak throw a major challenge for the airport officials.In Mumbai, hundreds of passengers on board the Cordelia cruise ship that returned from Goa tested positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/125-passengers-of-air-india-s-italy-amritsar-flight-test-covid-positive-101641462073648.html

Pointing out that the Prime Minister is a key representative of the country, the defence minister said that such lapses in his security have to be considered a serious matter.“In Punjab, there were lapses in the Prime Minister's security,” said Rajnath Singh during the ‘Vijay Sankalp Yatra’ in Uttarakhand. “Yet the Congress is talking nonsense. The Prime Minister is a representative of the country; such lapses in his security are a serious matter.”The defence minister addressed the crowd gathered at the public rally and asked, “I want to ask you whether Congress should be forgiven for this.”पंजाब में प्रधानमंत्री की सुरक्षा में चूक हुई, मगर कांग्रेस के द्वारा अनाप-शनाप बातें की जा रही है। प्रधानमंत्री देश का प्रतिनिधि होता है, उसकी सुरक्षा में चूक हो जाना गंभीर मामला है। मैं आपसे पूछना चाहता हूँ कि क्या ऐसी कांग्रेस को माफ़ किया जाना चाहिए। श्री @rajnathsingh जी pic.twitter.com/6aUm3ytwheFurther pointing out the grave nature of the security lapses, Rajnath Singh said, “The Prime Minister of India is not a person, he is an institution.

As per procedure, they have to make necessary arrangements for logistics, security as well as keep a contingency plan ready.”The MHA has demanded a detailed report in this regard from intelligence agencies and is seeking details of deployment, picket, rooftop deployment, barricades, and other security measures taken by Punjab Police during the Prime Minister's visit, the senior official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/should-congress-be-forgiven-rajnath-singh-on-pm-s-security-lapse-in-punjab-101641459713800.html

Court documents, however, did not disclose details of the colleges they were studying in.The trio were the last offenders linked to the case to be dealt with in court.Their accomplices, including Tirth Singh, 22; Tenzing Ugyen Lama Sherpa, 23; Mukherjee Sukanya, 24; and Jaspreet Singh, 26, were handed sentences by the court earlier, the report said.According to a statement from the Singapore Police Force, the group faced charges linked to the retention of proceeds by a transnational criminal syndicate that was perpetrating "tech support scams".In 2020, Tenzing introduced Giri and Nandi to a money laundering scheme in which participants were allowed access to their bank accounts to receive cash."(Nandi) was instructed to recruit individuals who were willing to use their bank accounts to receive monies as coordinated by (people known as) 'Sandeep Jha' and 'Aman Kumar'. (Nandi) was promised a commission of 2 per cent of the monies received (and he) agreed," Deputy Public Prosecutor Matthew Choo said.Sometime in August 2020, Akash overheard three of his housemates discussing and came onboard.Nandi, Giri and Akash later carried on the business of providing cross-border money transfers in Singapore.The trio received cash in their bank accounts, before transferring them out to people, including their accomplices, according to the report.On September 16, 2020, Singapore's Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) received a complaint from a victim in Canada, stating that he had lost more than SGD12,500 after falling prey to a scam, the police said.The offenders were caught after CAD officers conducted a raid at their home on September 22 last year.The three men who were dealt with in court on Wednesday have made no restitution, the report added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/singapore-jails-3-indian-students-in-transnational-money-mule-syndicate-case-101641461223297.html

All four are students and in their early 20s.Here is what we know about those behind the Bulli Bai app1. Niraj Bishnoi, arrested on Thursday, is apparently the main conspirator in the case. Bishnoi, a resident of Jorhat who studies in Bhopal, is also the creator of the "Bulli Bai" app on the platform GitHub as well as the main Twitter account holder of "Bulli Bai". Bishnoi is a second-year B.Tech student from the Vellore Institute of Technology in the Madhya Pradesh capital.2. The Mumbai Police made the earlier arrests. Shweta Singh, a 19-year-old woman, arrested from Uttarakhand, was said to be another mastermind of the case. Reports said she was planning to pursue an engineering course after her class 12. She had lost her father to Covid recently.3. A 21-year-old engineering student, Vishal Kumar Jha, was arrested from Bengaluru was arrested earlier. Vishal Kumar's lawyer said his client has been falsely implicated in the case.Bulli Bai row: 'I am the real mastermind', claims Twitter user; asks police to stop targeting 'innocent' people4. Mayank Rawal (21), another conspirator, was arrested from Uttarakhand. He is a student of Delhi University, studying Chemistry honours from Zakir Hussain College. He is the son of Army Subedar Pradeep Rawat. He admitted to the police that he had received a link on Twitter on December 31 and was asked to join. He said he took some screenshots and shared them on his timeline.What is the Nepal connection of Bulli Bai?Police said Shweta Singh was acting on the instructions of some Twitter user 'Giyou' who is based in Nepal. "You have arrested the wrong person, Mumbai police. I am the creator of #BulliBaiApp. Got nothing to do with the two innocents whom u arrested, release them asap," the user, who goes by the handle @giyu44, said in a tweet.What is the Sikh connection of Bulli Bai?The accused shared photos from the Bulli Bai app on Twitter by using handles like @bullibai_, @sage0x11, @jatkhalsa7, @wannabesigmaf, @jatkhalsa and @Sikh_khalsa11. Police said Sikh names were used on the online platform deliberately to mislead people about their identity. "As per the status of the handle (linked to the app), it says Bulli Bai is a community-driven open source app by Khalsa Sikh Force. So why this (alias) is there, that is part of our investigation," Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-created-bulli-bai-4-arrests-made-so-far-all-students-101641460345356.html

The central government urged the states and the UT to ramp up Covid-19 testing to ensure that infected people do not spread the highly contagious Omicron variant.In a letter dated January 5, additional secretary of Union health ministry Arti Ahuja said that the decline in Covid-19 testing and rise in positivity rate is a “cause of concern”. She underlined that the true level of virus spread in the community is impossible to determine in absence of sufficient testing. The official advised them to ensure the availability of sufficient stock of testing kits and prompt arrangement of testing facilities, consumables and logistics."With the increased detection of the Variant of Concern (VOC), Omicron, and a majority of countries seeing multiple surges in cases despite high levels of vaccination, there is a need for continued vigil and efforts to prevent any deterioration of the Covid-19 scenario,” Ahuja said in the letter to Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Bihar, and Jammu and Kashmir."Keeping in mind the unpredictable and highly transmissible behaviour of Omicron and the larger preponderance of asymptomatic cases, ramping up testing in the initial days itself will help to ensure that the infected individual does not spread the virus to others," she added.India reported over 90,000 new Covid-19 cases and the biggest single-day jump of 495 Omicron cases in the last 24 hours, the Union ministry of health and family welfare said on Thursday morning. A total of 2,630 confirmed cases of Omicron has been reported in India so far, according to the health ministry data.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cause-of-concern-centre-on-decline-in-covid-19-testing-in-9-states-ut-amid-omicron-surge-101641460281362.html

The bulk of those infected have shown no or only mild symptoms and have recovered quickly at home, officials said.The federal health ministry on Wednesday identified Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai and Bengaluru as some of the main regions of concern, although state officials worry the disease will soon spread to the countryside where health facilities are weaker.Kolkata, a city of about 15 million, accounted for half of the new cases in the eastern state of West Bengal until a few days ago, but cases are now rising in neighbouring districts. The state has reported one of the highest rates of infections in India."We are watching the situation in the districts and rural belts where the numbers are also growing," said Ajay Chakraborty, director of the West Bengal health services who has isolated himself at home after contracting the virus.Many Covid beds in Kolkata were still empty, Chakraborty said. In the government-run Infectious Diseases and Beliaghata General Hospital, only 75 admissions were recorded on Tuesday despite more than 9,000 new cases, he added.In the west, Mumbai recorded a new daily infection peak of 15,166 on Wednesday, well up on its previous high of just over 11,000 hit last year. Nearly 90% of new patients had shown no symptoms and only 8% were hospitalised, city officials said in a daily health bulletin.Covid-19 cases nearly doubled in a day in Delhi to 10,665 on Wednesday, but the state said only 7% of its Covid beds were occupied.Federal health officials, however, have warned even a large number of mild cases could put pressure on the health system.India has confirmed at least 2,135 Omicron cases and one death linked to the variant, in an elderly man who was suffering from diabetes.Daily Covid-19 deaths rose by 325 on Thursday, taking the total to 482,876. Total infections are at 35.11 million, only behind the U.S. tally.As cases rise, the western state of Gujarat on Thursday indefinitely postponed a Jan. 10-12 biennial investment summit that was to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and previously attended by the country's top billionaires. Modi's home state reported 3,350 infections on Wednesday.Many Indian cities have already imposed night curfews and weekend lockdowns, as well as closed schools. Political rallies, however, have continued in several states where elections are due in the next few weeks and months.Health authorities will discuss the matter with election commission officials on Thursday amid rising concerns about such rallies that led to a devastating second wave in the country in April and May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/omicron-spreads-in-delhi-mumbai-kolkata-but-hospitalisations-still-low-101641458265261.html

I worked till 3am to convince farmers to clear all routes. All roads were cleared by Wednesday morning.

It should be condemned," Gehlot said on Twitter.The Bhartiya Kisan Union (Krantikari), one of the 32 farm organisations involved in the year-long protests against the now repealed farm laws, took responsibility for the blockade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-pm-modi-security-breach-supreme-court-to-hear-petition-tomorrow-101641448846838.html

06-01-2022||India||Rahul Gandhi may return to India from foreign trip in second week of Jan: Report||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who is on a ‘personal visit’ abroad, is likely to return to India on the second week of January ahead of the high-profile assembly elections in five states this year, reported the ANI news agency. The former Congress president had embarked on the trip in December, months before the crucial state elections which are lined up for the months of February and March. Although the party did not disclose the place of his visit, reports suggested that Gandhi had gone to Italy.Preparations of the assembly elections in five states – Goa, Manipur, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand – are already in full swing. They are being considered as a crucial test for the Congress, not only in terms of its ability to contain the BJP but also for the space as the main challenger to the ruling party at the Centre.Among the poll-bound states, Congress is seen to have better prospects in Punjab and Uttarakhand but the situation has been complicated over a series of decisions over the past few weeks, according to the news agency. The party is witnessing infighting in both the states and Rahul Gandhi, who takes crucial decisions without a formal senior party position, is being seen as “missing from action”, the report said.Now, the Congress leader is likely to return to the country next week and take charge of the situation himself, reports the ANI news agency, citing party functionaries familiar with the matter. According to the report, Gandhi is in touch with senior officials of the party and has taken stock of the entire electoral situation across several states.Notably, Rahul Gandhi had earlier too travelled abroad just ahead of the winter session of Parliament and is learnt to have returned a day before the commencement of the session. Meanwhile, his foreign trips have been panned by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and other parties in a move to secure the electoral positions ahead of polls.Mamata Banerjee, whose party is keen to emerge as the main challenger to BJP, had said taken a swipe at Rahul Gandhi and said no one can do politics by staying abroad “half the time”.Congress general secretary Randeep Surjewala, however,  said that Rahul Gandhi is on “a brief personal visit” and that the BJP and “its media friends” should not spread rumours unnecessarily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-may-return-to-india-from-foreign-trip-in-second-week-of-jan-report-101641432950104.html

Raids were carried out at 40 places, including the premises of Jain, on December 31. Pushpraj is a member of the legislative council in Uttar Pradesh as a Samajwadi Party nominee. He launched the Samajwadi ittar (perfume) on November 9.“Evidence found in the sales office and main office has revealed that the group makes 35% to 40% of its retail sales in cash by ‘kucha’ (temporary) bills and these cash receipts are not recorded in the regular books of account, running into crores of rupees. Evidence of booking purchases from bogus parties to the extent of about ₹5 crore has also been unearthed,” it added.The SP, on the day of the raids, said the I-T action was an “open misuse of central agencies by a scared Bharatiya Janata Party” ahead of polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-dept-45-cr-undeclared-income-found-in-raids-on-sp-mlc-101641434406581.html
06-01-2022||India||20-yr-old from U’khand is 3rd arrest in GitHub case||Three people have been arrested so far in connection with webpages where hundreds of Muslim women were “auctioned”, the Mumbai Police said on Wednesday, apprehending a 20-year-old a day after two accused were arrested from Bengaluru and Uttarakhand.The police said the accused appeared to have used names related to the Sikh community in their Twitter handles which promoted the webpages in order to mislead people about their identity and add a communal angle.“The probe is on and anyone involved in the crime directly or indirectly will be arrested and prosecuted,” Mumbai Police commissioner Hemant Nagrale said. Some more people were likely to be involved in the matter, he said at a news briefing.Eighteen-year-old Shweta Singh, who is understood to be the main accused, created some of the social media handles that promoted the webpages. On Wednesday, her friend Mayank Rawat, 20, was also arrested from Uttarakhand. Vishal Kumar Jha, 21, was detained from Bengaluru on Monday and arrested a day later.The Mumbai Police are probing two such controversial webpages hosted on the code sharing platform, GitHub. The first web page was floated in July 2021 and the second, Bulli Bai, surfaced on January 1. The webpages, which were named after derogatory references to the Muslim community, sparked outrage because hundreds of Muslim women – most of whom were vocal activists or top professionals – were listed for “auction” along with their photographs, which were sourced without permission and doctored.When asked if Sikh names were used by social media handles which promoted the webpages, Nagrale said it appeared that such attempts were made. Some of these handles had names such as “Khalsa Supremacist”, “Jatinder Singh Bhullar” and “Harpal’, he said. “As per the status of the handle (linked to the app), it says Bulli Bai is a community driven open source app by Khalsa Sikh force. So why this is there, that is part of our investigation,” the commissioner said. “It is too early to say exactly what was the aim of the entire exercise,” he added.“Jha was using the Twitter handle by name Khalsa Supermecist and was using a proxy location from Canada to misguide the law enforcement agencies. He would use such fake names to regularly post messages on Twitter,” an officer involved in the probe said. The officer said there was an attempt to give a communal angle to the webpages.Nagrale said: “In order to ensure that no such incident is repeated again we urge people and the especially the victims of Bulli Bai or any such crime or incident to report the matter to police and share information.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/20yrold-from-u-khand-is-3rd-arrest-in-github-case-101641433414996.html

The total death toll in the state has touched 6,174 with the death rate remaining at 0.99 per cent.The 35-year-old man, who returned from Saudi hails from Hojai district, was found infected with the Omicron variant, Health Minister Keshab Mahanta said.His sample was sent to the Jorhat-based North East Institute of Science and Technology as he had tested positive for Covid-19 after his return from the West Asian country, the minister said."His report for genome sequencing came during the day. But by this time, he has already recovered from the infection," Mahanta said.A teenager from Digaru area in Kamrup metropolitan district had also tested positive for the new strain of coronavirus, but his sample was taken to Meghalaya, the minister said."Once we were alerted about his status, we started contact tracing of his family members and others. All protocols are being followed," Mahanta said.The minister said the state government has been monitoring international travelers with rising cases of Omicron variant in the country.During the period between December 1, 2021 and January 4 this year, 3,198 people had entered the northeastern state from foreign countries, and of them, 52 were found infected with Covid-19, including the one who contracted the Omicron strain, the minister said.Since December 12, the state has sent 1,598 samples of Covid-positive patients to a Kolkata laboratory for genome sequencing, he said.Of these, reports of 1,348 samples have been received, and all were found negative for the new variant, the minister said, adding that besides monitoring the situation in view of the rising Omicron cases in the country, the authorities are also gearing up to tackle any increase in overall Covid infections.He pointed out that the state had reported 150 and 156 new Covid-19 cases on January 1 and 2 respectively, and the numbers had shot up to 351 and 475 on the next two consecutive days, with the most infections being reported from Kamrup Metropolitan district.The district comprises the state's largest city Guwahati. Mahanta said the government is strengthening infrastructure in hospitals and Covid care centers to manage hospitalization of at least 25,000 patients.At least 8,539 beds, including 4,991 isolation and 935 ICU beds, are already ready, the minister said, adding that only five per cent of these beds are currently occupied."We will hold a meeting with the chief minister on Thursday morning. Decisions on how to tackle the emerging situation will be taken," Mahanta added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-reports-1st-omicron-case-in-state-591-new-covid-19-infections-in-24-hours-101641432814931.html
06-01-2022||India||War of words, Channi govt in dock over PM Modi convoy collapse||An unprecedented breach in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s security in Punjab on Wednesday sparked a major political row with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) saying the Congress was targeting the PM and putting him in harm’s way, and the ruling party in the state blaming a last-minute schedule change for the lapse.Union home minister Amit Shah attacked the Congress, saying it owed an apology to the people, and the home ministry has asked the Punjab government for a detailed report, even as several BJP leaders said the buck must stop with the state’s chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi.“Today’s Congress-made happening in Punjab is a trailer of how this party thinks and functions. Repeated rejections by the people have taken them to the path of insanity,” he said, adding that the home ministry sought a detailed report on the incident.Channi dismissed the allegations, and said his government had no information about the PM’s plan to travel via road from Bathinda airport to Ferozepur.“There was no prior information. I worked till 3am to convince farmers to clear all routes. All roads were cleared by Wednesday morning. Had they told us about the road travel in advance, we would have made proper arrangements,” Channi told reporters. “We respect our PM...there was no security lapse of any kind and there was no situation of any attack.”Modi was travelling by road from Bathinda to the National Martyrs Memorial at Hussainiwala, around 120km away. He was supposed to take a helicopter, but inclement weather force prevented the chopper from taking off. After travelling for about 100km, the PM’s convoy was blocked by around 200 protesters near Piareana village in Ferozepur district on the Moga-Ferozepur national highway.After being stuck for around 15-20 minutes, the PM headed back to Bathinda airport, cancelling his visit to the memorial and a rally in Ferozepur.Punjab goes to the polls in early 2022.BJP president JP Nadda accused the Punjab government of trying all “possible tricks” to scuttle the PM’s programme. “Protesters were given access to the PM’s route while the Punjab CS (chief secretary) and DGP (director general of police) gave assurances to SPG (special protection group) that the route is clear,” Nadda tweeted.He also claimed that Channi refused to get on the phone to address the matter.Congress accused the BJP of “doing politics” over the issue. Channi alleged that the attendance at the BJP’s rally in Ferozepur was thin, and that only 700 people had turned up for arrangements made keeping 70,000 people in mind. “May be this was why the PM decided to go back,” he added.“Modi ji, How’s the Josh?” tweeted Youth Congress chief BV Srinivas -- a statement that led to strong criticism from BJP leaders, including Union minister Smriti Irani and Rajya Sabha MP Sudhanshu Trivedi.Former Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar broke ranks with his party colleagues. “It is against Punjabiyat. A secure passage for the Prime Minister of India to address BJP’s political rally in Ferozepur should have been ensure. That’s how democracy works,” he said.Former chief minister Amarinder Singh, a BJP ally, called for Channi’s resignation, and asked for President’s Rule in the state.At a press conference in Delhi, Irani said there was a need to answer questions on who gave a false go-ahead to the cavalcade and who leaked information about the PM’s route. “Who in the Punjab government gave information about the Prime Minister‘s route to individuals who planted themselves atop the flyover?” she asked.“I am sure the nation shares our outrage at this incident. We know that the Congress party hates Modi but today they tried to harm the PM of India. Such is the breakdown of law and order in the state of Punjab that the DGP police claims he is incapable of providing security support to the Prime Minister‘s office, the Prime Minister security detail,” she added.The Shiromani Akali Dal, an erstwhile ally of the BJP, said there was a complete breakdown in law and order. “The CM is incompetent to run the state,” said Sukhbir Singh Badal, SAD chief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/war-of-words-channi-govt-in-dock-over-pm-modi-convoy-collapse-101641432453890.html

06-01-2022||India||NEET-PG: Demands by docs genuine, says Supreme Court||The Supreme Court on Wednesday said that the demands of resident doctors to hold counselling for NEET-PG seats were “genuine” as it set out to examine the Centre’s request to allow the process pending a constitutional challenge to the introduction of reservation for other backward classes (OBC) and economically weaker section (EWS) in all-India quota seats for graduate and postgraduate medical courses.Resident doctors who have qualified for postgraduate courses have been protesting the delay in counselling because the matter of reservations is pending in court.“We want to bring an end to this uncertainty as there is a genuine demand from resident doctors,” said a bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and AS Bopanna which began to hear the petitioners on the short question of allowing counselling for NEET-PG courses. In October last year, counselling was stalled after the Centre put in abeyance pending the legal challenge to a July 29, 2021 order introducing 27% OBC quota and 10% EWS quota in 15% undergraduate medical courses and 50% PG seats under all India quota (AIQ).Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, told the bench: “When we made the statement (putting counselling on hold), we did not anticipate this situation. We are at a stage where counselling is stuck and we need to respond to the bona fide demands of resident doctors. Let the stage of counselling get over.”The petitioners opposed the suggestion, and proposed that the July 29 government order not be given effect to for admissions in this admission cycle. Senior advocates Arvind Datar and Shyam Divan, for the petitioners, said the NEET-PG 2022 is to be held in March, and the order of July 29 was passed after the process for conducting NEET-PG 2021 started in February last year.SG Mehta said, “As a government we would not accept any position whereby the OBC or EWS, whether pre or post this exercise is deprived of what is legitimately due to them.”In October, the top court raised doubts on whether EWS beneficiaries can be uniformly clubbed together as persons belonging to households with annual earnings below ₹8 lakh without considering the rural-urban divide, purchasing power in different regions, and other factors that vary across states. To quell these doubts, the Centre in November formed a three-member committee to revisit the criteria for identifying EWS, and put the counselling process of Neet-PG seats on hold.Mehta pointed out to the report by a three-member committee found no fault with the ₹8 lakh income limit for EWS, and said: “In deference to the court’s order of November 25, we formed a committee. Now the report has been filed. The court may examine and see if the reservation serves the poor and that it is not over-inclusive. We are ready to assist but let the counselling go on in the meantime.”Divan said that the petitioners should be given the opportunity to present their concerns as they had concluded their submissions before a three-judge bench, and now there was a change of bench with the exception of justice Chandrachud. The court allowed Divan and Datar to make brief submissions and posted the matter for Thursday as arguments remained inconclusive.Divan said that AIQ seats were carved out by the Supreme Court in 2007, when it permitted reservation for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes. He submitted that OBC and EWS reservation in the AIQ category cannot be made by an executive order as this would go against judicial decisions and deprive general category students of nearly 3,500 seats in government medical colleges.Datar submitted that the three-member Committee report does not show what exercise was carried out prior to settling the income cutoff for EWS at ₹8 lakh per annum.Interventions were also filed by pro-reservation quota groups and individuals. Supporting OBC quota in NEET-PG, senior advocate P Wilson told the court that he represents the voice of OBCs, who secured a favourable order from the Madras high court, which was later upheld by the top court. The court agreed to hear the intervention applications on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/neetpg-demands-by-docs-genuine-says-supreme-court-101641424775025.html

06-01-2022||India||Two days after BJP minister and Congress MP spar, Karnataka home minister orders police probe||Karnataka home minister Araga Jnanendra on Wednesday sought a report from police on the failure to anticipate protests at the Ramanagara district event, where Karnataka information technology minister Ashwath Narayana and Congress MP DK Suresh had a face-off on the stage on Monday.The home minister sought the report to be submitted at the earliest while citing intelligence failure on the part of police to provide adequate security against protesters. Both leaders almost came to blows in the presence of chief minister (CM) Basavaraj Bommai during an event in Ramanagara district.The event was organised by the state government to unveil the statues of Dr B R Ambedkar and Bengaluru founder Kempegowda. The function was also Bommai’s first event in the district after he took over as the chief minister.A senior police officer present at the event, pleading anonymity, said, “The problem started when Congress workers walked onto the stage where CM Bommai was sitting and raised slogans supporting Shivakumar. They were also waving black flags before the event started. Police cleared them and the function continued.”The officer said the probe has been ordered to identify if there was a failure on the police’s part to identify the protests or on the part of Congress workers. The protest had resulted in a standoff between the two leaders.During his speech, Narayana attacked Congress leaders and questioned the action of party workers who walked onto the stage and shouted slogans. “Is this how you behave when a chief minister comes? Should you shout like this to ruin the district’s reputation? If you are a man, show it in your work. We did not come here to cheat people; we came here to work.”Following this, Karnataka Congress chief DK Shivakumar’s brother Suresh walked towards Narayana. Seeing this, the MP charging towards him, the minister stopped the speech and got into a heated argument with Suresh. Suresh was joined by Congress’ Bangalore Rural MLC S Ravi, who even tried to throw the mike to stop Narayan from speaking.“The superintendent of police (SP) of the district has been accused of not making enough security arrangements to prevent the workers from getting on the stage. The SP has said that they had reviewed the security system in advance and created a special team to protect the CM. These claims will be investigated now,” said another officer pleading anonymity.Meanwhile, five Congress workers were booked for creating ruckus at the event. The police, who didn’t disclose the details of the workers, said that one of them have been booked under the Goonda Act and further probe is on.Meanwhile, Karnataka home minister Araga Jnanendra called the incident a public exhibition of muscle power by the Congress leaders. “I condemn the gross misconduct of the Congress leaders at the function organised by the Ramanagara district administration. The Congress leaders’ attempt to manhandle the higher education minister, Dr Ashwath Narayan, in a public meeting is obnoxious. People of Karnataka will not tolerate this kind of culture,” the home minister said in a statement.DK Shivakumar said that a minister’s arrogance was at display in Ramanagara. “The minister (Narayan) has done everything to make sure that his CM is humiliated in public and this is a part of the conspiracy to bring the CM down (by publicly humiliating him),” said Shivakumar.
06-01-2022||India||Petition in Supreme Court against Bombay HC norms on sexual harassment cases||A plea has been filed in the Supreme Court against a Bombay high court order which laid down guidelines to protect identities of parties under the Sexual Harassment of Women at the Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act) and Rules.The order, passed by Justice G S Patel of the high court on September 24 last year, mentioned a slew of guidelines related to conducting hearings, passing and uploading of orders, and reportage on cases of sexual harassment of women at workplaces, and made it clear that such cases can be either heard “in-camera” or in the judge’s chamber, and no reporting without the nod of the judge will be permitted. Any breach of these directions would amount to contempt of court, the court had observed. The plea in the top court challenged the high court’s decision, terming the directions a “death blow” to the freedom of speech and expression.“The high court has failed to take into consideration that any blanket ban or gag order in the form of an injunction restraining the broadcast of true and accurate facts will encroach upon the people’s right to know and violate their right to information, which is an integral part of Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. This will have a devastating and detrimental effect on the society at large,” the plea, drafted by advocate Abha Singh on behalf of the victim, said. Singh also pointed out that the high court order was passed suo moto in a suit filed by the victim seeking compensation for wrongful termination. “This gag order will serve as a tool for powerful men to continue to sexually harass women and thereafter suppress women’s voices on social media and in news media with the help of such gag orders,” the plea said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petition-in-supreme-court-against-bombay-hc-norms-on-sexual-harassment-cases-101641410183866.html

My appeal to the people is four to six weeks is crucial. As we have observed worldwide, it is declining in five to six weeks. This wave will not be for too long, like in the first and second wave that was for three to four months,” he told reporters.Meanwhile, Dr Vishal Rao, member, committee for Covid-19 whole-genome sequencing said that a study led by researchers from the LKS Faculty of Medicine at The University of Hong Kong (HKUMed) provides the first information on how the novel variant of concern (VOC) of SARS-CoV-2, the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infects the human respiratory tract.“The researchers found that Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infects and multiplies 70 times faster than the Delta variant and original SARS-CoV-2 in the human bronchus, which may explain why Omicron may transmit faster between humans than previous variants. As per the study, the Omicron infection in the lungs is significantly lower than the original SARS-CoV-2, which may be an indicator of lower disease severity,” he said.He, however, added that this research is currently under peer review for publication.Karnataka on Wednesday reported 4,246 new cases of Covid-19, the second consecutive day where the new cases reported in city are showing massive increase. Out of the new cases, 3,605 were reported in Bengaluru. The positivity rate in the state stands at 3.33%. On Tuesday, Bengaluru saw the number of new cases jumping from 1,040 to 2,058. On Wednesday the city witnessed a 75% increase in the number of cases.A 15-year-old girl was among the two people who succumbed to Covid-19 in Karnataka, as per the bulletin from the Karnataka health department on Wednesday. The girl who had influenza-like illness had shown only fever as a symptom. She was admitted to a private hospital on Monday and succumbed on the same day, added the bulletin.Sudhakar said that Karnataka government vaccinated 7.96 lakh children in the age group of 15-17 years in just two days. “That is 25% of the total target population of 31 lakh in this age group. We are hopeful of completing this in next 7 to 10 days,” he said.Meanwhile, the government has issued new guidelines for hospital bed reservations. As per the new orders, the private hospitals and private medical college hospitals have been asked to immediately reserve and keep ready 30% beds in each category, ie, intensive care unit (ICU), ICU with ventilator, high definition unit (HDU)/oxygenated and general beds for treatment of Covid-19 patients referred by the public health authorities.“The complete quote of 50% beds of each category, ie, ICU, ICU with ventilator, HDU/oxygenated and general beds of private hospitals to be reserved for treatment of Covid 19 patients referred by the public health authorities in a manner that the beds are free for occupation by January 7,” read the order.It further added that the private medical college hospitals will keep ready and reserve beds under each category, i.e, ICU, ICU with ventilator, HDU/oxygenated and general beds for treatment of the public health authorities referred cases up to 50% by January 7 and up to 75% by January 10.Owing to the increase in cases, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta on Tuesday instructed the chief health officer Dr Balasundar to identify one Covid-19 care centre in all Assembly constituencies in BBMP limits. Speaking after inspecting the Covid-19 care centre established at Kempegouda community hall Bengaluru’s Nandini Layout in Mahalakshmi constituency, he said that as Covid-19 cases are increasing by the day, one centre in each Assembly constituency should be reopened.“It is instructed to identify one Covid-19 care centre each in all Assembly constituencies as the number of Covid-19 cases are increasing. Persons with mild symptoms, if they are unable to take treatment under home isolation, can get treatment at Covid-19 care centres,” said Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/be-cautious-for-4-to-6-weeks-to-contain-third-covid-wave-says-k-taka-health-minister-101641409889377.html
06-01-2022||India||Kerala actor’s abduction, assault case drags on||The Kerala actor abduction and assault case saw two special public prosecutors resign, 38 witnesses turned hostile, and prosecution moved higher courts, seeking a change of the trial judge. In the last two days, the case was heard in the special court in Kochi without a public prosecutor, and the government is busy searching for a third one. On Wednesday, the state government moved the Supreme Court seeking an extension of the trial for another six months after film director Balachandra Kumar came out with new revelations against actor Dileep, an accused in the case.After the revelation, the investigating officer Baiju Paulose had moved a fresh plea in the Kerala high court requesting to question the main accused Pulsar Suni, who is in judicial custody. On Wednesday, Dileep, along with a co-accused, wrote a letter to Kerala police chief Anil Kant seeking the removal of Paulose. The letter came two days after the victim, a 35-year-old woman actor, now settled in Bengaluru, wrote to Kant and chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan seeking speedy justice and examination of new evidence.In the letter, Dileep said the officer was trying to influence some of the film workers with whom he has uneasy relations and forcing them to depose against him. He said the controversial interview of director Kumar was part of this plot and sought to examine phone call details of Paulose to buttress his charge. Paulose, known to be a tough officer and often called ‘Action Hero Biju’ (a recent Malayalam movie name), was trying to cover up the prosecution’s mistakes by coming out with trumped-up leads, Dileep alleged in the letter. Kumar told a Malayalam news channel that he met the prime accused in the case Suni at actor Dileep’s residence in 2016 when he went to discuss a new project. He also claimed that the latter had a video clipping of the assault. He also alleged that Dileep tried to influence a key witness, Sagar Vincent, a film crew member, two years ago, after which he turned hostile. But Dileep downplayed his utterances saying, “He (Kumar) was using his old enmity to settle scores with me.” He said Kumar was upset with him after he refused to take up his project. When contacted, Kumar said he delayed his disclosure because he feared for his life and denied any blackmail tactics. “I was scared to come out. Whatever I want to say, I shared it with the SIT,” he said, adding that since the investigation was on it was unfair on his part to explain it again. Soon after the new disclosure, the prosecution moved the trial court for a fresh investigation, and the court asked the prosecution to file fresh charges by January 20. New allegations against Dileep and the prosecution’s fresh demand for a probe surfaced at a time when the trial court’s six-month extension given by the Supreme Court last August is set to expire on February 16.The attack on a woman actor took place in 2017 when she was returning to Kochi after a shooting assignment on the outskirts of the city. Her vehicle was allegedly waylaid, and she was abducted by a criminal gang in a closed van. She was allegedly assaulted in the moving van by them. They also took video clippings of the sexual assault and let her go after a three-hour ordeal and threatened to release the video if she approached the police. In her statement to the police, she said she promised them a hefty amount to leave her safe, but they continued to torment her. During the attack, the first accused, Pulsar Suni, a notorious history-sheeter in the port city, had reportedly told the victim that he was given a contract and he was forced to do this. The actor complained to police the next day, and all nine accused were arrested and the vehicle used for assault was seized.Six months after the case was registered, the Special Investigation Team led by Paulose arrested Dileep, who spent three months in jail. He is the eighth accused in the case and faces charges under criminal conspiracy (Section 120 A) and abetment to crime (Section 107 of the IPC). The case witnessed many twists and turns since then. Some of the police witnesses had turned hostile, and at one point, the state government told the high court that Dileep was filing unnecessary pleas in different courts to delay the trial. But the HC and later apex court rejected the prosecution plea to shift the trial judge Honey M Varghese. In August last year, the Supreme Court had directed the special court to complete the trial in six months. The Malayalam film world is also totally divided over the case. While one section insists that the victim should get justice at the earliest, the others say it was unfair to target Dileep and force his detractors to come up with fresh disclosures. “Where was Balachandra Kumar all these days? He could have deposed while the trial was on. As an observer, I feel he was propped up by the prosecution at the eleventh hour when the wind was going against it,” said film producer Saji Nanthayad. Women in Cinema Collective (WCC), an outfit formed in the wake of the attack on the actor, asked the government to inquire about new revelations and get speedy justice to the victim. “Time and again in this excruciating fight for justice, many such questions need to be asked and answered to learn the truth,” the WCC said in a statement. After the assault, the WCC started a hashtag campaign called #Avalkoppam# (with her) which turned viral on social media. It also wrote to the CM last week to ensure speedy justice to the victim. “It is a peculiar case. Many witnesses have turned hostile weakening the prosecution. It is natural for the prosecution to go after fresh development in the case. But it seems some of the claims of the director seem to be quite weird. Let the court decide it,” said a former lawyer associated with the prosecution team, who was not willing to be named. “The Supreme Court had in the past extended such deadlines set for criminal trials multiple times. It may extend the deadline after examining disclosures in detail otherwise it may be construed as a miscarriage of justice,” said senior Supreme Court lawyer M R Abhilash. 
06-01-2022||India||Weekend lockdown plot to stop Mekedatu project implementation: Cong||Senior Congress leader Siddaramaiah on Wednesday said that the Karnataka government’s decision to impose a weekend lockdown and ban public rallies due to the surge in Covid-19 cases was a conspiracy to stop the party from taking out a protest rally demanding the Mekedatu drinking water project. Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president DK Shivakumar, reacting to a protest ban issued on Tuesday night, said the Sunday (January 9) march would not be cancelled. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi is holding a series of rallies, but the BJP government in Karnataka wants us not to conduct a walk for water?” he asked. The march from Mekedatu to Bengaluru, a distance of around 179 km, will cover 15 Assembly constituencies before culminating with a public meeting at the Basavanagudi grounds in the state capital. Talking to the media on Wednesday, Siddaramaiah said that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is trying to stop the protest since the government has no plans to implement the drinking water project. “Their intentions are not visible to anyone. They have no intention to go ahead with the project since they want to expand their political presence in Tamil Nadu. Their state leader Annamalai is holding protests. Can it happen without the blessings of the BJP leadership? Because of this, we are doing this protest to demand water for the people of the state,” said Siddaramaiah. He added that the government was trying to divert attention from its failure during the first and second waves of Covid-19. “The government didn’t work during the first and the second waves. They couldn’t provide medicines, ambulances, ICUs, Oxygen and other facilities. The experts had warned about the third wave in February. They should have taken the precautions,” he added. The veteran leader said that Congress would take out the rally without breaking any guidelines issued by the government. “We have taken all the precautionary measures. If required, only DK Shivakumar and I will walk,” he said. Shivakumar said that he was more concerned about the small business owners, who are getting affected by the BJP’s political games. “What concerns us the most is that hit taken by small businessmen in the state. They are in pain. For the past two years, their condition has been difficult. For their (BJP’s) political gains, because of the grudge they have against us (Congress), they are hurting businessmen, the tourism sector, drivers, street vendors are being targeted. It is as good as them getting murdered, and the government is doing it,” he said. According to Shivakumar, the party has ordered sanitisers and 100,000 masks for the participants of the padayatra. Also, 100 doctors from the party’s doctors’ cell and 10 mobile health check-up units will be deployed during the 10-day event, he said. Over 4,817 people, mostly party workers, are said to have registered online for the event. Responding to the Congress, Karnataka health minister K Sudhakar said that the spread of the virus is happening in front of everyone’s eyes, and he hopes that Congress will take the right steps. “People are watching, and they will make a decision. We didn’t bring out the guidelines because of any ill intention. The virus is spreading in front of our eyes. It is spreading fast. I hope Congress changes its mind looking at the situation now. The Congress has a former chief minister and many leaders who have held important posts. I want to believe that they will take the right steps,” said Sudhakar. Asked if action will be taken against Congress for violating the Covid guidelines, he said, “the laws will take its course.” 
06-01-2022||India||Jayalalithaa’s chennai residence:Madras high court rejects AIADMK appeal over house acquisition||The Madras High Court on Wednesday dismissed an appeal filed by the AIADMK and the party’s former law minister C V Shanmugam challenging a single judge’s order in November 2021, which had scrapped their acquisition of J Jayalalithaa’s residence ‘Veda Nilayam’. A division bench of justices Paresh Upadhyay and Sathi Kumar Sukumara Kurup said that they agree with judge S Seshasayee’s 2021 order that the acquisition of Veda Nilayam is procedurally illegal & doesn’t fall under ‘public purpose’. The original case pertained to petitions filed by Jayalalithaa’s niece and nephew J Deepa and J Deepak, who had challenged the AIADMK acquisition and attempting to convert the former chief minister’s residence into a memorial. On November 24, the single bench’s 114-page judgement set aside the acquisition of Veda Nilayam and directed the Chennai district collector J Vijaya Rani to hand over the residence’s keys to Deepa and Deepak. The court had also said that the Income Tax department is free to proceed for recovering any arrears of tax payable by Jayalalithaa, which is chargeable on her estate as per law. Following the order, the keys went to Deepa and Deepak in December 2020. Though the court, in an interim order in January 2021, allowed the AIADMK to inaugurate the memorial, it was not open to the public, and the final judgment came after a change in government in May 2021. On Wednesday, having heard the arguments and considered the material on record, the division bench found three issues before it–whether the impugned judgement can be said to be erroneous; whether the said acquisition could be said to be for any ‘public purpose’ as defined under section 3 of the under ‘The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013’ and lastly, whether the ‘appropriate government’ under the Act of 2013 can still be directed to continue with the said acquisition proceeding, by initiating the exercise afresh. The court observed that if the acquisition is examined, keeping in view the ‘objects and reasons’ and the definition of the ‘public purpose’ in the Act of 2013, then the bench would be unable to bring the acquisition of the property within ‘public purpose’. “Having held as above, it may not be required to examine whether the ‘appropriate Government’ still needs to be directed to continue with the said acquisition proceeding,” the court said. The then AIADMK government enacted legislation in 2020 establishing a foundation for the sprawling white bungalow’s upkeep to be turned into a memorial and stated that the property was acquired legally after depositing a compensation of ₹67.9 crores before the civil court in Chennai. Jayalalithaa lived in the property, which she purchased in the 1960s, until her death in December 2016. She died intestate. According to the revenue department, the three-storey residence is on a ten-ground plot. It has 32,721 moveable items, including 8,376 books and 394 mementoes. Fourteen items of gold weighing 4.4 kgs and 867 items of silver weighing 601 kgs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jayalalithaas-chennai-residence-madras-high-court-rejects-aiadmk-appeal-over-house-acquisition-101641409825227.html
06-01-2022||India||Telangana high court grants bail to BJP Telangana unit chief Sanjay||Bharatiya Janata Party Telangana unit president and Lok Sabha member from Karimnagar Bandi Sanjay was on Wednesday released from Karimnagar jail, after the state high court granted him bail and ordered his immediate release.Sanjay was arrested by the Karimnagar police on the night of January 2 after he made an abortive attempt to stage a “Jagran” deeksha at his camp office in protest against a government order relating to transfer of government employees and teachers.On Wednesday, a high court bench headed by Justice Ujjal Bhuyan heard the arguments on his bail petition and set aside the orders of the Karimnagar court. It ordered the release of Sanjay on personal surety.Noting that Sanjay was arrested at 10.50 pm and an FIR was registered at 11.15 pm, the high court asked how the FIR was registered in such a short time. It also sought to know why Section 333 (causing injuries to the public servant) of the Indian Penal Code was added to the FIR, as there was no medical report about the injuries to policemen in the remand report submitted to the lower court.The high court also issued a notice to the state government to submit all the details and adjourned the hearing to February 7. Sanjay was released from the jail at around 7.45 pm.The arrests had led to strong protests from BJP. The party had called for state-wide protests for 14 days. BJP national president J P Nadda also took part in the protests at Secunderabad on Tuesday.Welcoming the high court verdict, the BJP general secretary in-charge of Telangana Tarun Chug said it was a slap on the face of the TRS government. He said the party was not afraid of false cases and arrests and would continue to fight on behalf of people.Chug alleged that the K Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR) government was trying to stifle the voice of the opposition for questioning its anti-people policies. He alleged that the police booked false cases against Sanjay and arrested him.The BJP leader said Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla had served a privilege notice on Karimnagar police for manhandling the state BJP president. “The police used ropes and gas cutters to enter Sanjay’s office in Karimnagar to arrest him. Is Sanjay a criminal or a gangster, like Dawood Ibrahim?” Chug asked.Meanwhile, Telangana Rashtra Samithi working president and state minister KT Rama Rao lashed out at BJP national president J P Nadda for calling the chief minister corrupt and a person who had lost mental balance.Describing the BJP as a ‘Bakwas Jumla Party’, KTR said Nadda had spoken nonsense and made useless comments. He said there was no difference between Nadda and Sanjay in using nasty comments against the chief minister.He alleged that several poll promises made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi were not fulfilled.QUOTE?
06-01-2022||India||Ex-IFS officers say outrage on Haridwar hate speech a ‘smear campaign’||A group of former ambassadors and senior diplomats has criticised activists, retired bureaucrats, military officers and journalists for conducting what it claimed was a “sustained smear campaign” against the government over controversial statements made at the Dharam Sansad in Haridwar in December last year.The group of 32 diplomats, which included former foreign secretary Kanwal Sibal, contended in a statement issued on Wednesday that all calls for violence “must be unequivocally condemned regardless of their religious, ethnic, ideological or regional origin”.The group claimed a “motley group of activists”, some former civil servants and military figures were involved in the “smear campaign against the present government on its presumed violations of the secular ethos of the country”.“This has taken effectively an increasingly anti-Hindu tenor under the guise of anti-Hindutva. The latter has become a convenient peg for ‘secular’ posturing, adopting virtue-signaling ‘constitutional’ positions, relying on bloated vocabulary of ‘Nazism’ and ‘genocide’ to gather international attraction and leverage it to bring odium to the Modi government,” the statement said.The group specifically referred to the activists and former bureaucrats and military officers raising the issue of “some objectionable anti-minority statements made at a religious gathering at Haridwar”.The former diplomats contended these statements should be “condemned by all right thinking people”, but added that “when the import of these is exaggerated out of all proportion and the ranting by fringe elements are seen as representative of the sentiments prevailing in ruling circles, and as laying the agenda of what lies ahead at the national level, then the political leanings and moral integrity of the critics can be rightly questioned”.After several videos of leaders at the religious congregation emerged on social media, Uttarakhand Police registered an FIR that named several Hindu leaders for allegedly making hate speeches. Five former chiefs of staff of the armed forces and more than 100 prominent citizens wrote a letter to President Ram Nath Kovind, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Justice NV Ramana on December 31, condemning speeches made at the meeting in Haridwar.However, the group of former diplomats contended that a “tirade of accusations and calumny has been let loose in an effort to falsely portray the Haridwar speeches as a force very much larger than the fringe groups they represent”.“Overwrought fears are expressed about an irreversible fragmentation and disintegration of the country by what is described as brazen and violent attacks against minorities throughout the North Indian heartland by supposedly not fringe elements but ones dangerously close to mainstream, and holding that the instruments of state are being bent to advance this communal agenda,” the statement said.The group claimed that under the current government, welfare schemes for minorities had seen increases in expenditure, including on rural housing, scholarships for students, priority sector lending by banks and the rural and urban livelihoods mission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/exifsofficers-say-outrage-on-haridwar-hate-speech-a-smear-campaign-101641409584333.html
06-01-2022||India||Telangana’s facial recognition technology comes under scanner||The use of facial recognition technology by the Telangana police as part of their smart policing mission, supposedly to profile criminals and keep a watch on their activities has come under legal scrutiny.Acting on a public interest litigation petition filed by a social activist S Q Masood, a division bench of the state high court comprising chief justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili on Monday issued a notice to the state government and the Hyderabad city police commissioner, seeking an explanation over the propriety of the usage of technology and whether it infringes on one’s privacy while being in public places. The case has been posted for January 15 for further hearing and a response has been sought from the Telangana police.Masood in his petition claimed that on the night of May 19 last year, he was stopped by a group of policemen while he was returning home. The police allegedly forced him to remove his mask and took his picture without taking his consent. Next day, he wrote to the Hyderabad police commissioner asking him the reason why the police had taken his photographs, where they were stored and who would have access to them.When there was no response from the police, Masood sent a legal notice with the help of an NGO Internet Freedom Foundation on May 31. Subsequently, he moved the high court.The petitioner argued that he had come to know that his photograph was being used by the police as part of profiling the people using facial recognition technology (FRT). He said it was arbitrary and an infringement on the right to privacy of an individual. He said it had no safeguards for the citizens, no redress mechanism and no legal backing or guidelines for implementing FRT. Unlike the 12-digit biometric based unique identification number called Aadhaar, which is mandated through an act of Parliament, there is no such regulation for FRT.Masood explains it. He said the police had discretionary powers to use the FRT on anyone, apart from covertly capturing photographs through CCTV cameras. The technology is not for a specific purpose but is used for mass surveillance, he alleged, a view of also several pro-privacy activists.WHAT IS FRT?According to Ramesh Kanneganti, executive director of Centre for Human Security Studies and an expert on internal security issues, FRT involves processing digital images of individuals’ faces for verification or identification of those individuals using artificial intelligence.“It extracts specific data from a face, based on facial expressions or hair style or shape of the face and uses the data to compare with the images of the persons who have already been profiled in their database,” he said.Launched in August 2018, the FRT, by design, requires external cameras to capture sensitive personal data and photographs which are compared with those maintained on pre-existing lists compiled for purposes of either identification or verification of persons.The deployment of FRT is being done through an existing setup of Close-Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras, without giving notice to individuals about them being subjected to intrusive surveillance and without providing them information about the manner in which their sensitive personal data is stored, shared, and used.Alternatively, the police on ground can also capture the pictures of the people on their smart phones and send them to the database using a mobile-phone based application “TSCOP.” There has been a lot of criticism over the use of mobile application to capture pictures of residents of Hyderabad during police patrolling.According to Telangana government, there are nearly six lakh CCTV cameras across the state, but mostly in the state capital region. According to the year-end data released by the police, there are 440,299 CCTV cameras in Hyderabad alone, followed by 126,760 in Cyberabad and 23,700 in Rachakonda police commissionerate limits.In its report released in November 2021, Amnesty International declared Hyderabad as one of the most surveilled cities in the world, which is putting human rights at risk. “Hyderabad is on the brink of becoming a total surveillance city. It is almost impossible to walk down the street without risking exposure to facial recognition,” said Matt Mahmoudi, Amnesty International’s AI and Big Data researcher in the report.He said in addition to CCTV, the matter of concern was the way the police are using tablets to stop, search and photograph civilians that could be used for facial recognition.Masood, in his petition filed in the high court pointed out that the images captured by the CCTV cameras and analysed using FRT, were being linked to the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) under Union ministry of home affairs, a national database with biometrics of persons apprehended by state and central law enforcement agencies in connection with any case.“The use of the FRT and other such biometric data is a gross violation of the right to privacy and right to freedom as per the Supreme Court judgement in 2017. We strongly oppose the same,” said noted lawyer and human rights activist Ch Prabhakar.Internal security expert Kanneganti said though the FRT can be an effective prevention and pre-emptive measure to contain many law and order challenges but the law enforcement agencies have to maintain caution and respect privacy laws of the citizens.“There is every possibility of the technology being misused, as it depends on what data one would feed. Even if there are 10-15 percent of similarities between an innocent and criminal in terms of facial features, there is a scope for the police harassing the innocents,” he explained.He suggested that the police should observe utmost caution in using such predictive policing techniques. He said the police should not use it in racial, religious and caste based profiling in the name of national security.Hyderabad police commissioner C V Anand allayed fears of the misuse of FRT being used by the police. “We don’t infringe into the privacy of any individual, as we are not barging into anybody’s house to take pictures. The technology is being used only to keep surveillance on criminals or suspected criminals,” he said.He claimed that the FRT was also serving as a deterrent for the criminals, especially those from other states indulging in crimes in Hyderabad. “Three years ago, there were more than 1,300 such criminals caught based on the CCTV footage in a year. It has come down to around 300 now, thanks to the technology,” he explained.Activists said the police needs to understand that people have privacy rights also in public places. “The Supreme Court in its Aadhaar ruling clearly defined privacy as a fundamental right which person exercises at his home and also in public places. One has a right to move freely without being watched by the state,” said Apar Gupta, a lawyer who is also executive director of Internet Freedom Foundation, a Delhi based advocacy group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telanganas-facial-recognition-technology-comes-under-scanner-101641409527024.html

The two injured are currently undergoing treatment at a government hospital for burns. This comes just days after five people died in a firecracker factory explosion in the same district, a firecracker manufacturing hub in Tamil Nadu. The January 1 fire accident killed five people and left eight others injured. Both accidents happened at firecracker units that hold a licence, the police said.On Wednesday, the accident happened near Sattur. “Four people, including the owner, are dead. Two people are being treated,” said Nagaraj, deputy superintendent of police, Sattur in Virudhunagar. The deceased owner, A Karuppasamy (40), holds a licence to run the firecracker manufacturing unit under Sri Solai FireWorks.On Wednesday, Karuppasamy and an employee, K Senthi (35), were in the room where they were mixing chemicals, which led to the fire breaking out due to friction and quickly spreading. Fire and rescue service officials were immediately pressed into service, and the fire was eventually put out. Offering his condolences, chief minister M K Stalin announced a solatium of ₹3 lakh to the families of the deceased and ₹1 lakh each for the injured. Stalin announced the same amount of compensation for the January 1 accident too.“It is a case of carelessness in both accidents that led to the fire,” said Nagaraj when asked what caused two back-to-back accidents, particularly since both units were licensed and had safety norms in place. Fires at factories have been recurring in the state, questioning the safety of employees. Besides, two recent accidents related to fireworks also shocked the state. A shop in Kallakurichi district had stored up firecrackers in October, a few weeks before Diwali, which led to a massive explosion killing seven people, including an 11-year-old boy. In November, a man and his seven-year-old son were killed on the spot when they were riding a two-wheeler with a bag of country-made firecrackers that exploded on the road between Puducherry and Tamil Nadu’s Villupuram district. Following the accidents Virudhunagar district collector, J Meghanath Reddy issued a statement that if irregularities are found in licensed factories, authorities will permanently revoke their license.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-dead-two-injured-as-fire-breaks-out-in-tamil-nadu-firecracker-factory-101641409524038.html
06-01-2022||India||PM Modi’s convoy held up: Role of Punjab Police in focus over security fiasco||Was the protest by farmers and a possible road blockade by them during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit in Punjab discussed during the advance security liaison (ASL) meeting? Why wasn’t an alternative route identified during the meeting, which is always done before deciding on a route for the Prime Minister’s convoy?HT spoke to many officers across various agencies who explained the security protocol for the PM and the reasons why they believe that the Punjab Police and the Intelligence Bureau are at fault for Wednesday’s security breach.The PM’s immediate security is by the SPGThe PM is guarded round-the-clock by the Special Protection Group (SPG). At any given time, at least 40-60 officers of the SPG including an SPG commandant — equivalent to a Superintendent of Police (SP) — are always present with the PM. This is called the inner ring. Outside this inner ring, there are other layers of security provided by police and those from the paramilitary forces. For example, if the PM is addressing a rally at a ground, the main stage will have SPG personnel. Even the local police will not be allowed inside the ring.But local police is in charge of the routeWhenever the Prime Minister moves in any part of the country, the route is secured by the local police (Punjab Police in this case). The PM is accompanied only by SPG. Personnel from the paramilitary forces are put on duty to guard the route. If there are towers or tall building along the route, snipers from the paramilitary forces are posted . The local state police has to ensure that no person — especially those who live or work on the roadside — breaches the security of the route. This is very clear.“The sanitisation of the road is done 3-4 hours in advance. The PM’s visit was not an impromptu one. The local police had enough time to check for mobilisation in the villages nearby, especially in the backdrop of the recent farmers protest. The local police must sanitise the road and cannot make exceptions for even fire or ambulance vehicles to stop the convoy,” said one officer who asked not to be named.The first two vehicles of the convoy called Escort Number 1 and 2 are always provided by state police. The personnel inside these vehicles coordinate with the local police and are informed if there is any disturbance.Everything is discussed at an advance security liaison or ASL meetingThis is one of the most important security preparedness meetings ahead of the PM’s visit anywhere. Even if the PM is attending a rally or a function near his house in New Delhi, the meeting happens. If the PM’s schedule is known in advance, the ASL meeting happens more than a week before the visit. Officers of the rank of deputy inspector general and inspector general from the Intelligence Bureau (IB), SPG, and the local police attend the meeting. “An ASL report is prepared. Wasn’t the threat of protesters spilling on the roads discussed at this? If it was and yet the protesters came on the road, then the Punjab Police is at fault. Also, it would be interesting to see what the IB said in the meeting. Every security detail is planned on the basis of this meeting,” said a second officer who too asked not to be named.There are usually two routesA third officer, who has in the past worked on the PM’s security, said that there are always two routes planned for the PM. The first route is called the contingency (C) route and the second is the main route. “The routes are chosen in such a way that if there is a blockade on the main route, the convoy immediately takes a turn towards the C route. In Delhi, CISF and BSF personnel guard the route till the PM passes through it. If there is a threat or a possible, disruption, the escort vehicles immediately take the second route, which is already sanitised in advance. And until the PM passes, no one is allowed on the route,” the officer added.Usually, one or both carriageways of the road are kept clear for the PMIn Delhi, where the PM mostly travels from his residence to his office or a function, only one carriageway is blocked. CISF and BSF personnel stand on the divider and allow traffic to move in the second carriage. But vehicles cannot stop.“But if the PM is travelling in Jammu & Kashmir or any other sensitive place such as Chhattisgarh, then both carriageways are blocked. CCTV cameras are places and then the security drill is the same. The local police have to sanitise the route, keep miscreants off the roads. They act on their own and also collect inputs from the Intelligence Bureau. Depending on the IB’s inputs a chopper is also kept on stand-by,” a fourth officer, who has worked with in the PM’s security, said.
06-01-2022||India||Tamil Nadu issues fresh curbs amid Covid-19 surge||Tamil Nadu has reported a 78 per cent spike in Covid-19 infections as 4,862 people tested positive in the state on Wednesday as against 2,731 new cases a day ago. On January 3, the state had reported a total of 1,728 new Covid cases. The increase in number isn’t an outcome of increased testing as Tamil Nadu has been averaging more than 100,000 tests every day, with a marginal increase Thursday. From January 3 to 5, the number of people tested in lakhs has been 1.02, 1.03, and 1.17. Chennai remains the hotspot, driving the daily surge in cases. From 876 new cases on January 3, the capital city reported 2,481 cases on January 5. The Greater Chennai Corporation has not released its testing numbers. Authorities said that the Omicron variant of the virus is leading to rapid transmission. Tamil Nadu has 121 cases of Omicron variant, of which 110 patients have been discharged. After the World Health Organisation (WHO) announced Omicron as a variant of concern on November 26, 2021, cases began rising in Tamil Nadu from November 29, the directorate of public health and preventive medicine (DPH) said in a statement. “The state has recorded around 2,731 new cases on January 4, which is almost a jump by 4.5 times in just a week from 619 cases on December 28,” said T S Selvavinayagam, director of the DPH. “The active cases have also risen to 10,364. The trend from other international countries like the USA, UK, France suggest active cases during the peak period may be 3 to 4 times higher than the previous peak period. So, there is a chance that this surge can lead to healthcare infrastructure being strained if not managed systematically.”On Wednesday, the DPH directed all the deputy directors of health services to upgrade primary and community health centres into interim Covid care centres. It included guidelines on how to set them up. Health secretary J Radhakrishnan told reporters in Chennai that all Covid-19 infrastructure, such as beds with oxygen supply is in place, and medicines are in stock for the next six months. “Cases will rise in the next few days before cases decline again. We are taking several steps to break the chain. People should be careful to prevent transmission so that the health system is not pressurised. And I want to insist people get vaccinated,” he said.Tamil Nadu on Wednesday tightened restrictions given the rising cases, and the government anticipates more cases as the Tamil festival of Pongal approaches. 
06-01-2022||India||NEET is unnecessary and creates unequal platform: Tamil Nadu governor in maiden assembly speech||Tamil Nadu Governor R N Ravi on Wednesday in his maiden address in the state assembly articulated that the state’s view is that entrance exams like National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) create an unequal platform against rural students and it is unnecessary. This comes even as he is facing criticism for not sending the Bill to ban NEET in Tamil Nadu to President Ram Nath Kovind. “Entrance exams create an unequal platform by being inherently discriminatory against rural students. Hence, this Government is of the firm view that entrance exams like NEET are unnecessary for student admissions to professional courses and will continue to reiterate this position,” Ravi said. DMK’s parliamentary leader T R Baalu in Delhi told reporters on Wednesday that Ravi has to resign for not sending the Bill to the President. “He has no other alternative but to send it. How long will he hold on to it?” Baalu said. “When the Governor is not following the procedure, he has to resign and go.” DMK’s ally Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) walked out of the assembly blaming the governor for “sitting on” the bill. K S Alagiri, president of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee, which is also part of the ruling coalition, pointed out that Tamil Nadu MPs have tried to meet Union home minister Amit Shah thrice on the matter. “But he has refused to meet them. His action is condemnable.” The Undergraduate Medical Degree Courses Bill, 2021 was passed by the DMK-led state government in the state assembly with the support of all parties except the BJP in September. The bill seeks to restore Tamil Nadu’s process of medical admissions by considering only class 12 marks, retracting a similar way before the Supreme Court made NEET compulsory in 2017. But according to an RTI response from the governor’s office in December, the bill is under consideration, though it has been three months. The AIADMK in 2017 passed a similar bill seeking exemption from NEET but it was rejected by the president. DMK’s poll promise has been to abolish NEET. It has been a burning issue in the state since more than a dozen medical aspirants, mostly from poor and rural backgrounds, have died by suicide after the competitive exam became compulsory. Ravi took over as governor on September 18 after the then Governor Banwarilal Purohit was transferred to Punjab. On Wednesday, Ravi began his 45-minute address by praising chief minister M K Stalin for “galvanising” the entire government machinery after he took office in May and praised the state government’s efforts to immediately contain the second wave of Covid-19 and increase vaccine coverage. “In just seven months, due to the concerted efforts of this Government, the vaccination coverage has been increased to 86.% for the second dose, with a total of 8.55 crore doses being administered,” the governor said. By this time members of the principal Opposition, the AIADMK, were on their feet, with the leader of opposition Edappadi Palaniswami criticising the DMK regime and the party staging a walkout. The governor asserted the state’s stand on sharing of river water with neighbouring states by opposing Karnataka’s Mekedatu reservoir project on the Cauvery river and declaring its intention to take necessary steps to restore the full reservoir level (FRL) of 152 ft in Mullaperiyar Dam located in Kerala. “While extending constructive co-operation to neighbouring states, Tamil Nadu will continue to fight for its rightful share of river waters,” he said. Ravi outlined that Tamil Nadu will continue to implement a dual language policy of using Tamil and English amidst the state’s protest against a National Education Policy (NEP). He also said that this government urges the GST Council and the Union finance ministry to continue the GST compensation till at least June 2024, since the state’s finances are yet to recover from the hit of the Covid pandemic. And as Tamil Nadu has sought ₹6,230 crores, he urged the Union government to release funds from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) soon after heavy floods caused damage in November 2021. The governor also announced that the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR & CE) department will establish a publication division to bring out books that speak of the rich history and architecture of temples in Tamil Nadu. In addition, they will also launch a drive to preserve rare palm leaf manuscripts available in temples and mutts. Following the governor’s speech, the Assembly Speaker M Appavu informed that the first session of the assembly this year will go on until January 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/neet-is-unnecessary-and-creates-unequal-platform-tamil-nadu-governor-in-maiden-assembly-speech-101641409343825.html
06-01-2022||India||CDS Rawat chopper crash a CFIT accident, say officials||The December 8 helicopter crash in which India’s first chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat was killed along with 13 others was most likely a controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accident with cloudy weather a contributory factor, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, after the Indian Air Force (IAF) made a detailed presentation to defence minister Rajnath Singh on the inquiry report into the Mi-17V5 accident.In aviation parlance, CFIT refers to the accidental collision with terrain of an airworthy aircraft under the flight crew’s full control. In CFIT accidents, the pilot or crew is unaware of the looming danger until it is too late, according to the US Federal Aviation Administration. The most common causes of it are bad weather, human error, or a problem with navigation equipment. And most of these accidents happen during take off or landing.A major factor leading to such accidents is the loss of situational awareness, FAA says.The Russian-origin helicopter, considered extremely safe and reliable, was fully serviceable when it crashed near Coonoor, said one of the officials who cited above. The low-flying helicopter flew into a cloud cover seconds before it went down in a fireball, barely seven minutes before it was scheduled to land in Wellington.“It was most likely a CFIT accident. The aircraft was fully serviceable. There is no evidence of technical failure,” said a second official.There was no official word from IAF on what led to the accident. Air Marshal Manavendra Singh, who headed the inquiry into the crash, made the presentation to the defence minister in the presence of IAF chief Air Chief Marshal Vivek Ram Chaudhari.The helicopter took off from the Sulur air base at 11.48am and was scheduled to land at the helipad at the Wellington golf course at 12.15pm. The air traffic control at Sulur, however, lost contact with the helicopter at 12.08 pm, 20 minutes after it took off.IAF is now expected to review protocols governing flights ferrying important people. The review will be based on the findings of the court of inquiry into the crash, the IAF chief said last month.Rawat was on a visit to the Defence Services Staff College (DSSC) at Wellington to deliver a talk when the Mi-17V5 crashed.Those killed in the crash included the CDS’s wife Madhulika Raje Singh Rawat, his defence assistant Brigadier LS Lidder, Lieutenant Colonel Harjinder Singh, Wing Commander Prithvi Singh Chauhan, the pilot of the Mi-17V5, Squadron Leader Kuldeep Singh, the co-pilot, Junior Warrant Officer Rana Pratap Das, Junior Warrant Officer Arakkal Pradeep, Havildar Satpal Rai, Naik Gursewak Singh, Naik Jitendra Kumar, Lance Naik Vivek Kumar and Lance Naik B Sai Teja.The sole survivor of the crash, Group Captain Varun Singh, breathed his last on December 15 after putting up a week-long fight .Developed by Russian Helicopters, the Mi-17V5 is designed to carry personnel, cargo and equipment. The Mi-17V5 can carry a load of around four tonne in a full cargo role. It can also insert assault forces behind the enemy lines, a role frequently demonstrated by the IAF during military exercises.The helicopter is equipped with modern avionics, a self-defence system and other advanced features that enhance its survivability. The Mi-17V5, which has an armoured cockpit, can be fitted with rockets, cannons and small arms for carrying out offensive roles. It has a service ceiling of 6,000 metre, top speed of 250 kmph and a maximum range of around 1,180km with additional fuel tanks.

Genome sequencing can take multiple days.The company said in a statement that the price has been fixed MRP ₹250 a test to the laboratories. According to the company, the kit will be available in market from January 12.“The good news is that the Omicron detecting RT-PCR kit has been developed in partnership with TataMD and ICMR, and has been approved by the drugs controller general of India. This new kit will test for Omicron in four hours, and will augment genome sequencing efforts of the country,” said Balram Bhargava, director general, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). “This kit is unique in the sense that it works on two levels: one is it detects Sars-CoV-2, and it has two specific targets for the S gene that are Omicron-specific targets. If the two S gene targets light up, the Covid-19 positive sample is of Omicron variant,” said Dr Nivedita Gupta, senior ICMR scientist.The company said it is the first such test to use this method. “Tata MD will work with regulatory bodies, and central and state governments to make the product available in India and globally. In parallel, we have begun work to scale up our production capability, supply chain and raw material inventory to deliver two lacs OmiSure tests per day,” read the company statement.The kit evaluated in partnership with ICMR reported 100% sensitivity and 99.25% specificity for Sars-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron.
06-01-2022||India||ED opposes Anil Deshmukh’s default bail plea in money laundering case||Mumbai: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday told a special court that former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh cannot be granted default bail in the money laundering case as the agency had filed a charge sheet within the stipulated period of 60 days from his arrest. The agency, in its affidavit, said the plea by Deshmukh was devoid of merits and liable to be rejected as it was against the settled principles of law. Special PMLA judge RN Rokade adjourned the plea to January 11 for hearing both the sides. The agency said that Deshmukh was arrested on November 2, 2021 under Section 19 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in accordance with the law, under reasonable belief that he was guilty of the offence of money laundering. “It is submitted that the concept of statutory bail/default bail cannot be considered once the charge-sheet and supplementary charge-sheet has been filed. The supplementary prosecution complaint against Deshmukh and 11 others has been filed on 29th of December, 2021, within a period of 60 days from the date of arrest,” the agency said in its reply. Deshmukh had moved for default bail on Tuesday through his counsel, advocate Aniket Nikam, on the ground that the special court has not taken cognisance of the ED’s supplementary charge sheet against him, within the period of 60 days, stipulated under section 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). Challenging Deshmukh’s plea, ED said, “It is further submitted that the question of cognisance is not relevant for ascertaining the right of default bail of the accused persons under section 167 (2) of CrPC, since the section is only for completing the investigation within the stipulated time period. It is a well settled law that default bail cannot be granted merely on the ground that cognisance had not yet be taken within the statutory prescribed time period even though the report and the complainant have been filed as per the provisions of the act.” “It is submitted that the stage of cognisance is a stage that occurs after the filing of the criminal complaint (charge sheet). It is submitted that the right to default bail is dependent upon completion of investigation which is a stage that is anterior to the taking of cognisance,” the agency added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-opposes-anil-deshmukh-s-default-bail-plea-in-money-laundering-case-101641408023778.html

Two terrorists were killed on Tuesday in Okay village of Srinagar district.Regarding Wednesday’s encounter, Kumar said police, army and CRPF launched a joint operation based on specific inputs of terrorist presence in Chandgam area of Pulwama district in the early hours of Wednesday. Three militants were killed after the search operation turned into a gunfight, he said.“Three militants of terror outfit JeM, including one Pakistani national were killed. Incriminating materials, arms and ammunition including two M4 carbines and one AK series rifle was recovered from them. It is a big success for forces,” Kumar said.A police spokesperson identified two of the deceased terrorists as Mir Owais of Ashmander in Pulwama and Pakistani national Talha Yasir. Yasir was an expert at making vehicle-borne IEDs, the spokesperson said.The identity of the third terrorist was being ascertained, the spokesperson added.According to police records, Owais and Yasir were both named in numerous terror crimes. “Owais was involved in killing of a civilian, namely Azad Ahmad Dar of Kangan Pulwama.

06-01-2022||India||Budget may raise agri credit to nearly ₹18 lakh crore||The Union Budget 2022-23 to be presented on February 1 is likely to increase agricultural credit target to ₹18 lakh crore, an increase of 12.5% from ₹16.5 lakh crore for the current fiscal year, officials aware of the development said. The budget may see announcement of steps to strengthen agricultural lending by scheduled banks and primary agricultural credit societies, which are last-mile village institutions that play a key role in disbursal of farm credit to millions of farmers, the official said. Successive budgets have enhanced the farm-credit target over the years, from about ₹10 lakh crore in 2017-18 to about ₹16.5 lakh crore in the current financial year. “In the current financial year, banks are expected to exceed the target set for loan disbursal for farm activities,” an official said, requesting anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media. Since banks and credit societies have exceeded the target consistently, the target is likely to be raised in the upcoming Budget, the official added. The livelihoods of nearly half of all Indians is tied to the agriculture sector. Timely availability of loans is critical for farmers, who take credit to meet expenses related to various farm inputs, such as fertilisers and seeds. The Agriculture Infrastructure Fund, announced as part of the Atma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, is likely to further boost credit to the agriculture sector. Analysts say that though the actual disbursal of loans have always exceeded the target set in the Budget, credit has traditionally been geographically skewed towards south India, while in north-east, it is very low. “There is a need to ensure more equitable spread of farm credit flow,” said Anand Vishwanath, a former agricultural credit officer with Union Bank of India . According to the annual Economic Survey 2020-21, during 2020-21, in the actual disbursal of loans up to November 2020, southern states had a 40% share, while this was less than 2% for northeastern region. “This shows that farming is largely non-commercial and subsistence-led in the north-east,” Vishwanathan said. 
06-01-2022||India||Another 139 people on board Cordelia ship contract Covid-19||Another 139 passengers on board the Cordelia cruise ship that returned to Goa from Mumbai tested positive for Covid-19, taking the total number of cases to 205, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said on Wednesday. On January 1, 66 people, including crew members, were found to be infected on the ship when was at Goa’s Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) with nearly 2,000 passengers. Of the 66, six had disembarked in Goa and were admitted to a local hospital in Vasco Da Gama for treatment.According to the Mumbai civic body, as many as 1,827 samples were collected after the ship docked at Green Gate port in South Mumbai’s Ballard Pier on Tuesday evening. Of the 66 cases detected earlier, at least 41 passengers were shifted to various civic-run isolation centres and hospitals in the city. According to a BMC official, most of the patients showed mild symptoms.“The patients have been shifted to facilities like the Richardson and Crudas in Byculla, Suncity residency, Pacific residency and other private hotels at their own expense,” the BMC official said, seeking anonymity.The remaining 19 patients, however, were allowed to stay back on the ship as they were largely asymptomatic and were with families. They were isolated inside the ship, another senior official confirmed.On the latest cases, officials said the patients will be sent home or to medical facilities depending on their symptoms.“Most of the patients that have tested positive are asymptomatic. We have passed the reports to the operator of the cruise which will carry out further health tests to check if they have other comorbidities or not. If a patient is fully asymptomatic and doesn’t have any comorbidities, then he/she will be allowed to go home with a stamp on his hand so that they follow isolation norms and protocols. If anyone is co-morbid and has serious symptoms, then he/she will be transferred for treatment,” Shivadas Gurav, assistant municipal commissioner from A-ward (where the ship is anchored), said. All those who have tested negative were allowed to disembark the ship. “BMC officials present at the port have put a stamp on the hands of the passengers who have tested negative so that they compulsorily follow home quarantine for seven days and the local ward office will track their health status,” Gurav said. Cordelia is the same cruise ship where the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) busted a high-profile rave party in October last year. The ship, operated by a private firm, was carrying hordes of New Year revellers when it arrived in Goa on Sunday, and a crew member tested positive for the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-139-people-on-board-cordelia-ship-contract-covid19-101641407603574.html
06-01-2022||India||Home isolation cut to 7 days as 3rd Covid-19 wave surges||The Union government issued new guidelines on Wednesday to reduce the home isolation period for people with Covid-19 from 10 days to seven as long as they have not had fever in the last three days.The move follows similar steps by the UK and the US, where isolation periods have been cut, following the near-global pandemic takeover by the Omicron variant of the Sars-CoV-2, which studies have established to be leading to milder disease.India reported 89,972 new cases on Wednesday, continuing a sharp spike. Compared to Tuesday’s numbers, Wednesday saw new infections rise by more than 58%, as per HT’s Covid dashboard. In Delhi, this number jumped 94.6% in a single day to lead to 10,665 new cases.Top government officials said the current R number of the epidemic, a measure of the intensity of the outbreak, has now reached 2.69, surpassing the 1.69 recorded during the Delta variant peak, although the outbreak is leading to fewer hospitalisations.“It seems hospitalisation rate is very low. We are following this data very closely… In Delhi, the hospitalisation rate is about 3.7%, and in Mumbai, we heard an officer saying it was around 5%. In previous waves, last year and in 2020, the typical hospitalisation rate was 20%,” said Niti Aayog member VK Paul during the health briefing.But, he cautioned, “it was important to remember that if there is a very large number of cases, even these small proportions will become a lot in numbers”.Experts said the sharp surge and the milder outcomes complicate efforts to balance containment measures and avoid a disproportionate disruption to everyday life if those who don’t need to are forced to isolate.The new guidelines thus carry some more relaxations, like not needing close contacts of a confirmed case to be tested as long as they do not have any symptoms.“The new home isolation guidelines relate to all Covid-19 cases. Omicron as well a Delta is part of these cases... hence, these home isolation guidelines apply to all Covid-19 cases,” a Union health ministry note said.“The way cases are rising, and which is expected with the new variant, institutional isolation does not make sense any longer. Experts were consulted and after detailed deliberation it was decided that those who are mildly symptomatic, or asymptomatic, should be allowed home isolation under certain conditions,” said a senior public health expert with the government aware of the matter, on condition of anonymity.A second official, who asked not to be named, said because of the exponential surge, “measures such as contact tracing and creating containment zones will not serve any concrete purpose”.“The onus lies on an individual now to take preventive measures such as Covid-appropriate behaviour; wearing a mask; avoiding mass gatherings to avoid getting infected. For those who show symptoms, it is better to get tested at home and isolate if the symptoms are mild. It makes sense to not rush to a hospital unnecessarily,” this person added.During the briefing, Union health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said the guidelines now specify how best people should isolate, and when they need to seek attention. People who end isolation at seven days should continue wearing masks when they go out, he stressed.The new guidelines, uploaded by the health ministry on its website, also specified the patients who should not be recommended for home isolation: those compromised immunity, like HIV-infected people, transplant recipients and cancer patients. People above the age of 60 years with comorbid conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease and chronic lung/liver/ kidney diseases will only be allowed home isolation after proper evaluation by the treating medical officer.Among the other changes mentioned in the revised guidelines, the Centre also asked for requisite facilities at home for other family contacts to be able to quarantine and for a caregiver to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19.The rest of the guidelines are largely the same as released last year.Asymptomatic cases have been defined as laboratory confirmed cases without any symptoms and with oxygen saturation at room air of more than 93%. Clinically assigned mild cases are patients with upper respiratory tract symptoms with or without fever, without shortness of breath and with oxygen saturation at room air of more than 93%.Experts said case numbers are going to keep rising for a while, making it important to monitor the hospitalization rate.“Cases are going to increase substantially because of the new variant in circulation; but the main issue is to see how mild it remains. It is the rate of hospitalisation that will eventually decide how concerning the spread is as merely rising numbers should not be of a serious concern,” said Dileep Mavalankar, director, Indian Institute of Public Health, Gandhinagar.“If positive cases are getting better on their own without hospitalization, there is no worry. Level of mildness of the virus and higher immunity because of vaccines and natural infection will balance out things. In next two-three weeks we should know clearly how mild the disease is proving to be in our population,” Mavalankar addedThe health expert added that gross mortality too should be monitored for any concerning spike. “ What works in our favour is the fact that our population is young compared to US or UK,” he said, while also calling for authorities to consider a full market authorisation for the vaccines in use to allow people who want to.

He was interrogated at length and then allowed to go as, apparently, there was nothing against him at that point, according to a senior official in a central investigation agency directly involved in the Mundra drugs haul investigation. “At the time, Punjab Police didn’t know how big a player he was so he was released after questioning,” this person added, asking not to be identifiedWhen contacted, Punjab Police’s Special Task Force (STF) head, additional director general (ADG) Harpreet Singh Sidhu said he was not aware of the case and would have to check the details. “If the police has sufficient facts about any criminal let alone a drug trafficker, they would take action,” and not allow them to get away, he added.Nabibullah, according to the officer from the central agency cited above, supervised the delivery of a similar consignment at Mundra Port on June 6 last year, which was also imported in the name of same firm used in the September consignment -- Aashi Trading Company run by Chennai-based couple Machavaram Sudhakar and Govindaraju Durga Purna Vaishali. A Kandahar-based firm, Hasan Husain Ltd , was used in both June and September to smuggle in the heroin, labelled as semi-processed talc stones.“The June consignment, suspected to be around 300kg , was sent to Mundra port for the first time as a ‘tester’, to see the security arrangements there. Once the June consignment was cleared, Nabibullah got confident and a larger consignment of 3,000kg heroin was sent in September. Prior to Mundra port, he was using border smugglers, couriers and other modes to get drugs into India from Afghanistan,” said a second officer familiar with the investigation, requesting anonymity.Investigators have found that Nabibullah, who is in his early 30s, was living in India for past five years, and had rented several godowns in and around Delhi, where he used to store the drugs smuggled from Afghanistan.“As the news about the seizure of 3,000kg consignment by DRI broke, he left the country within four-five days. We believe he fled to Afghanistan via Pakistan but we don’t have his photograph or other details including the route or his address there,” added the second officer.Since Taliban’s takeover of the Afghanistan on August 15 last year, Indian agencies have been worried that huge quantities of Afghan heroin will be pushed into India by drug traffickers backed by Pakistan. Narcotics smuggling and trade has for long been used as a vehicle of funding by terror networks operating in Pakistan and targeting India. It isn’t known at this point in time whether Nabibullah has any connections with such networks.The National Investigation Agency is currently investigating the case. Eight persons, including four Afghan nationals based in the National Capital Region, two Uzbek women, and the Chennai couple have been arrested in the case so far.Asked whether any warrant or notice has been issued against Nabibullah, NIA said that this “information cannot be shared at this point”.Kandahar , Helmand, Badghis, Uruzgan, and Faryab are areas where major opium poppy cultivation takes place in Afghanistan.UN data suggests that potential opium production in Afghanistan in 2020 was estimated at 6,300 tonnes and the average opium yield was 28 kilograms per hectare. The country produces over 85% of the world’s opium.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mundra-drug-mastermind-an-af-man-was-let-off-by-cops-in-another-case-fled-after-bust-101641407486650.html
06-01-2022||India||PM’s convoy halted inPunjab security breach||New Delhi/Chandigarh: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first rally in poll-bound Punjab was cancelled on Wednesday on account of a major and unprecedented breach in his security, with protestors blocking a route and forcing the PM’s convoy to spend about 15 -20 minutes on a flyover.The Centre, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), security experts and former senior police officers all stressed on the dangerous precedent set by the incident, with both the Union government and the BJP pointing to lapses by the Punjab police and the state government, and alleging that dirty politics was at play. “Today’s Congress-made happening in Punjab is a trailer of how this party thinks and functions. Repeated rejections by the people have taken them to the path of insanity,” tweeted Union home minister Amit Shah. Union minister Smriti Irani asked if information about the PM’s route was leaked. “Never before has the state government knowingly constructed a scenario where the PM will be brought to harm,” she said. “This was the Congress’s khooni (deadly) intention.” She also touched on reports that said PM Modi spoke to officials at Bathinda airport.“Say thanks to your CM that I was able to return to Bathinda airport alive,” Modi was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi expressed regret over the incident but rejected the BJP’s allegations. “We regret that he had to return due to the blockade...he is the Prime Minister of the country. We respect him,” he told reporters, clarifying that his government had no information about the PM’s motorcade taking the road route. “There was no prior information. I worked till 3am to convince farmers to clear all routes. All roads were cleared by Wednesday morning. Had they told us about the road travel in advance, we would have made proper arrangements,” Channi said. Still, it is difficult to recall the last time when a sitting PM had to cancel a rally after protestors blocked the way -- even in a state ruled by a rival party. Through last year, the BJP fought a bitter battle in West Bengal with the Trinamool Congress, and the PM addressed several rallies without incident. The Bhartiya Kisan Union ( Krantikari), one of the 32 farm organisations involved in the year-long protests against the now repealed farm laws, took responsibility for the blockade. “We were not aware that PM would travel by road as we were told he would reach the rally site by a helicopter. We were already protesting on the spot and came to know about the PM only after his cavalcade had left,” said Baldev Singh Zira, general secretary of BKU(Krantikari).Security experts said the established protocol puts the onus of ensuring security on state governments. “The state police is informed in advance about PM’s travel programme and an advance security liaison (ASL) is carried out jointly with the state police and Intelligence Bureau in which any threats, programme venue’s security, route, alternative routes are discussed. While the SPG (special protection group) handles the proximate security, the overall security – including clearing of routes, peripheral security arrangement, frisking of venue are all responsibilities of the state police,” said a former senior SPG officer, requesting anonymity.In a statement detailing the sequence of events, the Press Information Bureau said,“Today morning, the Prime Minister landed at Bathinda from where he was to go to the National Martyrs Memorial at Hussainiwala by helicopter. Due to rain and poor visibility, the PM waited for about 20 minutes for the weather to clear out.” “When the weather did not improve, it was decided that he would visit the National Marytrs Memorial via road, which would take more than two hours. He proceeded to travel by road after necessary confirmation of necessary security arrangements by the DGP (director general of police) Punjab Police,” it addedThe statement went on to say that “around 30km away from the National Martyrs Memorial in Hussainiwala, when the PM’s convoy reached a flyover, it was found that the road was blocked by some protestors”, resulting in the convoy being stuck there for 15-20 minutes, which was a major lapse in his security. Modi was scheduled to address a rally in Ferozepur and lay the foundation stone of multiple development projects worth more than ₹42,750 crore. This would have been his first public meeting in the state since the repeal of the three controversial farm laws, which sparked sweeping protests across the state. Shah said that the Union home ministry sought a detailed report on the security breach from the state. “Such dereliction of security procedure in the Prime Minister’s visit is totally unacceptable and accountability will be fixed,” he tweeted.In his press briefing, the Punjab CM claimed that the attendance at the BJP’s rally in Ferozepur was thin, and that only 700 people had turned up for the arrangements that were made keeping 70,000 people in mind. “May be this was why the PM decided to go back,” he added.BJP chief JP Nadda accused the Congress government in Punjab of using “all tricks to scuttle” PM Modi’s programmes, including the Ferozepur rally. In a series of tweets, he said that Modi’s rally was called off and another programme disrupted as protesters blocked his route breaching the security protocol. He termed the security lapse as “extremely worrisome” incident. “Protestors were given access to the Prime Minister’s route while the Punjab CS and DGP gave assurances to SPG that the route is clear. To make matters worse, CM Channi refused to get on the phone to either address the matter or solve it,” Nadda said in a tweet. In response, the Congress said that the real reason for cancelling the rally was the poor attendance in Ferozepur. “Dear Naddaji, Stop losing cool and all sense of propriety. Please remember--1. 10,000 security personnel were deployed for PM’s Rally. 2. All arrangements were made in tandem with SPG and other agencies. 3. Route was carved even for all buses of BJP workers from Haryana/Rajasthan,” said party general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala. “4. PM decided to take a road journey to Hussainiwala. It was not part of his original schedule to travel by road. 5. Kisan mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC) has been protesting against PM’s visit and Union Minister, Gajendra Shekhawat has held two rounds of negotiation with them,” the leader added. CM Channi said there should not be any politics on the issue.Elections in Punjab are likely to be announced shortly. The ruling Congress hopes to come back to power by holding at bay the BJP, its erstwhile ally Akali Dal and the Aam Aadmi Party. Farm issues, and the yearlong protests against the three central laws, are expected to shape the poll campaign.Detailing the protocol between the Special Protection Group (SPG) and Punjab police, the PIB statement said the PM’s schedule and travel plan was communicated well in advance to the Punjab government. “As per procedure, they have to make necessary arrangements for logistics, security as well as keep a contingency plan ready. Also, in view of the contingency plan, the Punjab Government has to deploy additional security to secure any movement by road, which was clearly not deployed.” Senior officials in the Punjab Police declined to comment.The PIB statement said after the security lapse, it was decided to head back to Bathinda airport. Taking cognisance of what it termed as a “serious” security lapse, the ministry of home affairs (MHA) has sought a detailed report from the state government. The state government has also been asked to fix responsibility for this lapse and take strict action, the statement added. A second SPG officer, who requested anonymity, said, “In the wake of recently concluded farmer protests, any agitation by farmer bodies should have been anticipated by the state police and SPG should have been alerted about it. It is definitely a lapse if the PM was stuck on the flyover for 15-20 minutes. But what exactly transpired will come out in the state government’s report or if any inquiry is carried out”. In her press conference, Irani questioned the Punjab government’s failure in addressing the security lapse. “When the PM‘s security detail contacted Punjab police about the circumstance of the prime minister‘s cavalcade atop the flyover that there was a 20 minute exposure and a breach of security of the Prime Minister, why did those who lead the security arrangements not respond to any call for efforts to secure the prime minister,” the minister asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pms-convoy-halted-inpunjab-security-breach-101641407485769.html

He tested negative on December 21 and 25, and succumbed to his illness on December 31.“The government confirmed the death in Rajasthan has been counted as Omicron death in India. We can say this is the first death in India,” Union health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said in Delhi on Wednesday.Superintendent of Maharana Bhupal government hospital, Dr RL Suman, said the man was brought in for treatment after he complained of respiratory problems. During his admission, his samples were sent for genome sequencing, the results for which arrived on December 25. He was administered another test at the time, which too came out negative.“He had multiple comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. He suffered from cardiac and respiratory failure,” said Suman.The state on Wednesday reported 1,883 Covid-19 cases and two deaths, taking the active cases tally to 5,016. A total of 121 cases of the Omicron variant have been reported as per genome sequencing.Genotyping confirmed Omicron cases in the country have now risen to 2,135 but most of the close to 90,000 cases recorded in the country on Wednesday are likely to be of the new variant of concern, which spreads at an unprecedented pace.

06-01-2022||India||No mix and match for third dose of Covid vaccine: Centre||The third shot of Covid-19 vaccines that will be rolled out for certain categories of citizens from January 10 will be of the same dose as the first two, a Union government official said on Wednesday. People above the age of 60 with certain illnesses and those working in high-risk healthcare and front-line jobs will be allowed to take what the government has classified as precaution doses, as long as their second shots were taken more than nine months ago.“It will be a homologous third or precautionary dose. Those who have received Covaxin will receive Covaxin and those who have earlier received primary two doses of Covishield will receive Covishield,” said VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, during the health ministry’s weekly media briefing on Covid-19.Paul said that as and when the government gets more information and data on other vaccines, especially on mixing of doses, the policy could be reviewed.“We will take a call later as more data will gradually emerge on the so-called heterologous approach. For now, however, it will be the same third vaccine dose,” added Paul.Experts backed the decision to wait for scientific doses on mixing vaccines. “In the absence of any data, no decision can be said to be inappropriate,” said Gagandeep Kang, vaccine expert, and senior faculty, Christian Medical College, Vellore. “That is actually the right approach; policies can be modified as data evolve,” she added.Paul said arrangements have been made to ensure smooth implementation of the third dose administration plan. “The process is on track and it will start as per plan on January 10,” added Paul.The third doses are part of the government’s next phase on coronavirus vaccinations, which comes at a time when the country is in the grip of a third wave driven by the highly transmissible and resistant Omicron variant. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 25 announced the opening of the phase, beginning with the first of the under-18 population – children between 15-17 began to get doses on Monday. As per the Union health ministry guidelines issued earlier, all healthcare workers, frontline workers, and citizens aged 60 years or above with comorbidities will be able to access the vaccination for precaution dose through their existing Co-WIN account. Eligibility of such beneficiaries for the precaution dose will be based on the date of administration of second dose as recorded in the Co-WIN system.
