Channi could not attend the meeting in Delhi due to the state cabinet meeting held in Chandigarh around the same time. “The screening committee again went over the names of probables for 50-odd seats where there is consensus and not more than two serious contenders are in the race in order to recommend their names to the central election committee. However, no decision was taken as the chief minister was not present,” a party leader privy to the deliberations said. Besides Maken, Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu, campaign committee chairman Sunil Jakhar, Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Chaudhary and joint secretary Krishna Allavaru were among those who attended the meeting. The committee will hold another meeting in a day or two to finalise its first list of recommendations to the central panel. Earlier, amid growing internal bickering in the state Congress, cabinet ministers Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, Bharat Bhushan Ashu and Pargat Singh and Fatehgarh Sahib MP Dr Amar Singh met Congress general secretary KC Venugopal at his residence in the morning. They are learnt to have discussed the situation arising out of the rift and Sidhu’s statements that have left the party deeply divided. Randhawa and Ashu have aired their differences with the PPCC chief, with the latter hitting out at him for throwing a spanner in the government efforts and creating confusion in the party by repeatedly questioning the decisions and announcements of the state government. The state chief has also hit back at the two ministers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-cm-charanjit-channi-skips-congress-screening-committee-meeting-101641319506459.html

The event was organised by the district unit of the Congress under its ‘Ladki Hoon, Lad Sakti Hoon’ (I am a girl and I can fight) poll campaign in UP, where assembly elections are due this year. The injured girls were sent to a nearby hospital from where they were discharged after getting preliminary medical treatment. The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) took suo motu cognisance of the incident and directed the district magistrate of Bareilly to lodge an FIR regarding the matter. , Later, district magistrate of Bareilly Manvendra Singh directed the police administration to lodge FIR under relevant sections for violation of Covid-19 protocols against organisers of the marathon .“Prime-facie, the use of children in such political activities appears to be violation of sections of Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 and also violation of Covid Protocol guidelines issued by the government. Therefore, in view of the sensitivity of the matter, it is requested that you look into the matter and initiate necessary inquiry to ensure the welfare and safety of children, by lodging an FIR at the first instance, under Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 and relevant sections of IPC,” reads the letter addressed to DM of Bareilly Manvendra Singh by principal private secretary to chairperson,NCPCR Dharmedra Bhandari“An Action Taken Report with regard to status of treatment of injured children in the said incident may please be furnished to the commission within 24 hours and a detailed fact-finding enquiry report may also be shared with the commission, within 7 days of receipt of this letter,” the letter added.Videos that have emerged from the site show some girls in front tripping and falling to the ground while running, forcing those coming from behind to stop suddenly. This led to a commotion in which some of the participants were injured. Most of the participants are seen without masks and not following any Covid-19 guidelines. Reacting to the mishap, Congress leader and former Bareilly mayor Supriya Aron said there was nothing to worry about. “When a stampede can happen in Vaishno Devi, these are just girls. It is human nature. But I want to apologise.” She said that it could also be a conspiracy against the Congress, due to its increasing mass base ahead of the elections. According to local police, the incident occurred at the beginning of the marathon. No police complaint has been lodged regarding the matter. As per local Congress party leaders, close to 10,000 girls had registered for the marathon. The prizes included a scooter, smart phones, smart watches and medals. Geeta Shakya, the women’s wing chief of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Uttar Pradesh (UP), described the Bareilly marathon incident as unfortunate, while slamming Congress leaders over their “irresponsible” statements. “First the Congress leaders lured these girls, using them for political gains and then after the incident, the way they reacted on the incident was shameful. They did not provide first aid to the injured girls and later on, held them responsible for the incident. The Congress leaders shamelessly compared the incident with the stampede at the Vaishno Devi temple. BJP cadres and local administration helped the students but the Congress leaders were only seen trying to cover up their mistake,” Shakya said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/cong-women-marathon-4-girls-hurt-ncpcr-directs-bareilly-dm-to-lodge-fir-101641318964393.html

Pawar was addressing the Vasantdada Sugar Institutes’ annual general meeting virtually on Tuesday. This is the second year the general body meeting was held virtually because of Covid-19. Pawar said, “Major sugar producing countries like Brazil, have adopted the hybrid model and keep switching production between ethanol and sugar depending upon prices. India has enough sugar production, around 305 lakh tonnes. If we consider export of sugar, then also the industry has enough sugar which can be diverted for ethanol production.” Pawar added, “Central government is promoting ethanol aggressively. Industry must participate to maintain its own economics.” He said that the differential price system has been introduced for ethanol-based sugar on whether it is produced directly from cane juice or from molasses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sharad-pawar-moots-hybrid-ethanol-and-sugar-production-model-101641318844256.html

Giving this information while talking to select media persons on Tuesday, UPPSC chairman Sanjay Srinet said, “Along with this, UPPSC has also taken several decisions to ensure fair and transparent conduct of recruitment exams held by it for various posts. The steps have been taken in wake of the recent incidents of paper leak that surfaced in the state.”“We will be issuing the advertisement for recruiting male nurses in the second week of January 2022 and that of PCS-2022 in the last week of this month,” he added. He also said the commission had taken several steps to improve the work culture because of which results of several recruitment processes had been announced in a record time. “We in the process of making an arrangement following which the candidates of different recruitment exams, conducted by the commission, would be able to know the name of their exam centre just 48 hours prior to the day of the exam. Before declaring the name of the exam centre, the candidate would only know the city in which the exam centre would be located (for example Gorakhpur 1 or 2, 3 etc) and prior to 48 hours of the exam, the commission would inform candidates about the exact name of the centre through an SMS, mail and via UPPSC’s official website,” the UPPSC chairman. He further said the commission now followed its annual calendar for both conducting the recruitment exams and announcing its results in a given time. “Besides, numbers of steps have been introduced in respect to examination centres and the commission would ensure that only those schools and institutions are made exam centres which fulfilled our norms,” he added. In another important decision taken by the commission, the chairman said in future all exams conducted by UPPSC would be two-layered and the concept of single exam or direct recruitment would be done away with. “This will eliminate the chances of any gang or unscrupulous elements getting involved in recruitment process,” he added. He said the commission had also decided to rope in support from Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). “UPSC is a higher body and has a spotless track record for its work culture. Thus, we have decided that UPPSC will take support from it and follow it to improve ourselves,” said the UPPSC chairman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-pcs-2022-notification-by-january-end-uppsc-chairman-101641318485031.html

Pune city too reported 1,113 cases.“It seems that the Omicron strain is responsible as is evident from the rapid rise in the number of cases. This seems to be an Omicron driven surge… but the severity of the infection is mild, so the number of cases is not accompanied by a corresponding rise in hospitalisations,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, the state’s surveillance officer. He added that the spread of a mild variant could serve as a “blessing in disguise,” by ensuring herd immunity.“But vulnerable people are at risk. This includes those suffering from diabetes, hypertension, cancer or are immunosuppressed due to medical treatment. We should develop a strategy of the focussed protection of the vulnerable population,” said Awate. Just around 10 per cent of the 66,308 active cases have been hospitalised. The state has around 2.75 lakh dedicated Covid beds, which can be increased in phases. Of these, 3.5 to 4 per cent are occupied. Similarly, of the 98,000 oxygen beds, only 2.12 per cent are occupied.Health minister Rajesh Tope said that they expected the active caseload in Maharashtra to touch 80 lakh in the third wave. This wave is expected to peak in mid-February or the end of that month, after which the graph is expected to taper.Meanwhile, Vijay Wadettiwar, minister for relief and rehabilitation, indicated that while some restrictions would be tightened considering the Covid surge, lockdown would be a last resort.

04-01-2022||Lucknow||UP can give free electricity to farmers: Consumer body chairman||Pointing out that electricity was free for farmers in around six states in the country, the UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Parishad, a power consumers’ body, on Tuesday, suggested a formula for making power free of cost for farmers in UP. “The government can easily provide free electricity to farmers with a little or no financial burden on the exchequer,” parishad chairman Avadhesh Kumar Verma said, amid various political parties talking of subsidised or free power before the upcoming Uttar Pradesh assembly polls. He said states including Andhra, Karnataka, Punjab and Telangana are providing free power to their farmers, while in Haryana the electricity is as cheap as 10 paise per unit. “On the contrary, in UP, farmers have to pay ₹170 per horsepower (HP) of the tubewell motor if they are unmetered consumers and ₹70 per HP plus ₹2 per unit energy charges if they have meters on their tubewells. In urban areas, the tariff is even higher at the rate of ₹130 per HP with ₹6, as per unit energy charge,” he pointed out. According to him, in UP, there were 1316399 agricultural consumers with 794170 kW connected load. Around 14006 units of electricity worth ₹1845 crore is consumed by the farmers in a year, and the state government gives an annual subsidy to the tune of ₹11,000 crores to the UPPCL to give cheaper power to the farmers. “The government can provide free power to farmers just by giving around ₹2,000 crores additional cash subsidy to the UPPCL in advance as provided under section 65 of the Electricity Act 2003,” Verma pointed out. He said the government could provide free power to farmers without bearing any subsidy burden too, through cost-cutting and other measures like stopping power from expensive sources. “We can submit a detailed plan to the government if it wants us to,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-can-give-free-electricity-to-farmers-consumer-body-chairman-101641317404479.html

The coming 15 days might see surge in the Covid graph in the state as being witnessed in Delhi and Maharashtra. The people should take utmost precaution and follow the Covid protocol to protect themselves from infection. Any event that required mass gathering should be restricted across the state.

These classes will instead resume online from Wednesday in Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and the rest of the district, said deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, after reviewing the Covid situation in Pune on Tuesday. The schools restarted for the first time on December 16, and there was then a winter break for most. The latest decision was taken as Covid-19 cases have been increasing in Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and rural parts of the district.As of Tuesday Pune district reported 1,649 new Covid-19 cases and five deaths due to the infection.“The offline classes for standards 1 to 8 will remain shut as the number of new cases continue to increase each day. As students from Class 9 onwards are eligible to get the vaccine under the 15-18 age group category we have offline classes as it will be easier to give them the shots. However, the younger students are not yet eligible for vaccination and so we have taken this decision to shut offline classes for Classes 1 to 8,” Pawar said during a press conference after the meeting. Pawar also said that the decision was taken after communication with Mumbai civic commissioner IS Chahal who also announced that classes in Mumbai for primary and secondary classes would remain shut. “I have also spoken to ICMR chief Dr Balram Bhargava who approved of the decision now that the positivity rate of the district is hovering around 18-20%. There are predictions that the number of Covid-19 cases could explode in the coming days,” said Pawar. The decision is also applicable to rural areas as most teaching staff in rural areas commute to and from the city to nearby villages, which means they could be potential spreaders, said Pawar.

A day after the incident on December 18, deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa had constituted a special investigation team (SIT) under Amritsar DCP (law and order) Parminder Singh Bhandal and asked it to complete the probe within two days. The SIT went through all CCTV footage of the Golden Temple complex and streets that lead to the shrine, and found that the accused paid several visits to the area before the day of the incident. However, it failed to establish his identity, despite making his picture taken from the CCTV footage public. After no one came up to claim his body, police cremated it. “We have not got any further clue about the accused despite persistent efforts,” said Bhandal, adding that the man’s postmortem report is still awaited. Earlier, the SIT had said that any action against those who lynched the accused would be taken only after receiving the postmortem report. Meanwhile, Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) have accused the police of cremating the accused’s body in haste, even as it was crucial evidence in the alleged conspiracy. SGPC forms 7-member probe panel The SGPC on Tuesday constituted a seven-member panel to conduct an internal investigation into the sacrilege bid as well as throwing of a gutka (books of hymns) in the sarovar at the Golden Temple. SGPC chief Harjinder Singh Dhami issued orders to form the panel. “Sri Harmandar Sahib (Golden Temple) granth Giani Gurminder Singh, Damdami Taksal chief Baba Harnam Singh Khalsa, Shiromani Panth Akali Budha Dal chief Baba Balbir Singh, SGPC senior vice-president Raghujit Singh Virk, member Bhagwant Singh Sialka, member Gurcharan Singh Grewal and Sikh scholar Inderjit Singh Gogoani will be members of the panel,” said Kulwinder Singh Ramdas, media assistant secretary of the apex gurdwara body. He said SGPC secretary Mahinder Singh Ahli will be the coordinator of the panel.

Deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya hit out at Yadav, saying if the Lord did come in his dream, he should promptly commit to a grand Krishna temple in Mathura. “Akhileshji, if you believe in Lord Krishna why don’t you support Krishna temple in Mathura? Do that, if Lord Krishna actually came in your dreams. Actually, Akhileshji must commit that he would get a grand Krishna temple made,” said Maurya. UP cabinet minister Sidharth Nath Singh said: “It’s nice that after talking Babur and Jinnah, Akhilesh Yadav has now started seeing Lord Krishna, albeit in his dreams. Wait for another five years and the entire Samajwadi Party would begin seeing Lord Ram, Lord Krishna and Lord Shiva too.” The Krishna controversy had started on Monday when the SP chief, while responding to a development about BJP Rajya Sabha MP writing to his party’s national president JP Nadda requesting him to field Yogi from Mathura, had said: “From wherever he contests, he will first have to answer people’s questions on unemployment, Covid deaths, law and order, electricity, businesses and the promise of doubling farmers’ income.” Quipping on the BJP MP’s letter in which he wrote that “Lord Krishna had inspired him to write the letter,” Akhilesh had said: “Lord Krishna comes to my dream and says that this time SP will form the government. And not just one day, Lord Krishna comes in my dream every day and says that SP will form the government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/entire-sp-would-begin-seeing-lord-ram-shiva-too-in-their-dream-sidharth-nath-singh-101641316743906.html

04-01-2022||Chandigarh||Covid curbs clamped on public, but politicians have free run in poll-bound Punjab||Even though the Punjab government has clamped Covid-19 restrictions in the state by closing educational institutions and imposing night curfew, politicians are having a free run as they are holding massive political rallies for the forthcoming assembly polls.Hours after the restrictions were imposed by the home department, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Tuesday held a massive rally of anganwadi workers in Morinda. Later, he attended a programme at a private university in Phagwara, where he even danced with the students. All Covid-19 guidelines were thrown to the wind at these events as people were without masks and did not maintain social distancing.Not only this, former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh held a workers’ meet at Bathinda beside meeting people in Patiala while on his way to Bathinda. AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal, who has tested positive for Covid-19, had also held massive shows of strength in Patiala and Amritsar, and even Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Badal is busy holding rallies. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to launch the BJP campaign by holding its maiden rally at Ferozepur.Even during his rally of anganwadi workers, CM Channi spoke about the threat of rising Covid-19 cases. He exhorted people to follow precautionary measures amid the recent surge in cases and said that the Punjab government already has a robust healthcare infrastructure in place to face any eventuality.“It’s totally unfair that restrictions have been imposed for the public, while politicians are having a free run, holding rallies and worker meetings. Restrictions have been clamped on hotels, clubs and gyms and educational institutions, but there is no bar on political gatherings,” said Naresh Kumar, a hotelier.“Why are laws and restrictions are only meant for the public. Why no restrictions on politicians?” questioned Badish Jindal, an industrialist. He said politicians, irrespective of their party, should be punished for spreading Covid-19 through their rallies. AAP leader Dr Balbir Singh said the party workers will follow all guidelines, and already they have been asked to comply with the Covid-19 protocol while canvassing. BJP leader Subash Sharma said the PM’s programme is a government function, which was planned before any restrictions were imposed.Meanwhile, medical education minister Raj Kumar Verka said the government is seized of the matter and more restrictions will be imposed after reviewing the situation.

The attack happened in Jhinaruan village when the former legislator was visiting the place to attend a football match as a guest, police said. While Nayak managed to flee the spot along with one of his three bodyguards and reached Goilkera police station to report the matter, the two other bodyguards were reportedly killed by the ultras and their arms snatched. “As per the latest confirmed information, one Jharkhand police jawan with the former MLA has been killed.

04-01-2022||Ranchi||Tribal man finds his name on wanted Maoist list, seeks CM’s help||A 43-year-old tribal man in Bokaro district of Jharkhand on Tuesday urged chief minister Hemant Soren for help, alleging he has wrongly been framed and branded as a Maoist by the local police which is asking him to surrender as he carries a reward of ₹1 lakh on his head. A local rights activist tweeted a letter on behalf of the man, Birsa Majhi, who is uneducated and works as a labourer. In the letter, Majhi, father of four children, has claimed he fears for his life and wants his name to be cleared. Majhi is a resident of Charpania village under Jogeshwarnagar police station of Bokaro district. Sunil Baski, 20-year-old son of Majhi, told Hindustan Times on Tuesday that his father was summoned by the police station in-charge last month and asked to surrender since he was a “wanted Maoist and carries a reward of ₹1 lakh on his head”. “We are not educated. We don’t even know in which case he has been named as a Maoist. The policemen at the station told my father that he could also get some money if he surrenders,” said Baski, adding that a few villagers and activists were helping them in the matter. Siraj Dutta of Jharkhand Janadhikar Mahasabha, a rights group which is helping Majhi, said the man is innocent and that it seems to be a case of mistaken identity. “Majhi is facing a trial in an old case of witchcraft in 2006. Like other accused in that case, he will also be acquitted as he is innocent. And out of nowhere, he has now been branded as Maoist. In 2018, all his belongings at his home were attached by police when Majhi was in Andhra Pradesh for work. His family was not even served a proper notice and they don’t still know in which case that action was taken. We demand the CM to intervene in the case and provide relief to this poor tribal,” said Siraj. Lakshmi Prasad, who appeared for Birsa Majhi in the 2006 case, said he is innocent and is likely to be acquitted. “Six of the other accused in the case have been acquitted as the charges could not hold. This man is still on trial just because he could not appear for hearings as he is poor man wandering for work,” Prasad said. On the new charges, Prasad said they have no clue in which case police wants Majhi to surrender. Jogeshwarnagar police station in-charge Kanhaiya Ram dismissed allegations that he had directed Majhi to surrender. “I did not summon him and I have not even met him. Would I have allowed him to walk free if he is a Maoist carrying a reward of ₹1 lakh? Only he can say who did he meet at the police station,” said Ram. About allegation of his property being attached in 2018 without any notice and whether any case is pending against Majhi in his police station, Ram said, “I will have to check the records as this police station was established only a few years back and many files are still in record room with Mahuatand police station from which Jogeshwarnagar station was carved out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/tribal-man-finds-his-name-on-wanted-maoist-list-seeks-cm-s-help-101641313568309.html

04-01-2022||Patna||Bihar seeks special financial assistance from Centre||The Bihar government has sought special financial package from the Centre and modification in fiscal norms, state’s finance minister and deputy chief minister Tarkishore Prasad said on Tuesday. Prasad said the state urgently required the financial assistance for infrastructure development and capital expenditure owing to unavoidable natural calamities. He made a formal demand for the same during the pre-budget meeting of finance ministers of different states with union finance minister Nirmala Sitharamam in New Delhi last week. “We have offered sufficient arguments to justify our demands, which include revisit of revenue sharing pattern in the Centrally sponsored schemes,” said the deputy CM. Recently, chief minister Nitish Kumar and many of his cabinet colleagues had trashed the Niti Aayog’s report on multi-dimensional poverty index, in which Bihar was ranked at the bottom of development with regard to education, health and ease of living. The CM had questioned the authenticity for the report and the state government had sent a formal protest against it. Declining to elaborate on the CM’s assertion about the Niti Aayog’s report, Prasad said the Bihar government had asked for review of revenue sharing pattern in the Centrally sponsored schemes as the Centre’s share in them had been on decline over the past few years. “We have asked the Centre to increase the fiscal deficit limit to 5% of the state’s GDP against the present 3%, besides raising the borrowing limit,” said the deputy CM. Prasad said that prior to 2015-16, the Centre’s share in various centrally assisted schemes was 90%, 75% or 60%. “But in recent times, Bihar has enhanced its spending on various schemes as the Centre had slashed its share considerably. The state’s share in the Central taxes has also been decreased,” said Prasad, adding that the state had to spend a substantial share of revenue to pay salary to school teachers and pension of retired employees. The Opposition, however, was quick to attack the state government over the issue. “Earlier, the government promised special status to Bihar, jobs to two crore people every year and recovery of black money, but nothing happened,” Congress leader Ajay Kumar Singh said.Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) spokesman Mrityunjay Tiwari said social welfare schemes had become a den of corruption.

JD (U) national president Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh on Tuesday informed through a tweet that has also tested positive for Covid-19.

04-01-2022||Patna||Two teens gets Covishield shots instead of Covaxin in Bihar’s Nalanda district||Following a faux pas, wherein two teenagers in the 15-18 years age group were administered Covishield instead of Covaxin at a vaccination centre in Nalanda on Monday, the district administration on Tuesday issued a show-cause notice to the nurse who had administered the vaccine, officials in the state health department said.“The teenagers, both brothers, have not reported any adverse event following the immunisation (AEFI). They had mild fever and body pain last evening but are doing absolutely fine now. We are taking regular feedback from the parents,” said Nalanda civil surgeon Dr Sunil Kumar.“We kept the children under observation for 90 minutes and have assured the parents, who came to meet me, to extend all possible medical help in case of any eventuality. I have shared my official mobile number as well as that of the district hospital and asked them to contact us in case the children face any medical issue,” said Dr Kumar.Terming it a ‘huge negligence’, the civil surgeon said, “I have issued a show-cause notice to the GNM trainee concerned and will also ask the deputy superintendent of the district hospital under whose guidance the vaccination session sites are being run, to explain how the lapse took place.”The two brothers, Aryan Kiran, 16, a student of class 10 in Nalanda, and Piyush Ranjan, 17, of class 11 in Bishop Scott’s Boys School, Patna, took the vaccine shots at the Indian Medical Association (IMA) hall, which was a vaccination centre for adults.“My children got their vaccination centre at the IMA Hall in Biharsharif at the time of pre-booking on the CoWIN portal on Sunday. My husband, Priyaranjan Kumar, even enquired with the staff at the vaccination centre who told him that Covaxin was being administered. I became very nervous when I later got to know that Covishield had been given to both my children. They had developed fever, pain and slight dizziness last evening, but are now doing fine,” said the mother of the teenagers Poonam Kumari. “My biggest worry now is to get the vaccination certificate of my children corrected that mentions Covaxin. I have spoken to the district health officials but they have not given me any assurance,” the mother added.Talking about the faux pas, the civil surgeon said the auxiliary nursing midwife (ANM), who was administering the vaccines on a regular basis turned Covid-19 positive and was off duty. In the haste of making an alternate arrangement, the officials deputed a general nursing midwife (GNM) trainee, who was possibly ignorant about the government directive to administer only Covaxin to children,” said Dr Kumar.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, in his December 28 letter to the chief secretary and administrator of all Indian states and union territories, had written that the option for vaccination of children would only be Covaxin as this was the only vaccine with emergency use listing (EUL) for the age group 15-18.The WHO had issued Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin emergency use listing in November, last year. WHO’s EUL procedure assesses the quality, safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines and is a prerequisite for vaccine supply.There have been a few instances of goof ups in Covid vaccination in Bihar in the last one year.Earlier, on June 21 last year, an ANM at the Urdu Middle School temporary vaccination centre in Barhampur village of Saran district had administered a shot to a youth without any vaccine in the syringe. The Bihar government had suspended the nurse after the video went viral.On June 16, a sexagenarian woman, Sunila Devi, was given a shot each of Covaxin and Covishied at an interval of 5 minutes at the Utkramit Vidyalaya, a rural vaccination camp in Beldarichak village of Punpun block under Patna district.Instances of vaccine mix-up have also been reported from Bihar’s Purnia and Samastipur districts.Madan Lal Modi, 50, claimed he was vaccinated Covaxin instead of Covishield in the second shot at the Kasba community health centre, Purnia, on May 11. Its medical officer Dr Ashok Kumar Singh had then attributed it to “human error”.Ankit Sharma, 32, claimed his provisional vaccination certificate, after the first jab, mentioned Covaxin though he was administered Covishield at the Middle School, Harpur Alloth village, Samastipur, on May 16.

But, she never returned. The police suspected that she was allegedly kidnapped by a 20-year-old woman whom the girl’s family recently provided shelter and helped in getting a ticket for her hometown. The police claimed that she lured the girl with the promise of a luxurious life. The victim, however, on learning the accused’s intention, was smart enough to escape and seek help to contact her father. The Naupada police in Thane sent a team to Delhi to get the girl back and registered a kidnapping case against unknown persons.The girl, identified as Tulshi Butia, resides in Kalwa and sells garlands and flowers with her family at Thane station.A police officer from Naupada said, “The family met the woman who identified herself as Jyoti on December 27. She told them her ordeal and asked for help to reach Gujarat, her hometown. The Butia family allowed her to stay with them and on December 29 gave her some money to buy a train ticket.” On the same day, their daughter went missing. The officer added, “The woman lured the girl with the promise of a smartphone, luxurious life and several other comforts, and convinced her to board the train with her. After reaching Dwarka, she took the girl to a red light area and the two slept in an auto rickshaw for the night. The next day, when the accused did not take her home, Butia was scared and asked her to give her the phone so she could call her father. Jyoti refused. That’s when the girl got a chance to escape and run away. She approached a security guard on the way and called her parents from his phone.”Senior police inspector, Sanjay Dhumal, said, “Both of them vanished at the same time. Therefore, we realised the accused might have taken the girl along with her. We sent a team to Gujarat to find the girl. Meanwhile on January 1, the girl’s father got a call from the person who found the girl crying in Delhi’s Dwarka railway station. We sent our team and brought her back on January 2. The Dabadi Police in Delhi tried to look for the other woman who dropped the girl there but could not find her.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/13yearold-girl-kidnapped-from-thane-rescued-in-delhi-101641313505703.html
04-01-2022||Patna||Bihar panchayat polls: Females sweep elections for district boards posts||Female candidates in Bihar have swept the elections for the coveted posts of chairperson and deputy chairperson of district boards, the apex body of the three-tier rural local bodies, as per results declared late Monday evening. Of the total 38 district boards, 29 posts of chairperson and 24 posts of deputy chairperson have been won by females in an indirect election in which the newly elected ward members in panchayats form the electorate, as per data compiled by the State Election Commission (SEC). For the post of chairperson, females have beaten their male counterparts in at least 11 district boards where there was no reservation for women nominees. They have fared equally well in winning 24 posts of deputy chairperson despite there being no reservation for female candidates for the post. The margin of victory for winners has varied from 42 votes to as small as six votes in different district boards, indicating the close contest. There are 18 district boards where the post of chairperson is reserved for women, including seven from SCs/STs and backward classes, as part of the policy to give 50% reservation for women in seats in panchayat bodies asz provisioned in the panchayati raj act. “This is a welcome change. It indicates the change in social milieu and breaking of traditional mould,” said State Election Commissioner Dr Deepak Prasad. Another striking aspect of the election for district board chairpersons is that several old faces, including some having strong political background, have lost. For instance, Rani Bharti, daughter of Bima Bharti, a former minister and JD(U) MLA from Rupauli, lost the election for the post of chairperson of Purnia district board to Wahida Sarwar by 19 votes.“In at least 28-29 district boards, new faces have been elected as chairperson and deputy chairperson,” said an official in the SEC. The panchayat election in Bihar to fill up 2.55 lakh posts were conducted in 11 phases, from September 24 to December 12 last year.
04-01-2022||Mumbai||Resident doctors call off strike, to resume services from today||Mumbai: The Central Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) on Monday called off their strike late evening. A statement was released after a virtual meeting between members of the resident doctors’ association and Dr Deelip Mhaisekar, director of the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER).“We’ve been assured recruitment of house officers/medical officers in all government and corporation hospitals. This is being done in view of the delay in postgraduate medical counselling,” said a member of central MARD. The protests were triggered on account of delays in placing doctors at government hospitals, as the Supreme Court (SC) is considering a policy to increase the share of seats reserved for underrepresented communities. This has resulted in a stay on admissions to postgraduate medical courses, leaving an entire batch of first-year PG students missing in 2021. In addition to the delay in NEET-PG counselling, the city’s resident doctors are also demanding the waiver of their academic fees and a risk incentive for services rendered during the pandemic, which was promised to them by the civic body. Post the meeting with Mhaisekar, students have now been assured that “runanubandh bhatta” (allowances) will be released soon for medical colleges. “DMER director has also assured us that irregularities of stipend at few medical colleges will be addressed soon,” read the statement by Central MARD.Meanwhile, SC on Tuesday said it will hear the EWS matter a day in advance. Originally scheduled to be heard on January 6, the SC will now hear the petition on Wednesday, January 5. “Advancing the hearing by one day after a four-month delay makes no difference. However, the focus should now be on avoiding any further delay and starting the counselling process at the earliest,” said a resident doctor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/resident-doctors-call-off-strike-to-resume-services-from-today-101641313443355.html

04-01-2022||Lucknow||I-T raids on 4 shoe exporters of Agra, Noida-based realtor||AGRA/MEERUT The income tax department on Tuesday raided multiple premises linked to a Noida-based realtor, who is said to have political connections, and four Agra-based footwear exporters as part of a tax evasion investigation, official sources said.They said offices and other locations of the realtor and footwear exporters in Agra, Noida and Delhi were covered as part of the searches.The action was an outcome of heavy investments in real estate and purchase of properties in prime locations by the footwear exporters in recent times, but the quantum of seizures was not revealed, they said. The raids took place at different spots including the exporters’ residences in Agra’s posh localities of Bharatpur House, Lajpat Kunj and Vijay Nagar Colony apart from the locations in Delhi and Noida. The operations were led by additional director of income tax (investigations) Neelam Agrawal, and assistant director of income tax (investigations) Ashima Mahajan. The raids began around 7am and were continuing when reports last came in. In Agra, the premises of Om Exports, Tara Innovations and Nuova Shoes were raided but officials of these firms were not available for comment. I-T sleuths, however, refused to make any comment. Meanwhile, the Noida-based builder’s house was raided by the I-T department’s team in his native village Mehrampur in Baghpat at 5am on Tuesday. Deputy director of Income Tax Rajeev Prasad was leading the team.The team faced mild resistance from villagers but the police managed to keep them away and the team searched the house. The builder was said to be close to the Samajwadi Party. The realtor is stated to have developed commercial and residential projects in Noida, Greater Noida and some other locations in the National Capital Region, said sources.Samajwadi Party leader and former member of state planning commission Sudhir Panwar described the raid as a “targeted operation” and accused the ruling BJP of violating ethics to win the elections.Panwar raised questions over the timing of the raid, and said: “The BJP grossly misused government agencies to win elections, which is against democratic values of the country.” He said the raids would pave the way for victory of SP in forthcoming UP Assembly elections, as similar operations in West Bengal and Rajasthan resulted in the success of non-BJP parties. “What is there to fear if none has done any wrong? It’s true that the Samajwadi Party and its leader are little bewildered these days as the fragrance of the Samajwadi perfume has turned into a stench,” said Keshav Prasad Maurya, deputy chief minister, UP. “The BJP is trying to terrorise opposition parties by using CBI, ED and other agencies. But they are mistaken. These only show the BJP’s desperation,” said Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party leader Om Prakash Rajbhar, whose party has inked a pre-poll pact with the Samajwadi Party. Earlier while commenting on I-T raids on some of his party leaders, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav too had said that these operations only showed how desperate the BJP was. “Now, income tax has come and shortly enforcement directorate and the CBI would come too,” Yadav had said while accusing the BJP of misusing central agencies for poll gains. I-T agencies had previously raided Kannauj businessman Piyush Jain, who BJP leaders claimed, was connected with the launch of Samajwadi ‘itar’ in Lucknow in November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/it-raids-on-4-shoe-exporters-of-agra-noida-based-realtor-101641313264073.html

04-01-2022||Mumbai||Mangrove Foundation deploys app to streamline data collection on Olive Ridley turtles||MUMBAI: The Mangrove Foundation - an autonomous society under the Maharashtra forest department’s mangrove cell - on Tuesday launched a mobile application named M-Turtle to help streamline collection of data on the nesting patterns of Olive Ridley turtles in Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg and Raigad districts where they are known to lay eggs between December and March.The app was created in collaboration with Chiplun-based NGO, Sahyadri Nisarga Mitra, which has been working with the Mangrove Foundation on sea turtle conservation in Maharashtra, and which is the first organisation in the state to start a sea turtle conservancy programme in Ratnagiri’s Velas village.The application will be used by about 55 qualified nest managers, who conduct regular patrols along the coast to identify Olive Ridley turtle nests and transport the eggs to hatcheries where they are kept safely until the hatching season in April-May, after which the hatchlings are released into the ocean.“During this process, we collect a lot of data ranging from the number of nesting sites, nests and eggs; to measuring turtle track marks on the beach; to the hatchling success rate; to the survival rate of the hatchlings. Doing this manually is a lot of effort, and there have been issues in the past due to the data not being uniform. The M-Turtle app eliminates any extra work, and all the information that we need as researchers becomes available to us on the cloud,” said Harshal Karve, a marine biologist with the Mangrove Foundation.M-Turtle was first commissioned by the Mangrove Foundation in early 2020 and has been in testing over the past one month to remove bugs and respond to queries from nest managers. “Our nest managers in Raigad and Ratnagiri are already using the app, and have given positive feedback. We are conduting a training workshop in Sindhudurg on Wednesday. The nest managers deal with a large amount of data so it can get very tedious for them to note down everything manually and then input it on a computer,” Karve added.The Mangrove Foundation is planning to add more functionality to the M-Turtle app in future. For example, the foundation is considering equipping all nest managers with thermometers and asking them to log the temperatures of Olive Ridley turtle nests, along with the sand around the nesting site. “This plays an important role in determining the sex of the hatchlings. The data won’t be perfect but it will give us a rough baseline for future studies, and it can be reflected on the app in real time,” Karve explained.This nesting season, nest managers have so far identified only 10 Olive Ridley turtle nests in Maharashtra including one at Araavi beach in Sindhudurg district, a hitherto unknown nesting location. Officials from the Mangrove Foundation said that they have conducted awareness drives among the locals and are currently keeping a watch out for other Olive Ridley turtle nests in the area. While there are four species of sea turtles recorded in Maharashtra, Olive Ridley turtles are the only species that nest in the state and have the widest population distribution. Globally, their populations have been declining, and they have been listed as ‘vulnerable’ in the IUCN Red list of threatened species.In 2021, the number of turtle nesting sites along Maharashtra’s coastline had doubled as compared to 2020. During nesting season, a total of 451 nesting sites were recorded through field observations, up from 288 during the corresponding period last year. In fact, data shows a significant increase in the number of nesting sites over the past six years. In 2017, for example, only 75 nests were recorded across these three districts. That figure has shown steady improvements, year on year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mangrove-foundation-deploys-app-to-streamline-data-collection-on-olive-ridley-turtles-101641309182895.html

The directorate general of health services in its order cited the high transmissibility of Omicron variant of coronavirus and exponential rise in new infections."The keepers of all private hospitals/nursing homes having total bed capacity of 50 beds or more are directed to reserve at least 40% of their total bed capacity (i.e. 40% of Ward Bed capacity and 40% of ICU bed capacity) for COVID patients," the order read.As daily Covid cases witnessed a decline in June last year, the Delhi government allowed all private hospitals and nursing homes with a total bed capacity of 100 beds or more to reduce their reserve capacity for Covid oxygenated beds to 30% of their total bed capacity. Delhi may see 5,500 Covid cases today, curfew is not lockdown: Health minister JainIn view of rising cases of vector-borne diseases like dengue and malaria in October last year, the government allowed those private hospitals and nursing homes to further reduce their reserve capacity for Covid oxygenated beds to 10% of their total bed capacity.The fresh order related to reserve beds after an upsurge of Covid cases in Delhi in the past four days as the positivity rate rose from 2.44% on December 31, 2021, to more than 8% on January 4, 2022. On Tuesday, the Delhi government imposed fresh curbs, including a weekend curfew in the national capital to contain the virus. Delhi health minister Satyendra Jain said the weekend curfew being imposed in view of rising Covid cases should not be considered a lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-directs-private-hospitals-to-keep-40-of-bed-capacity-for-covid-cases-101641307074421.html

Besides, the judge also imposed a fine of ₹25,000 on the convicted man, identified as Amit Suresh Aher, 39, a resident of Khadki area of Pune. Upon failure to pay the fine, the man will be subject to an additional year of rigorous imprisonment, according to the court order.The conviction was awarded by district Judge KK Jhagirdar with public prosecutor Arundhati Bramhe and investigating officer police sub-inspector Namrata Daware. The victims in the case are siblings and were 14-year-old and 16-year-old at the time of registering of the case in 2018.  Aher is currently out on bail in the case. He was the live-in partner of the survivors mother and lived in the same house as the minor girl, said officials. “There were two victims. The man was known to them. One of them turned hostile and the second one was from 2014 so there was substantial delay in filing of the FIR. But conviction was granted. Sexual assault cases do not come to light as much as they should due to pressure from relatives and lack of complainants’ and their relatives’ will. But if such convictions are awarded, it will encourage other survivors to come forward and curb the abusers’ tendencies to commit such crimes,” said prosecutor Bramhe. With one witness hostile, the prosecution examined six witnesses in the case including the investigating officer. The two sisters lived in a hostel and used to visit home during vacation days. It was during one such vacation in 2014 that the man molested the elder sister. The girl cried herself to sleep but did not tell her mother about it fearing backlash from her. The man repeated the crime in 2018 as the girl was sleeping. It was then that she told one of her maternal aunts about the incident. A second aunt then reported the incident to the police. At the time, the younger sister also claimed to have been molested but retracked her statement during trial.The police had arrested the man in 2018 for molesting two girls since 2014. He was arrested in March 2018 and had been in Yerawada central jail since March 27, 2018. However, he was granted bail on ₹15,000 personal bond on April 18, 2018 by additional sessions judge PC Bhagure.In his bail order, the judge had asked the man to stay away from the survivors and not try to establish any contact.The conviction was awarded under Section 354 of the Indian Penal Code along with Sections 8 and 12 of Protection of children from sexual offence act (POCSO) registered at Bhosari police station. The man was found not guilty under sections of 7 and 11 of POCSO which were invoked in the FIR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/man-gets-five-years-rigourous-imprisonment-for-molesting-partner-s-minor-daughter-in-2018-101641307142609.html

But our demand to waive off 60 per cent property tax on flats between 501 to 700 square feet has not been fulfilled,” said Bhai Jagtap, president of the Mumbai Regional Congress Committee (MRCC), adding that the waiver should be implemented with retrospective effect from 2020 instead of April 2022. Jagtap urged Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to take this decision and added that Congress had been demanding this since January 2021.The Shiv Sena, which controls the cash-rich Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which is the richest civic body in Asia, had promised this in its manifesto for the 2017 polls. This will lead to the BMC foregoing revenues to the tune of around ₹462 crore every year. The decision, which will be placed before the state cabinet for ratification, will come into effect from 1 April 2022 for the 2022-23 financial year.Jagtap demanded that the BMC administration revoke its decision to convene meetings through the virtual route, and asked for physical meetings to be resumed to ensure that elected representatives can get issues addressed more effectively. The MRCC president also sought that the vaccination for those between the 15 to 18 years age cohort is conducted in their respective educational institutions to make the drive more effective and focused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/congress-demands-property-tax-waiver-with-retrospective-effect-101641306482698.html

The Congress leader had also appealed to the jathedar to instead act against the Badals for their alleged “anti-Panthic” activities.“Randhawa has no right to interfere in the Panthic affairs because his party Congress had unseemly attempted to end Sikh Qaum (community) by committing genocide of Sikhs in 1984,” Dhami said in a statement.Telling the Congress leader to “first look under his own cot”, the SGPC chief said: “This sacrilege committed by Congress has become a forever mark on Sikh psyche and the coming generations will never forget this too.”Dhami said the Akal Takht Sahib is supreme and the dignity of its honourable jathedar is very high. “But these Congress leaders are on the path of undermining the traditions of Akal Takht Sahib. Their aim is to create confusion between the Qaum. An example of this is the appearance of these leaders while standing on the road in front of self-proclaimed jathedars in the recent past. These people are doing such practises, only with the intention of weakening the Panth,” said Dhami.Giani Harpreet Singh during the Sunday event had said the Sikh community would not tolerate any interference in its religious affairs and urged it to strengthen the Akal Takht and the SGPC. “The SAD will get stronger automatically,” the jathedar had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/randhawa-has-no-right-to-interfere-in-panthic-affairs-sgpc-chief-101641304444343.html
04-01-2022||Delhi||Yoga in yellow alert: Delhiites make the most of outdoor sessions||With gyms shut in the city, as per the restrictions under yellow alert, it’s yoga in the open that is more or less the only option left for residents to be able to work out and stay fit. Most yoga centres, in the Capital, have been shut as per the guidelines of the Government. But private trainers are allowed to conduct yoga outdoors, and Delhiites are making the most of this option.“There are more bookings for private sessions coming in now, as this is the only form of exercise that has been allowed, and that too in the open and not indoors. Some people are booking yoga sessions with us, specifically for their kids. People want to concentrate on their health and work out as well, and yoga is undoubtedly the best option to do so at this point,” says Nidhi Bhanot, from Yog Nirvana Yoga Classes, Model Town.Echoing similar thoughts, Anuj Bangari, a yoga teacher from Pitampura, says, “The response in the number of queries and enrolments has been phenomenal in the past few days, and roz fresh enquiries bhi aa rahi hain. Ek toh sirf yoga allowed hai toh log fitness angle se soch rahe hain. But in addition, they know that yoga has many benefits and just practising breathing exercises can help them strengthen their lungs and subsequently build their immunity. So this is another reason why a lot of people are of late wanting to take up yoga, seeing the sudden rise in Covid-19 cases in the country. Log chahte hain ki woh fully prepared rahe Covid ko harane ke liye!” But only yoga, without Covid precautions, isn’t going to be of much help in such times, says Bangari, adding, “I’m taking one on one classes, and those too are conducted in the open. No group sessions are allowed as of now because I feel it’s utmost important to maintain social distancing, to defeat the corona virus.” And another yoga instructor, Hari Om, who conducts personalised sessions across Delhi-NCR shares, “Humari offline individual classes bhi chal rahi hain, but we are ensuring to take in only vaccinated students. The instructors are also vaccinated, and we organise these classes in the open, while ensuring a six to eight feet distance between the students and us. Instructor mask pehne rakhte hain. Aur pehle jaise we would hold a student and guide them in striking the correct pose for an asana, but now we are making sure that we don’t even go close. We only give verbal instructions and guidance.”The set up seems to be working for people wanting to stay fit. “The results are so amazing that those who had enrolled themselves earlier, are this time getting their family members as well as friends to join in,” says Mandeep Duggal who runs Delhi Yoga Classes in Rohini. And Ruby Sharma, a homemaker from Shalimar Bagh says, “Yoga is really helping me as the news of Covid cases going up, drove me to join solo classes, and I am so happy with my decision. I’ve a medical condition in my lungs, and just coming for the class in the outdoors is making me feel so much better. I was anxious as I cannot take a chance with Covid, but the fact that only yoga is open, motivated me to join. At least there is some form of work out that we can do to stay healthy.” Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/yoga-in-yellow-alert-delhiites-make-the-most-of-outdoor-sessions-101641303233186.html

The circular stated that the police personnel suffering from comorbidities such as diabetes, heart ailments, high blood pressure and those who have undergone angioplasty or treatment for cancer or such other serious health issues, should not be assigned duties at the station house, so as to avoid their direct contact with the members of the public. The circular adds that irrespective of age, policemen with co-morbidities should be given office work or work at other places, where they do not come in direct contact with the public in general, thus reducing the possibility of them contracting the deadly virus. Wherever possible they should be allowed to work from home, it added. Pandey has also instructed police personnel to take all the precautions and ensure that they are not at the risk of getting infected and police stations, police colonies and police vehicles are frequently disinfected and policemen on duty are provided with appropriate face masks and sanitiser. The circular further stated that the police stations should also be equipped with temperature measuring instruments. Similar concessions were given to policemen between 55 and 58 years of age and those with co-morbidities during the first and second waves in Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cops-above-55-years-to-stay-away-from-direct-public-contact-dgp-101641302572193.html
04-01-2022||Delhi||Game on for waste segregation! Golf to snakes and ladders, there’s lots to play||Don’t be surprised if you spot a cute cartoon character explaining to you the concepts of waste segregation at a popular market in the city. A host of Delhi-NCR based NGOs have come up with games and other innovative methods to explain the concept of waste segregation and ill effects of single-use plastic. “We are planning to hold parades, puppet shows, magic shows in SDMC markets; to explain these concepts. But of course, all the plans depend on the Covid situation,” says Ruby Makhija, from Why Waste Wednesdays, adding, “We recently had a very successful event at a city mall, where one of our volunteers dressed like a Santa Claus, engaged the children as well their parents and grandparents. The idea was to spread awareness on waste segregation at the source, and control single-use plastic bags at a popular mall. We had cards with names of various items mentioned such as left over food, cans, plastic bottles, vegetable peels, syringes, expired medicines, cardboard boxes etc. Three dustbins were placed — one each for wet, dry and hazardous waste — and the children or adults had to put the card given by Santa Claus in the correct bin.” “Games are the best way to explain such concepts,” says Rukhsar Gauri, from Gurugram-based NGO, Saahas, adding, “We conduct these awareness games with the help of RWAs, in residential societies. In one game that involves golf, we make a path and put coloured glasses at the end. These are coloured in segregation colours — green for wet waste, blue for dry waste, black for domestic hazardous waste and yellow for electronic waste. The one playing it, needs to use a golf stick to put the ball in the right bottle; depending on the card they pick... People are so interested in these games that the kids start fighting as to who will play first. This is way better than showing people some power point presentation, or giving them a lecture.”And if you talk of games, then how can snakes and ladders be left behind! One waste segregation game, based on snakes and ladders, and darts, by Dwarka-based NGO, Rise Foundation. In the process of coming up with more innovative games, Madhukar Varshney from the foundation, says, “In the waste segregation snakes and ladders, if you do a good thing, then keeping the concept of waste segregation in mind, you move ahead. The other game we make people play is a waste segregation magnetic dart game. This one has a chart paper with numbers corresponding to the colour where the dart lands, and each number has a message about waste segregation. This makes it exciting for the players, and helps us put across the message that’s much needed to keep our city clean.”Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Twitter and Facebook||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/game-on-for-waste-segregation-golf-to-snakes-and-ladders-there-s-lots-to-play-101641302212407.html
04-01-2022||Mumbai||Congress to deploy 10k Gandhidoots to counter fake news in cyberspace||Mumbai In a bid to improve its social media outreach and fact-check propaganda about its party and leaders, the Congress is appointing 10,000 social media warriors as ‘Gandhidoots.’ This will help the grand old party counter the influence of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in cyberspace. The Congress is also working at creating a social media structure from the state-level down to every assembly segment to serve as a force multiplier. “We are looking at boosting the numbers of our social media volunteers across the state. These Gandhidoots will be appointed in each assembly constituency and will be trained in the party’s ideology and the credo of Mahatma Gandhi. They will take the message to the people through Whatsapp and social media,” said Vishal Muttemwar, general secretary, Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) and chairperson of the party’s social media department. “We want to build a narrative… and we need supporters on the ground for it,” he added.At present, the Congress social media cell has a strength of around 425, including a core team of about 10. It also has a leader in charge of a district and an assembly segment. However, it is looking at a quantum leap in the numbers of its social media warriors by appointing around 40 to 50 volunteers in every state assembly constituency for focussed messaging on social media.In February, Congress had issued an appeal calling for volunteers, and around 17,000 people had responded in this missed call-based campaign. However, the second wave of the pandemic had delayed the rollout. Now, a fresh campaign has been launched and the party will utilise the responses from both drives to create a database of respondents and reach out to them. A total of 10,000 volunteers will be appointed as ‘Gandhidoots’ after an interview process that will be completed by February. Their social media trials and history will also be checked to assess their ideological and political leanings.Muttemwar said that these ‘Gandhidoots’ will draft and disseminate content, posts and memes and will be involved in fact-checking and debunking fake news. “They will also present the correct version of history... We will create a content bank to counter deliberate distortions of history about our party and its leaders like Pandit Nehru, Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel,” he explained. “The internet and social media have a lot of fake content against icons like Mahatma Gandhi. The idea is to ensure that the younger generation gets to know the facts through a manner that is rational and scientific,” explained a Youth Congress leader. “Apart from fact-sharing and sharing party propaganda, we will also disseminate messages over issues like unemployment, womens’ safety, law and order and the state of the farmers,” said another leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/congress-to-deploy-10k-gandhidoots-to-counter-fake-news-in-cyberspace-101641302152008.html
04-01-2022||Mumbai||After MV Act amendment, traffic cops collect 65% more fines||Mumbai After the 2019 amendment to the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, came into force in Maharashtra on December 12, 2021, the fine amount shot up by 65 per cent, even as the violations decreased by over 20 per cent. Before December 12, an average of 51,584 challans were issued to traffic violators across Maharashtra every day. After the amendment, the number of traffic violations went down to a daily average of 40,245, but the average fine levied on motorists has gone up from a daily average of Rs. 1.98 crore to Rs. 3.28 crore. Maharashtra traffic police officer take the sharp decline as an indication that the enhanced fines have a deterrent effect. “It may take time to further discipline motorists, but looks like the increased fines will surely prove to be more effective in the near future. Maximum drivers are aware of the amendment and are more cautious now,” said BK Upadhyay, additional director general of police (traffic), Maharashtra. Although the amount of fines levied on violators has increased in numbers, traffic police officers said, unless the drivers pay their challans, the amendment will not be actually effective. According to statistics provided by the traffic police department, between November 27 and December 12, a total of 8,06,218 challans were issued to traffic violators, out of which only 1,62,412 were paid, leaving a staggering 5,96,161 challans unpaid. The number of fines recovered in this period was Rs. 4,40,91,750 – only 16.93 % of the total levied fine amount of Rs. 26,04,07,850. After December 12, in all 7,30,857 challans were issued and 1,08,038 of them were realised, leaving 6,22,819 challans as unpaid and the total amount the violators owed the government was ₹92,39,13,384 out of which ₹37,61,57,084 were paid and ₹54,77,56,300 was unpaid amount. Traffic police officers said that they have been conducting regular checks and also sending notices to drivers who had not paid their challans, to be present before the Lok Adalat. “This step has proved to be quite effective as we had recovered the amount of ₹6,76,75,150 out of ₹135,05,37,951 till November this year,” he said.Experts said that although the increase acted as a deterrent, but the agencies also need to improve road markings so that the driver or riders are not confused and commit an offence unintentionally. “The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and other road maintenance authorities need to mark pedestrian crossings and stop lines on the roads more clearly so that a driver does not unintentionally commit an offence like crossing the stop line and then getting a challan,” said Sudhir Badami, traffic expert. Some experts also think that the difference of 20 per cent in challans issued within 15 days of the amendment is not too much. “There could be many reasons of the this 20 per cent difference like less enforcement etc. but due to social media and news agencies, awareness of the amendment has reached almost every driver in the state and it will act as a deterrent,” said Dhaval Ashar, senior manager with the Integrated Transport team at the World Resources Institute (WRI). GRP traffic branch fines 2,053 violatorsIn the past 15 days, the traffic branch of the Government Railway Police (GRP), which has been restarted after a gap of 12 years, has caught 2,053 traffic violators and recovered a fine of ₹11,19,300 from them. Police Inspector Suresh Bhale, in charge of the GRP traffic division, said they have opened five traffic chowkies across outside of major railway stations - Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, Mumbai Central Terminus, Bandra Terminus, Dadar and Kurla LTT (Lokmanya Tilak Terminus). One ASI and two constables have been posted at every terminus along with an e-challan machine. Bhale said after a week-long awareness session for auto and taxi drivers, asking them to wear uniforms, badges and keep driving licenses and insurance documents with them while on duty, from December 15 they started penalising the violators. He added that in the past 15 days, they have fined 950 drivers for obstructing vehicular traffic at the terminus, 447 drivers for not wearing uniforms, 10 drivers for refusal to ply and 38 for number plate related issues.According to statistics provided by the traffic police department, between November 27 and December 12, a total of 8,06,218 challans were issued to traffic violators, out of which only 1,62,412 were paid, leaving a staggering 5,96,161 challans unpaid.

He was questioned and several facts were verified and after his role was found involved in the crime, he was arrested,” said joint commissioner of police Milind Bharambe (crime).“The accused was taken to the Bandra court around 4pm for his custody remand for further investigation,” added Bharambe. The judge remanded him in police custody till January 10.Vishal Kumar’s lawyer D Prajapati said he was innocent. “My client is falsely implicated in this case,” he told reporters after the court hearing, according to news agency ANI.The Mumbai police have also detained a woman in Uttarakhand in connection with the case. Police officers, however, refused to divulge details about the woman.The Mumbai cyber police started a fresh probe into the offensive apps after registering a first information report (FIR) under sections 153A, 153 B, 295A, 354D, 509, 500 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) along with Section 67 Information Technology Act against unknown persons on Sunday.The case was based on statements of some women who complained that their photographs were among the hundreds that were uploaded by an unidentified group on an app using the online platform ‘GitHub’ for an ‘auction’ and were shared with the term, ‘Bulli deal of the day’.In 2021 too, pictures of many Muslim women and girls were uploaded on the same ‘GitHub’ platform under the name “Sulli Deals”.While the latest app came to light on January 1 after women who were targeted approached police, the previous app was floated in July last year. The Mumbai police’s Intelligent Fusion and Strategic Operations Unit (IFSO), which deals with major cybercrimes, registered the FIR in the first case in July.The police have sought information from GitHub, the platform used to make the app and Twitter, where links to the app were posted on several accounts which are now deactivated. “We are yet to get a reply from Git Hub in the first case.

04-01-2022||Mumbai||Maharashtra may see nearly 100,000 cases a day during the third wave peak||Mumbai: Maharashtra on Monday recorded 12,160 fresh Covid-19 cases taking the tally of active cases in the state to 6,712,028, even as the state health department’s internal projections — prepared based on inputs by the state Covid-19 task force and projections from the Central government to help governments ensure that preparations do not fall short — indicate that daily cases may go up to 100,000 cases at the peak of the third wave anticipated in February. In such a scenario, the tally of active cases may also go up in the peak. Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary for health said that going by projections prepared by the state health department, by the third week of January, active cases may reach up to 200,000 and breach 300,000 by the first week of February.Though Vyas said that it would be too early to say definitively that the daily caseload would reach 100,000 in the peak, as cases are rising only in some districts and not in the entire state, he said that active cases are likely to cross 200,000 by the third week and 300,000 by the first week of February.“We are likely to cross two lakh (0.2 million) active cases by the third week of this month and by the first of February the active cases are likely to cross three lakh (0.3 million) in the state. But we can’t say one lakh (0.1 million) will be reported during the peak as it is too early to predict because only Mumbai, Thane, Pune and Nagpur are showing an increase in cases but other districts are silent. It will also create unnecessary panic,” Vyas said.At present, Maharashtra has 52,422 active cases (including Monday’s figures) and going by the projections, over 100,000 active cases will be added to the tally in the next two weeks. Maharashtra was hit by the second wave in February 2021 and experienced a peak two months later. In the second wave, the highest one-day tally was 68,631 cases reported on April 18, and highest tally of active cases went up to 699,858 reported on April 22.The additional chief secretary said that around 20% of the active cases are admitted in hospitals and among them over 69% are asymptomatic. “Till yesterday of the 7,500 cases admitted in various hospitals across the state, over 69% are asymptomatic, close to 20% are on oxygen support and close to 11% are critical. We are hoping that the trend will remain the same and even if more people require hospitalization we are prepared for it,” Vyas said.The state also reported 68 cases of the Omicron variant of concern (VOC) on Monday. Of them, 40 are from Mumbai, 17 from Pune, four from Nagpur, three from Panvel, and one each from Navi Mumbai, Raigad, Satara and Kolhapur. The total number of Omicron cases recorded in the state now stand at 578. So far, 259 cases have been discharged following a negative RT-PCR test.“Omicron is much more transmissible than Delta. In eight days, it has crossed 12,000 daily cases from around 1,500 cases which shows it spread much faster than the old variants and thus by the third week, the state will have over 0.15 million active cases. By February, a peak in daily cases will start which will go up to one million cases a day,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity.He said that the projections are based on mathematical models which can succeed only if there is a rise in cases. “We cannot get the mathematical model of the entire state because of no rise in many of the districts. It can succeed only once it starts increasing,” Vyas explained.State health experts also believe that the rise in cases would be exponential as the doubling of cases is between 1.5 to three days, which means that the daily tally of 11,000 cases would go up to 22,000 within three days.Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state task force said, “My own prediction is that a peak will start in Mumbai by January 15 while for the state, it will come between January 15 and February 15. But the rate of rise would be exponential because the doubling rate is between 1.5 to three days.”Since December 27, the state has recorded a rise of 41,981 active cases, from 10,441 to the current 52,422 cases.Joshi said that the third wave will be predominantly by Omicron as it has already replaced 90% of Delta variant cases in the state, thus the number of patients who require hospitalization is very low at the moment. “The bed occupancy is very less as more than 90% beds are vacant. Hardly any Omicron infected patient needs oxygen and ventilator patients are also extremely few. Most of them who are on ventilators were infected by the Delta variant. We are hoping hospitals should not be overwhelmed by a large number of patients,” he said. Since the outbreak of Omicron variant, the state has seen a surge of cases, prompting state health officials to declare that we are likely in the midst of a third wave. The state has imposed fresh restrictions to control the situation. It has restricted the number of people who can attend weddings, social, political and religious gatherings to 50 irrespective of venue. The number of people attending funerals has been restricted to 20.State health minister Rajesh Tope on Monday said that they will have to impose a lockdown if bed occupancy reaches 40% and daily consumption of oxygen touches 700 metric tonnes.“We have determined a norm for lockdown for Maharashtra, according to which if bed occupancy reaches 40% and daily consumption of oxygen goes up to 700 MT then lockdown will be imposed,” the health minister said.At present, the bed occupancy in the state is around 20%.The total number of beds in the state is now 1,052,184, according to the state health department. Since March 2020, the number of Covid-19 hospitals have increased to 6,451 from 214 while the isolation beds have been increased to 439,733 from 11,380 beds; ICU beds now stand at 38,870 and there are 15,582 ventilator beds.The state recorded 11 deaths on Monday, taking the tally to 41,553. Over 6,514,358 people have recovered -- 1,748 on Monday -- while 69,370,095 tests have been conducted in all, including 110,477 on Monday.The state administered 721,042 doses on Monday bringing the total doses administered to 134,805,871 till date, according to data on the Co-Win portal.
04-01-2022||Pune||Civic Sanskriti: Water eco-restoration efforts||A bright blue kingfisher patiently surveyed the area from its vantage point on a tree branch. A grey or yellow wagtail caught the eye with its bobbing tail, as it walked about a stream bed in Satarnagar, in south-eastern Pune. As we watched these birds, Shramik Shevate, engineer with the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) explained about two water harvesting and restoration initiatives from pre-Covid times coming to fruition now. Dr Himanshu Kulkarni, director, Advanced Center for Water Resources Development and Management (Acwadam) and water management expert Shashank Deshpande guided the effort taken up in association with United Way, Bengaluru. Ravindra Sinha and Vaishali Patkar from Bhujal Abhiyan coordinated the initiative with the local corporator Pramod Nana Bhangire and PMC officials who facilitated implementation. Stream restoration Originating to the east of the Mohammadwadi forest area, this stream flows past the JSPM pharmacy college. As it drains almost a square kilometre of area near its origin, it soon changes from a little trickle to a 30 metres wide bed with a seasonal stream that flows during the rains. A few dug wells along the stream and an old stone weir across it show that the stream has been an asset for water management before urbanisation took hold here. The wells are functional and nearby apartments and a few remnant farms in the area draw water from them. The site is located on a natural recharge zone identified through Acwadam’s initiative on mapping Pune’s aquifers over the last five years. Over the years, and especially with building and road construction in the area, a lot of silt has been deposited in the stream bed. As part of the restoration effort currently underway, garbage, weeds like lantana and congress grass, and accumulated silt have been removed from the bed. The silt is used to stabilise the banks which will be re-vegetated. As native plants take hold even while some erosion occurs, the banks will slowly regain gentler slopes.A little walkway is planned over the existing stone weir. It will provide a view of the stream bed and dense tree canopy downstream, perhaps like what the kingfisher could see. The stream restoration effort is expected to improve rainwater recharge, storm water carriage, conserve biodiversity and provide a beautiful recreational space for the neighbourhood. Percolation pond A water percolation pond at the Dada Gujar school in Mohammadwadi has also been revived by the PMC. This pond receives water from the western side of the Mohammadwadi forest area and built-up neighbourhood. The PMC road department officials came across the pond during road construction work in the ward. The need for space for a footpath was extended into an opportunity for the revival of the percolation pond and creation of a unique public open space around it. The footpath was created on a cantilever along the bund. When the pond was de-silted, two springs were uncovered. These are now protected. A stone and sand filter has been created to receive and harvest rainwater run-off from the now built-up neighbourhood. Recharge wells will enable percolation into the deeper aquifer when the pond is full during the monsoons. Sinha says “The pond rejuvenation effort has already shown results with improved groundwater availability in the nearby areas.” Children from the neighbourhood were busy playing at the stone steps and sitting area, bringing their energy to this urban environment asset that our city surely needs more of. Both the initiatives have not been without challenges. The multiple needs of different infrastructure such as roads, stormwater drains, sewage lines, and the protection of the natural assets of streams, aquifers, recharge areas are often at cross-purposes. While a city-wide urban watershed and aquifer management plan is needed, the constant excavation, and construction activities, the increase in built-up spaces, and the provision of other services often interfere with natural environmental assets. These initiatives in Mohammadwadi show how with some careful thought and collaboration, it may be possible to synergise the different needs.

04-01-2022||Bangalore||Special measures needed to contain Covid-19 in Bengaluru: Karnataka minister||Karnataka health minister Dr K Sudhakar on Tuesday insisted upon special measures for Bengaluru amid an alarming rise in Covid-19 cases in the city. Stating that the third wave of Covid-19 has set in, Sudhakar predicted that the state capital will be an epicentre of the latest outbreak. "Taking special steps in Bengaluru has become very necessary. Bengaluru is an epicentre. It was an epicentre in the first wave and second wave. It will be the epicentre during the third wave as well," Sudhakar told reporters here. Explaining the reasons behind taking special steps for Bengaluru, he said the city has an international airport where many people arrive from abroad. Hence, we need to take special measures, the minister added. Sudhakar said the infections went up to 1.6 per cent from a mere 0.4 per cent in the state, of which 90 per cent were reported in Bengaluru. "If you look at the national figure, maximum cases are coming in the metropolitan cities. Almost 90 per cent are in those cities. Hence, we are concentrating on Bengaluru with focus on formation of micro-containment zones and screening at the airport," the minister said. To a query, the minister said the third wave of Covid-19 has begun. "What's the present scenario? Isn't it the third wave? For six months, Karnataka did not have 0.1 per cent cases. If it has gone up to 1.6 per cent on a single day, this is the beginning of the third wave," Sudhakar said. According to him, it has already started in a few states such as Telangana and Maharashtra. Vaccinating children between the age group of 15 and 18 is one of the measures taken by the government. "Yesterday, we (the government) vaccinated 4,22,252 children, though our target was 6.38 lakh. We could achieve 66 per cent on the first day. We were in the fourth place in the country in vaccinating teenagers. We want to increase more vaccinations," he said. According to him, there are 43 lakh children in the state within the age group of 15 to 18 and the state government wants to vaccinate them all in 10 to 15 days. I am confident that we will achieve it, he said. When asked about the second dose to the children, the minister said he is waiting for the Centre's guidelines. To a query on the possibility of lockdowns, Sudhakar asked reporters not to use "strong words". "Don't use strong words like lockdown. Recently, the public life is returning to normality. If we start talking of it, then it will disrupt lives," he added. Regarding the Congress' Karnataka unit's march from Mekedatu in Ramanagara district to Bengaluru on January 9 demanding the construction of a contentious balancing reservoir across Cauvery river to fulfill the drinking water needs of Bengaluru and neighbouring districts, he appealed to them to refrain from going ahead with it because the huge congregation will only lead to more infections. The state saw 1,290 cases and five deaths on Monday of which 1,041 infections and three fatalities were in Bengaluru itself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/special-measures-needed-to-contain-covid-19-in-bengaluru-karnataka-minister-101641289164295.html
04-01-2022||Chandigarh||Badal seeks package for state on eve of PM Modi’s Punjab visit||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) patriarch and former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal on Tuesday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to announce an economic, political, agricultural and territorial package for Punjab on the eve of his rally in Ferozepur. Also read: PM Narendra Modi to lay stone of PGI satellite centre at Ferozepur on Jan 5Modi will be visiting the border district of poll-bound Punjab on Wednesday to lay the foundation stones of projects worth ₹ 42,750 crore, including the Delhi-Amritsar-Katra expressway, four-laning of the Amritsar-Una highway, new rail line connecting Mukerian and Talwara towns, satellite centre of Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research at Ferozepur and medical colleges in Kapurthala and Hoshiarpur. The Prime Minister is visiting Punjab after two years. In November 2019, he had toured the state to open the Kartarpur Corridor on the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev. “A prime ministerial package will lend credence and respectability to your (Modi’s) visit. As PM, you will earn goodwill and my personal gratitude if before coming here you announce a package to meet the demands of the Punjabis,” Badal said in a press statement. He also drew the PM’s attention towards the Sikh families awaiting justice for the massacre of 1984. Modi’s rally, being held almost two months after the revocation of the farm laws, is being seen as an opportunity for the BJP to show its strength. His visit ahead of the assembly elections is crucial for the saffron party, particularly when old ally Badal’s Shiromani Akali Dal has snapped ties and the BJP has decided to contest in alliance with the Akali splinter group led by Rajya Sabha member Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa and the Punjab Lok Congress, floated by former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh after he was unceremoniously removed from the CM’s post by the Congress high command. The SAD has tied up with Mayawati’s Bahujan Samaj Party for the elections. Badal demanded an agricultural package to pull Punjab farmers out of a crisis into which they have sunk due to indebtedness. “It would be a great gesture if you announce an inquiry by a sitting judge of the Supreme Court into the conspiracy behind the series of sacrilege incidents against the Sikh faith,” Badal said. He demanded the transfer of Chandigarh and other Punjabi-speaking areas to Punjab and the resolution of the river waters issue as per the riparian principle. Drawing Modi’s attention towards the loss of lives during the farm agitation, Badal sought help for their families.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/badal-seeks-package-for-state-on-eve-of-pm-modi-s-punjab-visit-101641290375924.html

04-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi to impose weekend curfew amid spike in Covid-19 cases||NEW DELHI: A weekend curfew will be imposed in the national Capital while work from home for at least 50% of the staff of all private offices has been mandated amid a spike in Covid-19 cases, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Tuesday. The announcement came following a meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA).The DDMA has decided against sounding a red alert under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) even as Delhi breached the 5% positivity rate mark on Monday. It has allowed state-run buses and the Delhi Metro to operate with 100% seating capacity to avoid crowding at transport hubs such as bus stops and Metro stations. Standing passengers are unlikely to be allowed, transport officials said even as a detailed order was awaited.The DDMA has lieutenant governor Anil Baijal as its chairperson and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who tested positive for Covid-19 earlier on Tuesday, as the vice-chairperson. It also includes All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS, New Delhi) director Randeep Guleria and Indian Council of Medical Research chief Balram Bhargava as experts.Also Read | With 37,379 new cases, India’s Covid tally rises for 7th straight day; Omicron count nears 2,000Sisodia cited rapidly increasing Covid-19 cases in the Capital, but said the good thing with the Omicron variant of the coronavirus is that the severity of infection is fairly low compared to previous variants. “Delhi has nearly 11,000 active cases and only about 350 Covid-19 patients are in hospitals, of which 124 are on oxygen support and seven are on ventilators,” Sisodia said. “But since cases are increasing swiftly, the DDMA has decided to take certain preventive measures to contain the spread of infections in the city.”He added that only essential activities such as taking a patient to the hospital will be allowed over the weekends. “The night curfew on weekdays shall continue. In addition, all government employees have been asked to work from home or online. Private offices will have to ask at least 50% of their staff to work from home,” Sisodia said.Government departments catering to essential services such as Covid-19 management will work, as usual, a DDMA member said.Sisodia said overcrowding at bus stops and Metro stations was discussed at length at the DDMA meeting. “Since the highly mutated Omicron variant spreads much faster than the older variants, we cannot allow transport hubs to turn into super spreaders. The recent decision of the DDMA to restrict passengers in buses and the Metro to 50% of the seating capacity is leading to excessive crowding and, therefore, it is being revoked. Buses and the Delhi Metro will now be allowed to operate with full capacity.”On Monday, Delhi reported 4,099 Covid-19 cases, up from 3,194 a day earlier, a rise of 28% in 24 hours. The case positivity rate surged to 6.46% from Sunday’s 4.59%. With this, the cumulative case count of Delhi shot up to 14,58,220.On December 28, the DDMA sounded a yellow alert under GRAP leading to restrictions including night curfew between 10 pm and 5 am and shutting of educational institutions, gyms, and cinemas. Markets and malls were allowed to operate on an odd-even basis. Delhi then had a positivity rate of 0.89%.A day later, on December 29, at the last DDMA meeting, an “amber alert” was issued for testing, tracking, and treating for checking the transmission of the virus including its Omicron variant.GRAP spells out four levels of restrictions based on the positivity rate. The first level, classified as a yellow alert, is activated after the positivity rate remains above 0.5% for two consecutive days. The highest level is a red alert, which comes into play when the positivity rate breaches 5% and stays there for two consecutive days.
04-01-2022||Delhi||Parents of minor consented to Rahul Gandhi tweeting photo: Twitter to Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: Twitter has informed the Delhi high court that the parents of a minor Dalit girl, who was allegedly raped and murdered in Delhi’s cantonment area last year, had consented to their photo being shared by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on the microblogging site. The photo in question was later removed in accordance with the country’s laws.In a response to the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) on August 13 last year, Twitter had said that it received confirmation that the minor’s parents had approved the sharing of the image on the site. The social media platform also said that Gandhi had filed a formal appeal against the suspension of his Twitter handle.The NCPCR had earlier written to Twitter on August 4, asking it to take action against Gandhi for revealing the identity of the minor victim’s parents.“We are, however, in response to your legal request (NCPCR’s request), withholding the reported content in India under our assessment of the applicable local laws, which we do acknowledge disallow disclosure of such information, including the referencing of the parents of the victim, which cannot be disclosed under authorisation. Accordingly, we have withheld the reported content in India,” Twitter told the NCPCR in an email.The mail was a part of an affidavit filed on November 29 in reply to a plea by a social worker seeking action against Gandhi for posting a picture of the parents.Social activist Makarand Suresh Mhadlekar had alleged that by posting the photo of the victim’s parents, Gandhi violated the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, which prohibit the disclosure of identity of minor victims of sexual offences.On October 5, Twitter had told the court that the tweet was removed and the Congress leader’s account was operational without the objectionable post.The court had then asked Twitter to file an affidavit stating the facts after the petitioner’s counsel objected to the submissions made by Twitter’s counsel. In response, the social media platform said it restored Gandhi’s Twitter account following an appeal from him.“I state that Respondent No. 1 (Rahul Gandhi) failed to delete the tweet and filed an appeal with Twitter against the suspension of his account. However, based on the legal request issued by Respondent No. 2 (NCPCR), the answering respondent (Twitter) withheld the impugned content in India… Thereafter, Respondent No. 1’s account was restored based on the appeal filed by him in accordance with Twitter’s policy. As mentioned earlier, the reported content continues to be withheld,” the document read.Twitter has said that it had suspended Gandhi’s account on August 8 and the content in question was no longer available on the platform since then. It said that the action was taken on the basis of the potential risk of harm to the parents of the minor child over the disclosure of their identity in the content tweeted by Gandhi.The matter is expected to be heard on January 28.The Dalit girl, 9, died under suspicious circumstances on August 1 while her parents alleged that she was raped, murdered and cremated by a priest at a crematorium in southwest Delhi’s Old Nangal village.According to the contents of the FIR filed by the girl’s mother, on the evening of August 1, the child went to fetch cold water from a cooler at the crematorium. Then at around 6pm, the priest and three employees of the crematorium informed the child’s mother that her that her daughter died from electrocution.The alleged rape and murder case triggered protests in the Delhi cantonment area. Several political leaders such as Gandhi and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal visited the victim’s family and assured their support in pursuing the matter and getting justice.

The number of Covid-19 cases has seen a rapid increase in Maharashtra and its capital Mumbai is among the leading contributors in the state-wide tally.On Monday, Mumbai recorded 8,082 new Covid-19 cases, the highest daily count since April 18, 2021, and two deaths. In the last one week, the metropolis has logged a 10-fold rise in fresh cases of the viral infection.For now, the civic body has decided not to put any restrictions on suburban train travel. Suresh Kakani, Additional Municipal Commissioner at Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), said on Monday that the Maharashtra government will take a decision on the issue in consultation with the state task force on Covid-19, if needed.The BMC has issued fresh guidelines in view of the surging cases of Covid-19 in Mumbai. It has directed sealing of buildings if more than 20 per cent of the occupied number of flats has Covid-19 patients.The guidelines came into effect from Tuesday (January 4).The BMC further notified that Covid-19 patient and contacts shall strictly follow the current guidelines of home isolation and hygiene etiquettes while in home quarantine.Maharashtra’s infection tally on Monday reached 6,712,028 after 12,160 fresh cases were recorded within a span of 24 hours.Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary for health said that going by projections prepared by the state health department, by the third week of January, active cases may reach up to 200,000 and breach 300,000 by the first week of February.He, however, said that it would be too early to say definitively that the daily caseload would reach 100,000 in the peak, as cases are rising only in some districts and not in the entire state.Maharashtra was hit by the second wave in February 2021 and experienced a peak two months later. In the second wave, the highest one-day tally was 68,631 cases reported on April 18, and highest tally of active cases went up to 699,858 reported on April 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/lockdown-in-mumbai-if-mayor-issues-warning-amid-covid-19-surge-101641282880274.html

WBSEC (West Bengal State Election Commission) has issued some Covid-19 protocols. These are similar to the ones issued by the Election Commission of India (ECI) in April 2021 when assembly elections were being held in five states, including West Bengal,” said an official.The protocols prohibit roadshows, bike, and cycle rallies. During door-to-door campaigns, candidates may take four other persons and security guards along.Meetings in open spaces have been allowed with maximum participation of 500 people. Only 200 people would be allowed at meetings organised in conference halls. The campaign will end 72 hours before the polling day.Also Read | West Bengal imposes fresh Covid-19 restrictions, here’s all you need to knowIn December, the WBSEC announced the schedule for civic bodies polls including in Asansol, Bidhannagar, Siliguri, and Chandannagar on January 22.

The positivity rate was nearly 20% meaning one out of every five samples was found to be positive.In April, the Madras high court criticised the ECI when the daily count of Covid-19 cases shot up after the assembly elections in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Assam, Kerala, and Puducherry. In West Bengal, the daily count reached a peak of over 20,000 cases daily in May 2021 after the elections.Sukanta Majumdar, state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief, said they doubt how far people would come out and vote due to fear of Covid-19. “I do not know why and how the WBSEC would conduct the polls amid so many restrictions. If people do not come out to vote and the voting percentage drops, then I do not think it would be considered as a successful election.”The government on Sunday reimposed stricter restrictions till January 15 by closing schools and colleges, limiting the workforce across offices, and restricting flights from Delhi and Mumbai.State minister Sobhandeb Chatterjee said if the guidelines are followed, then there is nothing to fear. “BJP has only one thing in mind and that is criticism.

04-01-2022||Delhi||Delhiwale: The roundabout actors||They all are speaking at the same time, speaking over each other, and so uninhibitedly and loudly that you will fear their lungs might explode any moment.Actually, these six young men are reading. They are reading aloud, randomly, from whatever they happen to be holding in their hands — which is either a newspaper or a book.Four of these men are sitting in a circle on the trimmed grass, here in this landscaped roundabout in central Delhi’s Mandi House. Another man is perched some steps away, as if diligently following the pandemic-era dictum of physical distancing. And the last man in the group is standing close to the busy road - reading Bhishma Sahni’s play Haanoosh.Members of the theatre group Aarambh Rang Manch, these solemn-looking folks are among the many stage actors who descend daily to this traffic island to rehearse for their forthcoming performances or some such pursuits. Being the heart of Delhi’s theatre district, the grassy roundabout serves as a makeshift stage for professional as well as amateur actors. The prestigious National School of Drama is within eyeshot, so is the statue of playwright Pushkin.This evening, “we are exercising our diction”, says “Guruji” Lokesh Verma, the group’s senior-most member. With a booming voice full of cadence and infectious earnestness, Mr Verma is engaged with the staging of Vijay Tendulkar’s play Footpath ka Samrat. It is to be performed at Akshara Theatre as soon as pandemic-related restrictions begin to ease. The aforementioned exercise is a part of the rehearsal. There are more actors in the play, but “this is just the second day of the new year, and many are still in holiday mood”.The current cast has assembled from disparate localities in the city. Vaibhav Dobhal and Sandeep Pal came from Lakshmi Nagar, Sahil Rana from Vijay Nagar, Amit Kumar from Munirka, and “Guruji” took the metro from distant Azadpur.All these college graduates are fully aware of a theatre actor’s struggles. The ongoing pandemic has added more challenges. Speaking for all his colleagues, “Guruji” says, “Haar jayenge, yaa paar jayenge (we’ll either lose or we’ll cross over to the other side)… but we’ll not be cowed down by the hardships.”Now the entire group huddles into a large circle to restart the reading exercise. Once again, each man’s voice is splitting from, and mingling with, the voices of the others. The rehearsal will continue till 8.30pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-roundabout-actors-101641259262980.html

The court, currently on its winter break, is set to resume its full schedule today in the form of these hybrid hearings – which will constitute both virtual and physical sessions. However, the court will be putting curbs on the entry of litigants and lawyers as required, a statement said.Justice AA Sayed, a senior judge of the Bombay high court, on December 31 presided over a meeting where it was decided that not all members of the Bar will need to come to the high court. They are not supposed to send their assistants and interns physically to the court unless absolutely required.Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani and health commissioner Ramaswamy were also present at the meeting. They affirmed that both the Greater Mumbai municipal body and the state government are well-equipped to handle any potential crisis arising out of the growing number of Covid-19 cases, especially those of the new, highly transmissible Omicron variant.The standard operating procedure (SOP) issued during the meeting read, “The hearing of the matters in all courts will be through hybrid (virtual/physical) mode at the Principal Seat, Bombay High Court with effect from Tuesday, January 4, 2022, until further orders.”Moreover, it was also decided that from January 3 onwards, matters in court won't be entertained for physical mentioning unless they are of an absolutely urgent and immediate nature.For any fresh matter, the advocate or the petitioner has been asked to first file the matter with the respective department, get the stamp or lodging number, and then move the praecipe by setting out the urgency. Furthermore, any orders requiring legal documents to be circulated in the high court shall also be carried out virtually, the guidelines said.Meanwhile, Maharashtra has reported 12,160 fresh Covid-19 cases and 11 deaths in the last 24 hours, informed the state health department on Monday.

Further, of the 420 beds occupied, 66 were in use by patients suspected to have Covid-19As many as 152 samples out of 187 sent for genome sequencing were found to be infected with the Omicron variant. “There are adequate number of hospital beds available in Delhi and there is no need to panic,” Jain said.The health minister accused the central government of not acting swiftly to stop the impending wave. “The spread would have stopped if the central government had stopped the flights coming from abroad on time,” he said. “Even after repeated requests made by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, no appropriate action was taken.”Delhi’s health infrastructure is prepared for any eventuality as almost 96% of the Covid beds in the capital are ready for service. “Furthermore, we are preparing more than 37,000 beds additionally in Delhi,” Jain said.The best way to stop Covid-19 is to wear a mask and follow Covid protocols at all times, the minister said. “People arriving at Delhi airport from abroad are being tested, and are being sent to isolation facilities if tested positive, and are being treated accordingly,” he said.Delhi reported 4,099 new Covid cases on Monday, Jain said. The positivity rate has breached 6%, indicating rapid spread.The Delhi government has failed to contain crowds in markets and public places, leader of the opposition Ramvir Singh Bidhuri alleged in the assembly that began a two-day session on Monday.“Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said that the Omicron variant causes very mild symptoms. Is such type of attitude of the government not inspiring negligence among the public?” Bidhuri asked.Also Read| Omicron: Delhi sees 28% spike in new Covid cases, DDMA to meet on TuesdayHe also said there was a shortage of mass transit, making commutes difficult. Buses and the Metro are allowed to operate only at 50% capacity to prevent overcrowding.“The public transport infrastructure has completely collapsed because the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government did not buy even a single bus, while it had promised to purchase 11,000 buses,” Bidhuri said. The government has failed to contain crowds outside liquor stores, he added.It is not a bad thing that the majority of cases are from the Omicron variant, which is milder than other variants, according to Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital.“People who escaped the previous two waves will definitely get this highly transmissible variant, which will act like a vaccine,” Dr Kishore said.“If there is no panic in the population, there would be less (hospital) admissions and lesser need of oxygen because they can recover at home. Some with comorbidities may still need to be admitted,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/omicron-delhi-s-dominant-variant-detected-in-81-samples-health-minister-jain-101641256132221.html

04-01-2022||Chandigarh||In December, Jammu and Kashmir saw lesser Covid cases than November||Amid the looming threat of new variants, government data revealed that the monthly coronavirus cases and the test positivity rate (TPR) in Jammu and Kashmir decreased in the month of December as compared to November. The data shows that the pandemic so far is under control in the union territory despite a huge influx of tourists and visitors. A compilation and analysis of the government’s daily Covid figures brought to the fore that the UT recorded 4,438 infections in December against 4,603 in November – a decrease of 3.5%. From 153 average daily infections in November, it reduced to 143 average daily cases in December.TPR – the percentage of tests turning positive out of the total conducted – in December also decreased to 0.26% from 0.32% in November. The TPR was 0.20% in October, 0.27% in September, and 0.23% in August. If TPR is below 5%, it indicates that the infection is under control in the community. The lower TPR in December can be attributed to highest number of tests conducted in the past five months. The authorities had conducted 16.87 lakh tests in December, 14.34 lakh in November, 13.47 lakh in October, 14.81 lakh in September and 16.54 in August. The data revealed that on an average, 54,443 tests were conducted daily in December against 47,817 tests in November, and 43,482 in October. About 49,374 average daily tests were done in September, 53,359 in August and 56,719 in July.Prof Dr Mohammad Salim Khan, head of the department of community medicine at Government Medical College, Srinagar, and nodal officer for Covid, said, “The situation is fine as of now. But if the Omicron variant spreads in India, the cases will rise in J&K as well. However the severity, morbidity, hospitalisation and mortality of the variant are very less. Even if there are more hospitalisations, our health institutions are very well equipped. We won’t be facing an overwhelming situation,” he said. 18% spike in deaths in December: DataCovid, however, took more lives in December in the past five months. As many as 52 people died in December while the number was 44 in November, marking an increase of 18%. In May 2021, when the second wave peaked, J&K had seen 1.14 lakh Covid cases and 1,625 deaths. There was, meanwhile, a slight decrease in vaccination rate in December. As many as 19.41 lakh vaccine doses were administered in December as compared to 19.85 lakh in November. Since September, the vaccination drive had been quite rigorous in the UT. Over one crore doses – first or second – have been administered collectively in September, October, November and December. Khan said in the second wave, most of the people became immunised naturally owing to the infection. “In Kashmir as well, our sero survey showed 90% of people with antibodies against Covid. That was in July. Now, almost all must be having antibodies,” he added. Kashmir contributed a substantial number of Covid cases and deaths than the Jammu division in December. However, in comparison to November, Kashmir’s Covid cases registered a decline and Jammu’s numbers increased in December.Kashmir saw 3,246 cases in December, logging a drop of 16% than November when the Valley had recorded 3,884 cases.The Jammu division witnessed 1,192 infections in December, clocking an increase of 65% than November, when the cases were 719. Of the 52 deaths in the union territory, the Valley saw 38 fatalities due to the virus while Jammu witnessed 14 deaths. On surge in cases in Jammu, Khan said there was nothing to worry as the increase was owing to tourists testing positive. “There were some 100 cases or more of outsiders testing positive for Covid there,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/in-december-jammu-and-kashmir-saw-lesser-covid-cases-than-november-101641251793588.html

04-01-2022||Chandigarh||Himachal: Over 90,000 teens get jabbed on Day 1 of vaccination drive||Himachal chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Monday launched the statewide Covid-19 vaccination campaign for the age group of 15-18 years from Government Vijay Senior Secondary School in Mandi. A Class-12 student , Ravi Kumar, became the first recipient of the first dose of Covaxin in the state in this category. As many as 90,531 teenagers were vaccinated on Monday. Kangra, the biggest district in HP, led the way in vaccination by inoculating 20,895 youngsters, said health secretary Amitabh Awasthi. He added that while 14,429 were administered the first dose in Mandi district, 7,196 persons were vaccinated in Shimla.While interacting with the media at Mandi, the chief minister appealed the people to come forward to get their dose of vaccine against Covid-19, which he said was the only means of protection from this virus. He said that in Himachal Pradesh, about 3.57 lakh youngsters in the age group of 15-18 years would be administered the vaccine. Jai Ram said as many as 4,259 educational institutions would be covered under this campaign, which include 2,801 government, 1,402 private and 56 other educational facilities. He said that the state Government was keeping an eye on the new variants and all preventative measures would be taken to check spread of this virus. Enthusiasm was seen among the youngsters to get vaccinated as they waited in queues outside the centres. “It’s a good decision to vaccinate the younger generation. Today, I am feeling good. Vaccination will give me protection against Covid-19. We will be able to attend school in days to come without much fear,” said Priya, a student of government senior secondary school in Khalini. “We all need to motivate the students and youngsters. They should not have any fear or misconception regarding the vaccination,” said Tenzin Palmo. Health minister Rajiv Sezal said the government was vigilant on the quickly spreading Omicron variant of Covid-19. “We are spreading awareness and asking people to take due precautions,” he said, while admitting that there was a delay in the genome sequencing test of the patients suspected to be infected with the Omicron variant. “There is a rush for the genome sequencing in the laboratories. I am hopeful that situation will change in the days to come,” he added.  On Monday, the vaccination drive was slow in the tribal Lahual Spiti and Kinnaur districts. In Kinnaur, only 423 teenagers were vaccinated and the number was 283 in Lahual and Spiti. In Chamba district, 5,255 children were jabbed, and in Bilaspur, 3,915 were vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-over-90-000-teens-get-jabbed-on-day-1-of-vaccination-drive-101641251193188.html
04-01-2022||Chandigarh||Himachal cabinet to deliberate on legalising hemp cultivation||Himachal Pradesh cabinet is likely to discuss and approve the government’s proposal to allow controlled cultivation of hemp to mobilise resources and jobs in the hill state. The move to legalise hemp has also come in the wake of growing unemployment and limited resources of income in the state. Covid had overarching effects in almost all the sectors of the economy. The state government aims to raise its finances from legalising cannabis cultivation as its debt burden has increased to ₹64,000 crore. The state government met its financial requirement in the first week of December and raised a loan of ₹2,000 crore. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur had been blaming the previous Congress regime for the poor fiscal of the state. Jai Ram Thakur, during his last budget, had announced to legalise hemp cultivation on the lines of neighbouring Uttarakhand. “The proposal will be placed before the cabinet for its consideration,” said a government official. Under the NDPS Act, 1985, there are provisions for the cultivation, production, maintenance and transportation of cannabis. The controlled cultivation of cannabis will boost the economy as the government aims to earn ₹18,000 crore and provide employment to nearly 50,000 youngsters while directly benefiting 2.8 lakh families in the lower-income group. Growing unemployment has been worrying successive governments, but they did little to generate more avenues to employ youth. The number of unemployed youths registered with the employment exchanges in the state was staggering 8,63,717 (figures as of October 31, 2019). This is more than 13% of the total population of the state. Of the total number of registered jobless persons, about 43% are women. About 75,000 of them are postgraduate; 1.35 lakh graduates; 6.15 lakh matriculates to undergraduate; 40,000 under matric and 500 illiterate. As per estimates, more than 60,000 young men and women come into the job-seeking market every year after finishing their studies. Hemp grows in the wild, almost in all the districts across the state, barring Lahaul and Spiti. In the remote regions of Kullu district, hybrid hemp is sowed clandestinely to extract high-quality charas, which is sold at exorbitant prices in foreign countries as well as the key destinations in India. Traditionally, hemp was cultivated in the parts of old Himachal comprising Shimla, Mandi, Kullu, Chamba, Sirmaur and inhabitants of this land-locked village used to make baskets, ropes and slippers from hemp. Hemp seeds were used in traditional cooking. In the 80s, foreign visitors taught villagers in the Kullu district to extract the intoxicant resin or charas from the hemp plant. Foreign drug mafia operated behind them and soon, scores of villages in Kullu started making a livelihood from charas extracted from the hemp or cannabis sativa plant.

Now he is resorting to false propaganda to tarnish my image. But the people of Mohali constituency are my own family and are aware of the conspiracy behind this game,” he added.Mohali mayor Amarjit Singh Sidhu, senior deputy mayor Amrik Singh Somal, deputy mayor Kuljit Singh Bedi, District Mohali Congress Committee president Rishav Jain and Kharar Market Committee chairman Harkesh Chand Sharma were also present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/always-been-a-staunch-congressman-not-joining-bjp-or-capt-says-balbir-sidhu-101641249879692.html
04-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh tricity’s Covid cases shot up 274% in week gone by||With a whopping 547 cases in the week ending on January 2, the Chandigarh tricity area recorded a 274% spike in cases from last week.Besides, a virus-related fatality was also reported in Mohali. As the weekly tally is highest since the second wave started ebbing away in the area in June, medical experts believe that the ongoing upward trend of weekly infections can be regarded as the onset of the third wave.In the previous week, ending on December 26, the tricity had reported 146 cases and two fatalities owing to the virus, making it the third consecutive week when the Covid-19 infections were above 100.With the municipal corporation (MC) election rallies in Chandigarh and wedding season across the tricity, the sudden surge in cases was seen in all areas. Chandigarh reported 287 cases this week, against 71 cases last week, while the figure rose from 34 to 144 in Mohali and from 41 to 116 in Panchkula in the same period.As the tricity rang in the New Year, it logged 125 cases on January 1, the highest single-day tally in six months. A day later, 181 people tested positive, a jump of 38%. Dr GD Puri, dean, academics, and head of the Covid management panel, PGIMER, said, “The number of daily Covid cases is doubling every day, indicating arrival of third wave of the pandemic. Comorbid people are vulnerable to severe infection, even if fully vaccinated. People must exercise caution to prevent the situation from worsening.”At the peak of the second wave, the tricity had recorded 46,245 cases and 790 deaths in just one month. With curbs on public movement in place across the tricity, the curve had started flattening thereon. The weekly tally had never crossed the 100 mark until the week ending on November 29, which saw 109 infections, and the weekly tally has continued to multiply gradually ever since.‘Infection spread restricted to close contacts’Dr Suman Singh, director, health services, Chandigarh, said, “Currently in Chandigarh, there is no cluster or hotspot, as the infection is being spread only within close contacts. As around 90% of the adults in Chandigarh are fully vaccinated, hospitalisation and severity among infected people is very less.”Yet, she cautioned the sharp increase in cases should not be taken lightly: “The cases have increased due to crowded gatherings in election rallies, marriage events and festivities, where people did not bother to follow safety protocols. People must get vaccinated at the earliest and follow guidelines to avert further surge.” Mohali civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur blamed public’s callousness for the spike in infections. “People have completely forgotten precautions. In public places, most people are out and about without masks and don’t maintain social distance,” she said.Panchkula chief medical officer Dr Mukta Kumar said the current trend indicated that the cases were going to increase further. Therefore, they had made adequate arrangements at the government health facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-tricity-s-covid-cases-shot-up-274-in-week-gone-by-101641249878230.html
04-01-2022||Chandigarh||India tapping space sector’s potential: Rajnath Singh||The Indian government understands the potential of space sector, Union defence minister Rajnath Singh said here on Monday, while appreciating the crucial role played by the sector during the Covid-19 pandemic in keeping the world connected from testing to data-transfer and analysis. Speaking after inaugurating the Kalpana Chawla Centre for Space Science and Technology (KCCRSST) at Chandigarh University, Gharuan, Singh recalled the four major pillars of reforms in the space sector envisioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “These pillars are: freedom of innovation to the private sector, role of the government as an enabler, preparing the youth for the future and viewing the space sector as a resource for progress,” he said, adding that the actions identified in the pillars will take the space sector to newer heights and give new direction to the country’s progress. He also launched a scholarship scheme worth ₹10 crore for the wards of defence personnel of the three services.The minister likened the KCCRSST with “pride of India” Kalpana Chawla, hoping that this research facility will touch new heights of success, similar to the remarkable achievements of the late India-born astronaut who brought universal recognition to her country of origin. Remembering Chawla, Singh described her as a symbol of women empowerment, who took a flight beyond imagination. He urged people to motivate their daughters to touch unimaginable heights, echoing the government’s vision of increased participation of women in all sectors. Quoting India’s first Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru, Singh said, “When I want to know the future of India, I do not look at stars and planets, but into the eyes of little children. If their eyes are bright and full of hope, the future of India is safe, Nehru had once said.”The minister also called for an active and long-term public-private partnership to take the education and science sectors to a global level and make India a knowledge economy.“Today, the private sector is exposed to a large number of opportunities in the space sector. Whether it is defence or space, we are fully welcoming the private sector,” he said, reiterating the government’s commitment to strengthening the private sector for the holistic development of the nation. Speaking on the occasion, Chandigarh University chancellor Satnam Singh Sandhu said since its inception, the university had been striving to provide quality, innovative and experiential learning to its students, and establishment of this centre was one of the steps in this direction. “We will soon be announcing short-term courses for satellite design and development,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/india-tapping-space-sector-s-potential-rajnath-singh-101641249875926.html
04-01-2022||Chandigarh||Now, Chandigarh shuts down Rock Garden, Bird Park||A day after putting restrictions on entry to Sukhna Lake, the UT administration on Monday decided to shut down the Rock Garden and the Bird Park at Nagar Van, city’s two major tourist attractions.The decision was taken at the Covid review meeting chaired by UT administrator Banwari Lal Purohit.According to the order issued by UT adviser Dharam Pal, Rock Garden and Bird Park will remained closed from January 4 until further orders.The administration’s decision comes in the wake of the sharp increase in the Covid cases in the city in the past one week. According to health experts, the sharp rise in cases is the result of large public gatherings and apathy towards Covid-appropriate behaviour during the MC elections’ campaigning, marriage events and festivities.The administration on Sunday had ordered the closure of Sukhna Lake on Sundays. On other days, it will be accessible only from 5am to 9am and 6pm to 8pm. Also, all banquet halls, hotels, restaurants, cafes, coffee shops and eating places were ordered to function at only 50% capacity. Besides, they have to ensure that only fully vaccinated people enter their premises.Facilities being beefed upDuring the meeting, the administrator asked officials to ensure availability of adequate oxygen and beds in hospitals, intensify testing and enhance vaccination to combat the situation.Dr GD Puri from PGIMER shared that the institute had 250 Covid beds and 48 of these had been activated. Dr Suman Singh, director, health, UT, shared that 606 isolation beds for asymptomatic and mild cases were available at GMSH-16 and 50 had been made functional. Another 250 oxygen beds and 80 ventilator beds were available at GMCH-32, shared its director-principal, Dr Jasbinder Kaur. All institutions have adequate oxygen supply for Covid patients.Health secretary Yashpal Garg shared they had already procured the buffer stock for essential Covid medicines. Chandigarh has 53.8 metric tonnes of oxygen available at its health institutes, against the requirement of 49.5 metric tonnes. Besides, there is sufficient vaccine stock for both adults and children, he added.Directing officials to ensure strict enforcement of Covid protocols in the city, the administrator also asked the neighbouring districts to support each other in controlling the Covid situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/now-chandigarh-shuts-down-rock-garden-bird-park-101641249874469.html
04-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh mayoral elections: AAP offers Congress to share chair alternately||Even as both the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Congress have moved their councillors out of Chandigarh, fearing poaching ahead of the mayoral polls on January 8, the proposal for sharing the mayor’s chair alternately between the two parties is on the table, it is learnt. As per the proposal, the AAP will have its mayor in the first year of the new Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) House with Congress support, while the Congress will get the post in the next year.In the House of 36, the AAP and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are running neck to neck with 14 votes each. The Congress with seven and the SAD with one vote are in the position to tilt the balance in favour of any of the two leading parties. Chandigarh Congress president Subhash Chawla, said, “The AAP approached us with the offer that they will support our candidate in the second and third years if we support their mayoral candidate in the first year of the new House.” Acknowledging the offer, AAP city chief Prem Garg said, “We proposed that the Congress should support the AAP mayoral candidate in the first year. They are senior to us. Woh humein ek saal guide karein aur saath chalein (They should guide us and walk with us for a year). They can review our performance after one year. If they are not happy with it, we can do as they say.” Though Chawla ruled out voting for any other party, he said the rival parties’ choice of candidates will be crucial for Congress’ decision: “We are waiting for the candidates that the AAP and the BJP put up for the mayor’s post.” Chawla also denied speculations that the party councillors will abstain from voting. The BJP has already declared that it will contest all three posts. Meanwhile, SAD’s lone councillor, Hardeep Singh, said the party will take a call on which candidate to support after his meeting with party chief Sukhbir Singh Badal within a couple of days. AAP, Congress trying to keep flock togetherOn Monday, the AAP took its 14 councillors, their families and some senior party officials to Delhi. Similarly, the seven Congress councillors, accompanied by their families, moved to a resort near Jaipur, Rajasthan. The development came a day after former Congress vice-president Devinder Singh Babla and his wife, councillor Harpreet Kaur, joined the BJP. While conceding that the councillors had been moved to Delhi as they were being approached by rival parties to vote for them during the mayoral elections, Garg said, “We also wanted our councillors to experience how an elected House works. There is a session of the Delhi legislative assembly and the councillors will be taken there.” Chawla said, “Both the AAP and the BJP are approaching our councillors. But we decided to move out of the city only to quell rumours and misunderstanding between our councillors. Attempts to mislead them were being made by rival parties. Last night, even though we were all together for a dinner, some councillors were getting calls that one of them was at a rival party’s office.” On their councillors’ return to the city, AAP’s Garg said it was not decided, though the group was likely to be back after attending the proceedings of the Delhi legislative assembly. The Congress councillors will return to Chandigarh only a day before the mayor elections on January 8. Taking a dig at the Congress and the AAP, BJP’s city chief Arun Sood said, “BJP councillors are in the city. They are neither under surveillance nor have their phones been switched off. The parties which fear their councillors are saleable are adopting such tactics.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mayoral-elections-aap-offers-congress-to-share-chair-alternately-101641249873204.html

04-01-2022||Noida||Residents meet Noida authority officials to discuss all ‘pending developments’||Representatives of apartment owners’ association (AOA) in Noida sectors 76 and 77 met officials of the Nodia authority on Monday to press for their demands regarding long-pending developments in the sectors.Noida sectors 76 and 77 are home to 20 high-rise housing complexes, which have approximately 700-2,000 flats each. “Development of one park in Sector 76 and two parks in Sector 77 has been pending for a few years. We have repeatedly submitted applications, and requested the officials to develop these parks so that children could play there. There are no such facilities in the residential pockets at present,” said Amit Gupta, a representative from Prateek Wisteria AOA in Sector 77. According to the Noida authority’s ‘Master Plan’, two parks were planned to be developed in Sector 76, and three parks and two green belts in Sector 77. However, not even a single park has been developed in Sector 76, and two parks and one green belt have been developed in Sector 77 so far. Sandeep Jindal, Skytech Matrott AOA of Noida Sector 76, said, “There is a dire need for a playground for the children in sectors 76 and 77 as there is no such place in the locality as of now. We discussed a possible development of a football or cricket ground in these parks, considering the need for the children and the youth, with the officials on Monday.”The authority officials have promised the residents to resolve the issues at the earliest. “The parks here have not been developed because of land issues. The land has been encroached at some places, and at other places, the authority could not completely acquire the land from the original owners as they are not accepting the compensation... After today’s discussion, the Noida authority CEO has ordered to resolve these issues at the earliest and develop parks for the children in sectors 76 and 77 with the land available with us in the next 15 days,” said Prasun Dwivedi, Noida authority’s officer on special duty (land).The authority officials were in Noida Sector 77 on Monday to inaugurate a “pink vending zone” there, out of the total nine zones opened across the city the same day. According to a statement by the Noida authority, “Pink vending zones have been especially created for female traders and sellers in the city, who can set up their shops at these zones. The nine vending zones in Noida sectors 2, 37, 44, 57, 62, 76-77, 88, 93A and 125 -- have a capacity of accommodating 55 vendors.”

The whole administration is with the DEO and thus he should not be afraid of any such bad elements,” said DC. Bhullar said, “The accused has gone in disguise with his family. Special teams have been deputed to arrest the accused. I appeal to people to not take law in their hands or else they will be in trouble.”Farmers join protestMeanwhile, the farmers extended full support to the DEO and joined the ongoing protest by the local government teachers and principals outside the DC office seeking immediate arrest of Rajinder Kumar Ghai, who was booked on January 1 after garlanding the DEO with slippers.Teacher unions declared to observe protests for two hours in schools on January 5 to press for the arrest of the culprits.Principal Davinder Singh Chhina appreciated the goodwill gesture by district authorities for their visit to DEO Samra. Chhina said, “All the teachers and school heads need to be united in future to isolate unscrupulous elements who are bent upon tarnishing the image of the government school system that had shown resurgence in recent years. Police should immediately arrest the accused and set an example for bad elements.”Security lapseHowever, farmers also raised questions on the security deputed at the entry of the Mini Secretariat. “Ludhiana police learnt nothing from the court complex blast. Despite security being deputed at the entry points, how did Ghai carry the slipper garland inside the building? Action should be taken against the policemen there,” said Malkit Singh, a farmer leader.The entry points leading to the DC office were barricaded and blocked for public visit by the police in wake of the ongoing protest of farmers.The caseA probe was launched against the PT teacher by deputy DEO, secondary, Charanjit Singh, on December 22, after Rajinder Ghai filed a complaint with the chief minister’s office.Ghai had claimed that since DEO did not take any action though 10 days had elapsed, and was trying to save the teacher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-deputy-commissioner-police-commissioner-visit-deo-to-express-solidarity-after-slipper-garlanding-incident-101641242135778.html
04-01-2022||Chandigarh||Navjot Sidhu promises ₹2,000 for women homemakers, 8 LPG cylinders||After taking digs at his own party’s government and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for offering “lollipops” ahead of polls, Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu on Monday jumped into the race to lure voters with freebies by promising to give ₹2,000 per month and eight free cylinders to every homemaker woman and incentives for school and college going girls if the party retains power in the state.Sidhu announced the populist promises at a rally in Shaina village which comes under the Bhadaur constituency of the district. “We want to give full rights to half the population in the state. The Congress has made a big road map for 1.18 crore women and girls. As per the category of self-reliance, we will start from homemakers and give ₹2,000 per month and eight free cylinders in a year to each woman,” repeated Sidhu, while addressing the media at the residence of former Barnala MLA Kewal Singh Dhillon in the town.With these promises, Sidhu has upped the game on competitive populism by trying to outdo the Opposition AAP and SAD. The AAP was the first to promise ₹1,000 per month to each woman in the state if voted to power, then SAD promised to double it, and Sidhu has gone a few steps further in one go. The PPCC chief’s promises have come even before the Congress manifesto committee, which is headed by Rajya Sabha member Partap Singh Bajwa, has drafted its poll manifesto.At the rally, Sidhu claimed that the school dropout number of girls is one-and-a-half per cent more as compared to boys but the Congress government will incentivise girl child with various schemes. “We will incentivise girl education and give ₹5,000 to a girl after she passes Class 5; ₹10,000 after Class 8 and ₹15,000 plus a tablet (computer) after Class 10. Besides, when she enrols in 10+2, the government will give ₹20,000. If she wants to get higher education in a college, we will provide an environment-friendly scooty. The Punjab model will also give ₹2 lakh loan without interest for PhD and other higher courses,” he added.He said the money will be arranged for such schemes by closing the business of various mafias. They will collect around ₹30,000 to ₹40,000 crore and use it with Central schemes. “Punjab will be made a welfare state, not the welfare of only 100 families,” he added.Sidhu said despite the fact women have equal rights but the registration of the property is 1.8 per cent in the state. “The Punjab model declares that all property registrations will be free for women. We will also open skill development centres in 23 districts for women. A special women commando battalion will be formed in villages and towns,” he added.The Congress leader also announced that farmers having below 5 acres of land or farm labourers, including women, will be given ₹300 per day through MGNREGA.Reverting on whether these promises will be a part of Congress election manifesto, Sidhu said, “There will be some reasons if I am holding a press conference. This is the Congress if its chief is speaking.”When asked that deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa said he would put the ministry at Sidhu’s feet within a minute if he wants the same as Sidhu is unhappy, the Congress chief said, “He is my elder brother and he can say whatever.”However, National Health Mission (NHM) employees opposed Sidhu’s visit seeking regularisation.
04-01-2022||Chandigarh||Shiv Sena leader Amit Arora claims his security trimmed day after he got threat calls||A day after claiming to have received threat calls from Pakistani numbers, Shiv Sena leader Amit Arora alleged that the Punjab government has trimmed his security by half, instead of beefing it up. Arora, who is the vice-president of Shiv Sena’s Punjab unit, said he had four security personnel in his detail, but now, he is left with just two. Stating that the Punjab government is not serious about the security of Hindu leaders, he said he had filed a complaint at the Division Number 7 police station, but no FIR has been registered so far. Past attacks on AroraArora had survived a terrorist attack in 2016. On February 3, 2016, when he had stopped near a roadside stall, some assailants had opened fire at him. A bullet had brushed past his neck, leaving him injured. Four months later, police had arrested him, along with his gunman, on charges of “faking the attack” to increase his security. Later in 2018, police busted a terror module, wherein one of the accused confessed to involvement in the attack on Arora. In February 2020, unidentified assailants had opened fire at the Shiv Sena leader’s SUV parked outside the office of one of his friends in Sector 39, Chandigarh road. At the time of the incident, he was sitting in the office with other leaders of the party.‘Threatened against recording statement with NIA’Speaking about the latest calls, which he claims had come from Pakistani numbers, Arora said the callers threatened him against recording his statement with the National Investigation Agency (NIA), in the case pertaining to targeted killings. The Shiv Sena leader further said, the callers told him that they would shoot him dead if he dared to record his statements. “I have sent my complaint to Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and director general of police Siddharth Chattopathay,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/shiv-sena-leader-amit-arora-claims-his-security-trimmed-day-after-he-got-threat-calls-101641242012621.html
04-01-2022||Noida||Yeida extends OTS scheme deadline as many plot allottees yet to claim benefits||The Yamuna Expressway industrial development authority (Yeida) during its 72nd board meeting on Monday decided to extend its one-time settlement scheme benefits till March 31, 2022, as many property allottees are yet to claim the benefits, said officials. The deadline to settle the financial dues was set on December 31, 2021.Yeida decided to extend the deadline as the response of the scheme is good, and many alottees are yet to claim the benefits, said the officials.Under the OTS scheme, Yeida agreed to waive off the compounded amount and only levy simple interest on property dues of the individual property owners. The authority had floated the scheme from October 1, 2021, and concluded it on December 31.Sharing the final outcome of the scheme, Yeida chief executive officer (CEO) Arun Vir Singh said, “The scheme was meant for all the allottees, except those in the group housing plot category, owned by the developers. It was also meant for industrial, institutional, commercial, built-up houses, mixed-use, and abadi plot owners.”Yeida said it received 2,593 applications during the scheme period, and it will bring in revenues of ₹416 crore. And by offering rebate over the compounded amount, the authority will pass on benefits amounting to ₹350 crore to the plot owners.While allotting a plot, YEIDA commanded interest of 8.5% over the land premium from the owners. In case of default the authority calculated the land premium by levying compound interest. While the first default attracted compound interest at the interest rate of 11.5%, the second one was calculated at 14.5%. The outstanding amount was compounded every six months.Out of the 38,000 allottees who had taken units along the Yamuna Expressway, the scheme was introduced to cater to 32,000 allottees. Officials said that several industrial allottees and residential allottees, who could not be offered land due to legal issues, have been offered zero period benefits in the past, and did not avail the OTS scheme.Rishabh Nigam, president of Yamuna Expressway Entrepreneurs Association (YEEA), said, “The OTS scheme is useful for those who are yet to clear their financial dues against their respective plots, because it waives off the compound amount, and only the simple interest charge remains.”Medical device park project approved, plot scheme to be launched soonOther major decisions taken during the board meeting on Monday were: extending deadline for executing lease deed for all allottees (except group housing) till March 31; people who have received notice to execute lease deed immediately through checklist issued by the authority will also be given an additional time; purchasing six four-wheelers and handing those over to the police department for increased patrolling along the Yamuna Expressway; allowing execution of lease deed and registration through the power of attorney for blood and close relatives; and standardising payment to contractors for various civil works according to the rates prescribed by the public works department of Uttar Pradesh among others.Yeida also said that medical device manufacturing units will soon be set up in Sector 28, along the expressway as the central government has approved the detailed project report of the mega project spread over 350 acres of land. During the board meeting on Monday, Yeida also approved the proposal to sell plots in the project, allowing industrialists to set up businesses along the Yamuna Expressway after getting a nod from both the Uttar Pradesh government and the Centre, said the officials.“The central government approved the medical device park project on December 31, 2021, and the state government has also given a green signal to it. The Centre has allowed us to promote the scheme, asking manufacturers to come here, invest, and start making medical devices,” said the Yeida CEO.Now, Yeida will take out road shows across cities to promote the scheme, in a bid to bring investors into the region.“We will interact with interested investors and ask them to invest and start businesses here. We will also seek their suggestions to make tailor-made plot schemes,” Singh added. In phase I, Yeida will carve out plots on 200 acres of land and 150 acres in phase II, said the officials.The central government asked Yeida on September 24, 2021, to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) and submit the same by December 23, 2021. Subsequently, Yeida submitted the DPR and the Centre approved the same last December. The central government has conveyed in-principle approval to the setting up of the medical device park on 350 acres along the Yamuna Expressway, according to the scheme guidelines of ‘Promotion of Medical Device Park’. It will be the first medical device park in India, to be developed in Sector 28, near the Noida airport site in Jewar.For the first time, Yeida will also build a shed to allot for setting up industrial units at this park, which is likely to emerge as a hub of manufacturing units of medical devices such as ventilators, PPE kits, and X-ray machines among other such products.A Government of India (GOI) approval means that the Yeida is likely to get over ₹1,000 crore fund and other benefits from the central government, said the Yeida officials.In November 2020, Yeida earmarked the 350 acres for the medical device park, and also sent a proposal to the Uttar Pradesh government for the same. The authority is expecting a ₹5,250 crore investment in the project, if it is executed, they added.Under the scheme ‘Promotion of Medical Device Park’ in follow-up to the July 27, 2021, order of the ministry of chemical, fertiliser and pharmaceuticals’ , the Uttar Pradesh government appointed Yeida as the state implementing agency on August 4, 2021, to execute this project. Subsequently, Yeida roped in Kalam Institute of Health Technology (KIHT), Visakhapatnam, to prepare the DPR for the same, according to the officials.

Addressing a press conference at the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), PFUCTO president HS Kingra said they have been repeatedly trying to convince the government that it was under constitutional obligation to comply with central legislation, as higher education is a subject on the concurrent list of the Constitution of India and the acts/rules/regulations/statutes of the UGC had to be followed, adding that the government has not to paid any attention to their issues.PFUCTO general secretary Dr Jagwant Singh, meanwhile, said they had written to the vice chancellors of all universities, requesting them to not violate their own statutes and UGC regulations by affiliating substandard government colleges, as they will not qualify under section 2 (f) of the UGC Act. He added that students admitted to these colleges will not be eligible to appear in university exams, further cautioning them to ensure that innocent students do not fall prey to such schemes.PFUCTO members said they have also written to CM Channi to ensure that no public money is spent on these colleges as these will not be recognised by the UGC unless the state government takes appropriate action on the UGC Regulation dated July 18, 2018 and February 20, 2010. Association members added that their agitation had more to do with compliance of UGC regulations than for the pay scales as they are unwilling to accept delinking from UGC.‘Pay scales not being revised due to internal tussle in Congress’PFUCTO members also alleged that the issue of pay scales was suffering because of internal conflicts within the Indian National Congress. They said that the former CM Captain Amarinder Singh did not implement the UGC scales because of alleged differences with the then higher-education minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, adding that CM Channi is doing the same as the present minister Pargat Singh is also considered close to Navjot Singh Sidhu, with whom he is presumed to be locked in a battle for supremacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ugc-pay-scales-teachers-to-protest-outside-punjab-chief-minister-charanjit-channi-s-house-on-jan-6-101641241352941.html

Slamming the civic body for not following up on the cases, the protesting NGO members submitted a complaint with the police at Kochar market police post.The members said it has been learned that decades-old trees were chopped by a few building owners, who reasoned that the trees were blocking the views from their buildings before alleging that the civic body has turned a blind eye to the violation even when one of the trees is just outside the MC sub zone office.Speaking on the issue, Council of Engineers president Kapil Arora said, “It is a heinous crime to damage the environment, punishable under the Environment Protection Act, 1986, but the MC is turning a blind eye towards the issue. FIRs are simply recommended against the unidentified accused and that too only for theft of trees/wood. One FIR was also recommended against an unidentified person for damaging trees in BRS Nagar recently, but no action has been taken.”“The MC has failed to practice what it preaches. These trees have been axed in the last few days, but MC claims that it came to know about the same on Sunday only,” he added.Naroa Punjab Manch member Jaskirat Singh and Sambhav foundation member Rahul Verma, meanwhile, also highlighted the need to protect the environment, especially given the rising pollution levels.“Every time residents submit a complaint, only a recommendation is made to lodge an FIR but it is never lodged, which encourages the culprits. The MC should set an example and those people behind these crimes should be punished. We have been demanding that political parties include a ‘green manifesto’ in their election campaigns, but it is a sad state of affairs at ground level,” Singh said.Responding to questions, MC junior engineer (horticulture wing) Kirpal Singh said an FIR was recommended against the unidentified culprits soon after the department received a complaint on Sunday. “It is not clear who axed the trees and mostly these people cut the trees during night hours or on a public holiday to avoid action. We also tried to look into the CCTV footage of private cameras installed in the area to no avail. The police will now lodge an FIR under the respective section of the Indian Penal Code,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ngos-stage-protest-against-ludhiana-municipal-corporation-s-inaction-over-illegal-cutting-of-trees-101641240694383.html

It took over an hour to decongest the stretch,” he said.Tomar said they had no prior information regarding the protest, or they would have planned diversions towards Delhi from Iffco Chowk. “Initially, we thought a vehicle had broken down but when we coordinated with the Delhi Police, we came to know that BJP workers were protesting and were not allowing vehicles to cross the stretch,” he said.Jyoti D Singh, a resident of Sector 65 and a daily commuter to Delhi, said that it took her 90 minutes to cross the stretch. “I asked several commuters but no one was aware of what led to the congestion. Most assumed that police had started checking vaccination certificates at the border,” she said.Another commuter to Delhi said that Gurugram police could have checked the congestion through automatic and real-time management of traffic signals. “Nothing works on time and traffic is poorly managed at the borders,” said Ranveer Singh, a resident of Golf Course Road.

Ali, who was handling the family’s political affairs in the absence of his father and elder brother, is now on the run with the possibility of a cash reward being announced on his head by the police. At present, Atiq is in Ahmedabad Jail and his elder son Umar is already absconding. “A report for announcing cash reward on arrest of Ali and other accused has been forwarded,” SP (City) Dinesh Kumar Singh said. The second FIR against Ali and some of his aides was registered at Kareli police station on Friday night on the complaint of Atiq’s relative Zeeshan aka Janu. Zeeshan alleged that Ali and his aides demolished boundary wall of his property in a bid to grab it. He also claimed that Ali forced him to talk to his father at Ahmedabad Jail who threatened him to transfer the property in his wife’s name or else give cash ₹5 crores. Zeeshan further alleged that Ali and his aides also assaulted him and his brother and nephew, following which they received serious injuries. He fled the spot as Ali and others opened fire on him, Zeeshan added. Later, police arrested two persons from the spot while Ali and others managed to escape and still on the run. Police were carrying out raids in Chakia and other places to arrest Ali and his friends. Meanwhile, AIMIM leaders have come forward in support of Atiq and his family. Party leaders held a press conference on Monday and claimed that the FIR was part of a conspiracy to defame Atiq and implicate Ali in a fake case as he was carrying out rallies and was canvassing for the party across the state. The administration forced Atiq’s relative Zeeshan to lodge FIR against Ali.AIMIM spokesperson Afsar Mehmood and senior leader Arif Iqbal said that Atiq’s brother-in-law Imran Zai and his brother Zeeshan were involved in land grabbing and have 14 cases lodged against Zai and he was in jail for the last six months in a case of extortion. “Zeeshan is a history sheeter of Khuldabad police station. Atiq Ahmad has disassociated himself from Imran and his brothers when he came to know of their illegal activities,” he said. AIMIM leaders have demanded a fair inquiry into the case as in none of the viral videos, Ali or party worker Asaad could be seen. It is worth mentioning that some videos had gone viral in which cops can be seen catching two aides of Ali while Zeeshan was heard arguing with them. Earlier, Kareli police had also lodged an FIR against Ali for indirectly issuing threats to PDA officials and inflammatory speech while addressing a public meeting of AIMIM at Majidia Islamia Intermediate College on September 26. Atiq Ahmad and his kin have joined AIMIM and are expected to contest from at least three seats in the upcoming state assembly polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/atiqs-son-on-the-run-now-prayagraj-police-to-declare-cash-reward-101641238772275.html

04-01-2022||Chandigarh||Now Covid grounds public programmes of BJP-JJP in Haryana||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and his cabinet ministers have cancelled their scheduled political rallies and public meetings amid spectre of the third wave of coronavirus looming large and after the state government declared public places out of bounds for people not fully vaccinated.From January 1, the state government has imposed ‘no entry in public places’ order on all those adults who are yet to take both the doses of Covid vaccination. It is this directive advising people that they should remain at their residence if not fully vaccinated which was coming in the way of planned public meetings of the CM and the ministers.Yet another cause of concern as per the government’s own admission is that a large number of beneficiaries are “due and overdue since long for second dose” of Covid vaccination.While 71% eligible people have received the second dose of Covid-19 vaccine till Monday when the vaccination of 15.4 lakh teenagers in the 15-18 age group began, at least 98% people in state have received the first dose.In this backdrop, while Khattar has applied brakes on his January 8-9 Haryana Pragati rallies in Kaithal and Jind, agriculture and farmers’ welfare minister Jai Parkash Dalal has deferred all his political programmes and other animal husbandry department’s engagements in which large public participation was expected. Power minister Ranjit Singh has also put on hold his ‘bijli panchayats’ slated for this month till the situation becomes normal.Such is the scare the virus has started causing again that home and health minister Anil Vij, who is known for meeting people regularly at his Ambala residence and in Chandigarh office, has announced that he will not be able to meet people.Now, the minister has urged the public to send him their grievances via letters or email, promising that he will continue to resolve public problems.Setback to public outreachEver since the BJP retained power in October 2019 assembly elections with the support of the JJP, the public outreach initiatives of the government has suffered setbacks. First it was Covid and the lockdown in 2020 that halted the movement and public engagements of the ruling party politicians.Later, Haryana remained the epicentre of the farmers’ agitation. During their over a year-long stir that ended in early December 2021 against the Centre’s three farm laws, the cultivators didn’t let the ruling Haryana BJP-JJP ministers move freely in public and hold public functions.Immediately after the farmer unions called-off their agitation in wake of Centre repealing the farm laws in the first week of December, Khattar started touring the state, and holding rallies and functions to replug with the public.Khattar held rallies, toured NCR districts and held ‘janta darbar’ in his Karnal district. His aides say political functions of Khattar in the next two months were prepared already and now all of them stand deferred due to the virus.“CM has cancelled his Kaithal and Jind (Safidon) rallies. I have put on hold all my programmes of January in which large crowds were expected. We will have to be careful,” said Dalal.Endorsing the views of Dalal, power minister Ranjit Singh said he too has deferred four ‘bijli panchayats’ that he had planned to hold in January.“We will have to wait for the situation to become normal before we again start public functions,” he said as education minister Kanwar Pal and transport minister Mool Chand Sharma said they have also tweaked their planned public events.

She appealed to the students to use the knowledge received from the SSU for promoting the language and to use it for the development of the nation.“Nation building and development of students depend on the teachers. If even a single student is successful, then the success of the ‘guru (teacher)’ is accomplished and the life of the ‘acharya’ (teacher) becomes successful,” she said.SSU vice chancellor Prof Hareram Tripathi said that the university that started as a Sanskrit college in 1791, is currently progressing towards its objectives. From March 22, 1958, the college gave way to Varanasi Sanskrit University and Sampurnanand Sanskrit Vishwavidyalaya started from 1973 onwards. “At present digitisation of library and examination system is being done so that students could get online examination applications and other facilities,” he said.SSU public relations officer Shashindra Mishra said that the governor honoured the chief guest of the program, Malini Awasthi with the honorary degree of D-Lit and distributed reading material, bags and nutritious food to the children coming from primary school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ssu-convocation-sanskrit-is-god-s-language-use-your-knowledge-to-promote-it-governor-to-students-101641238112462.html

In a statement, former minister and SAD spokesman Daljit Singh Cheema said the CM was speaking blatantly lies and announced to lead a dharna to get the file recommending regularisation of all contractual employees cleared by the governor. “This is being done despite the fact that the Congress government is well aware that the code of conduct may be imposed within the next few days,” added Cheema. Cheema said the governor should take strong action against the CM for cheating contractual employees. “This is a clear case of violation of constitutional norms also as the clarifications sought by the governor reveal that the state government has not withdrawn the earlier Bill passed on the same issue as committed before the high court,” added the SAD spokesperson. He also lashed out at Channi for releasing false advertisements to the effect that contractual employees were being regularised. “Crores of rupees are being spent on these false advertisements and it should be recovered from the chief minister as well as the Congress party,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bill-on-contractual-staff-register-case-against-channi-for-cheating-employees-sad-to-guv-101641238052316.html
04-01-2022||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Yogi transfers ₹1000 each in bank accounts of 1.50 cr unorganised workers||Lucknow Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday transferred ₹1,000 maintenance allowance in the bank accounts of 1.50 crore migrant and unorganised workers. In the first phase, a total amount of ₹1500 crore has been transferred while the remaining workers will get their allowance after necessary formalities are done, as per a press release issued by the state government.Speaking at a programme organised to transfer the maintenance allowance through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) in the bank accounts of 1.50 crore migrant labourers and construction workers, at Lok Bhawan here, Yogi said that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government was working for the welfare of migrant workers in Uttar Pradesh. During the Covid pandemic, the state government gave allowances to these migrant workers employed in the organised and the unorganised sectors and it has given a new direction to the public welfare schemes, he said. The CM said, “3.81 crore migrant workers have been linked to this scheme. Out of which, the accounts of 1.50 crore workers have been checked and the money is being deposited in their accounts in the first phase. Within the next four months, the maintenance allowance will be transferred in the accounts of the remaining workers. The government has also decided to include sanitation workers in the scheme under the ‘Life and livelihood policy’ in view of the Covid pandemic.” UP chief minister said that before 2017, the workers were victims of exploitation. “They did not get the benefit of government schemes. During the rainy days, they had to go hungry as there was no cooking gas. If a labourer fell sick, the family was in crisis, there was no facility for treatment. The Modi government mantra of ‘sabka ka saath, sabka vikas’, has paved way for health insurance, housing, electricity, and toilets for each poor family,” he said. The BJP government is setting up Atal residential schools in all commissionerates of the state to provide state-of-the-art education to the children of labourers who are migrating from one district to another. “Along with the skill development of carpenters, cobblers, confectioners and masons, the state government is also providing them honorarium and loans. Uttar Pradesh was the first state, during the pandemic, that provided the social security of ₹2 lakh and medical insurance of ₹5 lakh to every worker in association with Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh.” he said. During the Covid-19 induced first lockdown, over 40 lakh workers were forced to return to their home in Uttar Pradesh as other states failed to make arrangements for their stay. The BJP government in UP immediately started working on the plan to provide livelihood to the migrants, they are now also working in the industries and many set up new businesses in UP, he said. Under the SP, BSP and Congress governments there was no system of education for the children of the workers. Neither mid-day meal nor clean drinking water was available. “When our government came to power, we provided separate toilets for boys and girls, along with sweaters, socks, shoes, and books to study,” chief minister said. “Under the SP government the money released for the poor was being used by the SP leaders. The middlemen embezzled the fund meant for the marriage grant to the girls coming from weaker sections of the society. The BJP government stopped the loot by launching ‘Mukhyamantri Samuhik Vivah Yojana’ scheme. The incentive for each married couple has also been increased from ₹20,000 to 51,000.”

04-01-2022||Chandigarh||Haryana govt fails to get buyers to sell agro malls||Having failed to get buyers, the Haryana State Agriculture Marketing Board (HSAMB) has now cancelled the auction of its two agro malls located in Karnal and Panipat.The HSAMB had invited bids to e-auction the agro malls on November 18, 2021 but in lack of buyers, the e-auction was rescheduled to December 23, 2021. But again in the lack of bidders, the auction could not be completed. Following this, both the properties have now been sent in the cancelled list.Officials associated with the auction said auctions were cancelled as there were no bidders to buy the properties and they will again put these properties for sale.On November 15 last year, three days before the first e-auction on November 18, 2021, farm leader Rakesh Tikait, along with a group of farmers, had visited Karnal’s agro mall and warned that farmers will not allow the government to sell agro malls to private people at any cost.Tikait had termed the Haryana government’s move as beginning of privatisation of agriculture mandis in country.He had also threatened that the private buyers will not be allowed to buy and claim possession of these malls and directed local farmers to get united against this decision and fight tooth and nail but not to allow any private trader to buy this agro malls and lock them inside if any official or buyer comes at the agro mall.On the other hand, the HSAMB had categorically made it clear that they have decided to sell these properties after considering all options and the buyers will be given possession.HSAMB chief administrator Vinay Yadav said, “The auction process for both the properties could not be completed in lack of required number of bidders and now these properties will be auctioned again.”On whether the department could consider any other option as the farm leaders are also against this step and even threatened the buyers, he said, “The decision (of auction) was taken after considering all options as these properties were lying useless for the past couple of years.”The HSAMB had invited applications from the interested parties for e-auction of agro malls located on prime locations on NH-44 in Karnal and Panipat.The Karnal agro mall has commercial built up of 2.02 lakh sq-ft and the Panipat one has commercial built up of 63,256 sq-ft and the earnest money deposit of ₹3.50 crore and ₹1 crore was fixed for Karnal and Panipat agro malls, respectively.The agro malls were launched at four places – Rohtak, Karnal, Panchkula, and Panipat – by the previous Bhupinder Singh Hooda-led Congress government in 2013-14 with ₹200 crore.

04-01-2022||Chandigarh||Congress leaders question Sidhu’s pre-poll promises||Chandigarh : Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu’s “unilateral announcements” of freebies on Monday to lure women voters in the state polls has not gone down well with some senior party leaders. Cabinet minister Rana Gurjeet Singh, while raising questions of over the timing Sidhu’s promises, said these would mislead the people as the election manifesto of the Congress was still being prepared and no one knew if these would be included in it or not. “In his personal capacity, a person can say anything, but when one is the president of a party, he needs to take everyone along,” the minister told a TV channel. Rana Gurjeet said that these announcements and their timing would not send the right single to people. “If he (PPCC chief) has done this after a discussion with CM Charanjit Singh Channi, it is okay otherwise it will be tough for the party. In case these things are not included in the party manifesto, what face he would have,” said the minister, who earlier accused the state unit chief of trying to create divisions within the party.Punjab doesn’t need economic model fuelled by liquor sale: JakharPunjab Congress campaign committee chairman Sunil Jakhar also said that increasing collections from excise seems to be the basis for the promises being doled out by all the parties. “Even if it were not as absurd as it sounds, any economic model which is to be primarily fuelled by sale of liquor is not what Punjab deserves. If ‘chita’ has been the bane, liquor is no elixir to be propagated! Please don’t lead the youth astray,” he said on being asked about the competition over populist promises. He said hard work, blood, toil, tears and sweat had always been the Punjabi way to progress and prosperity. AAP takes dig at Sidhu over ‘shifting stance’ Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) spokesperson Raghav Chadha also took a dig at Sidhu for his shifting stance on welfare schemes. “Punjab de vich kahawat hai…Cycle da vi stand hunda hai lekin Sidhu da nahi,” Chadha tweeted with a video in which the Congress leader can seen mocking the AAP’s promise to transfer ₹1,000 per month to the account of every woman in Punjab aged 18 or above. Sidhu had questioned the poll promise, stating that Punjabis were not beggars and did not need such alms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/congress-leaders-question-sidhu-s-pre-poll-promises-101641237212227.html

They have not accepted the saffron party yet. They have spent days and nights on the roads even in harsh weather for over a year in protest against three farm laws.” “I tried to convince them that we would be able to bring major projects to the area from the Centre, but they were not ready to accept the BJP,” he said, adding that “considering their feelings, I decided to come back to the Congress”.On December 28, Ladi and Qadian Congress MLA Fateh Jung Bajwa joined the saffron party in the presence of Union Jal Shakti minister and the party’s Punjab affairs in-charge, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, in New Delhi ahead of the Punjab assembly elections.According to sources, the two leaders had joined the BJP since they were unlikely to be given the Congress ticket in the elections. The sources said Ladi had returned after getting assurance of the ticket from the constituency that is reserved for Scheduled Castes.Ladi is a confidant of Fateh Jung and conquered the traditional Panthic seat of Sri Hargobindpur in 2017 by defeating Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD)’s Manjit Singh Manna Mianwind.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-week-after-joining-bjp-ladi-back-in-congress-101641236852255.html

The deputy chief minister said he shared old ties with Sidhu’s family but the latter was upset from the time he became the home minister. “If he wants the home ministry and the high command tells me, I am ready to resign and leave the home department at his feet in a minute,” the deputy chief minister told reporters on being asked why the state Congress chief was upset with him. Randhawa, a minister in the previous Capt Amarinder Singh government, was elevated to the rank of deputy chief minister with the charge of home department in the Charanjit Singh Channi cabinet that was sworn in three months ago. Sidhu has been attacking the state government for not being able to arrest former Akali minister Bikram Singh Majithia in a drugs case. Majithia not in Punjab, claims dy CM Randhawa, who was addressing a press conference here along with Congress national spokesperson Alka Lamba, also refuted the AAP’s allegations that the Channi government was not arresting Majithia. “He (Majithia) is not in the state. He has not visited the Golden Temple recently. The pictures showing him offering prayers at Golden Temple are old,” he said, declaring that he would be arrested and put in jail as soon as he was seen in the state. The deputy CM also hit out at the AAP by raking up the apology tendered by the opposition party’s national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to Majithia in a defamation case for levelling allegations of involvement in drugs trade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ready-to-give-up-home-ministry-if-sidhu-wants-it-says-randhawa-101641236612275.html

04-01-2022||Mumbai||Teen spirit: 176,552 jabbed across Maharashtra||Mumbai: Relief and cheer writ large on the faces of teenagers who filed in to receive their first Covid dose, as the state rolled out the national vaccination drive for youngsters between 15 to 18 years on Monday.Maharashtra administered 176,552 doses of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin – the only vaccine option for the 15 to 18 age group according to guidelines issued by the Union health ministry -- while 7,158 doses were administered in Mumbai. While Mumbai has a target of 900,000 children in the 15-18 years category, the state has a target of 6.06 million children.Tanuja Makadwala and Rajan Bari, both class 10 students of Shastri Nagar Mumbai Public Secondary School (Santacruz West) were the first teenagers to get their doses in the city. They received their jabs at 11.15 am at the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) jumbo Covid-19 centre as Maharashtra Tourism and Environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, who launched the drive virtually, looked on. Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar and civic commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal also participated in the virtual inauguration.Makadwala and Bari were later felicitated with a certificate. “I would request everyone to take the dose as early as possible so that we can return to normal lives,” Makadwala said.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) set up vaccination booths in nine jumbo centres run by the civic body including at NSCI Worli, Kanjurmarg, NESCO, Richardson and Crudas (Byculla) and Mulund, among others. Apart from this, a handful of private hospitals also participated in the drive. Only the children of railway staff will be administered the vaccine at Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Hospital at Byculla.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner and incharge of public health in the BMC said that the civic body has set a target to inoculate 4,500 students each day this week. All students will be vaccinated free of cost in Mumbai.“In each centre we will be inoculating at least 500 teenagers daily. Each centre is equipped to administer 10,000 vaccines a day and if the need arises the limit can be easily expanded. We are eyeing a one-two months deadline for inoculating all the teenagers with at least one dose of the vaccine,” said Kakani.Dr Mangala Gomare, Mumbai’s executive health officer said Mumbai has nearly 40 exclusive Covaxin centres which will be opened up for 15–18-year-olds. “All vaccination centres have created separate booths for the 15-18 age group so that there is no mixing of the crowd,” she said.The civic body is hopeful that there will not be much hesitancy because of the increasing Covid-19 cases, she added.Teenagers started to queue up outside the vaccination centres from the early hours on Monday with their parents. Civic-run schools also brought many students to the vaccination centres in large groups.Nerrissa Mathews (16) from St. Joseph’s School Bandra said that taking the vaccine will make her parents feel more at ease.“All the members in my family are fully vaccinated. As I have not taken my dose, my parents feel apprehensive to allow me to go out often. Now that I have taken the dose, this will make them feel a little bit relieved,” she said.The Drugs Controller General of India granted emergency use authorisation to indigenously-developed Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin for children above 12 years with certain conditions on December 24.Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya has advised states and Union Territories to provide separate vaccination centres, session sites, queue and different vaccination teams for this age group to avoid the mixing-up of vaccines.Schools mapped with centresEach jumbo centre in the city has been mapped with at least two municipal wards and residents will be directed to their nearest centre. The civic body has tied up jumbo centres with the municipal schools in nearby wards.The BKC Centre, which is in H/East ward, is mapped with Bandra East (same ward as BKC), Andheri East (K/East), and Bandra, Khar, Santacruz (H/West) wards. Similarly, NESCO Centre in Goregaon (P/South) has been mapped with Malad (P/North) and Kandivli (R/ South) wards.The BMC has set a target of inoculating 500 students from all the municipal schools every day. The schools have been given a target to get minimum 50 students vaccinated each day. These students are escorted to the nearest jumbo centre by their teachers and online registration is not necessary for them.“On Friday we were given the target and after that we have readied the list of our students. We have started with 50 students on Monday and as the drive goes on more students will be brought here in batches,” said Koli Nilappa, an assistant teacher at the BMC Hindi Secondary School in Kalina.“The education and health department are working together in this. We have sent all the data of the students to the health department which is then sent to the nearest jumbo centres in advance so that when the students go, they have their credentials already registered,” said a senior official of the BMC education department.Arrangements madeAll municipal schools had held parent-teacher meetings to counsel the parents about the vaccination and give consent letters. “The civic schools have received a very good response with a majority of the parents consenting for vaccination,” said Gomare, the city’s executive health officer.“We are now working on a strategy to reach out to private schools and colleges. Our community health workers and outreach teams are also enlisting out-of-school children in their respective areas,” she added.The window for online slot booking was opened on January 1 and the BMC had kept both the online and walk-in facilities available for the teenagers to expedite the process.However, the teenagers and their parents stated that most of them had been facing technical issues during the online registration process. Many of them said that as the beneficiaries were less than 18 years old, there was no direct link available for them to get themselves registered in the Aarogya Setu app and Cowin platform.Many centres received a popup stating the website was “not available in the country”. Centres then began registrations on mobile applications. The glitch was corrected by 11.30 am.A dedicated helpdesk was set up to help teenagers register on the CoWin platform in many centres.“We had anticipated that on the first day more beneficiaries will opt for offline registration, because of which we had deployed dedicated staffers to help students register. After they received the OTP, they were taken into the centre for inoculation,” said Dr Rajesh Dere, dean of the jumbo facility at BKC.“The drive received a very good response, and we did not record any adverse event due to immunisation,” he said.Tushar Shetty (15) a science student from SIS Commerce and Science society high school said that now that he has taken the dose, he will be allowed to travel on train.“Earlier I used to take train for going to school but now I can’t get the ticket as I am not vaccinated and travelling in autorickshaw costs me a lot of money and often I have to share the ride with my friends. Now that I have taken the first dose now and will become fully vaccinated soon, I can again go by train,” said Shetty.Dev Trivedi, a 15-year-old said that in his school the students have been strictly instructed to take the vaccines or else they will not be allowed to sit in the exams.“Many schools that we know have taken this vaccine thing very seriously, we were told that they are gearing up to start offline classes soon and before that each one of us needs to be fully vaccinated,” he said.Hopeful for the future“Many students I know couldn’t go abroad for higher studies after 10th as they were not vaccinated. Besides safeguarding them from the virus, these vaccines will also open the doors of their careers again,” said Mohanlal Sharma, who had accompanied his daughter at the NESCO facility.“The cases have started to rise again and it’s difficult to keep children indoors all the time, which is also not good for their mental health also. Vaccinating them was necessary as they can now gradually get back to normal lifestyle,” said Tara Ahuja who came with her 15-year-old son and 17-year-old daughter at the NESCO facility.Many children who participated in the drive also came equipped with the knowledge of the importance of the vaccination and possible side effects.“I read many research papers and articles about the efficacy and safety of Covaxin,” said Kabir Kumar Parmani (16), a class 10 student Arya Vidya Mandir in Bandra. “I was determined to take the vaccine and I have told my younger brother to take the vaccine as soon as he is eligible. It’s the best weapon we have to fight the virus,” said Parmani, who aspires to pursue a career in oncology.For Mansi Patel (15) and her brother Varas (19), the increasing Covid-19 cases and the lack of access to unvaccinated people were two motivating factors to take the jab. “We are facing problems to enter malls. Going to school and college will also be difficult without being safeguarded by the vaccine. Not just our parents, we ourselves were very keen to take the shot,” said Patel adding that they stay in a large family with seniors and much younger children. “Being unvaccinated was very risky for us,” she said.Private hospitals too ordered more stocks of Covaxin anticipating the rise in demand. For instance, Wockhardt Hospital in Mumbai Central had 500 doses of Covaxin and they have placed orders for more. “We administered 89 vaccines to children in the 15-18 category on Monday,” said Dr Parag Rindani, chief executive officer of the hospital. We are looking forward to vaccinating more and more children in the coming days,” he said.Drive in Navi Mumbai and ThaneThe Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) have vaccinated 9070 students in the age group of 15- to 18-year-old at its 206 centres set up for the purpose, on the first day of the children vaccination drive. The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) vaccinated over 3,000 children while the Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) vaccinated 2,563 students on the first day.Around 500,000 students will be getting jabbed across Thane district in this vaccination drive.“We have set up vaccination centres for 15- to 18-year-olds at 206 schools across the city. The students will have to be accompanied by their parents for the vaccination. They will also have to get their mobile phones along to register online for the jab. The schools will be responsible for giving the slots to their students to ensure every one of them get the jab,” an officer from NMMC said.TMC has initiated the vaccination of 15- to 18-year-olds with their first dose at 16 centres in the city. “We have a target of vaccination 1000 students at the parking plaza centres daily, apart from this, 500 to 600 beneficiaries will be vaccinated in the 15 other centres. On day one more than 3000 students were vaccinated across the 16 centres,” Dr Prasad Patil, immunization officer, TMC, said.Kalyani Chavan, 15, a class 10 student was excited to get her first dose before the final examinations. She said, “Our School, Brahman Vidyalaya in Vartak Nagar, Thane had set up a vaccination drive for us. We have to give offline exams which pose a risk especially when the cases are increasing. As this is a crucial year for me, I decided to take the dose on the first day itself so I can complete the two doses before my board examinations.”QUOTE RAIL:Mahi Deliwala (16), Kandivali residentClass 11, NM College“The vaccine is for our safety and the safety of people around us. I believe that everyone should take it to fight the virus. I had made up my mind to take the vaccine as soon as it would start for my age group. I had also discussed this with my close friends and they will also be taking it.”Vineet Yadav (15), Goregaon residentClass 9, Pahadi Municipal School“My parents were scared of the side effects but they agreed to give the consent to the school as all other parents had done it. I was not worried about the vaccine, as so many people have already taken it and all my friends were taking it too. We all gathered at the school and came in a bus to the vaccination centres. Our school teachers have counselled us about the basic side effects.”Jayita Sadani (16), Chembur residentClass 11, Swami Vivekanand College“I didn’t give much of thought. My parents were convinced that I should take the vaccine because I am the youngest in the family and the only person who was unvaccinated till now. Our college had also made an announcement asking us to take the vaccine. I registered online on January 1 so that I could get the injection on the first day itself.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/teen-spirit-176-552-jabbed-across-maharashtra-101641236314125.html
04-01-2022||Lucknow||Accidental Hindus’ know nothing about Hindutva: Yogi slams Congress||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday laid the foundation stone of a government medical college in Amethi, inaugurated a 500-bed referral hospital and launched a scathing attack on the Congress accusing former Amethi MP Rahul Gandhi of projecting Amethi in poor light. He also accused the Congress as well as Samajwadi Party (SP) leaders of remembering Hindus and temples only during elections. In a veiled attack on the Congress leadership, Yogi said those who called themselves ‘accidental Hindus’, cannot call themselves Hindus. “Unhe chunaav me hi mandir aur Amethi ki yaad aati hai (They (Cong) remember temples and Amethi only during elections,” he said while addressing a public meeting in Jagdishpur after laying the foundation stone of the medical college. “When the people of this district gave them a chance to serve, they did nothing and now as elections have come, the ‘bhai-behen’ are coming here again,” he said referring to Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi who had recently visited Amethi. “During the Covid-19 period, when we were working to save lives of the common man these brother and sister gave fake numbers of roadways, fake numbers of scooters in the name of buses. They were playing with the lives of people while we took action against them because they were creating disturbances in the work of the government,” he said. “Divisive politics is always part of those whose ancestors used to say that they were accidental Hindus,” the CM said. The government medical college in Amethi would come up at a cost of ₹293 crore while 500 bed district-level referral hospital that was inaugurated on Monday has come at a cost of ₹86.42 crore. Union minister and Amethi MP Smriti Irani, who was also present on the occasion, said the medical facilities would transform the district into a medical hub. During his recent Amethi visit, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had tried to distinguish between “Hindu” and “Hindutva”, describing himself a “Hindu” and the BJP leaders as followers of “Hindutva”. Taking a dig at Rahul over his remark, the CM said, “One who doesn’t know how to sit in a temple knows nothing about Hinduism or Hindutva. During the elections in Gujarat, the former Amethi MP went to a temple and sat there. The priests had to interrupt and teach him how to sit in a temple,” Yogi claimed. “Even when I was not the CM, I used to say this that we are a proud Hindu and today also I am saying this. I will always say this. But such was their (Congress) lust for power that they resorted to appeasement politics. They even used to instigate riots in the name of communalism,” Yogi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/accidental-hindus-know-nothing-about-hindutva-yogi-slams-congress-101641236312568.html

He asked people to be wary of such “electoral Hindus”. On Samajwadi Party’s love for Brahmins, Maurya said, “Jo Ram ka na hua woh Parashuram ka kya hoga. (one who couldn’t be faithful to Ram, how would he be loyal to Parshuram?”On Sunday, SP president Akhilesh Yadav had unveiled an idol of Lord Parshuram (an avtaar of Lord Vishnu) and offered prayers during the Lucknow leg of his Samajwadi Vijay Yatra. Maurya made these remarks while addressing his party’s backward classes convention in Sikandarpur assembly segment of Ballia district. On the occasion, he laid the foundation stone of 42 roads and six bridges to be constructed at a cost of about ₹72 crore. He also inaugurated 48 roads constructed at a cost of ₹53.63 crore.The deputy CM said Akhilesh Yadav should prepare for 2027 polls and not for 2022. “There was a storm of BJP in 2014 and since 2019 it is having a tsunami in which SP, BSP and Congress will shed like leaves,” Maurya said. He also claimed that the BJP will repeat its performance in the upcoming assembly elections in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/be-wary-of-electoral-hindus-dy-cm-maurya-101641236074531.html
04-01-2022||Mumbai||Police inspector writes to HM, asks to transfer Param Bir probe to CBI||Mumbai: Anup Dange, a police inspector posted at the south region control room, has sought to transfer the investigation to his complaint against former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), in a letter addressed to state home minister Dilip Walse Patil. Dange had submitted his complaint to the chief minister and the home department on February 2, 2021, following which the Anti-Corruption Bureau initiated an open inquiry into an aspect of the complaint which pertained to Dange’s allegation that Singh had reportedly sought money in return for not initiating action against Dange.“It has been over a year and I am still being persecuted and victimized by my own department vide departmental inquiry, the only charge against me being ‘I spoke against Param Bir Singh’,” Dange wrote in the letter. “Ten months have lapsed since I have submitted my complaint to the government and [the delay] clearly shows that the government is not interested in conducting any inquiry into multiple issues raised by me against Singh and others or the Government is being misled by the investigating agencies.” “[Param Bir] Singh may have faith in his batchmate-buddies at the CBI. However, I have faith in the Almighty. Justice shall be delivered to me and justice shall be served upon Param Bir. I would prefer to have the fate of my complaint decided by an intelligent enemy rather than a foolish friend. Therefore, it is humbly requested that the inquiry of my complaint against Singh and others be transferred to the CBI,” Dange wrote. According to Dange’s complaint, in November 2019 while he was posted at the Gamdevi police station, he and a team had visited a pub on Bhulabhai Desai Road during a night patrol. The officer asked the pub staff to close down the establishment, as under the prevailing rules, it was not permitted to operate beyond the deadline of 1.30pm. Policemen on patrolling duty also asked customers to leave, but one customer entered into a heated argument with the policemen and attacked police personnel with some of his friends. A case was registered against seven people. Dange claimed that Singh -- who was director general, ACB at the time --- prevented him from taking action against the bar owner, which Dange did not heed. Soon after Singh took charge as the Mumbai PC in February 2020, a departmental enquiry was initiated against Dange. Dange’s complaint further stated that in 2020, Singh asked Dange to pay ₹50 lakh to avoid action taken against him. “We have recorded Dange’s statement and are conducting an inquiry as per the legal procedure. If required to record the statement of Param Bir Singh for inquiry will follow the legal process,” a senior IPS officer from the ACB who did not wish to be named said.
04-01-2022||Mumbai||GitHub apps case: Bengaluru student held for inquiry||Mumbai: The Mumbai Police on Monday apprehended an engineering student from Bengaluru for questioning in connection with its probe into two apps where images of Muslim women were posted in an attempt to “auction” them, officials told HT.While the latest app came to light on January 1 after women who were targeted approached police, the previous app was floated in July last year. Confirming the development, a senior police official of the Mumbai police who did not wish to be quoted said, “The cyber team has nabbed a person from Bengaluru and he is being taken to Mumbai for inquiry. We have not arrested him yet. If during an inquiry, we will find his involvement then the legal action will be taken.”“The person taken into the custody for inquiry is a second-year civil engineering student. He was running one of the twitter handles which was used to upload the content from the app,” an officer from the Mumbai cybercrime cell said.The Mumbai cyber police had registered an FIR under sections 153A, 153 B, 295A, 354D, 509, 500 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) along with Section 67 Information Technology Act against unknown persons. The case was based on statements of some women whose pictures were used on the app.Maharashtra minister of state (Home), Satej Patil tweeted on Monday evening: “@MumbaiPolice has got a breakthrough.Though we cannot disclose the details at this moment as it may hamper the ongoing investigation, I would like to assure all the victims that we are proactively chasing the culprits & they will face the law very soon.”“Were the platforms involved informed about these handles by Central Govt.? All these platforms are headquartered outside India. What provisions do we have for data transfer? Was the mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT) invoked in this case?” Patil, a Congressman, tweeted earlier on Monday. “The Central government had brought controversial regulations on digital media platforms last year, but if they are not used in such cases to prevent crime against women and children, then what is the use of them?”“This is condemnable, and action must be taken against those responsible,” said state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Keshav Upadhye, adding that the Centre has acted speedily against such apps. Former minister and senior BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar said it was necessary to codify a law about defamatory content about women and even political leaders on social media. “Anyone, regardless of their religious identity, must get justice… no one should be discriminated against based on their religious identity,” he said.Meanwhile, the Delhi commission for women on Monday issued notice to Delhi police in connection with its investigation into the app. An FIR in the case was registered on Sunday based on a complaint filed by a journalist whose picture was used in the app. Police officers who were familiar with developments told HT on Monday that the case is likely to be transferred to the Intelligent Fusion and Strategic Operations Unit(IFSO), which deals with major cybercrimes.“We are yet to get the order regarding the transfer of cases,” one officer from the IFSO unit, who asked not to be named, said.The FIR at the south east district cyber station was registered under sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Information Technology Act.IFSO is also handling the investigation into the app floated in July.The police have sought information from GitHub, the platform used to make the app and Twitter, where links to the app were posted on several accounts which are now deactivated. “We are yet to get a reply from Git Hub in the first case. The case can only proceed once they share the IP address of the users,” the above-mentioned officer of the IFSO, who asked not to be named, said.The DCW, in its notice, asked IFSO’s DCP to appear before the commission on January 6. In the notice, the DCW sought details of the action taken in the current case and reiterated that police had not action in the first case. The Commission said that the police inaction had emboldened the culprits to engage in such illegal activities for the second time. The DCW has asked police to provide a status report on the investigation in the first case.Union minister for electronics and information technology, Ashwini Vaishnaw had on Sunday said that the government has also asked for a ban on the account of a user on GitHub.A GitHub spokesperson had on Sunday said that they have already suspended a user account following the investigation of reports of such activities as it violated the company’s policies.(With inputs from HTC, Delhi)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/github-apps-case-bengaluru-student-held-for-inquiry-101641236013425.html

04-01-2022||Noida||Nearly 13,000 teenagers get coronavirus jab across Noida, Ghaziabad on Day 1||Noida/Ghaziabad: As vaccination against Covid-19 for children in the 15-18 age group started on Monday, nearly 3,068 beneficiaries were administered the first dose in Noida and 9,878 were administered the first dose in Ghaziabad without any adverse effect reported so far.“On Monday, there were no known Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) instances reported during the vaccination. For those children whose schools are shut, we have sent Covaxin to our community health centres and primary health centres. So, children can also walk in and get their doses,” said Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar, chief medical officer of Ghaziabad.In Noida, 27 government centres, including schools, and 15 private centres were set up for the vaccination of children in this category. According to population estimates, about 115,000 in this age group are to be vaccinated in Gautam Budh Nagar.Though both online and offline slots were available to book appointments for vaccination in Gautam Budh Nagar, a bigger crowd was witnessed at private centres than schools and other government centres in Noida.Authorities said it could be because of a lack of awareness among locals, especially in the lower socio-economic groups or general vaccine hesitancy.“The vaccination drive is going well and we expect more people to get the shot in the next few days. It takes a couple of days for people to start pouring in whenever a category opens up. We have enough doses at all centres and we hope that children in the 15-18 age group get the vaccine at the earliest,” said Dr Neeraj Tyagi, district immunisation officer.Children who took the dose in Noida said that it was better to be protected than be sorry later.“Our parents have spoken to doctors and they suggest that the vaccine should definitely be taken by all children. Cases this time are probably milder because adults have mostly taken the vaccine. We hope that it is allowed for even younger children as well,” said Shivani Singh, a 16-year-old resident of Sector 137.Some others compared it with the mandatory vaccines taken by toddlers. “Many vaccines are compulsory for children till three years of age. Some diseases like smallpox have been eradicated because children are given these vaccines early on. The Covid vaccine will soon become like one of these,” said Atharv Gupta, another 16-year-old resident of Sector 93.Meanwhile, 135 new cases were recorded in Gautam Budh Nagar on Monday, taking the tally of active cases to 466. The district health department said the cases did not include anyone with a travel history or the Omicron variant. Of the 466 active cases, 11 were recovering in hospital till 4pm on Monday, while 455 are in home isolation. With about 3,500 tests being conducted daily, the positivity rate on Monday was recorded at 3.8%.Meanwhile, Ghaziabad district health department officials said they vaccinated 29, 299 beneficiaries on Monday, of which 9,717 belonged to the 15-18 age group. Officials added they dispatched 40,000 doses of Covaxin to about 164 vaccination centres, including camps set up in 81 schools.Ghaziabad reported 135 fresh Covid-19 cases on Monday -- the highest single-day spike since May 27 last year, when the district recorded 169 cases. According to official figures, the sample positivity rate on Monday increased to 2.42%.According to the CoWIN portal, till 6.30pm on Monday Uttar Pradesh vaccinated 154,940 children.“My friends and I were very excited to get the first vaccine dose as everyone wants to get vaccinated before we start studying for our board exams. The rise in Covid-19 cases and spread of infection worried me so I also wanted to get vaccinated at the earliest,” said Sunny Kumar, student of Class 11 at Dr Ambedkar Inter College at Dasna, who was among the first ones to receive Covaxin doses on Monday.“My family supported me in the initiative and gave me the go-ahead to get the Covid vaccine at school. All the adults in my family have been vaccinated and now it is my turn. Now, I feel safe and protected against Covid-19,” said Rohit Chaudhary, another student of the same school.In December 2021, the Uttar Pradesh government issued guidelines for the vaccination of children aged 15-18 years from January 3 as well as for senior citizens, healthcare workers and frontline workers, who will be administered the third dose of the Covid-19 vaccine from January 10.The government has also provided districts with targets for vaccinating beneficiaries in different groups. According to its target, Ghaziabad must vaccinate 234,488 beneficiaries in the 15-18 year category.According to state guidelines, children are to be administered only Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin as it is the only vaccine with Emergency Use Listing (EUL) for the 15-18 age group and recommended by the Covid -19 Working Group of the National Technical Advisory Group on immunisation.A majority of the schools that started vaccinating children on Monday were government or government-aided schools while a majority of private schools are presently shut for winter vacations.School administrations also made elaborate arrangements on their premises with the help of the health department.“To ensure social distancing and Covid protocols, we picked up students of one class and took them to the vaccination camp on our school premises. Students of other classes also got vaccinated in a similar manner. We also held counselling sessions to encourage children to get vaccinated. The entire vaccination process went on smoothly while following all protocols,” said Mohammad Saleem, the principal of Azad Memorial Inter College at Dasna.On the other hand, most private schools are already shut for winter vacations and are likely to open on January 10. But their officials said that they will soon begin with vaccination.“We have requested the education/health departments to start vaccinating children in our school. We plan to vaccinate children of classes 10 and 12 initially so that they can take their second Covaxin dose, well before the start of the board examinations. Thereafter, children from other classes will get their vaccine doses,” said Jyoti Gupta, director of Delhi Public School, Sahibabad.“The member schools of our federation are in touch with the health department and we will be holding camps at different schools in the next few days. For this, we are readying the school premises and also preparing the list of children who are eligible for the vaccination,” said Subhash Jain, president of the Independent Schools Federation of India.The officials of the health department said that they have 100,000 Covaxin doses in stock, which will be used in the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/nearly-13-000-teenagers-get-coronavirus-jab-across-noida-ghaziabad-on-day-1-101641235592258.html
04-01-2022||Mumbai||MLA Nitesh Rane moves HC for pre arrest bail||Mumbai: Nitesh Rane, Member of Legislative Assembly and son of Union minister Narayan Rane, approached the Bombay high court (HC) on Monday seeking anticipatory bail after a lower court rejected his application in an attempt to murder case in Sindhudurg. Maharashtra’s minister of state for home Shambhuraj Desai said last week that the Sindhudurg police was investigating the role of Nitesh Rane in the attack against Shiv Sena functionary Santosh Parab which took place on December 18, as the victim had named the MLA as the person behind the attack. The police have arrested two persons. Rane filed the application through advocate Sangram Desai challenging the Sindhudurg sessions court order of December 30, which stated that as some of the material required for investigating the case was yet to be recovered, and custodial interrogation of Rane and others including confrontation with the arrested accused was required, it was rejecting the anticipatory bail application. Rane’s counsel argued in the sessions court that his client was falsely implicated out of political rivalry. On December 18, Parab, a Sena functionary from Kankavli in Sindhudurg was allegedly assaulted in the backdrop of the Sindhudurg District Cooperative Bank election scheduled for December 30. Parab is a close associate of chairperson Satish Sawant, who was defeated by Nitesh Rane in the 2019 assembly polls for the Kankavali seat.Parab told the police that while he was on his bike on the Kankavli Nardave road at around 11 am, an Innova car without a number plate hit his vehicle. A person alighted from the car and told Parab that since he (Parab) worked for Satish Sawant (a Sena leader), the assailant would ‘deal with him and stabbed Parab in the chest. The complaint stated that Parab heard the assailant tell another occupant in the car to inform Nitesh Rane of the incident. Rane’s counsel submitted that while the police seized vehicles, weapons and mobile handsets from the arrested accused, the evidence on record did not reflect Rane’s participation and his arrest would violate the legislator’s personal liberty. Rane’s counsel stated that the MLA had cooperated with the investigation by giving a written statement when he was served a notice by the police and was also willing to abide by all conditions imposed by the court.The prosecution opposed the application in the lower court stating that Rane was not cooperating with the investigation and had not handed over a few mobile phones in his possession. The prosecution also stated that there was a probability of evidence tampering of data and photographs on his phone of him with one of the arrested accused in a vanity van. The prosecution said that custody of the applicant for investigation in respect of intention and motive of alleged crime was needed. The court was also informed that there was a likelihood of Rane threatening prosecution witnesses and hence his application should be rejected. The application in the HC is yet to come up for hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mla-nitesh-rane-moves-hc-for-pre-arrest-bail-101641235532845.html
04-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi assembly panel fixes responsibility for denial of info for House queries||A Delhi assembly panel has recommended that the administrative secretary or the head of the department should be personally held responsible and proceeded against in all cases where the information sought by the minister for reply to questions in the House is denied as it amounts to breach of privilege and contempt of the House.The Delhi assembly committee of privileges, in a report tabled in the assembly on Monday, said replies to questions related to public order, police and land were not being furnished to the assembly since March 2018, following a communication from the LG office to the services department to not admit queries related to matters under the “reserved” category. According to the Constitution, three key subjects -- public order, police and land - are administered by the LG.Akhilesh Pati Tripathi, chairman of the committee of privileges, said since 2018 answers to dozens of questions on services have not been provided to the House. “It amounts to creating hurdles in the smooth functioning of good governance. All information which is available under RTI must be given to the House. Information on vacancy in different departments is available under RTI, but no answer is given to questions admitted on the same subject in the assembly,” Tripathi said. The report of the committee, seen by HT, stated: “The Committee is of the categorical view that all instances where the information sought by the minister for replying in the House is denied constitute a serious breach of privilege and contempt of House. The Committee recommends that in such cases the concerned administrative Secretary/Head of Department shall be personally held liable and responsible and proceeded against as the House deems fit.” The committee further recommended: “The Committee further recommends that Government of NCT of Delhi should take necessary action in coordination with the Central Government to introduce an amendment in the Parliament in order to legislate or make laws on subject matter related to Public Order, Police, Land of the State list under Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.” The Committee strongly recommended that Delhi government should take appropriate steps to ensure that the replies to the Questions raised by MLAs in the Assembly are duly answered by the department concerned. Saurabh Bharadwaj, member of the committee, said no reply was given to a question related to vigilance department, raised in the House on Monday. “It is wrong. The elected body should know which vigilance cases are being investigated against all officers because we deal with those officers every day. The LG cannot hide the names of the officers against whom vigilance cases are being investigated,” Bharadwaj said. The committee pointed out that the members of the House have been raising questions on subject matters related to public order, police and land and replies to questions on these subject matters were being furnished since inception of the Assembly in 1993. “However, as a covert manner in order to curtail the powers of the Delhi assembly and privileges of the assembly, replies to subject matters noted above are not being provided to the assembly since 2018 in view of the letter (from LG),” the committee stated in its report. The development triggered an uproar in 2018 and assembly Speaker Ram Niwas Goel wrote LG Anil Baijal, requesting him to withdraw the communication. The L-G office had sent a letter to the Assembly on March 19,2018 on the Union law ministry’s advice. Later, the services department wrote to the assembly’s question cell, expressing inability to send replies on services related matters. This had also been communicated by the principal secretary (law) to the assembly secretary on March 19, 2018. A Delhi assembly official said the report is likely to be adopted in the House on Tuesday.Repeated attempts to seek a comment from the LG’s office on the matter did not fructify.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-assembly-panel-fixes-responsibility-for-denial-of-info-for-house-queries-101641235472228.html
04-01-2022||Mumbai||Schools, parents welcome move to shut physical classes||Mumbai The civic body’s decision to shut physical classes for Class 1 to 9 and 11 was welcomed by schools across boards. While several non-state board schools had already decided to push classes into online mode for the next two weeks, state board schools had been receiving frantic calls from concerned parents.“We will go by the BMC directive and move to online classes starting January 4,” said Saba Patel, principal of Anjuman Islam School, Bandra. Most city schools witnessed a dip in attendance as they reopened on Monday morning post Christmas vacation. “Many parents were calling and inquiring about the status of physical/hybrid classes in the last one week. All were concerned about rising Covid cases and we were waiting to receive an official notification from the government before shutting down physical classes,” said the principal of a state board school in Dadar.On the other hand, international schools had already decided to delay reopening of campuses for physical classes by a few days. “Most international schools had anyway decided to postpone physical classes by two weeks, until January 15, to review the Covid situation. The BMC decision has come at the right time and calmed parents as well,” said Kavita Aggarwal, chairperson of Mumbai International Schools’ Association (MISA) and director of D G Khaitan School, Malad. She added that MISA schools have already started online classes for students post Christmas vacation.“We’ve received the order and we plan to go by it, classes will continue online. While the decision is very good, especially taking into consideration the rising cases, it’s surprising that schools have been asked to shut down until end of this month,” said Francis Joseph, from School Leaders Network. In September 2021, state school education minister Varsha Gaikwad had announced physical reopening of classes in hybrid mode for students of Classes 5 to 12 in rural Maharashtra and 8 to 12 in urban areas. In November, Gaikwad announced reopening of schools for Classes 1 to 4 in rural areas and Classes 1 to 7 in cities starting December 15. While state board schools implemented this move in phases, ICSE and CBSE schools were busy conducting end of semester exams and had suggested delaying reopening of physical classes for lower batches until January this year.
04-01-2022||Jaipur||‘Chaape wali sarkar’: Ashok Gehlot amps up attacks on Centre over I-T raids||JAIPUR: Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Monday accused the ruling National Democratic Alliance government at the Centre of misusing agencies and conducting raids to threaten its political rivals. “This is a “chhape wali sarkar” (government that conducts raids),” he said.“The NDA government at the Centre has a tendency to conduct (income tax) raids …such raids were made at my brother’s place. When raids were conducted at the residence of Ajit Pawar in Maharashtra, his sister’s place was also raided, who lives in a two-room flat,” the chief minister told reporters at the Press Club in state capital Jaipur.Ashok Gehlot also accused the BJP of trying to finish the opposition in the country and asked if the Supreme Court should not prioritise the hearing of cases of Pegasus and electoral bonds that, he alleged, are being misused by the government for weakening the opposition.“Should the Supreme Court not decide priorities in issues like Pegasus and electoral bonds? Almost 98% of funding is going to BJP and the rest is going to all other political parties in the country. Political parties are getting ruined,” he said.Asked about reports about Meghalaya governor Satyapal Malik’s purported claim that Union home minister Amit Shah told him that the PM “has lost his mind”, Gehlot said he didn’t think that the home minister could use such language for PM Modi.“I don’t think Amit Shah can use such language for PM. Only two people are ruling the country today. There are just two faces – Modi and Amit Shah. If he has spoken such words, then it is a kind of an understanding,” Gehlot said.The chief minister was dismissive of AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi’s plans to contest assembly polls in Rajasthan, Gehlot said he is a ‘partner’ of the BJP and whatever he speaks, he does it to strengthen the BJP.The chief minister also accused the central government of weakening the state financially and said that the Centre needs to change its policy to strengthen the state.“The revenue collection of the states has reduced because of Covid pandemic and due to wrong policies of the Centre and there is a need for the government of India to change its policy to financially empower states,” he said.Rajasthan’s deputy leader of opposition in the assembly Rajendra Rathore said Gehlot was levelling to hide his government’s failures. Rathod said it is unfortunate that Gehlot was raising questions about misuse of constitutional institutions and the alleged Pegasus espionage case. “Whereas under his (Gehlot) leadership, in the year 2020, by defying Section 5 (2) of the Indian Telegraph Act 1885 and Section 419 (A) of the Indian Telegraph Rules, 1951, the government machinery was misused and the phones of elected representatives were tapped,” he said, referring to the BJP’s phone tapping charges levelled at the state’s Congress government.Rathore said Gehlot has done nothing except to increase his numbers in front of the Delhi high command by making false and baseless statements against the central government, and by calling Rahul Gandhi an ‘intelligent leader’.

The council that comprises members from various departments, including agriculture, mandi parishad and horticulture, also recommended a hike in the MSP for 10 Kharif crops for the 2022-23 marketing season. In the meeting that agriculture minister Surya Pratap Shahi presided over, members unanimously recommended a separate MSP for the ‘Kala Namak’ variety of rice. Currently, MSP applies only to two varieties of rice — grade A and general. “We have urged the Centre to get a survey of the Kala Namak variety done and announce a separate MSP for it accordingly from the next marketing season since it is a popular variety and is grown in more than 12 districts in the state,” a senior agriculture department official, said. “This will help Kala Namak cultivators get a better price,” he pointed out. The council also recommended the fixation of MSP for 10 other crops, including paddy at one and a half times its production cost, which includes labour cost also. “We have taken the production cost for the year 2021-22 into account while recommending the MSP fixation for the coming Kharif marketing season so that farmers get a remunerative price,” the official said. The recommendations will now be sent to the Commission for Agriculture Costs and Prices which will fix the MSP for Kharif crops after it gets recommendations from all the states. Among the 10 crops that come under the MSP in UP, include maize, bajra, soybean, peanut, moong, apart from paddy. Krashak Samridhi Aayog recommends natural farming The Krashak Samridhi Aayog, meanwhile, on Monday, made a strong case for farmers to adopt natural farming to increase their farm income by reducing the input cost and increasing the production. It is the first meeting of the expert body since being created more than four years ago. “There were more than half a dozen items that were discussed in the meeting with the objective of enhancing the income of farmers, but the focus remained on natural farming,” said an official who attended the meeting chaired by chief minister Yogi Adityanath. The CM, according to him, asked the officials to examine all the suggestions received in the meeting and then make an action plan accordingly to encourage farmers to practise natural farming and adopt other progressive ways to increase their income. Natural farming is a chemical-free and traditional farming method. It is considered as agroecology based diversified farming system that integrates crops, trees and livestock with functional biodiversity. Natural farming, it was pointed out in the meeting, would reduce dependency on purchased inputs and help farmers with small holdings from the credit burden.

A few days ago, cyber fraudsters sent a message on her mobile phone using Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC) as a ruse. Seema Das’s daughter dialled the number.The conmen, posing as KBC authorities, asked Seema easy questions and told that she had won ₹25 lakh. The conmen then lured the teacher and made her transfer cash ₹1.50 lakh on some pretext. Later, they again lured the teacher and said she has won more money and made her transfer more cash on different pretexts including GST.In total, the teacher transferred 8.25 lakh in different transactions in the account number given by fraudsters. The teacher approached the cyber police station when she realised that she had been duped.

04-01-2022||Delhi||HC asks authorities for stand on release, rehab of zoo’s lone African elephant||On Monday, the Delhi high court sought to know the authorities’ stand on a plea seeking the release and rehabilitation of African elephant Shankar who has allegedly been alone in captivity at the Delhi zoo since the death of his partner Bombai in 2005. A bench comprising chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh issued notices and sought responses from the Centre, the Delhi government, National Zoological Park, Central Zoo Authority (CZA) and the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) to the petition.The court also directed the authorities to consider a representation preferred by the petitioner in this regard in November last year.The African elephant couple was a gift to former Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma by the Zimbabwe government and they came to India in 1998. But Shankar lost his partner Bombai, named after the wife of Zimbabwe’s ambassador, and has been alone for 16 years now.The plea filed by 16-year-old Nikita Dhawan, founder of Youth For Animals (YFA), said the lone African elephant is a victim of cruelty and viciousness at the hands of caretakers at the zoo, and his present condition is nothing less than illegal imprisonment.Dhawan said it will be a violation of Article 21 of the Constitution if the animal is not rehabilitated in a sanctuary as his mental and physical health is deteriorating day by day.The plea cited a 2009 circular issued by the CZA that banned the exhibition of elephants in zoos, as well as CZA guidelines prohibiting an elephant to be held in solitary confinement for over six months.The petitioner, represented through senior advocate Raj Panjwani, urged the high court to direct authorities to rehabilitate Shankar in a suitable wildlife sanctuary that houses other African elephants, and to ask the CZA to submit a rehabilitation and translocation plan for all captive elephants held in zoos across India in order to implement the 2009 circular.“He is perpetually chained...for 17 hours a day and does not get adequate space to move around… It is also pertinent to highlight that within a 100-metre distance from Shankar’s enclosure, there are multiple railway tracks, due to which there is constant noise and disturbance... These disturbances are also one of the reasons for psychological trauma to Shankar, as elephants are extremely sensitive to sounds,” the plea said.“Shankar is shackled in chains in an enclosure which unforgivingly falls short of the prerequisites of the behemoth elephant coupled with his merciless handling. The cruelty exhibited towards Shankar departs beyond physical in nature and forays into psychological abuse as well,” the plea added.It added Shankar’s solitary confinement and living conditions have engendered deep neurological and mental damage to the animal.The matter will next be heard on March 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-asks-authorities-for-stand-on-release-rehab-of-delhi-zoo-s-lone-african-elephant-101641234392081.html

Speaker Ram Niwas Goel said the committee will submit its report to the assembly within a month.Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Saurabh Bhardwaj moved a proposal for the formation of the committee, which was approved by the House.During a discussion, AAP MLAs slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the municipal corporations, led by the BJP, for not attending to the stray cows that are living in bad conditions and for not opening any new cow shelter.There has been no census on stray cattle in Delhi.Bharadwaj said due to the failure of the MCDs, stray cows are living in poor conditions and are forced to eat from garbage dumps and consume plastic. Bharadwaj alleged that MCDs have not paid NGOs managing gaushalas.Leader of Opposition Ramvir Singh Bidhuri blamed the Delhi government for the bad condition of gaushalas in the Capital. “The AAP government should tell how much land it has given for the gaushalas. It has thousands of acres of panchayat land. The AAP government has neither opened any gaushala nor given any financial assistance, due to which the cows are roaming on the roads,” Bidhuri said.Urban development minister Satyendar Jain alleged that BJP has been ruling the MCDs for 15 years but it has done nothing for the welfare of cows. “Land is under the jurisdiction of the lieutenant governor (L-G), not the Delhi government. Gram Sabha land is under the L-G and the Delhi Development Authority. The Delhi government will give twice the land as compared to what the previous governments have given if the L-G agrees,” Jain stated.He added that the Delhi government gives ₹20 per cow per day to guashalas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-assembly-forms-committee-for-welfare-of-stray-cows-101641234032101.html

At least 2,667 children got their first dose in South-West district, 2,268 children got vaccinated in East Delhi, 2,034 children were vaccinated in New Delhi and 1,956 children got their shots in west Delhi centres.At south Delhi’s vaccination centres, 1,806 teenagers were given the jabs, while the numbers stood at 1,705 in South-East district, 1,532 in Shahdara, 1,394 in North Delhi, and 1,210 in North-West Delhi. Central district saw the fewest jabs administered on Monday, with 739 teenagers getting their first shot.Covaxin was administered at all 159 vaccination centres.Union minister of health and family welfare Mansukh Mandaviya visited the vaccination centre at the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital on Monday to inspect the arrangements. The central government-run Covid hospital had reserved one site exclusively for children, which also had a separate entry and exit in place for children.The minister also interacted with teenagers at the centre, and urged them to encourage their friends and neighbours to get vaccinated.“I visited RML hospital today to take stock of the arrangements made to vaccinate children in the 15-18-year-old age group. I also interacted with these children and asked them to encourage their friends to get their shot as well,” Mandaviya tweeted.Dr Neelam Roy, vaccination centre in-charge at RML, said that the centre had made provisions for 200 online slots, apart from walk-in vaccinations.“We observed children for 30 minutes after being vaccinated to keep an eye out for any adverse impacts. However, today none of the kids that got vaccinated showed any side effects,” said Dr Roy, who also got her daughter vaccinated at the hospital on Monday.At Lok Nayak Hospital, the largest Covid hospital in the Capital, special directions were given to vaccination administrators to clear any doubts and hesitation that children or their guardians might have about the vaccines or the process.“Everything went very smoothly today. Children were excited and parents were also relieved to have their kids protected. Many children were also curious about how the vaccination will protect them,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director, Lok Nayak Hospital.Most children HT spoke to at vaccination centres in the city said the registration and vaccination process was largely free of hiccups.“I was looking forward to vaccinations being opened up for people my age. We have been cooped up inside our houses for nearly two years now, with schools being opened only on-and-off. Online classes have not been very helpful,” said Rishvi Rajvanshi (16), a resident of south Delhi’s Malviya Nagar.Fifteen-year-old Srishti Verma, a resident of east Delhi’s Mayur Vihar Phase 1, and her 17-year-old sister Shreya travelled to the vaccination centre with their mother.“We waited for around 15 minutes to get the shot, and were sent to the observation room. We booked the slot online on Sunday and got the appointment immediately. There was no trouble,” Srishti Verma said.Parents accompanying their children said the vaccination process was a matter of great relief for them.“I cannot tell you how anxious we were to get our children vaccinated, especially after the havoc that the second wave wrecked. We lost my father to the virus in May last year and we have seen what this virus can do. As soon as vaccinations for children were announced, we have been on the lookout for registrations. I am glad that my son and my niece got their first doses,” said Arunima Singh, who was accompanying 15-year-old Niha Singh and her son 17-year-old Dhruv Singh to the Kautilya Sarvodaya School in Greater Kailash.Dr Shikha Srivastava, medical officer at the vaccination centre in the Mayur Vihar Phase 1 Pocket 4, said, “Parents are being asked to wait in the waiting area and only children are being allowed inside the vaccination booths. Children are very motivated. We are specifically asking them if they have eaten something before taking the shot and also if they have any prior medical history or if they are on any medication. As a precaution we have a team of health officials, who are on standby, should any child experience any kind of side-effects. Till 3pm, we had already administered over 300 doses here,” Dr Srivastava said.Delhi government officials said online registrations will remain open and people can get a slot at the nearest centre for a slot between 9am and 5pm.“We are equipped to vaccinate as many as 300,000 children every day. We hope that the count will increase in the coming days,” said a senior official of the Delhi health department.

The statistic is a vital metric to understand the spread of an infection in a region. Experts, including the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend a positivity rate below 5% for two weeks, before an outbreak can be considered under control.Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal will chair the DDMA’s Tuesday meeting, which will be attended by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and top officials and experts. The body is likely to discuss and consult experts on whether the Capital needs more restrictions to check the sharp surge. “The government has been closely monitoring the situation. A decision on imposing more restrictions will be taken only after it is established that they are necessary. Even though the cases have increased and positivity rate has shot up, around 96% hospital beds are still vacant,” said an official who is aware of the matter.Currently, Delhi is under a ‘Yellow Alert’, the first level of restrictions under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap), even as the city has hit the positivity rate requirement for the highest level Red Alert, which mandates a complete lockdown.Under ‘Red Alert’, a complete curfew will be imposed, the Delhi Metro will be closed, only essential private offices will be permitted to open, and malls will be closed. Essential shops will be allowed to operate and only standalone non-essential shops will be allowed to operate between 10am and 6pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-authority-to-meet-on-tuesday-amid-spike-in-covid-cases-101641233792419.html

04-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi Teachers University Bill introduced in assembly session||Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Monday introduced the Delhi Teachers University bill in the assembly that seeks to establish an institution that will offer four-year integrated teacher education programmes. The campus of the Delhi Teachers University is coming up at Bakkarwala in east Delhi, and the government has said that it will enrol 5,000 students starting this year. The university will offer four-year Integrated teacher education programmes such as BA-BEd, BSc-BEd among others. Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio, said the university will focus on preparing quality teachers through world-class exposure and set new standards of teacher education in India. “Delhi Teachers University will focus on preparing teachers of such standard. It will not be just a B.Ed. or any other teacher education institution. It will set new standards in the field of teacher education like IIMs have set standards for management education, IITs for engineering education and AIIMS for medical education,” said Sisodia. He said there was a lack of teachers training institution, and added that the upcoming university will plug this gap. Sisodia said the blueprint of the new university has been made in line with the National Education Policy. He added that the government plans to increase the seats at the university every year. “Here excellent parameters will be created for pre-service as well as in-service teacher training. Along with regular teacher education programmes, a one-year diploma programme will also be introduced for those professionals who have passion for teaching but are not able to pursue it as a profession due to degree restrictions,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-teachers-university-bill-introduced-in-assembly-session-101641233672025.html
04-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi HC sentences sub-inspector to 1-day jail for violating arrest rules||In a first of its kind, the Delhi high court has sentenced a sub-inspector (SI) of the Delhi police to one day imprisonment for not giving proper notice to man before arresting him.The court said that “arrest and incarceration destroys a person and collaterally affects many other innocent relatives”.On December 7, 2021, Justice Najmi Waziri, while holding SI Kuldeep of Maurya enclave police station guilty of contempt, said that it is not only the petitioner, Rakesh Kumar, who had suffered the humiliation and the indignity of being arrested but the ordeal would have affected the reputation of his family i.e. his children, wife and parents.The court, however, said that the sentence would stay in abeyance for two months so as to accord sufficient opportunity to the SI to challenge the order, in case he wanted to challenge it.The judge also imposed a fine of ₹2000 on the SI and said that no amount of explanation to the neighbours or those who may have seen the arrest, would undo the embarrassment and indignity suffered by the petitioner and his relatives.“Subsequent release or acquittal of an innocent is of no solace and offers no reparation to the loss of reputation or for the temporary loss of precious personal liberty. A stigma gets attached to the person who has been taken away, detained and/or put behind bars by the police. R-3 (SI) is deemed to have due knowledge of the rights of a citizen and the procedure prescribed in law,” the court said in its order.The court said that by not giving proper intimation to the petitioner, law has been breached and his personal liberty has been curtailed.“..keeping in mind that R-3 is a serving police officer with Delhi Police, that he has served for seven years and may have a long career ahead of him, R-3 is sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for one day, along with a fine of ₹2,000/-, as well as nominal costs of ₹15,000 for these proceedings, to be paid by him to the petitioner within four weeks,” the court said in the order which was released late Monday evening.The order comes on the plea by Rakesh Kumar, who through his counsel Ajay Kumar Pipaniya, had moved a contempt petition in the high court against the violation of the rules of arrest laid down in the Arnesh Kumar judgment of the Supreme Court.Pipaniya had contended that his client’s was not given any intimation or not served a notice under section 41A by the police for his presence before arresting him on August 23, 2020.On October 28, 2o21, the court had held SI Kuldeep guilty of contempt and said that personal liberty is a natural right of every human being and the liberty of an individual cannot be trifled with.“It can be curtailed by the State only through the procedure prescribed by law. The police officer has acted in clear breach of the constitutional guarantee and the specific orders of the Supreme Court. R-3 is therefore guilty of having committed contempt of court,” the judge had said.The court had also said that ordinarily, while the notice is required to be served personally upon the noticee, it could well have been pasted on the door of the house of the notice, additionally, the notice can be sent through speed post.“Neither of the procedure was adopted by R-3. Admittedly, the so called ‘intimation’ through Whatsapp was not in the aforesaid format. Therefore, the intimation cannot be treated as a notice under Section 41A of the Cr.P.C or of it having been served, as per the procedure laid down. Certainly, the IO (R-3) is in breach of the prescribed procedure as well as the Supreme Court’s direction in Arnesh Kumar,” the judge had said while asking the police inspector to be present in the court.The court, in its order of December 7, ordered the SI to give ₹15000 to the petitioner on account of the legal expenses. The court noted that on mere allegations of criminal breach.It also noted that the SI arrested the petitioner in breach of directions passed by the Supreme Court and the requisite notice was not served upon the petitioner. The judge said that there were mere allegations of criminal breach of trustagainst the petitioner, which entailed a maximum sentence of three years and it did not warrant the arrest of a person in the manner in which it was done.“The petitioner’s own complaints to the police were not responded to. The highhandedness of the police officer, in specific breach of the Supreme Court’s directions is evident,” the court said.The judge also refused to accept the apology of the SI saying that there is no “contrition” in the apology by the SI. And it is a matter of last resort.

In its directive to both government and private schools, the department said that it was imperative for all government, government-aided, and private unaided school students aged 15 to 17 years to get vaccinated on an immediate basis.Also Read| Omicron Delhi’s dominant variant, detected in 81% samples: Health minister JainJyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in Rohini, said the school has approached the government for organising a vaccination camp on school campus on Wednesday. The school has nearly 500 students in classes 9-12 that fall in the eligible category.“We have already sent a letter to parents informing them about the vaccination process. Depending on the response of children, we will increase the duration of the camp,” said Arora.Sudha Acharya, principal of ITL Public School, Dwarka, and the chairperson of the National Progressive School Conference (NPSC) which has 122 Delhi schools as members, said her school will also be conducting the vaccination drive through private and government tie-ups.The school has reached out to the district health department and sought an appointment for vaccination at the nearest Central Government Health Scheme empanelled hospital. This will be followed by a vaccination camp in collaboration with a private hospital. “We will ask all students who have taken admission under the EWS category to get vaccinated at the government hospital in batches of 50 each. Since not everyone would like to pay for the private vaccination camp, they can avail this option. A private hospital will also be holding the camp for our students,” said Acharya.The school has planned a series of webinars for parents and students ahead of the vaccination. “We are holding webinars in collaboration with our parents. Many parents who are doctors will be sharing their insights with other parents so that they are motivated to get their children vaccinated,” said Acharya.Apeejay Schools in Delhi will also be holding a vaccination camp on campus from Thursday. The school has tied up with a private hospital for facilitating the process.

The payment for the vaccination will be directly dealt with by the hospital,” said a representative from Apeejay Schools.Not all schools are conducting vaccination on campus for now. Many said that they had informed parents and shared details about the vaccination centres. “Due to the spike in cases, many parents might not be willing to come to school. Some are also unsure about vaccination and would like to wait and watch before they decide to get children vaccinated.

The National Book Trust (NBT) – the main organiser of the 30th edition of the fair, however, has sent a report to the central government regarding the possibilities of the fair, which included postponing it to April 2021. A senior official of the MoE, said that taking note of the sudden rise in the cases of Omicron variant of Covid-19, the ministry may decide to postpone the book fair. “Though the DDMA, in its advisory, has banned the organisation of only business-to-business events, it’ll not be a wise decision to organise this fair – a business-to-customer event – for safety reasons as thousands of people come to this event every year. The official order in this connection will be issued soon as the options of postponing the event to April this year or organising it as per schedule in virtual mode are under consideration,” he said, requesting anonymity. When contacted, Govind Prasad Sharma, the chairman of NBT, also said that he had apprised the MoE about the bottlenecks in organising the book fair in the present scenario. “We’ve informed the MoE about the risks in organising this fair. Most publishers have expressed their unavailability for this edition of the book fair. We don’t have much time left for the preparations. And, considering the expected heavy footfall, the organisers will never take the risk with the lives of people. The fair is almost cancelled. Now, we are just waiting for the orders from the ministry,” he said. Sharma also said that the New Delhi World Book Fair is one of the most prestigious and largest book events in the Afro-Asian region and has acquired a high reputation among the international publishing industry. “Organised since 1972, the theme for this year was ‘Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav’ - 75 years of Indian Independence. With France as the guest country, a special Children’s Authors’ Corner and Yuva Corner were supposed to attract young talent in this edition,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/centre-likely-to-call-off-30th-new-delhi-world-book-fair-101641233372048.html

It was found that they had left Gaya with their local friend Pawan. Further investigation revealed that Pawan and the suspects were moving toward Agra. One team was immediately rushed for Agra to intercept them but it was learnt that the suspects have moved toward Rajasthan or Gujarat,” a police officer, aware of the details,said.Police said that the two teams then learnt that the suspects were hiding in a village in Gandhi Dham, Kutch, Gujrat. Police conducted raids at a slum cluster there and caught the three suspects -- Prince, Harshu and Javed.“The three confessed that they murdered Prasad because he had refused to lend his jacket to Prince. They said Prasad had even taunted Prince because of which they planned his murder. That evening(December 25), they called him to a place behind U Block and consumed liquor together. They then stabbed him and threw his body in the drain. After their interrogation, we also recovered Prasad’s body on Sunday,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-3-arrested-for-killing-friend-who-denied-to-share-his-jacket-101641233133283.html
04-01-2022||Delhi||BJP’s ‘liquor policy’ blockades jam Delhi||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) staged a ‘chakka jam’ protest against the Delhi government’s new excise policy on Monday by blocking traffic and deflating tyres of DTC buses at several locations resulting in traffic jams across the city that disturbed movement of vehicles on various arterial roads at least till afternoon. According to Delhi Traffic Police, BJP workers blocked traffic at 15 locations, including ITO, Signature bridge, Akshardham, Uttam Nagar, South Extension, ​Uttam Nagar and Chhatarpur. The protest began at 9am and continued for 2-3 hours, the traffic police said, adding that it took them at least four hours to clear the traffic jams triggered by the protest. Around the same time when the protests started, a truck broke down near Safdarjung hospital which added to the chaos between AIIMS and Dhaula Kuan, the officials added. According to Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot, protesters deflated the tyres of at least 86 DTC and cluster buses. The stranded buses hampered the movement of traffic near Akshardham, in Laxmi Nagar, Uttam Nagar and on Noida Link Road. “Of the 86 buses, 39 buses were of the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and 47 cluster scheme vehicles. All of them are getting repaired. Public transport was severely affected on Monday as the passenger demand was very high as it was the first working day of not just the week but also of the new ear. There is no bar on holding protests, but damaging public property and disrupting public service is not the right way to express dissent,” Gahlot said.The BJP, however, said they held a peaceful protest, and their members did not deflate tyres of buses. Adesh Gupta, Delhi BJP chief, said, “Ours was a peaceful protest to raise an important issue to save Delhi. Our workers didn’t deflate tyres of buses.” Gupta, who participated in the protest at Akshardham, along with party workers said, “Arvind Kejriwal is opening alcohol vends in every corner of the city while in Punjab he talks about prohibition. People in residential colonies are opposing it, but the government doesn’t want to listen. We want the government to withdraw this anti-people policy with immediate effect.” Delhi BJP general secretary Harsh Malhotra said, “Taking advantage of the protest by BJP some mischievous elements joined in and indulged in vandalism. BJP’s purpose behind the chakka jam was a pious one, that is to highlight the adverse impact of the new liquor policy, yet if some people have faced problem due to chakka jam we regret the inconvenience caused.” The Delhi Police did not issue an official response on Monday’s protest. However, a senior officer, who asked not to be named, said, “ Many protesters were detained and released at the police station. At most places, the traffic was cleared by 11-12 pm. At some places it took some more time.” Commuters between Gurugram and Delhi were stuck in heavy vehicular congestion on MG Road on Monday morning due to the protest by BJP members in south Delhi. From 9am, vehicles started to slow down near the Delhi-Gurugram border, creating a jam that stretched for several kilometres, Gurugram police said.The police diverted vehicles on the stretch towards DLF Phase 3, connecting Sirhaul plaza on Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway and Faridabad to decongest the route.Vehicular movement was smooth on other routes, the police added.Sunita Verma, an entrepreneur, was stuck in a traffic jam for 35 minutes near Akshardham. “I didn’t know about this protest; I won’t have come to Delhi today. People are anyway suffering a lot due to the Covid pandemic and recently imposed restrictions on public transport by the Delhi government. Such protest shouldn’t be allowed at all, especially now,” said Verma, who had a meeting in central Delhi. At least two DTC buses were stuck on Pusa Road at around noon on Monday because their tyres were deflated. In Uttam Nagar too, a DTC bus was stopped and its tyres deflated. Protesters also took to streets on the Ring Road in South Extension and blocked traffic after which they were removed by police. Many citizens tagged Delhi Police on social media and complained about the traffic chaos in several parts of the city. Until late afternoon, Delhi Police were posting traffic updates on its Twitter handle. AAP MLA Dilip Pandey slammed the BJP for causing inconvenience to the commuters and “playing with the lives of people”, as he claimed that lot of ambulances were stuck in traffic jam due to the protest. “There is place for protest in a democracy. But the way the BJP has created chaos on in the city, it has just exposed the dirty intent of the party. So many patients suffered because of this protest. There were people who registered for Covid vaccination, but couldn’t go. BJP needs to answer for all this,” Pandey said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bjps-liquor-policy-blockades-jam-delhi-101641232952022.html
04-01-2022||Delhi||As pollution improves slightly in Delhi, Met forecasts rain from Tuesday||The Capital breathed marginally cleaner air on Monday, with pollution levels falling out of the ‘severe’ zone, showed data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). With the weather office predicting rain from Tuesday night, air pollution levels are likely to improve further later in the week, the pollution watchdog said.Delhi on Monday recorded a 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) of 387, marginally better than 404 (severe), the previous day, showed CPCB’s 4pm bulletin.Pollution levels are expected to fall even further, predicted the central weather office, on the back of two consecutive western disturbances that are likely to impact the region this week.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said it expects Delhi to receive rain nearly every day from Tuesday night till Saturday.According to RK Jenamani, IMD scientist, the first western disturbance will influence the region from January 3 until January 5, with peak precipitation expected on January 5. The second is expected to influence Delhi from January 6 until January 9, with rain peaking on January 7.“Two back-to-back western disturbances will lead to a cloudy week, which will see rain on almost all days from Tuesday till Saturday. The intensity [of the western disturbances] will be highest on Wednesday and Friday, with rain and gusty winds touching 20-30 km/hr,” said Jenamani, adding that winds in Delhi were now blowing in from the east.“We can also anticipate a sharp drop in temperature on January 5 and 7 during the day, with the maximum hovering around 16-17degrees Celsius. While a high amount of moisture will be added, Delhi will only see shallow fog and a visibility of between 500 and 1,200 metres during this rainy spell,” he added.Delhi recorded shallow fog on Monday morning, with visibility dropping to 500 metres at Safdarjung, and to 600 metres at Palam. The Met department classifies fog as ‘shallow’ when visibility is between 500 and 1000 metres.Temperatures in the city have also picked up under the influence of the western disturbances, with Delhi recording a maximum temperature of 21.5°C on Monday, two notches above normal. The minimum temperature, meanwhile, was 5.4°C — two below normal. While the maximum is expected to touch 22°C on Tuesday, the minimum may rise to 7°C, predicted the weather office.Delhi’s air quality is meanwhile expected to see an improvement only from January 5 onwards, with the AQI remaining in the ‘very poor’ zone for the next 48 hours. “High winds and intermittent rains are likely during January 5 to 8, which is expected to improve AQI significantly through strong dispersion and wet deposition,” said Gufran Beig, founder project director at the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar), a forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/as-pollution-improves-slightly-in-delhi-met-forecasts-rain-from-tuesday-101641232713236.html
04-01-2022||Delhi||12k visit Bharat Darshan Park on New Year's weekend||South Delhi Municipal Corporation’s (SDMC) recently inaugurated Bharat Darshan Park in Punjabi Bagh witnessed about 12,000 visitors and sales of tickets worth over ₹15.4 lakh in the first two days of the new year, data from the municipal corporation shows.The SDMC said according to its estimates, it will be able to recover the input development cost within the first year of operations. The Waste to Wonder Park in Sarai Kale Khan, where replicas of seven wonders of the works have been made using scrap material, was also able to recover the input cost in the first year.Bharat Darshan Park’s daily ticket sales data shows that there were 6,307 visitors on Saturday and 5,276 visitors on Sunday. The park was inaugurated by Union home minister Amit Shah on December 25, 2021. The park opened for the public on December 26. Ticket sales worth around ₹25 lakh have been made so far.Leader of the House Inderjeet Sehrawat said that the civic body has also initiated premium services in the park at the cost of ₹150 per ticket, in exchange for which people can view light shows and automated illumination of the monuments. A regular ticket at the park costs ₹100.A senior civic official said that the shortage of open spaces and lack of recreational spots in the city has led to a growing demand for good quality theme-based public parks. Built at a cost of ₹20 crore, the theme park in Punjabi Bagh is spread over 8.5 acres and features 22 replicas of historical monuments such as Qutub Minar, Taj Mahal, Char Minar, Gateway of India, Konark Temple, Nalanda Stupa, Mysore Palace, Meenakshi Temple, Victoria Memorial, Ajanta and Ellora caves and other key sites. The replicas have been constructed with 350 tonnes of scrap material, such as old vehicles, fans, iron rods, nuts and bolts that were unused/abandoned at the SDMC stores, officials said. The evening illumination in the premium section has been carried out using 755 facade lights, three LED screens, 600 bollard lights, one DJ set and 102 compound lights.While two waste-to-art-based theme parks have already been operationalised by the south corporation featuring replicas of seven wonders of the world and Indian monument in the Capital, the commissioners of east and south MCDs announced in their annual budget speeches that more such parks will come up in the city at places like ITO, Nirman Vihar and Jangpura. The south corporation has plans to develop Bollywood Park and Shaheedi Park, while extending the concept of re-using waste beyond metallic scrap material.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/12k-visit-bharat-darshan-park-on-new-year-s-weekend-101641232531936.html
04-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi may get its first public e-buses in February||Delhi is likely to get its first set of electric buses for mass public transport in February, transport minister Kailash Gahlot said on Monday.“The prototype of the electric buses which have been procured by the Delhi government reached the city on Sunday. If there is no Covid lockdown again, we are hopeful that the first batch of fully electric buses for public transport in Delhi will be rolled out next month. Thereafter, e-buses will be added in batches of about 50 every subsequent month,” Gahlot said.The prototype bus that is expected to be pressed into service from next month is currently being tested by the state transport department and the vehicle manufacturer JBM Auto Limited. The low-floor buses will also be equipped with hydraulic lifts to enable passengers on wheelchair to board the bus. They will also have GPS trackers, panic buttons and CCTV cameras among other features, the minister said.In July 2018, the Delhi government first announced that it would induct 1,000 electric buses into the city fleet, after the Delhi cabinet approved the scheme. At that time, the government claimed that it would be the first city-state to roll out e-buses on such a large scale. Three and a half years later, cities such as Pune, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Ahmedabad and Kolkata already have functional e-buses, but Delhi is yet to kickstart its plan.Gahlot said the first set of e-buses will be flagged off by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. “It will most likely be in the first week of February,” he said. On October 28, HT was the first to report about the Delhi government’s plan to procure only electric buses for public transport in the future.According to the Delhi government’s plan, documents of which were seen by HT, it will procure 2,300 electric buses in the next one and a half years. Of this, 1,300 e-buses will be under the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and the remaining 1,000 will operate under the cluster scheme, for which tenders have been floated.In addition, the government is in the process of procuring 800 new CNG buses, which will be the last batch of CNG buses to be pressed into service by the city administration in the national capital.Delhi currently has a fleet of 6,793 buses, of which 3,760 are run by the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and 3,033 are operated by the Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS) Limited through the state transport department.At their full capacity, including standing passengers, these buses carry about 4.2 million people every day.By 2023-24, the government plans to increase its public bus fleet to 9,568 of which 5,358 will be electric and 4,210 CNG-run.The DTC is planning to build seven exclusive electric bus depots in the first phase with a capacity to park 615 vehicles. These include Mayapuri Depot, Rohini Sector 16, Dichao Kalan, Peeragarhi, Ghazipur depot, Banda Bahadur Marg-1 and Nehru Place depot. The DIMTS, on the other hand, will build the Kushak Nallah depot as a electric bus depot in the first phase with a capacity to accommodate 240 e-buses.Although the number of buses currently operational in Delhi is at an all-time high, ever since the Commonwealth Games in 2010, the increase in population means that the city requires around 11,000 buses for public transport, according to various court orders and studies.Amit Bhatt, executive director (transport), WRI India, said electric vehicles have low operating costs. “Any fuel, even if it’s CNG, accounts for 40% of the operational cost of buses in our cities. With electric buses, the operational cost will come down, and also help in the overall business planning of bus operations. The environmental benefits of e-buses are phenomenal as they have zero emissions and zero carbon footprint,” he said.
04-01-2022||Lucknow||Lakhimpur violence: SIT files chargesheet against 14 accused, including minister’s son||Investigators probing the October 3 Lakhimpur Kheri violence filed a charge sheet against 14 people on Monday, naming the son of junior home minister Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’ as the main accused and citing witness statements to confirm his presence on the spot during the incident.Four farmers and a journalist were allegedly mowed down by the minister’s son, Ashish Mishra, and others during a farm protest in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3. A special investigation team (SIT), which filed the charge sheet on Monday, told the local court last month that it was a “well-planned conspiracy”.The SIT filed the 5,000-page charge sheet in the court of chief judicial magistrate (CJM) Chinta Ram on Monday. It included thousands of pages of case diary, and documentary, scientific, forensic, physical and electronic evidence, said senior prosecution officer (SPO) SP Yadav.“Witnesses in the case confirmed Ashish Mishra’s presence on the spot and the same are part of the case diary,” said Yadav. Mishra had repeatedly denied being present at the spot when violence broke out. The SIT included the statements of 200 witnesses in the charge sheet, and named Ashish Mishra as the main accused.But family members of the victims alleged that the government was protecting the minister by not naming him in the charge sheet.“The SIT is playing at the hands of the government that seems adamant on saving Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’. The minister is the real mastermind of the incident and justice will not be done till the time he is put behind bars,” alleged Sukhwinder Singh, the father of 18-year-old Gurvinder Singh,who was killed on October 3.Amaan Ahmad, who represents the farmers in the case, said they were angered over the omission despite the minister being named in the initial police complaint.“The SUV that mowed down farmers is also registered in Teni’s name. We will appeal in the court for proper investigation into the case,” he said.The violence sparked nationwide condemnation and energised Opposition parties to demand the minister’s resignation, months before high-stakes polls in the crucial state.In the previous winter session of Parliament, several opposition parties disrupted proceedings to demand Ajay Mishra’s removal.The initial complaint into the case only named Ashish Mishra and unknown persons. Subsequent investigation by the SIT identified 12 other accused. In the charge sheet, the SIT added a 14th accused -- Virendra Shukla, a relative of the minister who is yet to be arrested.The 13 accused were charged under sections 147(rioting), 148 (rioting armed with deadly weapons), 149 (unlawful assembly ), 307(attempt to murder), 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt), 302 (murder) and 120B (criminal conspiracy), section 427(mischief causing damage), 34 (acts done with common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), and Section 177 (wilfully disobeying directions) and B177 of the Motor Vehicle Act, said Yadav.The people in jail are Ashish Mishra, Ankit Das who is a relative of the Lucknow-based businessman, his aide Nandan Singh Bisht, his private security guard Latif alias Kaale, and driver Shekhar Bharti, who were said to be present in one of the three SUVs in Mishra’s cavalcade.The SIT filed additional charges under section 3/25 of the Arms Act against Sumit Jaiswal, section 30 of the Arms Act against Ashish Mishra, Ankit Das, Latif alias Kaale and Satyam Tripathi and section 5/27 of the Arms Act against Nandan Singh Bisht, said Yadav.Virendra Shukla’s name was added in the charge sheet under section 201 of the IPC (disappearance of evidence) and he was called to the court on January 10.Four farmers and a journalist died when an SUV owned by Ajay Mishra ran over farmers from behind in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3.In the ensuing violence, three more people — two of whom were Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers and one was the driver of the car — were killed.On December 14, a court in Uttar Pradesh added stringent sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Arms Act, including attempt to murder, to the First Information Report (FIR) after the Special Investigation Team said that incident was “well planned” and “deliberate”.The prosecution urged the court to exclude copies of case diary and some other documents from a list of papers to be disclosed to the accused, said Yadav. It will not be in public interest to do so, he added.Some family members of the farmers killed on October 3 expressed discontent over the charge sheet.“Police officials promised us to ensure that all accused of the incident will be put behind bars. But they are clearly saving the mastermind Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’,” said Jagdeep Singh, son of Nacchhatar Singh, a father killed in the violence.The Opposition criticised the government over the development.“The BJP has a washing machine. After getting washed in this special BJP washing machine, a criminal doesn’t look criminal anymore,” said Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav.“The 5000 page charge sheet is actually a black box of the double engine government of the BJP,” he tweeted.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “The whole country has seen the truth of the 5000-page chargesheet in the form of a video, yet the Modi government is trying to save the accused. India is a witness!”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lakhimpur-violence-sit-files-chargesheet-against-14-accused-including-minister-s-son-101641229411849.html

Over 1.66 lakh children took their first jab on Monday with the start of the inoculation drive for the 15-18 years age group in Uttar Pradesh. The youngsters were being administered only Covaxin. A major chunk of the doses were administered between 11am and 4pm. Over 2,000 vaccination booths were decorated and dedicated for vaccinating children, including 39 in the state capital, according to the health department.By 9 pm, 1,66,304 children had got their first dose of Covaxin in the state, including 3,754 in Lucknow. A few centres, including Lok Bandhu and Balrampur hospitals in Lucknow, carried vaccination till 10pm. These are day and night vaccination centres.Officials said UP had a target of vaccinating 1.40 crore children (Lucknow’s target - 3.2 lakh children). The teenagers showed enthusiasm, unlike the adults when vaccination was started on January 16, 2021, they said. “I am not afraid and feel safe,” said Swarnima, one of the students who arrived at Civil Hospital up for the jab. She spoke to chief minister Yogi Adityanath when he visited the hospital to roll out the vaccination drive for children in 15-18 years age group. Experts said the vaccination drive will help in the fight against Covid-19. “Vaccination for children was a much needed step. Parents of eligible children should make use of this opportunity,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary, General Association of International Doctors. “Children are the most disciplined beneficiaries coming for vaccination. They make smart queues on their own,” said Dr Ajai Shankar Tripathi, chief medical superintendent of Lok Bandhu Hospital, where 320 children were vaccinated. “It was great to be back in school after the winter break. Our campus is organising a Covid vaccination camp, which is good for us,” said Jatinn Khanna, a Class 10 student at CMS (Kanpur Road).Vaibhavi Singh, 16, who took her jab at TB hospital said, “Those who had booked slots earlier and those coming for walk-in facility were in the same queue. I suggest there should be separate queues.” Basti tops chart with 15,491 dosesBasti topped the chart of districts in Uttar Pradesh by administering the maximum (15,491) doses of Covid vaccine (Covaxin) to children in 15-18 age group on Monday. Following Basti was Bulandshahr with 14,436 doses (till 6pm), according to the health department.

04-01-2022||World||Prince Andrew asks to dismiss US sex case, judge to rule 'soon'||Prince Andrew's lawyers pressed a New York judge Tuesday to dismiss a sexual assault lawsuit brought against the British royal, arguing he was protected by a previously confidential settlement that his accuser signed in 2009.Lawyer Andrew Brettler said Virginia Giuffre had "waived her rights" to sue other defendants in relation to alleged sex crimes committed by late disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.Judge Lewis Kaplan did not make an immediate ruling but appeared to express skepticism at Andrew's argument, questioning how a third-party could enforce a secret agreement that it didn't know about.Hour-long oral arguments in the civil action filed by Giuffre -- also a longtime accuser of Epstein's companion, the convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell -- were held via video conference with the public able to listen in by telephone.Giuffre alleges that Epstein lent her out for sex with his wealthy and powerful associates, including to Andrew, an allegation that Queen Elizabeth II's second son has repeatedly and strenuously denied.The deal made public for the first time Monday by a New York court showed that Giuffre agreed to drop a civil claim against Epstein for $500,000.The settlement contained a provision that purports to protect "other potential defendants" from being sued related to alleged sexual abuse committed by Epstein, who killed himself in jail in 2019.Brettler described it as "unambiguous" and argued that it protected the prince from litigation."Miss Giuffre intended to release a broad category of individuals, including royalty, including businessmen," Brettler said."She waived her rights to sue them when she entered into the 2009 release agreement and accepted the money from Mr. Epstein."But the judge said that neither he nor Brettler could "find any meaning at all" in the word "potential.""You'll have a decision pretty soon, but I'm not going to define that further," Kaplan said at the end of the hearing.Giuffre sued the prince for unspecified damages last year, alleging he sexually assaulted her in 2001 when she was 17 and a minor under American law.She says Andrew assaulted her at Epstein's home in New York, and on Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands.Giuffre's lawyer David Boies argued that the Epstein-Giuffre agreement was unrelated to Andrew because it was signed in Florida."Prince Andrew was not subject to jurisdiction," he told judge Kaplan.Giuffre alleges Andrew also sexually abused her at the London home of Maxwell, who last week was found guilty of sex trafficking minors for Epstein.The 61-year-old Andrew has not been criminally charged.Maxwell convictedMaxwell, who introduced Andrew to Epstein in the early 1990s, faces life behind bars after being convicted by New York jurors of five of the six counts she faced following a high-profile month-long trial.Epstein died aged 66 in a Manhattan jail in what New York's coroner ruled was a suicide, after being charged with child sex trafficking.Back in 2008 he was convicted of paying young girls for sexual massages at his Florida mansion but served just 13 months in jail after striking a deal with the state prosecutor at the time.Andrew has rarely been seen in public since he was forced to quit the royal frontline in 2019 for failing to distance himself from Epstein.In a disastrous interview with the BBC that year, Andrew denied Giuffre's claim that they had shared a sweaty dance at a London nightclub, saying that at the time he could not sweat due to a condition related to having fought in the 1982 Falklands War.Last week, Giuffre's lawyers demanded that Andrew hand over medical records proving that he is unable to sweat.Andrew's legal team has accused Giuffre of seeking to profit from a "baseless lawsuit," which is still in its early days.If the case proceeds and Giuffre and Andrew are unable to reach a settlement then it could go before a jury trial, likely in the latter half of this year.On Friday, Kaplan rejected attempts by Andrew's lawyers to halt progression of the suit on the grounds that Giuffre now lives in Australia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-andrew-asks-to-dismiss-us-sex-case-judge-to-rule-soon-101641318881440.html
04-01-2022||World||NATO foreign ministers to hold emergency talks on Ukraine||NATO foreign ministers will hold an emergency video conference on Friday to discuss Russia's military build-up around Ukraine, after a raft of demands from Moscow, the alliance said.Tensions have soared in recent months as the West has warned that the Kremlin could be planning a full-scale invasion of its neighbour after massing some 100,000 troops at the frontier.High-ranking officials from the United States and NATO are set to hold talks with Russia from Sunday after Moscow laid down a list of demands for Washington and the Western military alliance.The Kremlin is insisting NATO must never grant membership for ex-Soviet Ukraine and must roll back its forces near Russia's border.But the West has rejected what it calls a bid by Moscow to dictate the future of independent partners and threatened Moscow with "severe costs" if it launches a fresh incursion into Ukraine.President Joe Biden's administration has sought to reassure wary European allies that it will act in concert with them, dismissing suggestions that it could seek a meeting in Geneva without input from the Europeans.EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell -- who is heading to Ukraine for an official visit -- spoke on Tuesday to NATO boss Jens Stoltenberg ahead of the talks between the alliance and Russia on January 12.Borrell had earlier insisted that the EU must be involved in any talks on European security -- but a statement after the call with Stoltenberg did not repeat the demand.The last meeting of the NATO-Russia Council was held in 2019 and relations between the two former Cold War foes have been frozen amid deep mutual distrust.NATO says it has remained open for dialogue and previously accused Moscow of spurning its invitation to hold fresh talks.Russia seized the Ukrainian region of Crimea in 2014 and is accused of fomenting a bloody conflict in the east of the country that has killed over 13,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nato-foreign-ministers-to-hold-emergency-talks-on-ukraine-101641318008649.html

04-01-2022||World||Prosecutor drops groping charge against former New York Governor Cuomo||Albany's top prosecutor said Tuesday he is dropping a criminal charge accusing former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo of fondling an aide.Albany County District Attorney David Soares' decision comes three days before the Democratic ex-governor was due to answer the misdemeanor charge in court.“While we found the complainant in this case cooperative and credible, after review of all the available evidence, we have concluded that we cannot meet our burden at trial,” Soares said in a statement. He said he was “deeply troubled” by the allegation but was requesting that a complaint that the county sheriff filed in October be dismissed.The criminal complaint accused Cuomo of forcible touching. Soares had suggested the complaint was problematic.The sheriff's complaint did not name the woman, but she has identified herself as Brittany Commisso. She was one of Cuomo's executive assistants before he resigned amid sexual misconduct allegations in August.Commisso “had no control over the filing or prosecution of criminal charges. She had no authority or voice in those decisions,” her lawyer, Brian Premo, said in a statement Monday.“The only thing she has any power over is her resolution to continue to speak the truth and seek justice in an appropriate civil action, which she will do in due course,” he added.There was no immediate comment from Cuomo, who resigned in August.The Times-Union of Albany first reported that the charge would be dropped.Commisso says Cuomo slid his hand up her blouse and grabbed her breast when they were alone in an office at the governor's mansion in Albany in late 2020.Her testimony was included in a report, released in August by state Attorney General Letitia James, that concluded Cuomo sexually harassed 11 women. Cuomo announced his resignation a week after the release of the report, which he has attacked as inaccurate and biased.“I knew, and he knew, too, that that was wrong,” Commisso told investigators for the attorney general's office. “And that I in no way, shape or form invited that, nor did I ask for it. I didn't want it.”Cuomo has vehemently denied groping Commisso.“I would have to lose my mind to do some — such a thing. It would be an act of insanity to touch a woman's breast and make myself vulnerable to a woman for such an accusation,” Cuomo told lawyers investigating sexual harassment accusations for the attorney general, a fellow Democrat.Cuomo attorney Rita Glavin has said that Commisso had an “evolving version” of what happened.In October, Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple's office filed a criminal complaint against Cuomo accusing him of forcible touching in connection with Commisso's allegation.Soares later criticized Apple for “unilaterally and inexplicably” filing a complaint without first consulting with his office. The prosecutor criticized Apple's filing as “potentially defective” in asking a judge to delay Cuomo's arraignment from November to January.Apple has said the court paperwork was processed quickly, before he had a chance to consult with the district attorney. But he said he was confident in the strength of the case.The Associated Press doesn't identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they decide to tell their stories publicly, as Commisso has done in interviews.Several prosecutors around the state launched investigations after the attorney general's report.The development in Albany comes after two prosecutors in the New York City suburbs separately announced that Cuomo would not face criminal charges for allegations involving other women.A Long Island prosecutor announced on Dec. 23 that there would be no charges after a female state trooper on Cuomo's security detail told state investigators that he ran his hand across her abdomen at an event at Belmont Park in September 2019.Five days later, the district attorney in Westchester County announced Cuomo would not face charges stemming from allegations from that same trooper and another woman that the former governor planted unwanted kisses on their cheeks.In both instances, the prosecutors said the allegations were credible, but that they could not pursue criminal charges.On Monday, a lawyer for Cuomo said the Manhattan district attorney's office told him it had closed an investigation into how Cuomo's office handled nursing homes during the coronavirus pandemic. The office declined to comment.The office didn't disclose what it was looking into, but Cuomo faced scrutiny over his administration's reporting of nursing home residents' deaths and over an order that barred the homes from turning away recovering hospital patients because they had Covid-19.Federal prosecutors have also been investigating the nursing home death data issue.The state attorney general, meanwhile, has been investigating Cuomo's use of aides to help craft and promote his pandemic memoir. Cuomo said they volunteered, using their personal time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prosecutor-drops-groping-charge-against-former-new-york-governor-cuomo-101641316819011.html

Intensive care occupancy reached 21.2% on Monday, up from 8% a month ago but less than half the peak of 43% recorded last January.More than 90% of Spaniards over 12 have received a full vaccine course, according to health ministry data, while just under a third of children aged 5-11 have received their first dose since Spain began vaccinating that age group in mid-December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spanish-students-to-go-back-to-school-after-christmas-break-despite-omicron-101641302903454.html

According to the John Hopkins University data, the country logged 1.06 million cases of infections. The tally was almost double the previous record, set just days ago.This comes as the Omicron variant sweeps across the country, leading to exponential growth in the daily infections, cancelled flights, closed schools and offices and overwhelmed hospitals.Here are some of the key points to know about the surge:> Despite the surge in Covid cases, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shortened the isolation period to five days for asymptomatic people who test positive for Covid-19.>The agency has urged people to get a negative test result before venturing out again, officials said.> In the fresh surge, Covid-19 deaths have not soared yet as the spike is mostly driven by the Omicron variant. According to early studies, the Omicron variant spreads faster than earlier strains but causes milder symptoms.> The surge has also put enormous pressure on testing facilities, with holiday travellers waiting in long lines to be tested. Rapid at-home diagnostics are also flying off pharmacy shelves as the infection spreads rapidly in the country.> According to a report by Bloomberg, the actual number of infections might be underreported as Americans are not reporting the results of their at-home tests to the official government authorities.> The massive influx in cases also comes just as millions of students prepare to return to school, leading to a record jump in pediatric Covid-19 hospitalisations.> According to CDC data, an average of 378 children were admitted to hospitals every day with Covid-19 in the week ending on December 28. That's a 66% jump from the previous week, CNN had reported. The number also broke the previous record of 342 average hospitalisations, set during the Delta variant surge, earlier this year.> Most people who are being hospitalised for Covid-19 are unvaccinated against the disease, multiple reports have claimed citing data by hospitals. While the Omicron spreads faster than its previous variants, it is less likely to cause severe symptoms in people who are vaccinated.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/closures-overwhelmed-hospitals-mark-us-record-of-covid-cases-key-things-to-know-101641300121662.html

04-01-2022||World||Italy: Voting for new Italian President to start on Jan 24||Italy’s lower chamber of Parliament on Tuesday set Jan. 24 as the start date to begin voting for a new president, officially kicking off a campaign that is expected to see Premier Mario Draghi and ex-Premier Silvio Berlusconi vie for the prestigious job.The victor, who is chosen by around 1,000 “big electors" among lawmakers and regional representatives, will replace President Sergio Mattarella, whose seven-year term ends Feb. 3. The voting is expected to last several rounds over several days.The Italian presidency has limited powers and is largely ceremonial. But the president plays a key role in resolving political impasses, which aren't uncommon in Italy. And this election comes before a new season of campaigning before the 2023 parliamentary election.During Italy's political crisis last year, Mattarella tapped Draghi to lead a government of national unity to help guide the country through the pandemic and secure European Union funding for Italy’s recovery plan.At his end-of-year news conference, Draghi said he had accomplished what he set out to do, indicating his availability to move into the presidential Quirinale Palace and allow political parties to resume the process of governing.The center-left Democratic Party, which recently has topped polls with around 20% of voters, has voiced strong support for a Draghi presidency, believing that the internationally respected Draghi would send a signal of continued Italian stability and credibility.The center-right, which combined far outpolls the PD, has instead rallied behind Berlusconi, the 85-year-old media mogul and three-time premier. Berlusconi, who faced continuous legal problems during three decades in politics, was acquitted by Italy’s highest court in 2015 of charges he paid for sex with an underage prostitute during infamous “bunga bunga” parties.On Tuesday, Italian news reports said the 5 Star Movement was instead rallying behind a second Mattarella term. There has been no indication that Mattarella, 80, would accept.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-voting-for-new-italian-president-to-start-on-jan-24-101641295756253.html

That move came after the court ruled in 2020 that the law, which had expanded access to single women but excluded gay couples, “disproportionately harmed the right to equality and the right to parenthood” and was unlawful. It gave the government of then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a year to draw up a new law, but parliament failed to meet the deadline.The court said last year that the change in the law would take six months to come into effect, on Jan. 11, to allow the formation of professional guidelines.“Full equality. That is the simple demand and it is the goal of the LGBT struggle, the long struggle of my community,” said Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz, who is openly gay. “Equality before the law and equality of parenthood.”Horowitz said the change in the law would also expand surrogacy to single men and transgender people.Under the previous regulations, Israeli same-sex couples looking to become parents could not engage a surrogate and were often deterred by the additional costs of finding one abroad.The state had argued that the law was intended to protect surrogate mothers but the court ruled that it would be possible to strike a balance that would not discriminate.In contrast with much of the conservative Middle East, Israel is generally tolerant toward its LGBTQ community. Gays serve openly in Israel’s military and parliament, and many popular artists and entertainers are openly gay. Nonetheless, obstacles — including the absence of civil marriage that would allow same-sex marriage — remain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-to-open-surrogacy-to-same-sex-couples-as-of-next-week-101641290727944.html

Feeling so many emotions right now. I knew nothing about the polar world three years ago and it feels so surreal to finally be here. It was tough getting here and I want to thank everybody for their support,” she wrote.“This expedition was always about so much more than me. I want to encourage people to push their boundaries and to believe in themselves, and I want you to be able to do it without being labelled a rebel. I have been told no on many occasions and told to ‘just do the normal thing’, but we create our own normal," Chandi said.She uploaded a live tracking map of her trek and also posted regular blogs of her journey to the snow-capped region.“Day 40 – Finished. Preet has just made history becoming the first woman of colour to complete a solo expedition in Antarctica,” reads the final entry of her blog."You are capable of anything you want. No matter where you are from or where your start line is, everybody starts somewhere. I don’t want to just break the glass ceiling; I want to smash it into a million pieces,” she said.As part of a Medical Regiment in the northwest of England, Chandi’s primary role is to organise and validate training for medics in the Army as Clinical Training Officer.Currently based in London, she is completing her masters degree in Sports and Exercise Medicine, part-time, at Queen Mary’s University in London and had dragged around two large tyres over the past few months for her polar training as a substitute for the heavy sledge she has been dragging along in Antarctica.“It definitely feels colder in the last degree where I’m at higher altitude. I haven’t seen anyone here in the last degree and now I’m 15 nautical miles from the South Pole. I can’t believe I’m almost there,” read her entry from Sunday, a day before her milestone.She also used her time in the cold to think about wedding plans for when she returns to England, having been engaged to Army reservist fiance David Jarman before setting off on her expedition. The couple are expected to be reunited in Chile when she returns from the South Pole later this month.“I read somewhere that when you ask people to be your bridesmaids it’s nice to do it in a special way, so all the way from Antarctica I would love nothing more than for you to be my bridesmaids. Sonia Chandi, Rachel Tucker-Norton, Kamal Dhamrait, Tig Bridge, Hannah Sawford (or Hannah Smith now) and Collette Davey,” Chandi wrote.“I love you all and would love you to be my bridesmaids. I think at least three hen do’s are required. That’s normal right? But even if it’s not normal that’s never been anything to stop me,” she added.Chandi says she has always been keen to push the human body to its limits and sees her latest mission as part of this wider research.As an "endurance athlete", she has run marathons and ultra-marathons and, as an Army officer, completed large-scale exercises and deployments in Nepal, Kenya and most recently a six-month United Nations peacekeeping tour to South Sudan.“Anything ambitious can feel out of reach at the beginning but every bit of training I complete brings me closer to my goal. My training expeditions in Greenland and Norway have helped prepare me and my goal is now in reach,” she declared before setting off for the South Pole in November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/captain-chandi-becomes-first-indian-origin-woman-to-trek-solo-to-south-pole-101641286754052.html

The European Union later raised Lithuania’s claim that China had applied “unannounced sanctions” on its products to the World Trade Organization. China has denied it’s blocking Lithuania’s exports.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a regular press briefing in Beijing he wasn’t aware of the episode, adding: “I can tell you that the Taiwan authorities’ attempt to maintain their space for Taiwan independence activities by dollar diplomacy is doomed to be in vain.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-just-bought-20-000-bottles-of-rum-china-didn-t-want-101641285613294.html

Former Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga stepped down in September after losing voter support for seemingly being out of tune with the public sense of urgency on the virus.The country has more recently enjoyed a respite from the worst of the infections. Yet with boosters still, months away for the bulk of the population, Japan risks a resurgence like those seen in many parts of the world. Just 0.4% of the Japanese population have received a third vaccine dose, according to the prime minister’s office.Japan’s ex-vaccine czar urges faster booster rolloutRestrictions on activities may be introduced if hospitals come under strain, he said, adding he would take a cautious stance on re-introducing “Go-To” subsidies for domestic travel. Depending on symptoms, some of those infected may be supported to recover at home, rather than being admitted to hospital, Kishida said. In November, Kishida reimposed border controls that ban new entries by foreigners due to concerns about omicron. The strictest measures among the Group of Seven advanced nations have helped minimize the number of infections brought in from overseas and bought time for preparation he said. Xenophobia spills into Japan’s Covid-era debate on immigrationJapan posted 673 new coronavirus infections Monday, more than double from a week ago and its highest since October. But the country still has some of the lowest infection numbers in the developed world, while an omicron-fueled wave pushed the U.S. to set a global daily record of coronavirus cases, with more than 1 million people diagnosed on Monday.The premier also said his government would introduce a five-year plan to bolster startups, including providing funding from the public purse. “Japanese capitalism needs new players for the future,” he said at the event held in the coastal city of Ise. Kishida said he had been seeking to arrange to visit U.S. President Joe Biden and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison in the near future, but would instead prioritize virus management at home.

Before officers moved in, some people near the Van Gogh Museum unfurled a banner that read, "Less repression, more care."A group of people in white overalls and white masks held up signs, including one that said: "It's not about a virus, it's about control'' on one side and "Freedom" on the other, reported DW News.The Netherlands is currently in a strict lockdown, which is expected to last until at least mid-January.Despite the rapid spread of the highly contagious omicron variant, coronavirus infection rates in the Netherlands have been gradually decreasing in recent weeks.The cases have been on the decline since the country reintroduced lockdown measures in November, before tightening them further during the holiday season, reported DW News.Meanwhile, more countries in Europe are implementing or considering further measures to contain the Omicron variant as people return to work and school after the holidays.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-protest-covid-measures-in-netherlands-despite-ban-on-gatherings-101641280672967.html

It developed a relatively liberal culture in which mountain sports played a significant role.The skiers and cyclists on the slopes and roads, as well as the thousands of picnickers and sightseers enjoying the natural beauty offered a vision of carefree peace in stark contrast to the violence elsewhere."Band-e-Amir is a tourist location; it has beautiful lakes and pure weather. People enjoy spending time here," Reza said.The area was declared a national park in 2009 and although Bamiyan as a whole remains generally poor and underdeveloped, the tourism that continued during the years of war has left clear signs of prosperity in the little village by the lake.Reza said the 70 to 80 families living in Band-e-Amir village depend entirely on tourism and are already suffering from the slowdown in visitors caused by the pandemic. The economic crisis that followed the Taliban victory has done the rest."This year, due to the change in regime we have not seen any tourists in Band-e-Amir," Reza said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistans-blue-mountain-lakes-deserted-as-tourists-stay-away-101641279832182.html

CNN reported citing latest data from the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that Covid-19 hospitalisations last surpassed 100,000 on September 11, 2021.The CNN report stated that at the moment, nearly three-quarters of hospital beds across the country are full, and one in seven patients are suffering from Covid-19. It added that there have only been 67 days throughout the entire pandemic in the US when over 100,000 people were hospitalised with coronavirus at a time.As far as states are concerned, most hospitalisations are being reported from Ohio, Delaware and New Jersey with over 50 Covid-19 patients admitted for every 100,000 people. Meanwhile, the numbers are lowest in Wyoming and Alaska, with less than 10 coronavirus hospitalisations per 100,000 people, the CNN report added.Also Read | At 37,379 cases, India's Covid tally rises for 7th day; Omicron count at 1,892Furthermore, child hospitalisations due to Covid-19 is also the highest ever in the country, with more than 500 children admitted every day over the week ending December 31, data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated.The CDC data also revealed that overall hospitalisation rates through November are nearly eight times higher for unvaccinated adults and around 10 times higher for unvaccinated kids aged 12-17, according to CNN.Also Read | Can Omicron's ‘immunity’ end Covid-19 pandemic?

The latest figures are nearly double the earlier record of about 590,000 set just four days before, according to Bloomberg.Amid such a massive Covid-19 surge, US doctors are currently struggling to find out the variant of the virus that is affecting every patient who tests positive, meaning whether it's Delta or Omicron.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-hospitalisations-in-us-top-100-000-nearly-8-times-higher-in-unvaccinated-101641266716650.html

Monday’s number is almost double the previous record of about 590,000 set just four days ago in the U.S., which itself was a doubling from the prior week. America’s daily case count on Monday was more than twice the number seen in any other country at any time. The highest number outside the U.S. came during India’s delta surge, when more than 414,000 people were diagnosed on May 7, 2021. The stratospheric numbers being posted in the U.S. come even as many Americans are relying on tests they take at home, with results that aren’t reported to official government authorities. This means that the new record is surely a significant under-estimate.The surging infections have led to canceled flights, closed schools and offices, overwhelmed hospitals, and strangled supply chains. The data from Johns Hopkins University is complete as of midnight eastern time in Baltimore, and delays in reporting over the holidays may have played a role in the rising rates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/setting-a-global-record-us-tops-1-million-covid-19-cases-in-24-hours-101641275264819.html

The emergence of the new variant, which probably originated in Cameroon, as per the study, harbours both substitutions N501Y and E484K in the spike protein. At least 12 cases of the new variant have been reported near Marseilles, and has been linked to travel to the African country Cameroon.Also Watch: New COVID variant IHU with 46 mutations detected in France amid Omicron scare I Explained"The mutation set and phylogenetic position of the genomes obtained here indicate based on our previous definition a new variant we named IHU," the authors of the study said."These data are another example of the unpredictability of the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, and of their introduction in a given geographical area from abroad," they added.The B.1.640.2 has not been spotted in other countries or labelled a variant under investigation by the World Health Organization (WHO).According to a paper posted on medRxiv, the genomes were obtained by next-generation sequencing with Oxford Nanopore Technologies on GridION instruments.“Fourteen amino acid substitutions, including N501Y and E484K, and 9 deletions are located in the spike protein. This genotype pattern led to create a new Pangolin lineage named B.1.640.2, which is a phylogenetic sister group to the old B.1.640 lineage renamed B.1.640.1,” the research paper said.Epidemiologist Eric Feigl-Ding posted a long Twitter thread in which he said that new variants keep emerging but it does not necessarily mean they will be more dangerous. “What makes a variant more well-known and dangerous is its ability to multiply because of the number of mutations it has in relation to the original virus,” he said.“This is when it becomes a "variant of concern" - like Omicron, which is more contagious and more past immunity evasive. It remains to be seen in which category this new variant will fall,” the doctor further said.The Omicron variant was detected in a sample taken from South Africa on November 24 last year. Since then, it has spread to more than 100 countries. In India, it has infected nearly 1,900 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-covid-19-variant-ihu-discovered-in-france-has-more-mutations-than-omicron-101641274969259.html

04-01-2022||World||Capitol riot anniversary: Biden, Trump to address nation at split-screen event||A divided nation will experience an ominous split-screen moment Thursday when President Joe Biden uses the anniversary of the January 6 attack on Congress to warn of threats to US democracy and Donald Trump goes live with his conspiracy theories.One year after a mob of Trump supporters marched on Congress to try and prevent lawmakers from certifying Biden's victory in the presidential election, political wounds remain far from healed.Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will reportedly speak from inside the Capitol, the setting during the unrest of almost unbelievable scenes as Trump supporters fought past police to invade the heart of US democracy.As a veteran politician who came out of retirement to take on what he saw as Trump's authoritarian presidency, Biden has often warned during his first year in the White House of an "existential" threat to political freedoms that until now most Americans took for granted.His speech -- part of a series of events on what Biden's key ally, Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, says will be a "difficult day" -- is set to take that warning to a new level.But while Congress is holding a prayer vigil for what Biden has called "a dark moment," Trump will be giving a press conference from his luxury property in Mar-a-Lago, Florida.His message is likewise easy to predict. Despite losing by more than seven million votes to Biden, and despite losing multiple court challenges around the country, Trump continues to tout wild claims that the 2020 election was stolen.And the accusations are only the most incendiary element of a broader attack against Biden on everything from immigration to Covid-19, all adding up to what looks very much like an as-yet undeclared bid to take back power in 2024.It's a campaign that Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, calls "unprecedented in US history.""No former president has attempted to do so much to discredit his successor and the democratic process," Tobias said.What can Biden do?However ludicrous the election conspiracy theory may be -- one federal judge in Pennsylvania ruled Trump's case "strained" and "speculative" -- it is seen as truth by millions of Americans.Polls consistently show that around 70 percent of Republicans think Biden was elected illegitimately.A new Washington Post-University of Maryland poll puts this number at 58 percent. However, that same poll found that 40 percent of Republicans, compared to 23 percent of Democrats, believe violence against the government is justified sometimes.Fighting what Trump, the master brander, popularizes as "the Steal," has become a political ideology in its own right, with nearly all Republican lawmakers either squirming to avoid criticizing what happened on January 6 -- or actively defending the attack.Lara Brown, director of the Graduate School of Political Management at George Washington University, said the combination of political grifters looking to get into Trump's good books and the masses of voters deluded into believing what they're told amounts to a considerable force."What is so frightful about where we are right now isn't just that these are elite attacks, but they are being fueled by a grass roots movement," she said."It wasn't just far-right win groups who had organized" on January 6, she said. "It was average, everyday Americans who had bought into this whole notion."It's unclear what, if anything, Biden can do to change these dynamics.Political scientist and Democratic pollster Rachel Bitecofer urged Biden to take on Trump more aggressively, rather than stick to pretending that the man Press Secretary Jen Psaki has referred to as "the former guy" no longer matters.Biden "is not commemorating an event that ended. He is commemorating the event that is in process and threatens to get worse," she said."There's a real hesitancy to accept how virulent the right is in coming after democracy here."Brown said, however, that Biden has little room for maneuver, because a direct attack on Trump risks looking like a "political witch hunt" -- exactly what the former president claims in his conspiracy theories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/capitol-riot-anniversary-biden-trump-to-address-nation-at-split-screen-event-101641265059878.html

04-01-2022||World||Can Omicron's ‘immunity’ end Covid-19 pandemic? Experts hint at ‘silver lining’||A string of new studies has confirmed the silver lining of the omicron variant: Even as case numbers soar to records, the numbers of severe cases and hospitalizations have not. The data, some scientists say, signal a new, less worrying chapter of the pandemic.“We’re now in a totally different phase,” said Monica Gandhi, an immunologist at the University of California, San Francisco. “The virus is always going to be with us, but my hope is this variant causes so much immunity that it will quell the pandemic.”The omicron variant was discovered in South Africa just over a month ago, and experts caution that there is still plenty of time for the situation to change. But data from the past week suggest that a combination of widespread immunity and numerous mutations have resulted in a virus that causes far less severe disease than previous iterations.One study out of South Africa found that patients admitted to the hospital there during the omicron-dominated fourth wave of the virus were 73% less likely to have the severe disease than patients admitted during the delta-dominated third wave. “The data is quite solid now that hospitalizations and cases are decoupled,” said Wendy Burgers, an immunologist at the University of Cape Town.Early on, much of the alarm over omicron was due to the variant’s large number of mutations, many of which are on the spike protein, the part of the virus responsible for helping it invade host cells. Those mutations, early data suggested, allowed the virus to easily infect not only unvaccinated people but also to evade antibody responses from both previous infections and vaccines. But the question remained how omicron would fare once it made its way past those first lines of defense.Several factors appear to have made the omicron variant less virulent, or severe, than previous waves of Covid-19. One factor is the virus’ ability to infect the lungs. Covid infections typically start in the nose and spread down the throat. A mild infection doesn’t make it much farther than the upper respiratory tract, but if the virus reaches the lungs, that’s usually when more severe symptoms occur.But five separate studies in the past week suggested that the variant does not infect the lungs as easily as previous variants. In one study, released as an online pre-print by a large consortium of Japanese and American scientists, hamsters and mice infected with omicron experienced far less lung damage and were less likely to die than those infected with previous variants. Another study out of Belgium found similar outcomes in Syrian hamsters, which have been known to experience particularly severe illness with previous iterations of the virus.In Hong Kong, scientists studied a small number of lung tissue samples from patients collected during surgery and found that omicron grew more slowly in those samples than other variants did. Burgers said this change in virulence likely has to do with how the virus’s anatomy changed.“It used to use two different pathways to get into cells, and now because of all the changes to the spike protein, it’s preferring one of those pathways,” she said. “It seems to prefer to infect the upper respiratory tract rather than the lungs.”This, Burgers said, could mean less severe infection, but also more transmissibility as the virus replicates more often in the upper respiratory tract, from which it can more easily spread.While omicron may be good at evading the attacks of antibodies, recent studies have also shown that it has far less success avoiding the second-line defenses of vaccines and prior infections: T-cells and B-cells.T-cells are responsible for attacking a virus once it makes its way into the body’s cells if antibodies fail to prevent infection in the first place. In a recent study by Burgers and colleagues, scientists used white blood cells from Covid patients to show that about 70-80% of the T-cell response is preserved compared with previous strains of the virus. That means that for those who are either vaccinated or had a Covid infection in the past 6 months, it is likely their T-cells can recognize omicron and fight it off relatively quickly. This latest research will need to be followed up with further study. If it holds up to additional scrutiny, it just might explain why current infections appear to be milder than in previous waves of the virus.“When you start to see different kinds of data all pointing in the same direction, you begin to feel more confident that it’s going to hold up,” said Jessica Justman, a Columbia University Medical Center epidemiologist.That said, as cases skyrocket, the absolute number of hospitalizations and deaths will still rise alongside them, even if those numbers tick up more slowly.“When your denominator is very large because many, many people are getting infected, you still wind up having many people going to the hospital who need care,” Justman said.Gandhi, at the University of California, San Francisco, said that while case numbers might be reaching records, she hopes omicron’s combination of high transmissibility and mild infection might signal the beginning of the end. She pointed to another study out last week from Hong Kong, which showed that vaccinated patients infected with omicron generated strong immune responses against other versions of the virus as well. This, she said, might explain why case numbers peaked quickly in South Africa.“I hope this variant creates profound immunity in the population,” she said. “It will hopefully end the pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-omicron-s-immunity-end-covid-19-pandemic-experts-hint-at-silver-lining-101641266639881.html
04-01-2022||World||No way to distinguish Omicron cases from Delta, US doctors in a fix||Amid rising concerns over a fresh surge in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, doctors in the United States are faced with a peculiar conundrum – they have no ready way of determining which variant of the coronavirus a person is carrying. This is especially troublesome because a high-risk patient infected with the Delta variant would greatly benefit from two particular monoclonal antibody treatments, while they would do little to nothing for a patient infected with the new, highly transmissible Omicron variant – which requires a third antibody treatment.Faced with this issue, even federal health authorities are struggling to make decisions for the entire nation in the backdrop of uncertain estimates over the scope of each variant and the extent to which they are dominant in certain regions.Elaborating on the matter, a report by The New York Times states that the two antibody treatments that Delta-infected patients benefit from are the drugs made by Regeneron and Eli Lilly, while patients infected predominantly with the Omicron variant would greatly benefit from the antibody drugs manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology.Now, the problem arises in the fact that there actually is no approved test to determine the coronavirus variant with which each individual is infected: a national network of state and other labs in the US use genome-sequencing tests to track variants broadly in communities. Health authorities then use those “regional estimates” to decide which antibody treatments to use in clinics and hospitals.A system that is based on frail estimates is bound to show cracks, and such is evident in the fact that federal officials on December 23 stopped shipments of the antibody treatments for Delta infections after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that 73 per cent of all Covid-19 cases in the country were arising out of the Omicron variant.However, it soon became clear that there were, in fact, several states in the US where Delta was still dominant, and stopping the Eli Lilly and Regeneron antibody treatments there would be a grave mistake. Later, the CDC revised its national estimate of the Omicron outbreak to 59 per cent, and on December 31, federal officials once again resumed the shipments of all antibody treatments.According to infectious diseases experts and public health professionals quoted by NYT, the results of the genome sequencing used in most public laboratories take nearly a week to arrive – which is often too late to begin the early antibody treatments that have been found to reduce hospitalisations in patients.It is especially difficult to keep up with the pressure in states which have an uneven mix of both variants, thus keeping doctors on the edge about which treatment to use. According to health experts, this puts the United States in a “holding pattern” during which tailoring treatments to patients is going to be “extremely difficult” and in the absence of a rapid, surefire way to identify variants in bulk samples, the issue is only expected to compound in the near future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-way-to-distinguish-omicron-cases-from-delta-us-doctors-in-a-fix-101641260307447.html

But her lawyer, David Boies, says it’s a red herring.“The release is irrelevant to Ms. Giuffre’s claim against Prince Andrew,” said Boies. “The release does not mention Prince Andrew.” The issue will be aired in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday, when U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan hears arguments on Andrew’s motion to dismiss the suit. Giuffre claims the British royal was one of several powerful men to whom Epstein “lent” her for sexual abuse when she was a teenager. Andrew has denied her allegations.A litigation release in the November 2009 deal says it applies to Epstein and “any other person or entity who could have been included as a potential defendant” in the suit Giuffre filed against Epstein in federal court in Florida earlier that year.‘Potential Defendant’Boies said Andrew could not have been a “potential defendant” covered by the settlement, because he wasn’t subject to jurisdiction in Florida and that case involved federal claims of which the British royal wasn’t a part. Andrew was also unaware of the release at the time it was signed, Boies said.The settlement was also raised in a suit by Giuffre against Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz, with whom she also claims she had underage sex. She sued him for defamation in 2019 after he repeatedly denied her claims and called her a liar. Dershowitz, who counter-sued Giuffre for defamation and infliction of emotional distress, also said the 2009 deal barred her claims.The nine-page agreement includes a requirement that the amount of the settlement remain confidential. The parties also agreed that the deal “should not in any way be construed as an admission by Jeffrey Epstein” that he violated any federal or state laws.Epstein’s former longtime girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell was found guilty last week of sex trafficking. While Giuffre didn’t testify in that trial, prosecutors told jurors she was a victim of the couple’s abuse, and she was mentioned by name by two witnesses.Secret SettlementsFederal prosecutors put Epstein’s net worth at more than $500 million and said he had an income of more than $10 million a year when he was arrested in 2019.Epstein, who was found dead in his jail cell before he could go on trial for sex-trafficking, left an estate that included about $194 million in hedge fund and private equity investments, $113 million held in equities and $57 million in cash, according to a court filing.Before he died, Epstein used high-pressure litigation tactics and secret settlements to keep details of his sexual behavior out of the public eye. Some settlements exceeded $1 million, with three women agreeing to drop their suits for a total of $5.5 million. After Epstein died, his estate set up a compensation fund that distributed about $125 million to 135 victims.Maxwell’s lawyers aggressively questioned the women who testified against her about amounts they received in lawsuits and the fund. “Jane” said on the stand that she received $5 million. Prosecutors pointed out that Maxwell received some $30 million from Epstein.  Andrew’s lawyers said in his motion to dismiss Giuffre’s suit that she was looking for “another payday” by accusing “a member of the world’s best known royal family of serious misconduct.”  The case is Giuffre v. Prince Andrew, 21-cv-06702, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jeffrey-epstein-paid-prince-andrew-accuser-500-000-in-secret-settlement-101641254807165.html

More than 900 inmates in various leprosy homes and orphanages in the state will be benefited by this decision,” the CMO said.The move comes days after the organisation asked the central government to freeze its bank accounts following the Union home ministry’s refusal to renew its FCRA licence. Patnaik had responded to reports about the home ministry decision with instructions to district collectors to help out the charity to ensure that no inmate at any shelter or orphanage run by the organisation in the state suffers.“We are grateful to the chief minister for his support and we are indebted to the people of Odisha,” said Sister Stanley Rose of Missionaries of Charity after the CM’s order. Rose said the freezing of bank accounts has not hit the activities of the organisation. “The Almighty will take care of our needs.” Missionaries of Charity runs a leprosy home on the outskirts of Bhubaneswar housing 300 inmates. It also runs 12 orphanages with 600-odd inmates. Besides, there are 87 sisters who look after the day-to-day affairs of these institutions. Odisha BJP spokesperson Sajjan Sharma said the chief minister’s decision may send a wrong message.“The FCRA renewal of Missionaries of Charity was not done due to audit irregularities. Today’s order clearly shows his government would stand for Missionaries of Charity irrespective of its legalities and proprieties. In a federal government, when the Centre takes certain steps, the states should respect it. But the move by Patnaik is against cooperative federalism,” Sharma said.On December 25, the Ministry of Home Affairs said that Missionaries of Charity’s request for renewal of their certification under FCRA was refused, for “not meeting the eligibility conditions under the FCRA, 2010 and Foreign Contribution Regulation Rules (FCRR) 2011”. The registration was originally set to expire on October 31, however, its license was extended till December 31 to give them time to complete the renewal process, due to Covid-19 disruptions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/naveen-patnaik-responds-to-sos-for-missionaries-of-charity-gives-rs-79-lakh-101641317830772.html
04-01-2022||India||Centre permits mining in Hasdeo Arand area in Chhattisgarh||Despite protests by local residents, the environment ministry has permitted further coal mining in 1,136 hectares of land in Chhattisgarh’s Hasdeo Arand, one of the last remaining old growth forests in the country. The forest advisory committee of the ministry on December 23 approved a proposal to extend mining in the Parsa East and Kente Basan (PEKB) block owned by the Rajasthan’s power distribution utility, as coal reserves in the first allotment of 762 hectares was exhausted earlier than estimated. Hasdeo Arand, sitting on rich coal reserves, is one of the largest contiguous stretches of dense forests in central India. It spans 170,000 hectares and has 22 coal blocks underneath it. In October last year, HT had reported that protests by local residents broke out in the region after the ministry granted clearance for stage-II mining in the Parsa coal block in the region. On March 15, 2012, the ministry had granted clearance for mining in around 1,898 hectares of the region in two phases. Mining in phase-I was restricted to 768 hectares over a span of 15 years, considering an annual capacity of 10 million tonnes per annum, according to the clearance. This means that the stage-I mining was to be carried out till 2027. But the project proponent, Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Limited, had on September 9, 2020 applied for an amendment to the 2012 forest clearance, seeking the ministry’s nod for stage-II mining in 2022. The advisory committee referred to a biodiversity report by the Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education that recommended that four contiguous coal blocks in the Gej-Jhink watershed – Tara, Parsa, PEKB and Kente Extension – that are either already open or in advance stage of getting statutory clearances, can be considered for mining with strict environmental safeguards, including appropriate conservation measures for management of surface water and biodiversity. The approvals for coal mining in PEKB in Hasdeo Arand has been widely opposed by environmentalists. PEKB was a “no-go” area for mining as per a 2011 draft report of the environment ministry. The entire issue of ‘Go - No Go’ is before a Group of Ministers (GoM), constituted by the Cabinet Secretariat on February 3, 2011, to consider the environmental and developmental issues relating to coal mining and other developmental projects. However, the project was reconsidered after then environment minister Jairam Ramesh observed that the coal blocks were in the “fringe” and not within the biodiversity rich Hasedo Arand forest and were separated by a well-defined hilly ridge. An expert team from the ministry also visited the site on November 26 to 29 and said that under corporate social responsibility, a number of initiatives in the form of self-employment generation, agriculture, dairy, vermicomposting, women’s empowerment, etc., for uplifting socioeconomic conditions of the people around PEKB block were undertaken. “We have stated all the reasons why approval has been given for phase II mining in a larger forest area,” a member of the advisory committee said on condition of anonymity. “The risks have been considered and studied.” “This decision reflects that the Congress-led state government and the Bharatiya Janata Party led central government are concurring on pushing for mining operations despite several socio-ecological, legal and constitutional irregularities,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at the Centre for Policy Research, a think tank. The mine is owned by Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Limited (RRVUNL) while coal mine developer-cum-operator (MDO) operations have been awarded to Adani Enterprises.Adani Enterprises did not respond to HT’s queries on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-permits-mining-in-hasdeo-arand-area-in-chhattisgarh-101641317164153.html

The fresh surge comes in the backdrop of the detection of the highly transmissible Omicron variant, which is sweeping across the country.India on Tuesday logged as many as 37,379 new Covid-19 cases, which was a spike of 10.75 per cent from the preceding day in the biggest single-day jump since early September.This was the seventh consecutive day when the country saw a rise in the daily Covid cases. On Monday, India logged 33,750 fresh infections.Following Tuesday's figures, the cumulative tally of India has reached 3,49,60,261, according to the data by the Union ministry of health and family welfare. The active caseload has also been pushed to 1,71,830, accounting for 0.49% of the total cases.As many as 124 new fatalities due to Covid-19 were reported in the last 24 hours, taking the death toll in India to 482,017.Meanwhile, the number of cases of the highly transmissible Omicron variant of Covid-19 reached 1,892, with Maharashtra (568) and Delhi (382) being the leading contributors.

Dismissing CJAR’s petition for a judicial probe into the alleged medical college bribery scam involving the then sitting judge of the Allahabad high court, the top court said at the time: “The writ petition is dismissed with cost of ₹25 lakh to be deposited by the petitioner before the Registry of this court within six weeks where after the said amount shall be transferred to Supreme Court Bar Association Advocates’ Welfare Fund.”Hearing the matter on Tuesday, a bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar said: “As the original order was passed by a bench of three judge combination, post this application for consideration of prayer (c) before a three-judge bench.”Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan appeared for the petitioner, and said, “We are not (arguing) on the amount as the same has already been deposited with the court. We are (arguing) on the amount being treated as donation and not penalty as it concerns of reputation of people involved with this movement. It is a small favour but has implication on a large number of persons.”On January 19, 2021, the top court sought the assistance of the attorney general, who appeared during the hearing on Tuesday and supported the application. “What they want is the entire amount of ₹25 lakh be treated as donation. I personally have no objection to the amount being treated as donation.”The bench raised concerns since the word “cost” was part of the December 2017 order, which could be modified only by another bench having minimum three judges. Venugopal supported this view and submitted that the application be sent to a larger bench.Dhavan said, “CJAR is not a society but a platform where there are former judges as well. The word penalty will impose a stigma on people who are part of CJAR.” The NGO’s website names former Supreme Court judge PB Sawant, former Bombay high court judge H Suresh, and senior advocate Shanti Bhushan among its patrons.CJAR has been involved in highlighting acts of judicial impropriety and corruption. As part of that initiative, a petition was filed in the Supreme Court seeking probe against justice SN Shukla, then sitting judge of Allahabad high court, on charges of receiving a bribe to decide a matter in favour of a Lucknow-based medical college.The 2017 top order dismissing the petition termed it “frivolous, without any reasonable basis, and a gross abuse of the process of the court.”The Central Bureau of Investigation later filed charges against officers of the medical college and a retired judge, IM Quddusi, in the matter. A special CBI court took cognisance of the case in July 2019. In July 2019, the then Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi gave permission to federal investigators to register a first information report against justice SN Shukla, who retired on July 17, 2020. CJAR, in its application before the top court, said: “The conspiracy into which the petitioner organisation sought an investigation subsequently led to the arrest and charge-sheeting of a retired high court judge and of the medical college owners and middlemen and the indictment of a sitting high court judge.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-refers-ngo-plea-to-treat-25-lakh-cost-as-donation-to-3-judge-bench-101641316565576.html

The 61-year-old Congress leader represented the Tengnoupal assembly segment in Tengnoupal district that borders Myanmar.The Congress decision was conveyed to Korungthang in a letter from the party in-charge of Manipur, Bhakta Charan Das. In the letter, Das said the party had been receiving reports about his anti-party activities in his constituency over the past month. “AICC has received evidence of your involvement in anti-party activities,. Hence we are forced to take a call on this subject and further remove you from the post of Manipur PCC working president and suspend you from the Congress party,” the letter said.In an official bulletin, Manipur legislative assembly secretary said: “Shri D Korungthang elected from 42-Tengnoupal (ST) Assembly Constituency has resigned his membership from the Manipur Legislative Assembly… “Consequent upon his resignation, 42-Tengnoupal (ST) Assembly Constituency is now lying vacant with effect from Tuesday, the 4th January 2022.”Korungthang hasn’t spelt out his future plans but he is learnt to have told his supporters that he was looking at joining a non-BJP party in the state.Asked, Korungthang said he will make a decision on his next steps soon. For now, he declined to elaborate on his reasons for leaving the Congress.After Korungthang’s exit, the Congress’ strength in the 60-seat assembly has declined to 16.In the 2017 assembly elections, Congress emerged as the single largest party in the state by winning 28 seats out of 60 seats but was not able to form the government. Instead, the BJP, which won 21 seats in the state elections, formed the government with support of four NPP MLAs, four Naga People’s Front MLAs and one MLA each from TMC, Lok Janshakti Party and an Independent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-sacks-manipur-working-president-d-korungthang-after-he-exits-assembly-preps-to-switch-101641316083680.html

In her letter to Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu, Maliwal sought reconstitution of the panel with more than half women MPs."It's sad that the present committee has only one woman amongst 30 men! This is a sensitive matter and shall impact the lives of crores of women. Therefore, it must be decided through a comprehensive and consultative process led by women," the DCW chief’s letter read.At present, Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Sushmita Dev is the only woman member of the parliamentary panel that is tasked to deliberate on the Prohibition on Child Marriage (Amendment) Bill, which seeks to increase the age of legal marriage of women from 18 to 21 years.The bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha by Union minister Smriti Irani during the winter session of Parliament. It was then sent for examination to the 31-member committee, led by senior BJP leader Vinay Sahasrabuddhe.In the letter, Maliwal further wrote about the failure of agencies in implementing existing laws against child marriage and asked for wider consultation and assessment over the same. "The issue of raising the legal marriageable age of women in India is contentious and requires comprehensive assessment and deliberation backed by extensive research, both on the implementation of the existing provisions of law as well as the implications of the proposed amendments," she said.The DCW chief’s letter comes a day after several women MPs expressed their dismay over the inadequate representation in the parliamentary panel examining the proposed law.Shiv Sena leader Priyanka Chaturvedi, a member of the Upper House of Parliament from Maharashtra, has also written to the Rajya Sabha Chairman seeking more participation of women in the discussion. "This is disheartening to note that a bill so pertinent to women and the Indian society will be deliberated upon in a committee where the representation is highly skewed," the Shiv Sena leader’s letter read.Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) leader and Lok Sabha member Kanimozhi took to Twitter to express her displeasure over the matter. "There are a total of 110 female MPs but the govt. chooses to assign a bill that affects every young woman in the country to a panel that has 30 men and only one woman. Men will continue to decide the rights of women. And women will be made mute spectators," she wrote on the microblogging site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dcw-chief-writes-to-naidu-seeking-reconstitution-of-panel-reviewing-marriage-age-bill-101641311508952.html

She’s 18||DEHRADUN: An 18-year-old girl in Uttarakhand’s Rudrapur town has been arrested by Mumbai police in connection with its probe into the ‘Bulli Bai’ app where images of Muslim women were posted in an attempt to “auction” them, a top Uttarakhand police officer said on Tuesday. The app is seen to be a clone of ‘Sulli Deals’ that triggered a similar row last year.She is the second person to have been arrested in connection with the case registered by the Mumbai cyber police on Sunday to investigate the offensive app. Vishal Kumar, 21, a second-year civil engineering student, who was picked up from Bengaluru, was the first. He was formally placed under arrest on Tuesday and remanded in police custody by a judge in Mumbai. His lawyer has denied the charges, insisting that Kumar has been “falsely implicated”.The girl, a class 12 pass-out, has been produced before a local judge in Udham Singh Nagar district who granted transit remand to take her to Mumbai. The police team and the girl are still in Uttarakhand, waiting for female police officers to arrive from Mumbai to escort her, a district police officer said.The girl’s precise role in the case is still unclear. Senior police officers in Mumbai have declined to divulge any details about her alleged role.Uttarakhand police chief Ashok Kumar confirmed the girl’s arrest but underscored that the state police wasn’t part of the team that questioned her.“Uttarakhand police didn’t question the accused as the probe is conducted by the Mumbai police only which is in the know of the case details,” Kumar told HT.“The Uttarakhand police only provided them (Mumbai police) assistance by sending one of our lady constables to arrest the accused as their team was not accompanied by one of their own,” the Uttarakhand police chief said.A senior police officer said the Mumbai police team arrived in Udham Singh Nagar district’s Rudrapur around noon. “They sought assistance from us to arrest her, which we provided. The team then produced her before a local court to get transit remand to take her to Mumbai for interrogation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-girl-arrested-in-bulli-bai-app-case-is-a-class-12-pass-out-she-s-18-101641304446021.html

He said an additional ₹1.5 lakh and a house under the state government’s Life Mission project can also be sanctioned. For those below the poverty line, five cents (100 cents equals an acre) of land and ₹10 lakh compensation will be given. Compensation ranging from ₹25,000 to ₹40,000 will be given for cattle sheds.Vijayan promised jobs in the proposed rail corporation for qualified people affected by the project and said ₹13,000 crore will be set aside for compensation as per the market rates. “The government will be there with people who face losses. ...We have to surge ahead. For this, we need such projects,” said Vijayan, who has maintained the government will not bow to protests.Opposition leader V D Satheesan criticised Vijayan saying he meets only influential people and corporates. “But a majority of the displaced will be common people.”The proposed corridor will pass through 11 districts. Congress, the main Opposition party in the state, and the Bharatiya Janata Party are opposing the project. The ₹69, 941 crore project seeks to connect north Kerala’s Kasaragod and Thiruvananthapuram in the south. It needs 1,383 hectares of land of which 1,383 hectares is private land. The state is planning to fund the project through equity funds, foreign lending, and the railway ministry’s part-funding. The proposed link is estimated to bring down the travel time between Kasaragod and Thiruvananthapuram, covering 529.45km, to four hours from 12 hours. It is expected to be completed by 2025.

Another photo showed the group with four of them holding the national flag and another Tricolour flying high on a flagpole adjacent to a temporary observation post.A PTI report, quoting sources, said the photographs were taken on January 1 in the Galwan Valley.The photographs were also posted by Union law and justice minister Kiren Rijiju on his Twitter action with the caption "brave Indian Army soldiers in Galwan Valley on the occasion of #NewYear2022."On New Year’s day, troops on both sides exchanged sweets and greetings at 10 border points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), including in eastern Ladakh and North Sikkim, which was seen as a warm gesture in the midst of the lingering row in eastern Ladakh.The eastern Ladakh border standoff between the Indian and Chinese militaries erupted on May 5, 2020, following a violent clash in the Pangong lake areas.Both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry.As a result of a series of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides completed the disengagement process last year in the north and south banks of the Pangong lake and in the Gogra area.Each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the sensitive sector.The 13th round of Corps Commander-level military talks in October ended in a stalemate with the Indian Army saying that the "constructive suggestions" made by it were not agreeable to the Chinese side.In their virtual diplomatic talks on November 18, India and China agreed to hold the 14th round of military talks at an early date to achieve the objective of complete disengagement in remaining friction points in eastern Ladakh.It is learnt that the Chinese side is yet to respond to the next round of military talks.The defence ministry on Friday said it held several rounds of military talks with the Chinese side to deescalate the situation in eastern Ladakh without compromising on its stand of 'complete disengagement and immediate restoration of status quo ante.India has been insisting on returning to the status quo that existed before the face-off took place in early May 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/troops-celebrate-new-year-unfurling-tricolour-at-galwan-valley-101641291099449.html

Dr S Chandra, a consultant physician at Delhi’s Helvetia Medical Center, told news agency ANI that the symptoms in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients infected with Omicron mostly seem to be mild and moderate and further get reduced within three to four days.“Omicron will become dominant strain which is not a bad thing considering the fact that its symptoms are less severe,” ANI quoted Chandra as saying.“Symptoms mostly seem to be mild and moderate in Omicron patients. The symptoms are reduced within 3-4 days in such patient,” he added.Amid Covid rise, weekend curfew imposed in Delhi, non-essential movement curbedThe doctor underlined that vaccinated individuals are getting infected because Covid-19 vaccines may not be effective enough against the new variant of concern due to the high number of mutations. He, however, stressed that vaccines held in reducing the severity of the disease. Chandra said that the third Covid wave won’t be as severe as the second wave.“We seem to be at beginning of the third wave. Although cases are rising, the mortality rate is still very low. The third wave won't be as severe as the second wave,” Chandra said, as quoted by ANI.The rapid rise in fresh Covid cases, driven by the highly contagious Omicron variant, prompted the Delhi government to announce a fresh set of curbs in the national capital, including the weekend curfew.

The study, which is yet to be peer-reviewed, suggests that the new virus strain has more mutations than the Omicron variant.Omicron is still new and a lot of research has been going on across the world to understand its behaviour and capacity to infect. So far, 32 mutations have been identified in Omicron, which is believed to be more resistant to existing vaccines.But now, this new strain of lineage B.1.640.2 contains 46 mutations.The IHU was discovered in France on December 10, and since then, the scientists there have been conducting research on it.Here is a list of things known about the new IHU variant so far:• Its presence was first detected by experts at the IHU Mediterranee Infection in Marseille.• It has been linked to travel to Cameroon, a country in Africa. Omicron was also discovered in southern part of Africa on November 24 and rapidly took the world in its grip.• At least 12 cases of the new IHU variant were reported near Marseilles in France early in December. They are believed to be linked to the index case who returned from Cameroon. The research began after the discovery of the cluster.• According to a paper posted on medRxiv, the genomes were obtained by next-generation sequencing with Oxford Nanopore Technologies on GridION instruments. It further said that the mutations have caused 14 amino acid substitutions and 9 amino acid deletions - which are located in the spike protein.• The B.1.640.2 has not been spotted in other countries or labelled a variant under investigation by the World Health Organization (WHO).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-5-big-things-to-know-about-the-new-ihu-variant-101641284585803.html

All these factors indicate that the Omicron wave in South Africa may soon subside”."In view of this, we may see a somewhat similar pattern in India as far as the third wave is concerned."Looking at the behaviour of the Covid infection in the last seven to 10 days in India, I feel that we may be in for a third wave peak very soon," he said.Arora further advised people who are yet to take the vaccine to get themselves jabbed for protection against severe disease and hospitalisation and strictly follow Covid-appropriate behaviour.Also read | Mix and match of Covaxin, Covishield elicits 4 times antibody responseIndia has been reporting a sharp spike in its Covid-19 caseload from the past few days.

After a crew member contracted Covid-19, however, samples of all the passengers were tested. Thereafter, as many as 66 passengers on board tested positive for the viral disease, according to Goa health minister Vishwajit Rane.Govind Pernulkar, manager of operations at JM Baxi and Co, a local ship agent, told the PTI news agency that as many as 27 of the passengers who tested positive refused to get admitted to a Covid-19 facility in Goa.“Only six crew members out of the total 66 who had tested positive were disembarked [in Goa],” he said.After considering the situation, the South Goa district administration ordered that the ship along with all the passengers be sent back to Mumbai, he said, adding that the ship was sent back at 11.30pm on Monday and it is expected to reach Mumbai by Tuesday afternoon“The passengers who were shifted to an isolation facility were also brought back to the ship before it sailed to Mumbai,” Pernulkar said. “The coronavirus positive passengers would be isolated on the ship.”Notably, some of the infected persons who refused to leave the ship were also travelling along with their families, according to the shipping agent. Many of these family members had tested negative for the viral infection, thus leading to conflicting ideas about isolation on the coastal state.The Goa administration is likely to impose a night curfew soon between 11pm and 6am, besides cancelling classes for students of classes VIII to XII.

He added similarly no panchayat samiti chairperson post has been reserved for them.“In 2017 panchayat polls, at least 2,300 posts of sarpanch were reserved for tribals in the 23 districts while 70 posts were marked for us for the posts of panchayat samiti chairpersons. But this time, we have been totally forgotten just to appease the OBC (Other Backward Class) candidates who are numerically more than us,” said Bisi. “This is a violation of Article 243D of the Constitution, which states that seats would have to be reserved for scheduled tribes and scheduled castes in every panchayat in proportion to the population...”Bisi said in the Bolangir district, where tribals account for 21% of the population, not a single post of sarpanch in 317 gram panchayats have been reserved for tribals. He added in 2017, 72 posts were reserved for them. In Patnagarh block, where tribals constitute 32% of the population, no post of sarpanch has been reserved for them.“We would socially boycott (ruling) BJD (Biju Janata Dal) and not allow any leader of the party to enter the villages if our voices are ignored.”Similar protests were organised in Sonepur, Sambalpur, Bargarh, Jharsuguda, Angul, Nuapada, and Balasore districts for retaining the 2017 panchayat polls quota for tribals.“As per the amended Odisha Gram Panchayat Act, no post of sarpanch has to be reserved for tribals. So, to ensure that tribals get 22.8% reservation, we have reserved the posts of ward members in the rest of the districts,” said Gyana Das, director of the panchayati raj department.Kalahandi Adivasi Sangha chief Parakash Majhi accused the government of depriving the tribals of their rightful due. “When (chief minister) Naveen Patnaik came to power in 2000, he did everything possible for tribals by starting several schemes. But in 2022 panchayat polls, the government wants to do OBC politics and thus tribals are no longer required. By making the tribals weaker in the panchayati raj system, whatever gains the tribals made would be nullified.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tribals-protest-against-reduction-in-quota-for-odisha-panchayat-polls-101641273214989.html

Expressing grief, Stalin also ordered ₹10 lakh solatium to the boy’s family from the CM Relief Fund.The accident happened in Narthamalai village on December 30 when a bullet, fired from the Pasumalaipatti shooting range, hit the boy, K Pugazhendi, who was sitting outside his house. He was rushed to the government hospital in Pudukkottai and later shifted to Thanjavur government hospital. The doctors removed the bullet from his cerebrum on the same day and his further treatment was being done in the ICU. However, he succumbed to his injury on Monday.Locals had demanded that the shooting range be shut and the district police order an enquiry into the accident. The Keeranur police registered a case against a CISF personnel under IPC sections 286 (negligence in handling explosive substance) and 338 (causing grievous injuries).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/boy-hit-by-bullet-during-cisf-training-dies-in-tamil-nadu-101641260721105.html
04-01-2022||India||ATMS: Everything about next-gen traffic management system being tested by NHAI||If you are planning a long road trip via expressways, it is advisable to keep all the documents related to your vehicle in order. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is testing a new system, which will tell authorities if a vehicle has valid registration, pollution certificates and other documents.The new system is called Advanced Traffic Management System (ATMS) and all the expressways in the country will soon be integrated into it. It is not only capable of capturing a photo of the number plate of the vehicle, but will also alert the authorities if travellers are not wearing seat belts.The ATMS will be linked to the vehicle database of the transport department (RTOs).Here is everything you need to know about ATMS:• The NHAI is currently testing the system on Delhi-Meerut Expressway, Eastern Peripheral Expressway and some other places.• It will identify those vehicles, which do not have valid papers. The data will be shared with local traffic police for issuing challans.• All this will be made possible by capturing the number plate of a vehicle. This will tell ATMS about the insurance of the vehicle, its age, pollution certificate and CNG kit testing certificate since the system will be linked to RTO database.• According to NHAI officials, this system will help in reducing traffic jams and road accidents. Instead of placing barricades, the traffic policemen will issue challans only to those vehicles which will be flagged by the system.• The challans will be issued without stopping the vehicles. It will be the responsibility of the local traffic police to collect the amount later.• In case of commercial vehicles, the system will also check for valid fitness certificate.• They also said that the technology will help identity those vehicles which have been used in some crime, or been involved in accidents.• The ministry of road transport has made ATMS mandatory on all new expressways and national highways being built. The system is also being installed on existing roads, like the Delhi-Agra expressway.• Initially, the project was meant to make the Fastag experience more seamless by calculating the distance between vehicles. But, in a recent meeting between officials of the road transport ministry and NHAI, some experts suggested to link it with the database of the road transport department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/atms-everything-about-next-gen-traffic-management-system-being-tested-by-nhai-101641259479858.html
04-01-2022||India||LeT operative among 2 killed in encounters in Srinagar||Two terrorists, including a top commander of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), were killed in separate encounters with security forces in Srinagar on Monday, police said.Soon after the encounter near Shalimar Garden here, police identified the 30-year-old LeT commander as Salim Parray, a resident of Hajin in Bandipore district of Jammu and Kashmir.“Srinagar police neutralised dreaded terrorist of proscribed terror outfit LeT Salim Parray,” Inspector General of Police (IGP) Kashmir range, Vijay Kumar said.The IGP added that a second terrorist was also killed in another encounter near Shalimarbagh in Srinagar and he was later identified as Hafiz alias Hamza from Pakistan. “He was involved in killing of two policemen in Bandipora after which he had shifted to Harwan area of Srinagar,” the senior officer said.According to the police, before joining the LeT ranks in 2017, Parray worked as a motor mechanic in Hajin town. In August last year, police had issued a list of wanted commanders and terrorists active in Kashmir and his name also figured in the list, police said. Most of the terrorists from that list have already been killed by forces in different parts of Kashmir, police added.Parray, who was active since the last five years, had managed to escape from several encounters in Hajin and adjoining areas, police said, adding that by the end of 2017, almost entire LeT group active in Hajin was eliminated, except Parray.Whenever any big terrorist-related incident took place in Hajin or neighbouring areas, security forces would try to find Parray’s footprints, a police officer said requesting anonymity.Police said that Parray was involved in killings of several civilians in the area. He also helped foreign terrorists in establishing a base and find hideouts in Hajin and neighbouring areas, police said.Hailing the killing of Parray as a “big success” for the security forces, a senior police officer said, “He was the guiding force for new cadres and foreigners who came to Bandipore, Kupwara, Sopore and Hajin. After his death, things will be difficult for terrorists in Hajin, which was being used as a transit point by terrorists coming from north Kashmir before travelling to central and south Kashmir.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/let-operative-among-2-killed-in-encounters-in-srinagar-101641257402115.html

04-01-2022||India||Two engineers suspended for failing to fix potholes in Bengaluru||The chief commissioner of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) suspended two executive engineers for majorly lagging behind in meeting monthly pothole-filling targets in their divisions. Talking to the media, BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta said on Sunday that apart from the suspensions, four executive engineers have been issued notices over delays in filling potholes.Suspended executive engineer NS Revanna of the Gandhinagar division could meet 9% of the target given. As per the records, out of the 782 potholes, the engineer had filled 67 potholes as of December 28. CM Shivakumar, in-charge executive engineer of the Yelahanka Zone, was able to achieve only 18% of the total target, which led to his suspension. Notices have been issued to executive engineers E Ramakrishnappa of Shivajinagar, H T Mohandas of Byatarayanapura, H S Mahadesh of Bommanahalli, and H V Rayappa Reddy of Dasarahalli. The action came as chief minister Basavraj Bommai on Sunday held a review meeting on the repair works in the city and gave the BBMP a deadline of March 31 to fill potholes on the entire 730 km stretch of roads in Bengaluru. An official, who was privy to the details of the meeting, said the chief minister told the BBMP that repair works were a priority for the government. He added that 150 engineers will be hired on a contract basis, as the number of wards within the BBMP limits has increased from 198 to 243 after delimitation. Following the meeting, revenue minister R Ashoka said the chief minister promised an additional grant of ₹1,500 crore to take up road projects under TenderSURE, a web-based tendering system.Roads stretching at least 2,000 km in the city are damaged or have potholes, according to the state government, which have cost many lives over the years. The revenue minister said on Monday that major roads stretching 1,332 km in the city are damaged because of potholes. Of the 85,791 roads in the over 198 wards in the city, 2653 (or 887 km) are in poor condition by the government’s own admission. On October 7, the Karnataka high court had pulled up the BBMP for its inability to fill potholes in the city. The court directed the civic agency to ensure that filling up of potholes are taken up at the earliest and submit a status report. The bench orally observed, “You see potholes only on Kumara Krupa Road, the road in front of seven ministers’ bungalows, the road towards the high court. But you don’t see potholes of other localities, where the common man lives.” V Ravichandar, an urban expert, said the dug-up roads make Bengaluru look like a “Mohenjo-Daro excavation.” “Anywhere you drive, it is impossible to drive without potholes. It has become kind of a Mohenjo-Daro excavation city which is perpetually dug up,” the urban expert had earlier told HT. Badal Nanjundaswamy, a renowned artist, recreated a simulation of an astronaut walking a crater-filled road in September 2019 that was dubbed “moonwalk”, which became global headlines for bringing to light the basic infrastructure challenges of a city that has been called India’s IT, technology, startup and aerospace capital. Nanjundaswamy has over the years created nearly 50 artworks to get the attention of civic agencies, which include a mermaid in a water-filled pothole, a plastic yet realistic crocodile, a picture of Lord Yama or the god of death according to Hindu mythology painted around an open man-hole, among other pieces of art, that trend online.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-engineers-suspended-for-failing-to-fix-potholes-in-bengaluru-101641236432706.html

04-01-2022||India||North Karnataka outperforms Bengaluru in vaccines for teens||As many as 3.8 lakh children between the age group of 15 to 18 years were vaccinated on Monday in Karnataka. The vaccination drive, however, fell short of the target of 6.38 lakh students set by the state government.As per the government data, 15 districts in Karnataka, including Bengaluru, had reported less than the state’s average of 59%. Haveri district in Karnataka topped the list by administering 273% of the given target. Officials said the case above the given target shows that there was overwhelming support from the parents from this district.The north Karnataka districts, which had a poor record in vaccinating its adults, surpassed other cities in student vaccination. Haveri was followed by Dharwad and Belagavi districts from north Karnataka, while the target for Haveri and Dharwad was at 5,000 students for Monday, the district vaccinated 13,657 and 11,675 students, respectively.In the case of Belagavi, the target was to vaccinate 20,000 students on Monday, but the district was able to administer 44,068 vaccinations, showed the data.

04-01-2022||India||Minister, Congress MP clash on stage in Bommai’s presence||Karnataka information technology minister Ashwath Narayana and Congress MP DK Suresh had a face-off on a stage on Monday with both leaders almost coming to blows. The incident took place in the presence of chief minister Basavaraj Bommai during an event in Ramanagara district. The event was organised by the state government to unveil the statues of Dr B R Ambedkar and Bengaluru founder Kempegowda. The function was also Bommai’s first event in the district after he took over as the chief minister. A senior police officer present at the event, who didn’t want to be named, said the problems began when Congress workers and supporters walked onto the stage where CM Bommai was sitting and raised slogans supporting Shivakumar. They waved black flags as a sign of opposition to the CM before the event started. Police cleared them and the function continued. During his speech, Narayana attacked Congress leaders and listed achievements of the BJP government “Only getting votes, but doing nothing...that’s not what we’re here to do. We’re here to bring development to the people of Ramanagara. We are not people who’ll lay our hands on someone’s land.” He questioned the action of the Congress workers who walked onto the stage and shouted slogans. “Is this how you behave when a chief minister comes? Should you shout like this to ruin the district’s reputation? If you are a man, show it in your work. You create problems by bringing some people to the function. Show what you have done with your work. We did not come here to cheat people; we came here to work.” Bommai signalled Ashwath Narayan to stop making the remarks, but it seemed too late by then, as Suresh, brother of Karnataka Congress chief DK Shivakumar, could be seen walking towards Narayana. Seeing the MP charging towards him, the minister stopped the speech and got into a shouting match with Suresh. Suresh was joined by Congress’ Bangalore Rural MLC S Ravi, who even tried to throw the mike to stop Narayan from speaking. Senior police officers present at the event pulled the two leaders apart. Later, Ashwathnarayan continued his address as Suresh sat in protest on the stage against the minister. “You should have held a meeting with us with regards to today’s programme. We would have welcomed you in a grand manner. BJP has held this programme without informing us. Did RSS teach you this culture?” asked Suresh on the stage. As the commotion continued, Bommai took the mike to assure the crowd that individual egos should not come in the way of respecting Ambedkar and Kempegowda. “I have come here to contribute to development. And development will happen with everybody’s cooperation and not by one individual,” he said, urging not to mix politics with development. The Vokkaliga-dominated Ramanagara district has been a bastion of the Congress and JD(S). Narayana, a Vokkaliga leader, has been trying to help the BJP create a strong base in the district. Reacting to the incident, JD(S) leader and former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy slammed the Congress MP for his action. “The action of the MP was of a goon. For years, Ramanagara was a peaceful city. If during a government function, in the presence of the chief minister, he could do such a thing, what would happen to the common man?” asked Kumaraswamy. Karnataka home minister Araga Jnanendra called the incident a public exhibition of muscle power by the Congress leaders. “I condemn the gross misconduct of the Congress leaders at a function organised by the Ramanagara district administration today, which was attended by the chief minister Basavaraj Bommai and other dignitaries. The Congress leaders’ attempt to manhandle the higher education minister, Dr Ashwath Narayan, in a public meeting is obnoxious and nothing but an attempt to exhibit muscle power. The people of Karnataka will not tolerate this kind of goonda culture,” the home minister said in a statement. DK Shivakumar said that a minister’s arrogance was at display in Ramanagara. “The minister (Ashwath Narayana) has done everything to make sure that his chief minister is humiliated in public and this is part of the conspiracy to bring the chief minister down (by publicly humiliating him). Instead of keeping the decorum, he was hitting his thigh (show of strength) and shouting who is the man… When the chief minister and Anitha (Ramanagara JD(S) MLA) said his (Narayan’s) speech was not right, what more should I say,” said Shivakumar. The incident happened days ahead of a planned march by the Congress in support of the Mekedatu project on the Cauvery river, which the party claims the BJP is trying to stall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/minister-congress-mp-clash-on-stage-in-bommai-s-presence-101641235952255.html
04-01-2022||India||Bar owners lay siege to Tamil Nadu minister’s residence||Alleging irregularities in tenders, for running the bars attached to the state-owned Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation Limited (Tasmac ) outlets, bar owners and workers on Monday laid siege to the house of the minister for electricity, prohibition and excise, V Senthil Balaji.This is the first such complaint against a sitting minister since the DMK formed the government in May. Tasmac has a monopoly over liquor sale — one of the highest revenue making avenues — in the state.The protesters said they were given licence for two years starting from 30 September 2019 to 2021 to collect the bottles and sell eatables in the Tasmac shops or bars located in 38 districts. “During this period, for almost 15 months we had to remain shut due to Covid-19 lockdown. This is our livelihood,” said M Balamurugan, secretary of the Tasmac Bar Owners and Workers’ Welfare Association. We protested in front of the minister’s house as he is doing favouritism in the tender process, he said.The bar owners were not required to pay the licence fee during the lockdown period, however, they were paying rent to owners of bar premises/land.The protesters demanded chief minister M K Stalin’s intervention.Hours after the protest, the minister responded to the allegations in a press conference in Chennai on Monday calling it politically motivated. “Utmost transparency was followed while opening the tenders and announcing the winner,” Balaji said.He said the new regulations were added to the tender document keeping in mind the Covid-19 protocol.In December 2021, a few bar owners had moved the Madras High Court alleging violations in the provisions of Tamil Nadu Transparency in Tenders Act, 1998. The bar owners said they have a private arrangement with the owners of the property where the Tasmac bars attached to the shop are being run and that the state has now floated a fresh tender by advertising it on December 14 and 15.“But after that they didn’t issue tender applications,” said Balamurugan.“It is an attempt to oust the current and old bar owners and members of association from participating in the tender process,” he added.“The applications were given only on December 29 and that’s too short notice.” The tender process was held on December 30 for the contract to be awarded to the highest bidder.In their court petition, the bar owners also submitted that they have invested in developing the bar facility and therefore the petitioners should be given the opportunity to run/operate on the bar premises.Opposing this, the standing counsel for the respondents submitted that the tender forms are available on the website. “In any event, these forms will be given to all the existing licence holders whose licences are currently valid,” the state had told the court on December 22. The court had then ordered that the state can award the contract to successful bidders on December 30 who produce a no objection certificate from the property owner. The hearing was listed for January 3 but the state sought more time to respond.Balamurugan who runs four TASMAC shops with his partners in Thiruvallur alleged that there was no tender box kept in his district as well as in Chennai on December 30.“When we questioned the same, we did not get any response. But tenders boxes were present in other districts and they opened the boxes the next day which is against the rules,” he said.However, Balaji said,“The allegations are not true. The tender awards went on smoothly and no one raised any objection during the process. We followed the due process. Can anyone say their tender documents were rejected? Can anyone say they were not allowed inside the hall where the process was on?”
04-01-2022||India||Hate speech not part of our culture: Naidu||Hate speech and writings are against the country’s culture and constitutional ethos and secularism is in the blood of every countryman, said Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu in Kottayam on Monday. Addressing the 150th death anniversary of Saint Kuriakose Elias Chavara, an 18th-century social reformer and spiritual leader of Catholics, he said India is respected across the world for its unique culture, heritage and secularism. “Every person has the right to practice and preach faith in the country. Practice your religion but don’t abuse and indulge in hate speech and writings. They are against our culture and tradition,” he said. He asked religious bodies and other institutions to “inculcate the true Indian value system and among the new generation.” He also urged youngsters to imbibe, protect and promote the country’s cultural values and highlighted the importance of the philosophy of sharing and caring for others. “Living for others will not only give a person a lot of satisfaction but will also make the people remember that person for a long time for his or her good deeds,’’ he said. “Chavara had a passion for learning and reading. He was a scholar in several languages, including Sanskrit, English and Portuguese. He treated literature as a powerful means of energising people and his writings are rich in poetic flavour replete with profound spiritual and mystical insights,” Naidu said, adding that the country needs more such spiritual leaders. He said the saint combined the spirit of the renaissance with the mission of charity and the noble Christian concept of universal brotherhood. The vice president also said there is a dire need to inculcate the spirit of service from a young age. “Once this (Covid) pandemic is behind us and normalcy returns, I would suggest that government schools, as well as those in the private sector, must make community service of at least two to three weeks compulsory for students. It would help them to develop an attitude of sharing and caring in their interaction with others,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hate-speech-not-part-of-our-culture-naidu-101641235534200.html

He said the state had suffered heavily post bifurcation of the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh.“While Andhra Pradesh had 58 per cent of the combined state’s population, it could get only 45 per cent of the revenue. The state’s per capita income is only ₹8,979 as against ₹15,454 of Telangana as per 2015-16 estimates. This is just an indicator of the state’s financial position,” he said in a statement.The chief minister explained how his government was compelled to go in for borrowings to implement the welfare schemes. He said the Centre had originally fixed the net borrowing ceiling (NBC) for the financial year 2021-22 at ₹42,472 crores as per the Fiscal Responsibility and Budgetary Management (FRBM) norms.“The Department of Expenditure of the Union ministry of finance subsequently informed us that ₹17,923.24 crores were to be adjusted against the NBC fixed for this year on account of the so-called over-borrowing of the state during earlier years of the previous government in the state,” he said.Jagan clarified that the over-drawl was only borrowing and not a grant and the borrowing was also being serviced without any default. He requested the prime minister that the state’s NBC be restored to its original level of ₹42,472 crores.The chief minister brought to the prime minister’s notice that the total revenue deficit of the state for 2014-15 financial year ₹22,948.76 crore and the amount released to the state was only ₹4,117.89 crore. He requested that the remaining portion of ₹18,830.87 crores be released at the earliest, to support the state during this hour of need.According to the CMO release, Jagan also requested Modi to approve the revised cost estimates of Polavaram major irrigation project being built on Godavari river at ₹55,657 crores at 2017-18 price level, which includes drinking water component of ₹4,000 crores and that the Centre also release the pending payments of ₹2,100 crores already incurred by the state government towards Polavaram project.Regarding the dispute with the Telangana government over payment of dues of ₹6,284 crores to Andhra Pradesh Generation Corporation Limited (APGENCO), Jagan urged the Prime Minister to direct Telangana to settle these dues at the earliest.The chief minister urged the Centre to renew the approvals of site clearances for greenfield international airport at Bhogapuram. Regarding setting up an Integrated Steel Plant in YSR Kadapa District, he said MECON, a Government of India undertaking has not yet concluded its report as to the feasibility of the integrated steel plant and urged the Prime Minister to direct the concerned officials to expedite it.Later, Jagan called on Union finance minister Nirmala Sitaraman and discussed the issues related to the state.
04-01-2022||India||Kerala assault case: Actor writes to CM, seeks speedy justice||A week after prosecution sought a new probe into the actor assault case following fresh revelations of a film director, the victim Monday wrote to chief minister (CM) Pinarayi Vijayan and state police chief Anil Kant requesting them to take appropriate steps to ensure speedy justice to her. The four-year-old sensational case took a new turn two weeks back after director Balachandra Kumar told a news channel that he met the prime accused Pular Suni at actor Dileep’s residence in 2016 and claimed that the latter had a video clipping of the assault. Last week public prosecutor V N Anil Kumar had submitted his resignation to the government. He is the second prosecutor to resign from the post. In her letter, the victim expressed concern over the inordinate delay in trial and requested them to speed it up after taking new aspects into consideration. She also sought immediate appointment of a new prosecutor. She also said fresh allegations raised by the director should be probed. The case took place in 2017 when the actor was returning after a shooting assignment in Kochi. She was allegedly abducted and sexually assaulted in a moving car by a criminal gang. There were 10 accused in the case. The accused filmed the entire incident and let her go after three-hour ordeal while threatening to release the video if she approached the police. During the assault, accused Suni had reportedly told the victim that he was given a contract to execute the crime. A day after the incident, the actor filed a police complaint and all the accused directly involved in the crime were arrested. Since speculations were rife that the accused had carried out the assault at the behest of someone, six months after the case, a special team had arrested actor Dlieep and he spent three months in jail. The case witnessed many twists since then as several witnesses turned hostile and at one point, the state government said Dileep was filing unnecessary pleas in different courts to delay the trial. In November last year, the Supreme Court had directed the special court, headed by a woman judge, to complete the trial in six months. But it was delayed due to the pandemic outbreak and the time period was extended by of six months. Meanwhile, last Tuesday, Kerala High Court admitted a state government plea seeking to examine more witnesses in the case. On December 21, the trial court had rejected the fresh demand of the prosecution forcing it to move the high court which sent notices to all the respondents in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-assault-case-actor-writes-to-cm-seeks-speedy-justice-101641235412250.html
04-01-2022||India||Telangana BJP chief sent to judicial custody for violating state Covid curbs||A local court in Telangana’s Karimnagar district on Monday remanded Bharatiya Janata Party state unit president Bandi Sanjay to 14-day judicial custody for allegedly violating Covid-19 protocol after he organised a “Jagran Deeksha” (night-long protest) at his party office on Sunday night.Apart from Sanjay, four other BJP activists were also sent to the two-week judicial remand. They were shifted to Karimnagar Central Jail after due medical examination, a police official said on Monday.The Karimnagar police arrested Sanjay and others at the party office in the town after a three-hour-long high drama and violent protests by the BJP activists, who resisted police entry into the premises to disrupt the Jagran Deeksha.The BJP leader, who represents Karimnagar Lok Sabha constituency, took up the protests demanding that the Telangana Rashtra Samithi government revoke the controversial government order (GO No. 317) on the arbitrary transfers of teachers and employees.The police booked Sanjay under Sections 147 (rioting), 188 (disobeying the law), 341 (wrongful restraint), 332 (injuring a public servant) R/W 149 (unlawful assembly) of the Indian Penal Code, besides Section 51 (b) of Disaster Management Act and Section 3 of Prevention of Damage to Public Property (PDPP) Act.Apart from Sanjay, 16 BJP activists were also booked under similar cases, of which 11 activists were shown as absconding, the police said.After keeping Sanjay at Manakondur police station throughout the night, the police shifted him to the police training centre in Karimnagar town on Monday morning, from where he was taken to the court, which rejected his bail petition, an official said.In their remand report, the police said Sanjay and others had resorted to unlawful assembly, violating the orders of the state government on preventive measures being taken for the Covid-19 pandemic.“Hundreds of party leaders and workers gathered at the party office and wrongfully restrained the public. When the police requested them to obey the government orders and guidelines of the high court, they assaulted the police with bottles and sticks, causing severe injuries to some policemen. They also damaged the police van and prevented the police from discharging their duties, forcing the latter to arrest them,” the police said in the remand report.The arrest of Sanjay and his judicial remand evoked strong protests from the BJP leaders across the country. BJP national president J P Nadda strongly condemned the ‘inhuman’ manner in which the Telangana government, led by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, beat up Sanjay, lathi-charged the workers and arrested them.“It is very sad and highly condemnable. This is nothing but the murder of democracy. We strongly condemn this malicious attempt,” Nadda said.Senior Telangana BJP leader and Union minister for tourism G Kishan Reddy described the arrests as a largescale conspiracy by the TRS government to stifle the voice of dissent in the democracy.“The enlightened people of Telangana are closely watching the inhuman acts of the TRS government. They would reach a fitting lesson to it at the right time. The BJP will never be scared of such illegal arrests and false cases,” Reddy said at a press conference in New Delhi.Senior BJP leaders, including party national vice-president D K Aruna, OBC Morcha national president Dr K Laxman, BJP MLAs T Raja Singh, M Raghunandan Rao and Eatala Rajender and other senior office-bearers met at the party office in Hyderabad in the evening to decide the future course of action, an official aware of the developments said.“From tomorrow, we have decided to launch state-wide protests condemning the police atrocities and anti-democratic activities of the Telangana government,” BJP state vice president G Manohar Reddy said.Meanwhile, Sanjay wrote a letter to Union home minister Amit Shah, BJP national president J P Nadda and Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla alleging that the TRS government was behaving undemocratically and stern action be taken against the police responsible for his ill-treatment.Senior TRS leader and state minister for civil supplies Gangula Kamalakar described Sanjay’s Jagran Deeksha as a big drama. “He was arrested by the police for violating the Central government guidelines on Covid-19. If he has any concern for the people. he should stage a deeksha before the Prime Minister’s Office in Delhi for not filling up the one crore jobs as promised by Modi in the past,” he said.

Randhawa’s statement came as Sidhu has been questioning his party’s government in the state for not being able to arrest Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia, who has been booked in a drug case under the NDPS Act. Sidhu had said nothing would happen with the registration of an FIR against the Akali leader, saying he would not rest till Majithia was arrested. “If my brother (Sidhu) says that he wants the home ministry, then I will immediately put it at his feet,” said Randhawa while talking to reporters here. Ever since he became the home minister, Sidhu has been upset with him, added Randhawa. The Punjab deputy chief minister also denied the allegation that the state government did not want to arrest Majithia. He said Majithia is not in Punjab and he is not carrying his mobile phone. If he is spotted anywhere here, then Majithia will be arrested within a second, he said as he dubbed as fake some photos of the Akali leader, which showed him at the Golden Temple complex. Randhawa said Majithia is also not abroad as a lookout circular, which prevents a person from leaving the country, had been issued against him. Majithia has been booked under non-bailable provisions of the NDPS Act, the minister said. Randhawa said no security person was accompanying Majithia. “He is alone and not carrying his mobile phone,” said Randhawa. Majithia is absconding, he said. Asked if he is facing any sort of pressure, Randhawa denied it and said had there been any pressure, how could an FIR be registered against Majithia. Randhawa said raids are being conducted to arrest him. Randhawa also slammed AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal for calling the registration of the case against Majithia as “weak”. Replying to Kejriwal’s charge of the Congress being “hand in glove” with the Badals, Randhawa said it was the Delhi chief minister who had sought an apology from Majithia in a defamation case. Majithia was booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act on the basis of a 2018 report of a probe into a drug racket in the state. Majithia is the brother-in-law of Shiromani Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal and brother of former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal. Besides Sidhu, the Aam Aadmi Party has been attacking the Charanjit Singh Channi-led government for not being able to arrest Majithia despite several days passing since the registration of the FIR. AAP leader Raghav Chadha on Sunday had alleged that the Channi government did not want to arrest Majithia as there was a “setting” between it and the Badals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ready-to-give-up-home-ministry-if-sidhu-wants-it-says-punjab-deputy-cm-101641235052142.html
04-01-2022||India||Home minister Amit Shah holds high-level security meet||Union home minister Amit Shah on Monday held a high-level meeting with the chiefs of country’s security agencies and intelligence wings of armed forces during which several issues including threats from global terror organisations, terror-financing and illicit use of cyberspace were discussed, according to a home ministry statement.The MHA statement said the “home minister conducted a high-level security meeting to review the prevailing threat scenario in the country and the emerging security challenges”.The statement said that during the meeting, Shah highlighted the continued threat of terrorism and global terror groups, terror financing, narco-terrorism, organised crime-terror nexus, illicit use of cyberspace, movement of foreign terrorist fighters. The home minister stressed on the need for better coordination and synergy among the central and state security agencies in countering the ever-changing counter terrorism and security challenges, it said.The heads of security agencies of the country, prominent central intelligence agencies, Central Armed Police Forces, intelligence wings of armed forces, revenue and financial intelligence agencies attended the meeting, the statement said.Police chiefs of states and Union Territories also joined the meeting through video conferencing, it added.The meeting is significant in the wake of inputs that Pakistan-based terror organisations; particularly Khalistani outfits may target various cities ahead of assembly elections in five states -- Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Manipur and Goa.A bomb exploded inside the district court complex in Ludhiana on December 23 killing one person and injuring six others. Police had said the terror attack was carried out at the behest of Germany-based Jaswinder Singh Multani of Sikhs for Justice (SFJ). German authorities have detained Multani while the NIA has registered a case to investigate a larger conspiracy by SFJ to carry out attacks in Indian cities.People familiar with the development said security forces have been asked to stay alert ahead of elections.Last week, the home minister chaired a high-level meeting of Narco Coordination Centre (NCORD) in which he directed the concerned authorities to arrange container scanners and related equipment for scanning of incoming and outgoing containers at all ports, private and government , people familiar with the development said.He had also instructed the agencies to develop a narco-canine pool at the national level. He asked the federal drugs enforcement agency Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) to make a policy in coordination with the National Security Guard (NSG) under which states’ police will have access to a facility of canine squad that can be used for detecting drugs consignments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shah-holds-high-level-security-meet-101641234993224.html
04-01-2022||India||Centre seeks urgent hearing of pleas opposing EWS, OBC reservation in Neet-PG||The Centre approached the Supreme Court on Monday for an urgent hearing on petitions challenging the implementation of reservation for other backward classes (OBC) and economically weaker sections (EWS) in the all-India quota NEET undergraduate and post-graduate seats.After the court raised questions in October last year on the criteria adopted to give reservation to EWS based on a uniform annual income cap of ₹8 lakh, the Centre had put counselling for NEET seats on hold and constituted a committee to revisit the formula.The committee’s report formed part of an affidavit submitted by the Centre on January 1 before the top court that was supposed to take up the matter for hearing on January 6. On Monday, solicitor general Tushar Mehta appeared before a bench headed by justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and requested the court to advance the hearing from January 6 to Tuesday, January 4.“There is some urgency. Please have it tomorrow,” Mehta said.The bench agreed to consider Mehta’s request but justice Chandrachud pointed out that besides him, the other two judges – justices Surya Kant and Vikram Nath – are part of separate benches. An order to constitute the bench at short notice can be passed only by the chief justice of India (CJI) on the administrative side.“I will have a word with the CJI and see if a special bench can be constituted,” justice Chandrachud said. Till late in the evening, the matter was not on the list of business issued for Tuesday.Mehta said, “There is genuine urgency”, though he did not specify the reason. However, the context was understandable, given the recent strike by resident doctors upset over the counselling being put on hold. After the Centre intervened and assured the striking doctors it would resolve the matter by January 6, their federation withdrew the stir and decided to hold a meeting on Thursday.Senior advocate Arvind Datar, appearing for some of the petitioners, was permitted by the court to file a reply to the Centre’s affidavit.A bunch of petitions challenged a July 29, 2021 notification by the Centre introducing 27% OBC quota and 10% EWS quota in the NEET all-India quota seats. The petitions had raised constitutional and legal challenges to the July 29 order on the grounds that it exceeds the 50% benchmark and provides 10% EWS seats to those belonging to forward castes who earn below ₹8 lakh per annum which is applied uniformly across states, regardless of the rural or urban divide. In addition, those families possessing five acres or more of agricultural land also stood excluded.The three-member committee, after revisiting the criteria put out by the Centre on January 17, 2019, concluded that the ₹8 lakh limit is not “over-inclusive” and upheld the condition on agricultural land. However, it omitted the residential asset criterion prescribed by the January 2019 notification.The panel recommended that its recommendation be implemented from the next admission or advertisement cycle. Till then, it recommended that the existing criteria applicable for EWS reservation be followed. The Centre accepted all recommendations of the committee and informed the same of the court in its affidavit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-seeks-urgent-hearing-of-pleas-opposing-ews-obc-reservation-in-neetpg-101641234753695.html
04-01-2022||India||SC denies appeal against protection from arrest to Suvendu Adhikari||Bharatiya Janata Party leader Suvendu Adhikari, leader of the opposition in West Bengal, will continue to be protected against arrest, as the Supreme Court on Monday refused to interfere with the Calcutta high court’s order in connection with criminal cases lodged against him.A single-judge bench of the high court had on September 6 granted an interim stay on any coercive action against Adhikari in connection with criminal cases registered against him after he crossed over from the ruling Trinamool Congress party to the BJP. The West Bengal government had challenged the stay before a division bench of the high court, which upheld the stay. The state government then approached the apex court. Adhikari had approached the high court seeking stay of arrest in seven criminal cases lodged against him in the state. He had claimed that the criminal cases were the result of “regime revenge” because he had defected to the BJP in the state ruled by the TMC. One case pertained to a theft of ₹5,000 and a gold chain, while another related to theft of tarpaulin sheets at the behest of Adhikari. Even an old case of an alleged suicide of Adhikari’s personal security officer was sought to be reinvestigated on a complaint by the widow of the deceased, who alleged murder.This was the second case coming up against the same order, a bench of justices DY Chandrachud and AS Bopanna observed on Monday.On December 13, the court had dismissed appeals filed by the West Bengal government and a complainant in one of the cases on the ground that the high court order was passed as an interim direction, pending final consideration of Adhikari’s petition. The top court’s order had permitted the state to file an application before the high court to vacate the stay.In the present appeal, the state government presented new arguments, questioning the dismissal of its letters patent appeal (LPA) by the high court’s division bench. “Since the order of the single judge was assailed before us, the issue of maintainability of LPA pales into insignificance,” the bench had said. “Parties are to be governed by our order of December 13.”The issue raised in their appeal was similar in nature to a case already pending before the top court, said lawyer Menaka Guruswamy, appearing for the state government. “The issue here is whether LPA can be moved in terms of a writ petition before the high court under Article 226 of the Constitution,” she said. “This question is pending consideration in the Anup Majee vs CBI case pending before this court.”“We have already dealt with the high court order on merits; then where is the question of LPA? Once you have approached us on merits and we have dismissed your appeal, there is no question of dealing with another petition against the same order,” the apex court bench said on Monday.Guruswamy sought to argue that the question raised by the state has not been dealt by the December 13 order. She requested the court to allow this matter to be tagged with the Anup Majee petition, as similar questions of law are to be decided. Appearing for Adhikari, advocate PS Patwalia opposed the state’s arguments and requested the court to dismiss the same. As regards clubbing the petition with the other pending case, the bench told the state, “The state is already before us in the Anup Majee matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-denies-appeal-against-protection-from-arrest-to-suvendu-adhikari-101641234572060.html
04-01-2022||India||SC asks Centre to decide on plea to extradite woman who went to join ISIS||The central government should decide within eight weeks on the extradition and repatriation of a woman from Kerala who is detained in Afghanistan with her child on charges of joining the ISIS terror outfit, the Supreme Court ordered on Monday. The court was hearing a petition filed by 65-year-old VJ Sebastian Francis, a resident of Ernakulam district, who requested repatriation of his daughter Sonia, alias Ayisha, and his granddaughter. The two are at Pul-e-Charkhi prison in Kabul since 2019, before the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan. Francis said he feared for the lives of his 32-year-old daughter and nine-year-old granddaughter, and sought the apex court’s intervention.“First you have to persuade the Indian government. You should have first approached the government instead of moving the court,” a bench comprising justices L Nageswara Rao and BR Gavai said.Commenting on news reports suggesting cordial diplomatic ties being established between India and Afghanistan, the bench said, “The relationship appears to be good.”The woman had left the country on July 30, 2016 to join her husband, who was working with ISIS in Afghanistan. On an Interpol red corner notice issued on March 22, 2017, Ayisha and her daughter surrendered before Afghan forces on November 15, 2019, and were jailed. India’s National Investigation Agency has charged Ayisha under various offences under the anti-terror law UAPA.“There are several treaties in force under which extradition is possible. But in cases involving UAPA, they (Centre) do not initiate,” the bench said, expressing its limitations. A representation was moved before the federal government but there’s been no response yet, advocate Renjith Marar, appearing for Francis, told the court.The petition was filed in the Supreme Court in July last year. Disposing of the petition, the apex court bench said, “We direct the Cabinet Secretary and Secretary, ministry of external affairs (MEA) to consider and dispose the request for extradition of the detenues, preferably within eight weeks from today.” The apex court also permitted Francis to approach the Kerala high court, instead of approaching it, if he is aggrieved with the decision taken by the Centre after the eight-week period.During the hearing, Marar pointed out that the jail in which the kin of the petitioner were lodged was destroyed by the Taliban and prisoners were shifted to detention centres in border areas adjoining Pakistan.In his petition, Francis had stated that India was duty bound under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to bring back its citizens. He requested the Indian government to extend consular access to ensure safety of his daughter and granddaughter through diplomatic channels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scasks-centre-to-decide-on-plea-to-extradite-woman-who-went-to-join-islamic-state-101641234212401.html
04-01-2022||India||SC notice on plea challenging inner line permit in Manipur||The Supreme Court on Monday sought the responses of the Centre and the Manipur government to a petition challenging the constitutional validity of the inner line permit (ILP) system which controls the entry to Manipur of people who are not residents, and prohibits them from conducting business without a special permit.A bench of justices S Abdul Nazeer and Krishna Murari issued notices on a petition filed by a Kolkata-based sociocultural organisation Amra Bangalee.The petition challenged the decision of the Centre in 2019 to extend the ILP system in Manipur by way of an order promulgated by the President. It also challenged permit guidelines issued by the state government restricting the entry of outsiders, and imposing curbs on them with respect to business activity and land purchase.Terming the law and accompanying regulations to be violative of the constitutionally guaranteed freedoms of equality (Article 14), life and liberty (Article 21), non-discrimination (Article 15) and movement and trade (Article 19), the petition filed through advocate Fuzail Ahmad Ayyubi said: “The effect of ILP system in Manipur is that no person who is not a resident of the state is permitted to enter the state or engage in business without applying for a special permit known as ILP.”The inner line is an arbitrarily decided territory, the petition contended, adding: “These legislations create an embargo on the right of free movement of citizens and their right to freely carry out trade and occupation within the territory of India, guaranteed under Article 19.”Describing the law as part of the colonial legacy introduced under the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation (BEFR) of 1873, advocate Ayyubi said that this regulation was enacted during British rule to create a monopoly by prohibiting Indians from engaging in trade with the local tribal population. “The said restriction is continued post-Independence as well under the guise of protecting interests of tribal areas.”BEFR was retained by way of a 1950 order, and made applicable to most of North-East region. In 2019, an amendment was made to the Adaptation of Laws Order 1950 to extend it to Manipur besides Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and areas of districts of Nagaland as notified from time to time. The 1950 order applied to certain districts in the above states.Although, the 2019 amendment did not contain any Statement of Objects and Reasons, at the time of moving the amendment, the government said that it was meant to protect the indigenous population in these states.Expert quote||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-notice-on-plea-challenging-inner-line-permit-in-manipur-101641233972078.html

In a committee of 31 only 1 is a woman.”During the winter session of Parliament, the bill that seeks to increase the age of legal marriage of women from 18 to 21 years was introduced by Union minister Smriti Irani. The bill was sent to a 31-member committee, which only has one woman MP Sushmita Dev in it, for examination and scrutiny.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mps-seek-more-women-in-house-panel-to-discuss-bill-to-increase-age-of-marriage-101641233852441.html
04-01-2022||India||Row erupts after Satya Pal Malik calls Modi ‘arrogant’; Cong seeks PM’s apology||Meghalaya governor Satya Pal Malik has triggered a massive row after making startling claims against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah over farmers’ issues, remarks that he later clarified but stopped short of retracting. It has created a political storm with the opposition Congress on Monday demanding clarification from Modi and Shah.Malik, who has been publicly criticising the Union government over the farmers’ issue, claimed that Modi showed “arrogance” when he met him recently over deaths of farmers during their year-long agitations.Addressing a function in Haryana, Malik was caught on camera saying, “When I went to meet the Prime Minister to discuss the farmer issue, I ended up fighting with him within five minutes. He was very arrogant. When I told him that 500 of our own (farmers) had died… he said, ‘Did they die for me?’ I told him yes, since you are the king. I ended up having an argument with him. He told me to meet Amit Shah and I did.”Malik added, “When I met Amit Shah, he said ‘Satya Pal, he (PM Modi) has lost his mind. You be carefree and keep meeting us’.”When contacted by HT on Monday, Malik, however, said, “I didn’t say the PM was arrogant; he was just adamant about his position.” He also clarified that the home minister did not speak ill of Modi and told him that people are telling Modi all kinds of things and so he must meet and give him the right picture.Meanwhile, the Congress was quick to corner the government on Malik’s remarks. “The real face of PM Modi, the anti-farmer face of PM Modi, the insensitive face of PM Modi, the face of Bharatiya Janata Party and Modi government, which actually truly works for crony capitalist friends and to the peril and prejudice of India’s 62 crore farmers and farm labourers now stands exposed,” said Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala while briefing the media.Surjewala asked the Union government to sack and register an FIR against Malik if he was lying. “If not, then PM Modi and Amit Shah must come forward and apologise.

Both cities are high-density urban centres – bearing some similarities to Gauteng province in South Africa, which is regarded as the epicentre of the highly transmissible variant.Gauteng is also home to Johannesburg, the largest city in South Africa.South African experts have submitted a new study analysing the early days of the Omicron outbreak in the province, including the first age-wise break-up of hospitalisation rates. The report, undergoing a peer review in The Lancet journal, is based on cases that were recorded in the early phase of the wave between November 14 and December 11, a period when 133,551 Omicron infections are estimated to have taken place.Also Read| Omicron cases in India rises to 1,700; Maharashtra, Delhi worst-hitIn terms of headline numbers, the report reinforces the conclusion that the variant is leading to less severe cases: the authors found only 4.9% of cases were hospitalised, compared to 18.9% during the early phase of the Beta variant outbreak and 13.7% during the early phase of the Delta outbreak.A crucial caveat here is that a large number of people were vaccinated in South Africa between the Delta and Beta waves and the Omicron wave, and experts in the country have previously cited this as a possible factor for the reduced severity.This appears to bear out in a particular age group: those under 20, most of whom were not eligible for vaccines. “While admission rates during the fourth wave dropped substantially in those aged [over] 20 years in whom vaccination coverage was higher, this was not observed in the largely unvaccinated [under] 20 years age group. In the [less than] 20 years group, the proportions of cases admitted to hospital was similar -- 7.1% (Beta wave) vs 3.8% (Delta wave) vs 6.1% (Omicron wave) -- and the proportion with severe illness among admitted patients, was similar -- 22% vs 23.0% vs 20.4% -- in the three waves, in contrast to the reductions in both admission rates and disease severity observed in the fourth wave in adults,” said the authors from South Africa’s National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) in their report.Also Read| Omicron spreading among over-50s, says UK minister amid rapid surge in cases“Possible reasons for this could be that children have lower rates of prior infection and/or vaccination,” they added.The authors add that these were still early findings. “While these considerations apply to the early part of all three waves, these results may not represent the entire Omicron-dominated wave’s disease severity and may change when patient data for this entire wave are available,” they said.In another study of likely implication for India, researchers in Japan found that hybrid immunity – people vaccinated and previously infected – may have strong protection even in the case of an Omicron variant infection and the longer the gap between an infection and vaccination, the more protection there is likely to be.
04-01-2022||India||Month after botched op, Nagaland’s wounds refuse to heal||Sheiwang Konyak, 22, has lost vision in his right eye after a retinal detachment. There are injuries on his chest and leg; he has been recovering at the district hospital for the past month.Even then, Konyak is fortunate.On December 4, in the botched operation based on flawed intelligence, the armed forces shot 13 civilians dead -- six coal miners returning home in a van in Nagaland’s Mon district, and seven others in the subsequent violence. One security personnel was also killed in the clashes, while one other civilian died at in a clash with Assam rifles the next day.Also Read| ‘Positive’ development on AFSPA in Assam, Nagaland soon’: HimantaKonyak was one of the only two survivors of that first burst of fire at the van near Oting village. And one month later, he only longs for one thing: “I just want to go home.”The vision in his eye may now be impaired, but the sights and sounds from that night flash before him constantly. “We were returning from the coal fields, when I heard gunshots. Some of my friends fell down. I got shot in my stomach and arm, and got injured in my leg and eye too. We didn’t even get the chance to jump out of the van,” he said.Konyak lost consciousness, and when he came to, he was at the district hospital, where he has been since.Over the course of a month, there have been multiple surgeries, the pain has heightened his anguish at not being able to mourn with the families of the friends he lost. “I don’t know how Christmas and New Year’s Day went by. I don’t know anything anymore. I just want to go home and cry,” he said from his hospital bed.Back home in Oting, there have been no festivities. A month later, there is anger and disbelief at an incident that brought national headlines and attention to this remote part of the North-East, and has relaunched a conversation about the continued implementation of Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, or Afspa, with the Nagaland assembly unanimously calling for its removal.THE INCIDENTAccording to the Indian Army, a specific operation was planned in the Tiru area, “based on credible intelligence”, of likely movement of insurgents in the area. Subsequently, a unit of the Indian Army’s 21 Para Commando laid an ambush in the suspected area near Oting village on the afternoon of December 4 afternoon, during which, a mini pickup truck carrying eight persons was fired at, killing six on the spot.Villagers later said that these were youth from Oting village who were returning home after working for days at a coal field in Tiru. When people in the village heard gunshots from a distance, they assumed it was an exchange of fire between the Assam Rifles and insurgents from the NSCN (K) Yung Aung. However, as time went by, and the young men who were expected to return from the coal fields before sundown failed to return, the villagers sounded an alarm and gathered a search party.Also Read| SIT meets soldiers in Nagaland firing case“When we saw their vehicle (pickup truck), we asked the army personnel where our brothers were. They said they did not know, but some of our people went and searched one of the pickup trucks of the army and found the bodies piled under a tarpaulin. We thought they could have been detained for questioning but when we saw their dead bodies we were aghast,” said a village guard, among the search party, but asking not to be named.According to him, when the villagers started retrieving the bodies, the para commandos reportedly opened fire again, which killed seven more civilians. A soldier lost his life in the violence as well.“They (security forces) were firing at everyone,” said Nyawang Konyak, one of the primary eyewitnesses, who has recorded his statement with the Army’s Court of Inquiry that visited the village on December 29.Nyawang is also the president of Mon district’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) unit and was among the first responders who rushed to the site. He said he had rushed to reach the spot to pacify the situation but claimed that when he was on the way, personnel fired at his vehicle and his driver was injured.THE PROBEIn the immediate aftermath of the incident, the state government set up a special investigation team (SIT) headed by additional director general (law and order) Sandeep M Tamgadge to probe the killings within 30 days. He is yet to submit his report. The army has also instituted a court of inquiry (CoI), and investigations are ongoing.What has incensed the residents of Oting further is a government statement in Parliament on December 6 that security personnel opened fire after the vehicle was signalled to stop, but did not do so.Also Read| Afspa renewed in Nagaland: GovtSheiwang said that there was no signal made to the vehicle to stop at all.In light of the contrasting versions, the Oting citizens’ forum made an appeal on December 10 asking for facts to be ascertained from the ground. There were also widespread protests across Nagaland, and a complete bandh was called on Mon district against the killings on December 10.The group boycotted the visit of Court of Inquiry headed by a Major General to the spot on December 29 with only Nyawang and Lewang, a village guard, recording their statements. A local, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that others refused to meet the army team which was at the Tizit police station for about two hours.“Around 20 of them (army inquiry team) came to Tiru. I told the army team everything that transpired that day. I have also asked them to take back their statement which was presented in Parliament that army personnel had fired only when the vehicle in which the villagers were travelling did not stop after being signalled to,” Nyawang said.Public relations officer Lieutenant Colonel Sumit K Sharma said the team also took along the witnesses to the spot for a better understanding of how events would have unfolded. “The inputs received will be a part of the inquiry findings,” he said.THE AFSPA DEBATEThe Oting firing revived the public outcry for the repeal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act 1958 (AFSPA) from Nagaland. The Act grants sweeping powers to security forces to operate in “disturbed areas” including powers to search, seize, to arrest without warrant, and to use firearms on mere suspicion.The law came into force in 1958 in the entire North-East and according to Section 3 of the Act, an entire state or part of it can be designated as “disturbed” by the governor of a state, an administrator of a Union Territory, or the Centre if they feel the situation requires use of armed forces to aid the civil force. In Nagaland, the law has been in force since 1963, when the state was created.Naga lawmakers are now of the view that there is no need to term Nagaland a “disturbed area” with a vastly improved law and order situation, particularly with the government of India in dialogue with a majority of Naga political groups, and the existence of a ceasefire with groups such as the NSCN(IM). On December 20, the chief minister Neiphiu Rio-led United Democratic Alliance (UDA) government adopted a resolution to demand the repeal of Afspa in a special session of the state assembly.In this backdrop, Union home minister Amit Shah convened a meeting with Rio and his Assam counterpart Himanta Biswa Sarma in late December, and subsequently a high-level committee was constituted to examine the question of AFSPA on December 26. The committee is expected to submit its recommendations within 45 days.In the meantime, however, the Centre has extended the operation of Afspa in Nagaland for six more months from December 30, 2021 in a routine order.SUBDUED FESTIVITIESBack in Oting, these deliberations around the law bring little solace. Monglong, 34, married her husband Hokup, 37, on November 25, promising in her wedding vows to love each other till death did them part. Nine days later, she was a widow. “I keep praying to God to make me strong. As a church women leader, I try to put up a brave face and continue my work, but inside, I’m heartbroken. And I break down every time that I’m alone,” she said.On January 1, Monglong visited her husband’s grave, where the victims of the shootings are buried, laying a wreath of flowers made from the ones used at their wedding. Next to her, there were other families mourning their loved ones too. Everyone who died in Oting was under 40. Langwang and Thapwang were identical twins, and inseparable; C Shomwang was the president of the youth wing of the Oting Church, and owned the pickup truck; Khawang was father to a five-month-old baby.In grief, there is resolve too. The village has barred the entry of outsiders as a mark of protest. “Our struggle will continue till we achieve justice,” the Oting citizens’ group said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/month-after-botched-op-nagaland-s-wounds-refuse-to-heal-101641233134033.html
04-01-2022||India||4.2 million kids vaccinated against Covid-19 as next phase kicks off||More than 4 million teens, or over 5,500 every minute, were given coronavirus vaccines in a mere 12 hours after they became eligible for shots on Monday, sending a perceptible sense of relief among parents and children who queued up at vaccine centres under the shadow of a budding third wave of cases.Between 8am and 8pm, 4.12 million doses were delivered, data from the Union government’s Co-Win dashboard showed. This age-group accounted for 42% of all doses delivered till that time on Monday.Also Read| Omicron cases in India rises to 1,700; Maharashtra, Delhi worst-hit“Well done Young India! Over 40 lakh (four million) between 15-18 age group received their first dose of #COVID19 vaccine on the 1st day of vaccination drive for children, till 8 PM. This is another feather in the cap of India’s vaccination drive,” said Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya in a tweet.The turnout was encouraging also because, just on the first day of the vaccine drive being expanded, it accounted for 5% of the estimated eligible population in this cohort, and 79% of the 5.1 million who signed up for shots under this age group.Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India has taken an important step in protecting its youth against the disease. ‘’Congrats to all my young friends between the age group of 15-18 who got vaccinated. Congrats to their parents as well. I would urge more youngsters to get vaccinated in the coming days!’’ he said on Twitter.If this rate is maintained – although the opening day of a new phase typically has the highest demand – all of the estimated 74 million children are likely to be covered with the first doses within this month.The Day 1 excitement was palpable at the vaccination centres at schools, hospitals, and special vaccination sites.Also Read| Centre terms reports of using expired Covaxin ‘misleading’“I was looking forward to the vaccinations being opened for my age group. We have been cooped up inside our houses for nearly two years now, with schools being opened only on-and-off. Offline classes have not been very helpful. I am hoping that with maximum children coming for vaccinations, physical classes will finally resume,” said Rishvi Rajvanshi (16), a resident of south Delhi’s Malviya Nagar.Parents accompanying their children, too, said getting children at least the first dose was their priority.“I cannot tell you how anxious we were to get our children vaccinated, especially after the havoc that the second Covid wave wrecked. We lost my father to the virus in May and we have seen what this virus can do. As soon as the vaccination for children was announced, we have been on the lookout for registrations. I am glad that my son and my niece got their first doses,” said Arunima Singh, who was accompanying 15-year-old Niha and 17-year-old Dhruv to the Kautilya Sarvodaya School in Greater Kailash.Officials at the vaccination centres said the process went smoothly. “Everything went very smoothly today. Children were excited and parents were also relieved to have their kids protected. Many children were also curious about how the vaccination will protect them,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director, Lok Nayak Hospital.At present, only Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin is approved to be administered to recipients under the age of 18.The new phase of the vaccine drive comes at a time of a sharp acceleration in cases, driven largely by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. The variant is the most transmissible yet and is more resistant to immunity from past infection or vaccines than other configurations of the virus. But it is linked to significantly lower odds of hospitalisations, especially among those who have some immunity.Several countries accelerated their vaccination and booster drives last month when the variant began spreading after being first detected by South Africa in mid-November.“It is day one of children getting jabbed, and just into the new years which usually was going to add to vaccine hesitancy; however, given the circumstances, the response has been good. It could also do with the fact that the numbers have suddenly started to rise again and it has brought people out of their comfort zone that many were in. We should see further rise in vaccination numbers,” said Dr Anupam Sibal, senior paediatrician, and group medical director, Apollo Hospitals.Overall, the 45-60 age group population has the biggest two-dose vaccine coverage at 73.2%, data from the Co-WIN dashboard analysed by HT showed, followed by people in the 60-plus age group at 68.5%.Among states, Himachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh administered the highest share of doses to children, while Punjab, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh recorded the least turnout in this age group.On January 10, India’s coronavirus vaccination drive will further open up by allowing people above the age of 60 with certain illnesses and those in health care and front-line jobs to take their third doses, which the government has called “precaution doses”. These doses can only be taken if the primary vaccination course was completed more than nine months prior.According to estimates by HT based on 2021 Census projections, these newly eligible people – including the adolescent age group -- will add demand for another 104 million doses this month. As on Monday, according to the Union government’s daily vaccine supply bulletin, states already have close to 200 million doses at hand, indicating that the number of doses will not be a problem.Gagandeep Kang, vaccine expert, and senior faculty, Christian Medical College, Vellore, said, “Eventually, we will have to vaccinate everyone, but it makes sense to protect subsets as much as possible and as early as possible such as those who are immunocompromised, elderly, comorbidities.”(With inputs from Rhythma Kaul)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/42mn-kids-vaccinated-as-next-phase-kicks-off-101641233072137.html
04-01-2022||India||Pakistan urges India to join Saarc summit virtually||Pakistan on Monday reiterated its offer to host the long-pending summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc), with foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi saying India could attend the meet virtually if it does not wish to participate in-person.Qureshi made the remarks while addressing a news conference in Islamabad, where he presented a review of Pakistan’s foreign policy during 2021. He reiterated Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s remarks that the onus is on India to take steps to create an environment conducive to dialogue between the two sides.The 19th Saarc Summit was to have been held in Islamabad in November 2016 but it was called off after New Delhi pulled out over the Uri terror attack that was blamed on Pakistan-based terrorists. There is also uncertainty about the status of Afghanistan, one of the eight members of the grouping, following the Taliban takeover of the country last year.Qureshi, who was speaking in Urdu, described Saarc as an “important forum” and said: “Unfortunately, India has made this forum dysfunctional because of its stubbornness. They are not ready to come to Islamabad, they are hesitant.”He added: “Because of India’s obstinacy, this forum is suffering. If India does not want to come [for the Saarc Summit], then new means are available. I reiterate our invitation to all Saarc members and Pakistan is willing to host the 19th Saarc Summit in Islamabad. If India doesn’t want to come, they can attend virtually.”Qureshi further said, “If they (India) have problems coming here physically, they can attend virtually but they shouldn’t stop others. They should let others come and not affect this forum.”There was no immediate response by Indian officials to Qureshi’s comments.Saarc operates on the principle of consensus and the summit cannot be held if even one member decides not to attend. With India-Pakistan relations at an all-time low following a string of terror attacks blamed on Pakistan-based groups, New Delhi has said there cannot be any dialogue between the two sides if Islamabad does not act against terrorist groups operating from its soil.In recent years, India has also focused on other regional groupings, such as the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (Bimstec) to take forward developmental cooperation.Qureshi further told the news conference that prospects for durable peace and stability in the region and the potential for economic development and regional cooperation had been “held hostage by the hegemonic and hostile behaviour of India”, whose leadership has adopted a “particularly irresponsible and politically motivated anti-Pakistan posture”.He contended that India’s “unilateral and illegal actions” in Jammu and Kashmir since August 2019 had “vitiated the environment and threatened international peace and security”. Qureshi said, “Resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute is a prerequisite for durable peace and stability in South Asia.”He added that Pakistan will continue to extend “moral and diplomatic support” to the Kashmiri people in their struggle for self-determination.
04-01-2022||India||China building bridge across Pangong Lake: Satellite imagery||China has played up the hoisting of its national flag by soldiers at Galwan Valley as part of New Year celebrations as satellite imagery emerged of a new bridge being built by the Chinese to link both banks of Pangong Lake, highlighting the continuing tensions in the Ladakh sector.The messaging by China’s state-run media regarding the celebrations by Chinese troops at Galwan Valley was in marked contrast to images shared by the Indian side on January 1 of troops of the two countries exchanging sweets and greetings on New Year at several locations along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The state media shared two videos – one showing People’s Liberation Army (PLA) troops training on the Tibetan plateau saluting the national flag, and another more pointed one of PLA soldiers sending New Year greetings to the Chinese people from Galwan Valley, “near the border with India”, while standing under Mandarin characters painted on a rock that read: “Never yield an inch of land.”A report on New Year celebrations by the nationalist Global Times tabloid mentioned the raising of the national flag at places across China in its opening paragraph, but named only two locations – Hong Kong special administrative region and the Galwan Valley. Representatives of the state media tweeted the flag raised at Galwan was special as it once flew over Tiananmen Square in Beijing.These videos were followed by the emergence of satellite imagery that showed a new bridge being constructed by the Chinese side to link the north and south banks of Pangong Lake. Twitter user Damien Symon, who uses the handle @detresfa_, posted an image of the bridge, being built in territory held by the Chinese side, that would cut the distance between several PLA positions on both banks of the lake.The bridge – which spans a narrow section of the 134 km lake and is almost complete – is expected to enhance road connectivity for the PLA in the area and allow the speedy movement of both troops and heavy equipment.There was no immediate response to these developments from Indian officials. Indian and Chinese troops have been locked in a face-off in Ladakh sector of the LAC since May 2020. Following the disengagement of frontline troops on the banks of Pangong Lake and at Gogra last year, the two sides have been unable to make headway on de-escalation at several other friction points such as Depsang.People familiar with the developments said on condition of anonymity that the video showing Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley appeared to have been made in an area held by the Chinese side. They noted that it was not made in the so-called two-kilometre “buffer zone” created around the scene of a brutal clash at Galwan Valley in June 2020 that resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers and at least four Chinese troops.“They’ve deliberately not shown the bend of the Galwan river, which is with the Indian side,” said one of the people cited above. Another person added that the video, though shared widely by the Chinese media on January 1, appeared to have been shot some time ago as there is no snow visible on the nearby mountains.The people said that the new Chinese bridge spanning the Pangong Lake appeared to be located about 40 km from Finger 4 and would drastically reduce the distance between several PLA locations. They noted that India too is developing infrastructure on its side in this region and said the new Chisumle-Demchok road at Umling pass, located at a height of more than 19,000 feet in southern Ladakh, will allow troops to be speedily moved to several strategic positions on the Indian side.Maj Gen (retired) Ashok Kumar, a visiting fellow at the Centre for Land Warfare Studies (CLAWS), said the combination of China’s new land border law and the accelerated construction of infrastructure and “Xiaokong” or model villages along and inside disputed regions has created “conditions for a militarised solution to the boundary issue”.“Frankly, China’s political establishment wishes to win wars without fighting in the real sense. They’re mobilising public opinion, including in the opposing nation and resorting to psychological warfare to highlight their own strengths and beating down the opponent,” he said.“The new boundary law is the manifestation of a long-standing Chinese ploy of using ‘lawfare’ for gaining territorial concessions. The Chinese use legal norms to highlight what they believe is right in legal terms, and they are not in a hurry to resolve disputes unless the resolution is favourable to them,” Kumar added.

On Monday, 4,099 cases were reported from Delhi, with case positivity reaching almost 6.5%, indicating a rapid spread.Goa recorded four more cases of the Omicron variant with reports of samples sent to the lab of National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune returning on Monday. “One patient is from within Goa with no travel history indicating indigenous spread which needs to be further examined,” said Goa health minister Vishwajit Rane. With this, Goa’s total Omicron tally touched five.The state also reported a big spike in infections, with 631 fresh cases reported while the caseload crossed the 2,000 mark.Maharashtra reported 68 cases of the Omicron variant. Of them, 40 from Mumbai, 17 from Pune, four from Nagpur, three from Panvel, and one each from Navi Mumbai, Raigad, Satara and Kolhapur tested positive for the new variant. The total number of Omicron cases reached 578 in the state. So far, 259 cases have been discharged following negative RT-PCR test reports.Jammu & Kashmir has reported three Omicron positive cases. “Only three cases of the Omicron variant were detected in Jammu & Kashmir to date and all of them have recovered fully. All three patients belonged to Jammu city. Two were women from Talab Tillo area and third one was a 15 year old girl, a student of Class 10 at CRPF headquarters in Ban Talab. All three had no history of foreign travel,” said Dr JP Singh, chief medical officer, Jammu.In West Bengal, 20 Omicron cases were detected till Monday, out of which 14 are active.On Monday, four international passengers (two from Sweden and two from France) were found to be Covid-19 positive. Their samples have been sent for genome sequencing. The state health department is waiting for genome sequencing reports of 13 passengers as of now.Also Read| India sees sharp spike in Covid infections with 33,750 fresh cases, deaths dipKerala also reported 29 new Omicron cases on Monday, taking the total number of Omicron infected cases to 181. Among 29, at least two people have been infected locally.The Haryana health department’s data showed 2,284 infections were reported between December 27 and January 2 as compared to 436 the week before. The last the state recorded more than 1,500 infections in a week was during June 14-20 last year, when 1,557 infections were reported during the ebbing period of the devastating second wave.India held its first high-level meeting to discuss measures that needed to be taken to deal with the heavily mutated new variant soon after the World Health Organization declared Omicron a variant of concern on November 27. South Africa announced Omicron’s presence in its population to the world on November 24.Experts say the way numbers are rising, the surge appeared to be driven by Omicron. “This is no surprise that it is Omicron as Delta was not spreading this fast. We will have to keep an eye at the rate of hospitalisations now, as even a small percentage can be huge for a country like India,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head, pulmonary medicine department, All India institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/omicron-cases-in-india-rises-to-1-700-maharashtra-delhi-worsthit-101641232831906.html

The ship, operated by a private firm, was carrying hordes of New Year revellers when it arrived at Mormugao Port Trust in Goa on Sunday, and a crew member tested positive for the virus.In a tweet, Rane said: “Out of 2,000 samples tested from Cordelia cruise ship, 66 passengers tested positive for #Covid19 Respective collectors & MPT (Mormugao Port Trust) staff have been informed. The government will take appropriate measures to discuss disembarking of passengers,” Rane said.The minister’s remarks came on a day the state reported a jump of 16% in the positivity rate. While the positivity rate crossed the 10% mark a day earlier, it rose to 26.43% percent on Monday, prompting the state government to shut schools and colleges till January 26.According to officials familiar with the matter, the ship was initially made to wait at anchorage for a few hours on Sunday as authorities discussed steps to be followed before asking the ship operators to get all the passengers tested. Subsequently, a medical team in PPE kits arrived to conduct RT-PCR tests of the passengers and crew members, and the sample testing process continued till Monday afternoon.Meanwhile, the state reported four more cases of the Omicron variant, taking the overall tally to five. One among the four patients who tested positive for the Omicron variant during the day has no history of travel, the health minister said. The overall Covid caseload in the state rose to 1,82,201 with 631 new infections. Sawant, who chaired a meeting of the Task Force earlier in the day, told reporters that the government would also impose a night curfew.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/66-of-2-000-people-on-board-goa-cruise-ship-tests-positive-for-covid-101641232774483.html
04-01-2022||India||6 visitors at Bihar CM Nitish Kumar’s janata darbar test positive for Covid||Six persons who had come for grievance redressal at the weekly town hall meeting of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday along with five catering staff, as coronavirus infections seem to be spreading rapidly in the state. “At the initial check-up before the start of the programme, one out of the total 186 complainants, who poured in at janata darbar, was diagnosed with Covid infection,” Kumar said at a media briefing. “Later, it was found that six persons were positive for the disease. One of the staff, who takes care of meals for the participants, was also detected suffering from Covid. It’s becoming a matter of concern.” Four more catering staff were later found to be infected as well, a government official said. All participants at the janata darbar, or open house, have to take the rapid antigen test. “Those tested positive will undergo confirmatory RT-PCR tests,” the official said, requesting anonymity. The Bihar government will immediately take stock of the sudden upsurge in Covid-19 cases and take all measures to contain it, the chief minister said. There are currently 1,385 active cases in Bihar, which reported 344 new infections on January 2, the highest in a day since June 29. The positivity rate in the state stands at 0.1% in the week ended January 2, a health department officer said. Bihar might enforce night curfew, partial lockdown, and strict adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour for a limited period to bring the situation under control, a meeting convened by the chief minister decided, another state official said, declining to be named. The state’s health system was on high alerts and the pace of pathological tests to confirm infections has been enhanced, chief minister Kumar said. “Genome sequencing to isolate the Omicron variant of Covid19 has also been launched in the state. The isolation centres that were raised to treat the people suffering from Covid are being readied. There is no dearth of medicines and oxygen. People need to be sensitised to deal with the renewed challenge,” he said. The situation was not so alarming to postpone assembly elections in five states, Kumar said. “Assembly elections in Kerala were held during the pandemic phase. Even Bihar underwent for the polls in the midst of rise in Covid cases with precautions. There are people to take care of poll preparedness in view of the pandemic,” he said.

We are of the prima facie view that this is a matter of law being taken into their own hands by the accused,” said a bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh.“We can’t permit these things to go on. We are very sure about it. We can’t permit lynching at all,” said the bench, underscoring its disapproval of mob lynching in the name of protecting cows or preventing cow slaughter.The court emphasised that everyone who is a part of such an unlawful assembly must be taken to task and face prosecution under appropriate charges of Section 34 (acts done by several persons with common intention) or Section 149 (act committed by any member of an unlawful assembly) of the Indian Penal Code.A mob violence incident at Syana in Bulandshahr on December 3, 2018, left police inspector Subodh Kumar Singh, who was handling complaints against cow slaughter, and a local resident, dead with bullet wounds. The violence erupted after cattle carcasses were reportedly found in a nearby village. Yogeshraj and others were accused of leading the mob and instigating it to attack police with illegal firearms, sharp objects, and lathis.The apex court, in its order, directed accused Yogeshraj, who was let out on bail in September 2019, to surrender before the trial court within a week, and sent back behind bars. In May 2021, Yogeshraj won the Uttar Pradesh panchayat election from ward number 5 of Bulandshahr for the post of district panchayat member.“You will have to go back to jail. We can’t let these things go on,” the judges told Yogeshraj’s lawyer, who argued that he was not named in the charge sheet as the accused who shot at Singh.During the hearing, the bench also pulled up the Uttar Pradesh government for not challenging the bail granted to Yogeshraj, but acting only after the police inspector’s widow moved the top court.“If you say that his bail has to be cancelled, why did you not file an appeal against the high court order? You don’t take any step yourself, but now you come forward to say that you are supporting the petition,” it told the state’s additional advocate general Ajay Kumar Misra.The court expressed its dismay when the state’s lawyer argued that the policeman’s widow was too quick to file an appeal against the bail order. “It is surprising that a complainant can follow and a track a case, but a state cannot do it, and it keeps waiting,” remarked the bench.The first information report (FIR) into the incident named 27 persons, apart from 53 unidentified people, including Yogeshraj and local Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Shikhar Agarwal, and charged them with murder, sedition, attempt to murder, rioting and dacoity, among other charges. Yogeshraj absconded for around a month before he was arrested on January 2, 2019.In September 2019, he was released on bail by the Allahabad high court, compelling Singh’s wife Rajni to move the Supreme Court against the order. Arguing for her, advocate Sanjay Hegde raised objections to the grant of bail, contending that such an order would only result in encouraging mob lynching and people resorting to violence. Hegde further pointed out that Yogeshraj, who was the Bulandshahr unit convenor of the Bajrang Dal in 2018, is a key accused who led the mob and instigated it to attack Singh.Asked to respond, Uttar Pradesh police supported Rajni’s petition and said Yogeshraj’s bail should be cancelled. But the court expressed displeasure at the state government for not acting by its own to get the key accused’s bail nixed.During the proceedings on Monday, the bench told the state’s lawyer that instead of supporting Rajni’s petition, the state should have appealed through a separate special leave petition.Another aspect that the court highlighted was the absence of charges relating to common intention or unlawful assembly in the charge sheet filed in the case. “Unfortunately, there is no mentioning of section 34 or 149 in the charge sheet. If they are not charged under any one of these, many people in the mob will escape prosecution. What steps the state has taken to add these charges?” the bench asked Misra. The lawyer responded that he would revert with instructions on this aspect.The bench ordered the cancellation of Yogeshraj’s bail and further asked the trial court in Bulandshahr to send a report on the status of the case and charges against all the accused. The court will take up the matter after three weeks.
04-01-2022||India||Centre terms reports of using expired Covaxin ‘misleading’||The Union health ministry on Monday dismissed reports that India was using expired vaccines to inoculate people under its Covid-19 immunisation programme, calling them “false and misleading”, and based on incomplete information.As India began vaccinating children aged 15-18 on Monday, some people took to social media to say that the vaccine doses being administered were past their expiration date, and that when they voiced concern, they were shown a document stating that the national drugs regulator had extended the vaccine’s shelf life.“The Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) on 25th October 2021... approved the extension of shelf life of Covaxin from 9 months to 12 months. Similarly, the shelf life of Covishield has been extended by the National Regulator from 6 months to 9 months on 22nd February 2021,” the Union health ministry said after the reports emerged.“There have been some media reports alleging that expired vaccines are being administered in India under its national COVID-19 vaccination programme. This is false and misleading and based on incomplete information.” the ministry said.The statement came after some social media posts raised concerns over the vaccines.“So my son went to get his first vaccine, the drive for kids begin today and realized that the vaccine had already expired in November. Then a letter was shown wherein it seems the shelf life has been extended!!How, why, on what basis? To clear stock you experiment on kids?” tweeted Navanita Varadpande.The document that was shown to her was from KR Krishna Murthy, assistant general manager, distribution, Bharat Biotech International Ltd. “This is to inform you that we have received emergency use approval for Covaxin from Drugs Controller General (India) with shelf life of 6 months when stored at 2 degree C- 8 degree C. Further, Drugs Controller General (India), CDSCO approved for extension of shelf-life 12 months from the date of manufacture. The revised expiry date dates are detailed in the table below,” the letter said.The shelf life of vaccines was extended by the drugs regulator based on comprehensive analysis and examination of stability study data furnished by the vaccine manufacturers, the ministry said. “Stay Informed, Stay Safe! Media reports claiming that expired vaccines are being administered are false & misleading. CDSCO had earlier approved the extension of shelf life of Covaxin & Covishield vaccines to 12 months and 9 months, respectively,” health minister Mansukh Mandaviya tweeted.As Covaxin’s shelf life was increased first to nine months and later to 12 months recently, there could be vials with old expiration date pasted on them, according to people familiar with the matter. However, it does not mean the vaccine being administered is expired, an official said, asking not to be named.Bharat Biotech said it had begun lifting unused stock from hospitals. “The company, after receiving the approval from the regulator on the extension of shelf life to 12 months, have immediately begun lifting the unused stock from hospitals for relabelling,” the company said in a statement. It will conduct testing and inspection before relabelling, the company said. “All hospitals that have placed new orders have started receiving fresh stocks,” it said.
04-01-2022||India||Census activities postponed amid Covid surge||Census 2021 and activities around it have been postponed until further orders due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the home ministry told Parliament last month. In line with the decision, the Registrar General of India (RGI) and Census Commissioner Vivek Joshi is learnt to have written to the states and union territories last month, extending the date for making changes to administrative boundaries till end of June. During a Census operation – both the house-listing phase and the population enumeration, the states and union territories are not supposed to change the boundaries of districts, towns, villages and tehsils. Joshi’s letter means the freezing of boundaries of administrative jurisdictions will take place on June 30. The exercise was previously extended from December 31, 2020 to December 21, 2021. Originally, the field work of house-listing and housing Census, the first phase of Census 2021, along with the updating of National Population Register (NPR) was to be conducted in a period of 45 days during April 2020 to September 2020 in different states and territories, depending on their local conditions and other priorities. After the house-listing, the population enumeration was to be carried out between February 9 and 28 last year. To be sure, the home ministry or Census Commissioner’s office have not issued any official order or circular to postpone the exercise and extending the freezing date to June 30 is being seen as further delay. Union minister of state for home affairs Nityanand Rai informed the parliament on December 7, 2021 that Census 2021 and Census related activities have been postponed due to Covid-19 Pandemic. The government has said the forthcoming Census, in which data is collected on demographic and various socioeconomic parameters like education, SC/ST, religion, language, marriage, fertility, disability, occupation and migration of the individuals, is to be the first digital Census. A mobile app for collection of data and a Census Portal for management and monitoring of various Census related activities has already been developed. An official familiar with the development said with new date for administrative boundaries, the exercise may not begin before third quarter of 2022, which also depends on the Covid-19 situation in the country. The decadal census is the largest data collection exercise, which is important to assess the population growth as well as analyse the access to basic facilities such as housing, drinking water, sanitation, housing and electricity. This exercise was last held in 2011.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/census-activities-postponed-amid-covid-surge-101641232471939.html
04-01-2022||India||State of economy amid a surge in Covid infections||India is clearly witnessing the beginning of a third wave of Covid-19 infections. The seven-day average of daily new cases was 6,780 on December 27 and 18,236 on January 2. This number has been increasing continuously for exactly seven days now. How are economic indicators reacting to this development? What is the state of the Indian economy at the cusp of yet another wave of the pandemic? Here are four charts to put this in perspectiveStocks markets seem unperturbed at the momentThe BSE Sensex, India’s benchmark stock market index, gained 929 points on January 3 to close at 59,183. This is the highest single-day gain in the past 26 days, and the market has closed at the highest level since November 18. Among subindices, BSE Bankex that tracks the banking sector saw the highest increase at 2.55%. Bajaj Finance was the top gainer at 3.51% among the Sensex stocks.NIBRI at an all-time high in the week ended January 2The Nomura India Business Resumption Index (NIBRI) reached an all-time high of 120.3, gaining marginally over the reading of 120.2 in the previous week. To be sure, the rise in NIBRI seems mainly on account of an increase in the Apple driving index, which increased by 10.4 percentage points. Workplace mobility actually fell by six percentage points, and even labour participation rate fell marginally from 40.7% to 40.6%.“States have announced more restrictions, but elevated mobility and a rising positivity rate suggest a further rise in new cases. While early signs point to a lower mortality rate, it bears close monitoring. The restrictions could derail the recovery in contact-intensive services in Q1, but global experience suggests a smaller impact than previous waves and a swift growth rebound once cases peak,” Nomura Global Markets Research said in a research note.Manufacturing PMI continued to be in expansion zone in DecemberThe IHS-Markit Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for manufacturing was 55.5 in December 2021, the sixth consecutive month when it was above 50. However, the December value is lower than the November value of 57.6. A PMI value above 50 signifies an expansion in economic activity over previous month.“Manufacturers were optimistic that output would continue to increase in 2022, but business sentiment was somewhat tamed by worries surrounding the path of the pandemic, inflationary pressures and lingering supply chain disruptions,” Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit said in a statement.“We note that the (PMI) survey does not fully cover the Omicron impact on domestic producers’ perception as it was conducted between December 6-17 2021,” Madhavi Arora, lead economist at Emkay Global Financial Services, said in a note. Services PMI for December will be released on January 5.But the index of core sector industries suggests a moderation in NovemberThe index of eight core sector industries grew at an annual 3.1% in November, a sharp decline from the 8.4% growth seen in October, and also the lowest annual growth since March. When seen on a cumulative basis (April-November), the index was marginally above the pre-pandemic value of 129.9 in 2019-20 and 131.2 in 2021-22.Mixed signals on capital expenditure frontThe revival of investment remains critical for long-term growth prospects of the economy. The capital expenditure database of the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) offers mixed evidence. While the value of new project announcements fell in the second consecutive time to reach ₹2.1 trillion in the quarter ended December, the value of projects completed actually increased in the September and December quarters. The value of investment projects also fell in the September and December quarters. “Completions in the quarter of December 2021 were the highest compared to the levels achieved in any of the past six quarters,” Mahesh Vyas, chief executive of CMIE, wrote in an article on its website.To be sure, the jump in project completions might have an election bias to it. “The pick-up in completion of projects seen in the quarter ended December 2021 has been partly influenced by political activism. The largest project completed during the quarter was the Purvanchal Expressway. This 341km, ₹225 billion project was inaugurated by the Prime Minister in November 2021. The 257km, ₹98 billion Sarayu Nahar project was inaugurated by the Prime Minister in December 2021. In December 2021, the Prime Minister also inaugurated the Rs.86 billion, 1.27 million tonnes of urea per annum FCI fertiliser plant at Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh. During the quarter, the Prime Minister also inaugurated the Rs.26 billion Arjun Sahayak Irrigation project in Uttar Pradesh. Just these four projects inaugurated by the Prime Minister during the quarter of December 2021 add up to projects worth Rs.435 billion or over 30 per cent of the total projects completed during the quarter,” Vyas wrote in his article.
