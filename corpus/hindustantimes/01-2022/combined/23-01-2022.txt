23-01-2022||Lucknow||Denied ticket, sitting BJP MLA quits; joins Samajwadi Party||Agra ::: Denied party ticket this election, BJP’s sitting MLA from Fatehabad assembly constituency Jitendra Verma quit the party on Sunday. Later in the day, he joined Samajwadi Party and was named its district president the same day. Originally a Samajwadi Party leader, Jitendra Verma had switched to the BJP in 2014 and was given party ticket for 2017 assembly elections. Verma won the election and remained BJP MLA for almost five years but was denied assembly ticket this time as BJP declared candidates for nine assembly seats of Agra. Verma on Sunday sent a letter to BJP state president Swatantra Dev Singh, communicating his resignation as primary member of the party. Later in the day he returned to the Samajwadi Party and was nominated as its district president by state SP president Naresh Uttam, after he met national president of Samajwadi Party Akhilesh Yadav in Lucknow on Sunday. “We welcome sitting MLA Jitendra Verma who quit BJP and joined Samajwadi Party today. He is our new district president in Agra. His inclusion will strengthen the prospects of the party in all rural seats of Agra district,” stated Wajid Nisar, SP city unit president. The SP was not able to open its account in 2017 assembly elections in Agra district and all 9 seats, including six rural, were won by the BJP. Jitendra Verma is from Nishad community. Nishads are in handsome number in Fatehabad and Bah assembly constituencies of Agra district. SP leaders believe that inclusion of Verma would strengthen them, mainly in rural seats of Agra. Madhusudan Sharma, the incumbent district president of Samajwadi Party, has filed nomination as Samajwadi Party candidate from Bah assembly constituency and had won the seat for the BSP in 2007 state assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/denied-ticket-sitting-bjp-mla-quits-joins-samajwadi-party-101642961643943.html
23-01-2022||Patna||High Covid-19 vaccine coverage helps Patna recover faster amid surge||Patna’s high vaccination coverage has played a key role in reducing the number of hospitalisations of Covid-19 patients during the ongoing third wave of the pandemic as compared to the second wave last year, as only 2.6% of its 5,051 active Covid-19 cases on Saturday have required hospitalisation, while the remaining 97.4% are under home isolation, said Chandrashekhar Singh, district magistrate of Patna. In terms of hospital bed occupancy, barely 7% (173) of the 2,544 active beds in dedicated Covid-19 hospitals of Patna have been used up, he said. The state’s bed occupancy was barely 159 against 25,000 dedicated beds created for the management of Covid-19 cases, as per available figure last shared by Sanjay Kumar Singh, executive director, State Health Society, Bihar, on January 20. There are only five patients in the three dedicated Covid health centres of Patna that have among them 599 active beds, all of which are oxygen beds, Singh said. Of the 173 patients hospitalised in dedicated Covid-19 hospitals, only seven required ventilator support and 47 others were in ICU, he added. The All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH), the Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH) and some empanelled private hospitals make up the dedicated Covid-19 hospitals in Patna. These hospitals have among them 2,544 beds for management of Covid-19 patients, of which 1,495 are oxygen beds, 1,044 intensive care unit (ICU) beds and 299 ventilators. Patna urban area had a recovery rate of 85% as against the state’s 96.07% on Saturday. The Covid-19 case recovery rate has improved ever since the new cases spiked to 2,566 on January 10, when Patna’s positivity rate had gone up to 28% a day before. Singh said the smaller number of hospitalisations was because of high vaccination coverage in the district. As many as 3,083 of Patna’s 5,051 active cases, have been traced to outstation travellers and migrant workers, 1,403 to contact tracing of those who came in contact with Covid-19 patients, 445 to healthcare providers, while 120 are those with severe acute respiratory infection. “Patna has achieved first dose vaccination coverage of 81.04% against its eligible target population of 49,17,869, including the 15-18 years age group adolescents. Its second dose coverage is 81.7% against those eligible for the second jab,” said Mansoon Mohanty, team lead, Patna district resource unit, Care India, which has been partnering the government of Bihar in its health initiatives. As many as 46,34,468 doses have been administered among the 18-44 years age group, followed by 15,10,019 in the 45-60 years age bracket. Those above 60 years of age made for 9,56,699 doses as on Sunday morning, said Mohanty. Adolescents in the 15-18 years age bracket account for 1,76,328 doses, he added. Patna, with 72,77,514 doses, leads among Bihar’s 38 districts in terms of administering Covid-19 vaccination doses, followed by East Champaran (55,92,128 doses), Muzaffarpur (48,98,473 doses), Gaya (4,6,21,983) and Madhubani (44,26,356).
23-01-2022||Mumbai||Emergence of the Thackeray scion||Mumbai Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray at his first virtual appearance on January 1, following a spine surgery, said his son Aaditya had taken over almost all of his responsibilities concerning the developments in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). This statement indicated the growing role of Aaditya Thackeray, a Maharashtra cabinet minister, in steering the party.In the last two weeks, Aaditya has been at the centre of key developments: from preparing for the party’s foray into Goa and Uttar Pradesh to planning the campaign to retain control of the BMC. Shiv Sena leaders, however, said it was a matter of time since Thackeray’s attention was divided between running the coalition government and addressing the issues of the state.Aaditya has been in active politics since 2010 when he was launched by his late grandfather and Sena supremo Bal Thackeray. He started heading Yuva Sena, the party’s youth wing, and was elevated Sena ‘neta’ in 2018. The first Thackeray to ever contest elections became a minister in December 2019. Political analysts said, unlike his father, Aaditya had an interest in politics from an early age and was groomed for it.On January 10, Aaditya chaired a virtual meeting of leaders, including chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut, Vinayak Raut, Uday Samant, and Anil Desai, to decide on the strategy for the Goa Assembly polls. While Sanjay Raut has been driving the discussions for an alliance, it is Aaditya who is keen on getting a foothold in the bordering coastal state, party insiders said. With the Sena contesting in UP and Goa, Aaditya is expected to campaign in these states while Uddhav will address virtual rallies. Sanjay Raut confirmed that Aaditya will campaign in Goa.Arvind Sawant, former Union minister and Sena leader, said it is natural that Aaditya is shouldering greater responsibilities. “Uddhav ji is the Sena chief, but being the chief minister, he is occupied with the functioning of the government. So, somebody had to put in extra efforts to run the party and he [Aaditya] did. He conducted a meeting on the Goa elections, and he is working on the BMC [campaign] plan as well.” ‘Natural progression’ Political analyst Surendra Jondhale said running a coalition government would take much of Thackeray’s time. “There is a gap in communication; the connect that party leaders and workers had with the chief has reduced to some extent. Therefore, if Aaditya is taking charge of the party affairs, it is a natural progression.” A Sena leader said with Uddhav ji recovering after the surgery, Aaditya is expected to do the heavy lifting in the party under his father’s guidance. Aaditya also met West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee in Mumbai and held discussions on the possibility of a non-Bharatiya Janata Party front in 2024. Uddhav was hospitalised when his Bengal counterpart was in the city.Recently, Aaditya was instrumental in a Nationalist Congress Party-Sena alliance to wrest control of the Mumbai District Central Cooperative Bank from the BJP. This was preceded by a closed-door meeting deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had had with Aaditya where Uddhav Thackeray’s close aide Milind Narvekar was also present. The Sena had three directors on the board while the NCP had eight against the BJP’s nine. Ironically, the Sena’s candidate for the joint chairman post lost the election.Connecting with Shiv Sainiks will be a major challenge for Aaditya as he has been in his father’s shadow, Jondhale said. “The Sena grew by taking up the local causes and addressing the day-to-day issues of the people. Today the character of the party has changed; the demography has altered. The party is now in governance mode which is conducive for Aaditya. The challenge, however, would be to connect with the common Shiv Sainik.” Following in father’s footstepsUddhav had in 1997 taken the reins of the functioning in the BMC and prepared the strategy for the civic body election. Similarly, Aaditya was involved in the planning for the corporation poll in 2017. This time, the Thackeray scion aims to win 150 of the 227 seats in Asia’s richest civic body with an annual budget of ₹39,000 crore (2021-22).Since the beginning of this month, the chief minister has virtually launched three projects where Aaditya was present. Thackeray kicked off 2022 by announcing a waiver of the property tax on residential units of up to 500 square feet located within the Mumbai corporation limits. He then participated in the Sena’s pet project, Coastal Road work, and later launched the BMC’s digital chatbot.While announcing the property tax waiver, Thackeray said, “One cannot forget our roots while handling the responsibility of the chief ministership.” He was referring to the civic body, which gave the Sena political power and played a major role in its growth.Thackeray added, “I remember the days when Shiv Sena Pramukh [Bal Thackeray] used to inspect road construction, nallah cleaning, and beautification work. I grew seeing him do that and I also went to see road construction which at that time was carried out after midnight... Today, almost all my stress and burden has been taken over by Aaditya.”With the BJP expected to throw all its might to take control of the civic body, the Sena is planning to reach the halfway mark from its current 97 members. According to Sena insiders, the focus is on the 23 seats which it lost by a margin of around 1,000-1,500 votes in 2017. Of the 23 seats, around 18 seats are in suburbs where Aaditya is the guardian minister.“The Yuva Sena has been given the responsibility of 40 electoral wards where young population is significant,” a Sena functionary, who did not wish to be named, said.BMC poll a leadership testSawant said Aaditya has become a “seasoned” player now. “He knows the city and its issues very well; he knows the capability of party workers. It is the right time to give the responsibility to someone from the Thackeray clan. Otherwise, nobody will respect him.” Anil Desai, party secretary and Rajya Sabha MP. said Aaditya has taken a keen interest in the party affairs, and elections. “Uddhav ji took the lead in the 1997 BMC election under Balasaheb’s supervision. Aaditya has been active since 2017; the Mumbai University senate election victory came under his leadership. He is the mainstay of the Sena and the Yuva Sena.” Political analysts said the BMC election will be the litmus test for Aaditya as the BJP is expected to campaign with the Prime Minister, Union ministers, and even a few chief ministers. “Aaditya will have to be ready to face the BJP’s might in full force,” Hemant Desai, another political analyst, said.
23-01-2022||Mumbai||Shiv Sena wasted 25 years in alliance with BJP: Uddhav Thackeray||MUMBAI: Shiv Sena wasted 25 years in its alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said Uddhav Thackeray in a virtual address to party workers on Sunday, the 96th birth anniversary of Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray. It was also Thackeray’s first address to his party ahead of the forthcoming statewide municipal elections. “I reiterate that we wasted 25 years (of the party) in the alliance (with the BJP),” he said. He attacked the BJP – with whom the Sena first came together in 1994 – saying it used its local partners for politics and “threw them out at their convenience.” He said BJP’s Hindutva is “nothing but a charade for power.” He termed BJP’s idea of Hindutva as “hollow.” “It is unfortunate that we nurtured them for 25 years... We did not leave Hindutva and will never do so. We left BJP and not Hindutva. BJP is not synonymous with Hindutva... We wanted power to promote Hindutva. We did not use Hindutva to get power.” Challenging the BJP to not use central agencies against Shiv Sena and political opponents in Maharashtra, Thackeray said. “[Union Home Minister] Amit Shah came to Pune and challenged us to contest alone. We have accepted that challenge in our Dussehra rally. But while fighting, you must not use your power. We too will not use our power as a ruling party in the state. If you have the courage, contest on the strength of your workers. Merely challenging us and putting ED (Enforcement Directorate) and other agencies is not courage.” Reacting to Thackeray’s attack on the BJP, party leader Atul Bhatkhalkar said, “Thackeray’s speech was full of hatred for the BJP and loaded with contradictory statements. If he thinks they rotted in the alliance with us for 25 years, why have they not been able to perform in the recent local body elections? If he says his face was used by us at the national level, why is his party not able to win a single seat in other states? It is nothing but the jealousy about us that he keeps targeting the BJP. He should first introspect if has any respect in the three-party alliance and why Congress leaders including Rahul Gandhi did not pay tribute to Bal Thackeray. People of Maharashtra and even his own party workers understand and evaluate everything in politics.” Thackeray meanwhile told party leaders and workers to contest elections all the way from the gram panchayat level and district cooperative banks to Lok Sabha. Thackeray also directed party leaders to build cooperative institutions at the village level to build the party’s base just as the its alliance partners Congress and NCP have. Thackeray’s statements on elections came a few days after the results of Nagar Panchayat polls were declared, where Sena came fourth among all the state’s major political parties, including the BJP, NCP and Congress. The Sena chief remarked that party leaders and workers do not contest local polls with the same intensity as they fight Lok Sabha or Assembly polls. “We do not contest the smaller elections as other parties do,” he said. “I am responsible for this, but we should not let this happen again.” He said though the party came fourth in the recent elections, it won its biggest tally, “higher than when we were in an alliance with BJP.” To be sure, Shiv Sena is largely regarded as an urban party. Therefore, in a bid to build its rural presence, the Sena chief said they must focus on building institutions. “Our opponents or allies have built institutions at the village level. What are we doing in the cooperative sector? How many institutions have we founded,” he remarked. The Sena boss added that the party must build its presence in other states and create a “wave” to “capture” Delhi, which, he said, was Sena founder Bal Thackeray’s dream. Thackeray used the occasion to clarify about this health and his extended absence from key official meetings which came under criticism from the BJP. “The past few months were spent in recovery after my surgery. I am still undergoing physiotherapy. But soon, I will step out and tour Maharashtra. I will show the power of saffron to our opponents who are worried about my health. Like they say there is a caretaker government, they are a caretaker opposition, and they will self-destruct; we need not worry about them,” he said. Thackeray slammed the BJP stating that its Hindutva changed “as per the party’s convenience,” and that “the BJP killed democracy to gain power.” He said, “Our Hindutva does not change as per convenience. If you have the courage, then have one standard from Kashmir to Kanyakumari... What we did was in broad daylight, not before sunrise. We took oath at ShivTeerth in front of everybody. At many places, you topple governments, indulge in horsetrading to install your government. Do you consider this democracy?” Political observers said Thackeray may have successfully used the occasion to send out a strong message about his health and his capacity to govern the state and lead the party. Hemant Desai, a Mumbai based political analyst said, “Besides taking on the BJP strongly, Thackeray’s appearance on Sunday will help boosting his party’s morale after the concern over his health. Political corridors were abuzz with his alternatives, but he clarified that he will soon begin touring Maharashtra. I think the speech will encourage Shiv Sena’s rank and file.” Another political commentator Prakash Akolkar said, “Thackeray has dared the BJP on the eve of the local body elections, especially the corporation elections in Mumbai and Pune. By challenging the BJP to not use the central agencies, he has tried to send out a message that the ruling party at the Centre uses sneaky means to gain power. He also attacked the BJP saying it is their policy to use and throw the local partners. His public appearance after two months in a cheerful avatar will help in galvanising party workers.” 
23-01-2022||Mumbai||Dismissed constable, three aides arrested for extortion||Mumbai: A 52-year-old dismissed police constable and his three associates were arrested by the Mumbai crime branch on Saturday for allegedly extorting Rs. 1 lakh from a south Mumbai shopkeeper. The main accused, Chandrakant Madhukar Gaware, was dismissed from the force in 2020. The other three are Yogesh Lad, 43, Kundan Kadam, and Gyaneshwar Kunte, 51. According to the police, on January 20, two persons known to the shop owner in Pydhonie gave him ₹4.10 lakh for safekeeping. Around 6.30 p.m., the four accused approached the shopkeeper claiming themselves to be crime branch officers. Gaware was even carrying handcuffs. They threatened to arrest him saying that people kept their illegal money at his shop, said police inspector Srimant Shinde, crime branch unit 2. The accused then asked for a settlement and took Rs. 1 lakh from the shopkeeper. Later, the victim registered an FIR at Pydhonie police station. The crime branch unit 2 started a parallel investigation. CCTV footage showed the four had got into a car and headed towards Mohammad Ali Road, the officer said. The four were identified and the police arrested Gaware and Lad at the former’s residence in Nalasopara. Based on their interrogation, Kadam and Kunte were arrested in Borivali. The accused were later handed over to the Pydhonie police. Using the same modus operandi, Gaware, Lad and two others robbed gold worth Rs. 24 lakh from a jeweller in Borivali in August 2017. They were arrested. Following a departmental inquiry in 2020, Gaware was dismissed, Mr. Shinde said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/dismissed-constable-three-aides-arrested-for-extortion-101642961404133.html
23-01-2022||Mumbai||IITs offer scholarships to attract more female students to engineering||Mumbai Lack of gender parity in classrooms of the premier Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) was the reason behind the introduction of supernumerary seats across the 23 IITs. While a majority of the institutes have managed to achieve the target of 20% female admissions by 2020-21 academic year, the institutes are still working towards increasing the intake of female candidates over the next few years.Be it conducting outreach programmes in schools around their institute, offering scholarships to admitted female students or inviting parents of female students for special interactive sessions, IITs are including new ways to achieve gender parity across their classes.“IIT Delhi has been taking proactive measures to attract more female students to the institute, including women-oriented scholarships that have been instituted in the recent past. The Initiative for Gender Equity and Sensitisation (IGES) under the institute aims to create a safe educational atmosphere for all. IGES also advocates a zero-tolerance policy against sexual harassment,” said a spokesperson for IIT Delhi. Most institutes, including IIT Delhi and Bombay, have also approved the setting up of new female-only hostels on campus to accommodate the growing female student population.In 2017, intake of girls in B Tech programmes at IITs was a mere 9.3%. In 2018, the IIT admissions council decided to introduce supernumerary seats for female students with the addition of 800 (14%) seats across 23 IITs in 2018 while the number stood at 946 (17%) female-only seats across IITs in 2019. The aim was to ensure that female enrolment reaches a target of at least 20% of the undergraduate class by 2020. In 2021, however, the Joint Admission Board (JAB) decided to allow individual IITs to decide the female intake, especially since the 20% target has been achieved. The new rule meant IITs can set their own target of female intake for the 2021-22 academic year, as long as enrolment in each IIT is at least 20%. Most IITs stuck to the 20% target once again this year as well, while some managed to surpass the target.IIT Bombay has 1,360 seats out of which 156 seats are for female candidates only. At IIT Delhi, the total intake was at 1,221 and female only seats stood at 249 (20%), while at IIT Madras, 20.27% of the seats in BTech and 22.59% seats in dual degree courses for female candidates.“Special sessions are arranged for interaction with parents of girl applicants at IIT Hyderabad. Female faculty members and Women cell conveners took initiative to explain the prospects and career profiles for various departments. We also plan to invite girls from schools in the region on International Women’s Day to visit IIT and interact with students and faculty to raise their interest to join BTech programs in IITs,” said a spokesperson for IIT Hyderabad, where the female intake ratio stands at 20.77% this year. IIT Mandi gives a full tuition fee waiver to all undergraduate female students. Female students are also provided with a stipend of Rs1000 per month, subject to academic performance, said Rahul Vaish, dean of Academic Affairs, IIT Mandi, where the female intake stands at 20.67% this year.Some IITs have also started paying special attention to married female candidates who apply for PhD courses. “Institute is increasing the female students’ leadership positions at several levels including various academic and non-academic clubs and activities to create an inclusive and intellectually competitive environment for the female students. For postgraduate studies, married female students are supported with a full-time day-care centre and married students hostel and preferences are given to the female students with children for availing these facilities,” said Prof Bithiah Jagannath, Associate Dean Academic (Student Affairs), IIT Guwahati.While most IITs have managed to achieve the target over the last few years, some newer IITs still need to match this target. Some of the newer IITs have less than 10% seats filled up by female students, and what makes it worse is their off-beat location attracts fewer female students to the campus. “I had cleared JEE in 2018, and during seat allotments I was placed in IIT Goa, which I didn’t accept because it was not the course of my choice and the IIT itself is far from city-life, which was a turn-off. I appeared for Joint Entrance Exam (JEE) once again in 2019 and managed to get a seat in 2019 in IIT Bombay, which I accepted. It is important to have a life beyond the campus in IITs and that can only be achieved by studying in institutes with city life around,” said a UG BTech student, on condition of anonymity.
23-01-2022||Mumbai||Hospitalisations, cases dip; schools set to reopen||Mumbai With the state ready to open schools from Monday, the state continued to witness a drop in hospitalisation and a fall in cases in urban areas. However, the state continued to report a daily caseload of over 40,000 at 40,805 on Sunday. Barring a few districts like Pune, Aurangabad and Ahmednagar, schools in most parts of the state are scheduled to reopen on Monday. The state government has sought to assuage the concerns voiced by the section of parents who fear the risk of infection. State environment Minister and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray’s son Aaditya Thackeray stated that there was no compulsion to send their wards to schools. “It is on the parents to decide whether they want to send their wards to school or not. Those who feel it is risky, should not send their children. The schools are starting and it is now on both the school management and parents to decide on the future course of action,” he added. He said that schools have been closed for more than 700 days and the reopening is looked at as the beginning of the reopening activities after partial curbs were imposed in the first week of January.According to the weekly report presented by the state government, the number of hospital admissions has decreased to 20,552 on January 18 from 29,110 on January 10. The number of patients dependent on liquid oxygen outside the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) has decreased to 3,749 from 3,900 during the same period.Dr Wiqar Shaikh, professor of medicine, Grant Medical College and Sir JJ Hospital lauded the step. “Parents should not be worried about sending their children to school. They should not panic as Covid is here to stay and we need to learn to live with the virus. Students have suffered a lot in the last two years as online education is a very poor alternative to physically attending school,” said Shaikh.Maharashtra reported no new case of Omicron variant on Sunday. The total number of Omicron cases reached 2,759. So far, 1,437 cases have been discharged following a negative RT-PCR test.On Sunday, Maharashtra reported 44 fatalities, pushing the toll to 1,42,115.

Speaking during a felicitation ceremony organised by traders, Gosha said Navjot Sidhu should apologise to the people for the statements of his chief adviser. He went on to say that Mustafa’s statements prove that the Congress, especially Navjot Sidhu, is “working with Pakistan”.“It is very unfortunate and not tolerable at all. If people decide to do this, the central government should keep tabs on such people, check their phones and also keep an on their close associates.

23-01-2022||Mumbai||Nitin Raut seeks CM’s intervention for recovery of ₹9,138 cr from two departments||Mumbai: Amid the rising debt on the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Corporation Limited (MSEDCL), state energy minister Nitin Raut has sought chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s intervention for the recovery of dues from government departments. Two departments - rural development and urban development - owe MSEDCL ₹ 9,138 crore against the electricity used for the water supply scheme and streetlights. The minister has also said power connection for the scheme will be disconnected if the bills are not paid. Raut, in his letter to the CM, highlighted the poor financial health of the company. He said in the event of MSEDCL disconnecting the electricity connection, not only will the government have to face the ire of the people, even his party Congress will be seen in a bad light. “The outstanding dues for the water supply scheme is ₹ 2,607 crore while it is ₹ 6,316 crore for the streetlights. Despite repeated meetings with deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and officials from the two departments, the dues are mounting every month. Against the current month bills of ₹ 380 crore and ₹ 857 crore towards water supply and streetlights respectively, the departments have paid just ₹ 7 and ₹ 4 crore,” the letter said, adding bills were also scrutinised following complaints of inflated dues. MSEDCL supplies electricity to 28 million residential, agricultural, commercial and industrial consumers in the state. The pandemic, natural calamities, shortage of coal, and unpaid bills have led to a manifold rise in the dues in the last two years. The dues from customers amount to more than ₹ 50,000 crore, including ₹ 41, 175 crore from the agricultural pumps. “The debts have mounted on MSEDCL to ₹45,591 crore while it owes ₹13,486 crore to the power generation companies. Besides, the outstanding from the state government for the subsidies it offers to industries, including powerloom, textiles and units in D category areas, is ₹7,978 crore. Non-payment of power purchase bills has been leading to interest on the company,” Raut said. The minister has requested the CM to direct the two departments to clear their dues immediately. An official from the rural development department said the bills have not been paid on account of the shortfall in the budgetary allocation amid the economic crisis caused by Covid-19. “The outstanding of the electricity bills is an internal adjustment. The budgetary allocations are curtailed by 20% to 30%. In such a scenario, payments are prioritised and the dues to other departments are put on hold,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nitin-raut-seeks-cm-s-intervention-for-recovery-of-9-138-cr-from-two-departments-101642960803937.html

23-01-2022||Pune||‘Pune’s rising Covid cases to spill over rural areas in a fortnight; wave to ebb by Feb-end’||PUNE The Covid-19 infections in Pune is now on a steep rise, the number of cases being reported has touched to over 16,0000 daily and experts say that the district is likely to report over 20,000 new Covid-19 cases in the coming days.“The district’s third Covid-19 wave peak will finally begin to ebb by mid-February and by the end of February we will be able to resume most economic activities without much restrictions,” said Dr Subhash Salunkhe, Covid-19 advisor to the state.In Mumbai, meanwhile, by the third week of December last year, they had started witnessing a drastic surge in the number of new Covid-19 cases as the doubling rate fell down to one or two days. The rise was so steep that within two weeks, the cases had peaked to a new high and on January 7, Mumbai saw the highest daily new cases recorded, more than 20,000 cases and by January 9 the city reported its highest number of active cases.Dr Salunkhe, said, “Similar to Mumbai, Pune will also see the number of new Covid-19 cases peak at 20,000 daily. In the next fortnight, Pune’s cases will see a spill over in the 15 days in the rural areas and by February 10 we would see the peak in the number of new cases. However, by the end of the next month, we will be able to resume economic activities without much restrictions; however, it would still remain compulsory to follow all the necessary Covid appropriate behaviour.”Dr Salunkhe further added that as new Covid-19 cases increase the rate of hospitalisation is bound to rise. He further added, “The number of admissions on ventilators, ICU beds and also deaths. However, the number of deaths and hospitalisations would not be anywhere close to those reported during the second wave driven by the Delta variant.“Also, we have to be aware of the sub-variant being reported in the UK and also of the fact that Delta is also circulating along with Omicron and a new variant could also emerge. However, I am also sure that even if a new variant comes along, it may be more transmissible but not more virulent,” he said.In the second wave, Mumbai saw its highest number of active cases on April 11 at 91,100 which in the third wave peaked at 1,17,437 which was on January 9.Pune district reported its highest active cases on April 19 at 1,25,096 cases which is estimated that in the upcoming wave Pune may report 1,87,644 active cases out of this 65% would remain isolated at home, 35% would have to be admitted out of which 50% would be admitted in government hospitals. Based on this estimation, the district might fall short of over 700 ventilators and 3,800 oxygen beds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/punes-rising-covid-cases-to-spill-over-rural-areas-in-a-fortnight-wave-to-ebb-by-febend-101642959843671.html
23-01-2022||Lucknow||UP polls: Maya, her brother, SC Mishra on BSP list of star campaigners||The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) on Sunday announced its list of 30 star campaigners for the first phase assembly election in Uttar Pradesh. Anand Kumar, the brother BSP chief Mayawati who is the national vice president of the party, is among the star campaigners of the party along with Mayawati, party national general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra, sector in-charges of the party Munkad Ali, Shamsuddin Raini, former minister Nakul Dubey and other senior BSP leaders. Akash Anand, the BSP chief’s nephew who holds the post of the national coordinator in the party organisation, does not figure the list of the star campaigners submitted to the Election Commission of India by BSP national general secretary Mewalal Gautam.Akash was in the list of party’s star campaigners for the 2019 Lok Sabha election. He had then campaigned extensively for the party. When Mayawati was unwell during the campaign, he had addressed public meetings with alliance partner Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav in various districts.On her 66th birthday programme on January 15 Mayawati had said, “The BSP is preparing Akash Anand for bigger role in the party. He is young and gaining political maturity. The party has entrusted him with the task of spreading the base of the party in the states where assembly elections will be held later. At an appropriate time, Akash will get an opportunity to contest the election.” Mayawati had said she was against the promotion of the family in the party. “The leaders will get post in the organisation according to their performance and not on the basis of being relatives of senior leaders. I have no family but the people from suppressed community for whom the BSP is working since its launch call me ‘behanji’ (sister). A certain section of the media is trying to project as if I am promoting my family in the politics,” she had said. “Akash Anand along with Kapil Mishra, who is heading the party’s youth Prabuddh Varg wing and is son of the party national general secretary SC Mishra, is working to connect the youth with the BSP. The BSP is working to win the support of the youth by giving young leaders positions in the party organisation and raising the issues associated with the youth,” she said. Anand Kumar along with Akash Anand was present in Lucknow during the birthday celebrations of Mayawati.
23-01-2022||Lucknow||Covid surge: AKTU defers Feb exams to March||Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University (AKTU) has decided to postpone first and second year semester exams to March in view of surge in Covid cases. These exams were scheduled in February but now will be conducted in March, an official said.“I have given instructions to examination section to conduct first and second year exams in March now as Covid cases are quite high,” said newly appointed AKTU vice chancellor professor Pradeep Kumar Mishra.Controller of exams, AKTU, Anurag Tripathi said, “We are going to finalise everything related to exams by Monday and students will be properly informed through a circular. There are roughly 1.25 lakh students for whom the exam will now be held in March instead of February.”The students, however, want university to hold online exam instead of offline in February itself because they fear that postponement of exam will further delay the session or will reduce duration of next semester to just two months instead of usual five to six months.The university, however, has not decided whether to hold online or offline exam in March. The vice chancellor at time of assuming office earlier this month had told media persons that if Covid-19 cases remained high, the university will prefer to opt for online exam as holding offline exams especially at a time when Covid cases were on the rise across the state will put lives of students to risk.Prof Mishra said, “Students’ health and their safety is paramount. I’m not in favour of offline exams in Covid-19 times,” he said. The V-C is likely to meet governor Anandiben Patel on Monday. On Saturday, the state government had extended closure of all educational institutions till January 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/covid-surge-aktu-defers-feb-exams-to-march-101642959063571.html
23-01-2022||Pune||Covid cases hitting new high but Punekars fearless||PUNE Naina Upadhyay and her friends sip juice at a roadside stall on Fergusson College road even as an ambulance passes by, siren blaring. Neither Upadhyay nor her friends pay so much as a second glance before returning to their conversation.However, their reaction is not unlike that of a majority of Punekars although it is incongruous with the current climate of daily Covid-19 cases hitting the 16,000 mark amidst a third wave, which is said to be steeper than both its predecessors.So why are citizens not as afraid of Covid-19 as they were before? Or why is the civic administration (seemingly) not as worried about the situation as it was before?A major reason, according to experts, is the mildness of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 in the third wave coupled with high vaccine coverage due to which the people’s attitude towards the virus has changed drastically since the second wave. In April 2021 when Pune was grappling with the second wave, nearly 14.1% of the total active cases required oxygen. Currently, only 0.58% of the total active cases require oxygen. The fatalities too are only 0.1% as compared to more than 10% during the second wave. Dr Sanjeev Wavare, assistant medical officer, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), said, “The severity of cases in the third wave is almost negligible. Hospitalisation has dropped to 5%. Oxygen bed requirement is less than 1% and ventilator requirement is as low as 0.5%.”People’s attitude towards the virus has changed due to lower hospitalisation rates and a lower death rate during the third wave. This in turn has been facilitated by vaccination. At the peak of the second wave in Maharashtra in April, only health workers and some frontline workers (which accounted for only 2% of the population) were fully vaccinated. Today, 72% of the population is fully vaccinated. Hundred per cent of adults in Pune have received their first dose while 80 to 85 per cent of adults have also taken their second dose, Dr Wavare said. As fear, which is the main motivator, is absent, the streets are far more crowded than they were during the second wave.Dr Bhooshan Shukla, child and adolescent psychiatrist, said that the city could use its past experience to tackle the third wave without panicking. “Due to the rising cases, people should be careful and vigilant and not panic as we have already overcome the first and second wave of Covid,” he said.Not only are many people not wearing masks and flouting Covid-19 norms, many restaurants too are not complying with the 50% capacity guideline.“I think it is the genetic code of India not to abide by or follow the rules made by the government. People don’t wear masks or abide by rules because they think rules are meant to be broken,” said Dr Shukla.There is also a general perception among people that they do not now need to follow rules as they are fully vaccinated. The absence of lockdowns, too, has downplayed the seriousness of coronavirus for many.“Many people have told me that they believe that the virus is gone. It’s a hoax,” said Roshan Patil, programme associate (schools). “People believe that no lockdown means that there is no virus,” he said.Yet another view is that getting infected is unavoidable despite taking all precautions. Pradyumna Kalagi, a post-graduate student, said, “No amount of precaution is enough. A relative of mine did not leave his home for weeks and followed all the precautionary measures but still tested positive for Covid-19.”Meanwhile, Dr Vijay Natarajan, CEO, Symbiosis University Hospital and Research Centre, said, “Vaccinating the population is the only way out.” Dr Natarajan is of the view that the entire population should be inoculated with the booster dose and that the third dose should be administered to the younger and working population rather than senior citizens as the former is more likely to be infected. “A lot of the government’s decisions are based on logistics instead of scientific reasoning and that should change. That applies to how the central and state governments are implementing Covid-19 restrictions,” he said. Dr Natarajan welcomed the decision to keep schools closed in Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-cases-hitting-new-high-but-punekars-fearless-101642958763674.html

In fact, Akhilesh ji even did a rally for us in this constituency on November 27.”On Saturday, Akhilesh Yadav had announced the induction of Rita Singh, the wife of former Samajwadi Party MLA from Sandila, and Supriya Aron, the former mayor of Bareilly, into the party. At the joining event, he had also announced that Supriya will be the Samajwadi Party candidate on the Bareilly Cantt seat while Rita Singh will the party candidate in Sandila.“Those who are joining today will also face the polls,” Akhilesh had remarked and then mentioned the seats for Supriya Aron and Rita Singh. A person aware of the matter in the SP said that after Akhilesh Yadav had made the announcement on Saturday, the party decided to field Rita Singh from one of the Lucknow seats.“Ritaji’s late husband was Sandila MLA (he won the seat on the SP ticket in 2012), but she has her roots and family in Lucknow. The party will field her on Lucknow Cantt or some other Lucknow seat.”Rita Singh, the wife of the late Raja Mahavir Singh who won the Sandila seat on the SP ticket in 2012, is from the famous Bhargava family of Lucknow. She is the daughter of the late Rani Ramkumar Bhargava, a freedom fighter and Congress leader. Rita Singh’s brother Luv Bhargava was earlier the state general secretary of the Samajwadi Party. Luv Bhargava had contested on the Lucknow East seat in the 1993 UP assembly polls as an SP candidate.

From the next fiscal, we will further strengthen the system,” he added.Choudhary said that there is usually a delay in payment due to fund allotment hold-ups, but it gets further delayed due to procedural issues at the level of deputy development commissioners and block development officers. “Now the effort is to streamline the system and hopefully the department will directly disburse emoluments through CFMS from the new fiscal,” he added.Of the ₹72.32 crore, ₹32 crore would go towards payment to mukhia/up- mukhia/ ward members. Bihar government gives fixed monthly emolument of ₹12,000 to district board chairman, ₹10,000 each to vice-chairman and pramukh and ₹5,000 to up-pramukh. The district board member, mukhia, and sarpanch get ₹2,500 each, up-mukhia ₹1,200 and panchayat samiti member gets ₹1,000. Ward members and panch get ₹500 each.“From the new fiscal the government wants to bring in a lot of changes to transform rural governance with greater accountability and for that efforts are on to develop a proper ecosystem for transparency so that the benefits reach the people in desired measure and quality of work is regularly monitored. People should get the facilities in the panchayats itself,” he said, adding the elected woman representatives would no more be allowed to participate in any meeting through their representatives, as it happened before.“The woman representatives would have to themselves participate in the meetings, as they are only authorised for that. We receive complaints of representatives (husband or family member) of woman elected representatives attending the meeting. The officials have been directed to ensure participation of woman representatives in the meetings,” he further added.Bihar has 8,387 panchayats and 38 district boards. The panchayat elections were completed in December 2021. The new representatives have already taken the oath.

A dispute erupted after they refused to vacate the spot, which turned into a clash, in which one person was injured and a few others, including the minister’s son Niraj Kumar and his brother Harendra Prasad, from the other group, also received injuries,” said the SDPO.According to the mother of the injured, identified as Janardan Kumar, the incident occurred when her son along with dozen of children was playing cricket near an orchard. “Four to five men, including the minister’s son arrived with guns and sticks on a vehicle and started thrashing them. My son received injuries after being hit by the minister’s son with the butt of a gun. My son is now admitted at government medical college and hospital (GMCH),” said the mother Rina Devi. Video images that emerged from the village showed villagers chasing the minister’s son and thrashing him. Tourism minister Narayan Prasad said that some people were encroaching his orchard in the village. “When they reached to stop them, they misbehaved with my brother (Harendra Prasad). On hearing this, my son rushed to the spot and he was attacked. Villagers also snatched our licensed arms and damaged the vehicle,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-tourism-minister-s-son-injures-man-101642957623515.html
23-01-2022||Mumbai||Kamala building fire: Electrical audit for buildings above 5 floors likely to become mandatory||Mumbai: The Mumbai Fire Brigade has said an annual electrical safety audit, on the lines of biannual fire audit, might become compulsory for buildings above 15 metres or of five floors. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation and the fire brigade are in talks with the state government in this regard. The move comes in the backdrop of frequent fires in high-rises caused by defective electric wiring. On Saturday, a major fire at the 20-storey Kamala Building in Tardeo claimed six lives and left 24 injured. According to the fire brigade, they have jointly held a meeting with the state electrical inspector along with BMC officials. Hemant Parab, Chief Fire Officer, said the general opinion is residential societies should be asked to conduct an electrical audit. “The electrical inspector can make such an audit mandatory once a year. We will also give them inputs in formulating such a policy considering this will bring down the fire incidents in the city.” Parab added, “In many fire incidents, defective electric wires are either the cause, or contribute to spreading the blaze. Hence, we need to fix this issue for which we will require periodic electrical audits.”In October 2021, a major fire was reported at Avighna Park, a 60- storey building at Currey Road. One person was killed. The fire brigade had said that the primary cause of the blaze was short circuit. In case of Saturday’s incident, though the fire was on the 19th floor, wiring in the electric duct was damaged due to which power supply in the entire building was cut off. On the investigation, Parab said, “During any blaze, the fire and smoke spread to upper floors but in this case, the smoke and heat were vented rapidly to the lower floors. We are investigating what could be the cause for this and whether it was due to some layer or due to the weather.”Meanwhile, fire officials on Sunday said they will conduct an inquiry into the incident and submit a report in 15 days. The probe has not started yet considering the residents are in a state of panic. The inquiry will look into three aspects: cause of fire, reasons for the spread of the fire, and illegal addition or alteration in the building, if any.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kamala-building-fire-electrical-audit-for-buildings-above-5-floors-likely-to-become-mandatory-101642957566954.html
23-01-2022||Mumbai||Govandi gang-rape: Two arrested, two minors detained||Mumbai: The Shivaji Nagar police arrested two persons and detained two minors on Sunday for allegedly gang-raping a 19-year-old girl. Ramzan Ali Qureshi, 19, and Sajid Malik, 19, were arrested in Uran while they were preparing to flee. The minors were hiding in the Deonar dumping ground. All the four were acquaintances of the victim, the police said. According to the police, the victim is a resident of Shivaji Nagar in Govandi and works for a catering company. When she was returning home around 4.30 a.m. on Saturday, the four intercepted her. One of them asked why she was out at that hour and on the pretext of questioning, he took her to a nearby vacant hut. The four then raped her. After they left, the girl called up the police control room. She was brought to the police station by Nirbhaya squad officers after a medical check-up. She kept changing her statement as she was in a state of shock. The police set up 10 teams to nab the culprits. “All the four have been charged with gang-rape under sections of the Indian Penal Code,” Arjun Rajane, senior police inspector of Shivaji Nagar police station, said. The minors were presented before the Juvenile Justice Board and sent to the Dongri children’s home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/govandi-gang-rape-two-arrested-two-minors-detained-101642957443516.html
23-01-2022||Lucknow||UP polls: BJP makes fresh campaign pitch with women politicians||Union minister for information and broadcasting Anurag Thakur, who has been coining interesting slogans to target the main opposition Samajwadi Party, on Sunday made a fresh campaign pitch for the UP polls with women politicians who have joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) from other parties. After standing at the busy Hazratganj crossing with five-member teams holding placards with slogans like women’s safety written on them, Anurag Thakur again took to the streets on a cold Sunday afternoon. This time, he was with a delegation of women leaders, three of whom have made news by their joining the BJP ahead of the UP polls. The delegation included Aparna Yadav, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav’s sister-in-law who recently joined the BJP in Delhi, Congress’ rebel lawmaker from Rae Bareli Aditi Singh who joined the BJP, and Priyanka Maurya, who till recently was on the posters of the Congress’ ‘Ladki Hoon Lad Sakti Hoon (I am a woman and can accept a challenge)’. Priyanka Maurya has also joined the BJP ahead of the UP polls.Holding placards with women safety slogans written on them, Anurag Thakur and the women politicians held door-to-door campaigns in Hazratganj and Lalbagh areas before arriving at the BJP office. Aditi Singh, named as the BJP candidate from Rae Bareli, is among the 26 women to have found a place in the list of 195 candidates that the party has declared in four tranches so far. Aditi has been fielded from the same Rae Bareli (Sadar) seat from where she won in the 2017 UP polls.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had launched a women centric poll campaign in Uttar Pradesh, declaring 40 per cent tickets to women candidates. The BJP is also up against a spirited Samajwadi Party (SP) and is seeking to target it on the issues of women’s safety. The participation of women voters has steadily increased in UP, from 47 per cent in the 60s to around 60 per cent in 2019, the reason why all parties are wooing women, say experts. There is a buzz about the Congress mulling fielding Priyanka Gandhi Vadra from Rae Bareli. Through Aditi, the BJP has targeted the Congress leader and her party’s pitch on ensuring women safety. Priyanka Maurya, too, has left the Congress after mocking the party’s campaign “Ladki Hoon, Lad Sakti Hoon”. She has accused the party of denying her a ticket.In Aparna Yadav’s presence, Anurag Thakur hit out at the previous SP government for faring poorly on women security during its tenure.Aparna Yadav herself kept gesturing at her placard that read “bahu beti suraksha aur adhikar (safety and share to daughter and daughter-in-law).” “It is the BJP where both Mulayam Singh Yadav’s bahu Aparna Yadav or Swami Prasad Maurya’s daughter Sanghmitra Maurya feel safe,” Thakur has been stating.Swami Prasad Maurya, the OBC leader that BJP imported from the BSP ahead of the 2017 UP polls, has now walked out of the BJP and joined the SP. But his daughter Sanghmitra continues to be a BJP MP from Badaun. The BJP has rolled out Kamal clubs and has entered the campaign with slogans like “atmanirbhar naari hamara sankalp, ujjawal bhavishya yahi vikalp (committed to making women self-dependent, this is the only alternative to a brighter future). BJP leaders like Union home minister Amit Shah, chief minister Yogi Adityanath and the party’s state chief Swatantra Dev have all been talking of women safety.

23-01-2022||Chandigarh||Money laundering: Punjab minister Rana Gurjeet urges Sonia to expel Sukhpal Khaira||Punjab minister Rana Gurjeet Singh on Sunday urged Congress president Sonia Gandhi to expel former Bholath legislator Sukhpal Singh Khaira from the party for his alleged involvement in “drug money” laundering. The appeal comes days after Khaira along with three other Punjab MLAs wrote to Sonia, demanding Rana Gurjeet’s expulsion for alleged anti-party activities. In his letter, Rana Gurjeet said: “He (Khaira) is currently in jail... It is not a routine money laundering case of unaccounted wealth... The money in question has been made through drugs, which is unacceptable and indefensible”. Stating that the Congress has always taken a stand against drugs, the Kapurthala MLA said that party’s former president Rahul Gandhi had flagged the issue in 2015, while referring to the serious problem of drugs in Punjab. Claiming it will be difficult for Congress leaders and contestants to defend the indefensible, he said it was high time the party took a stand against giving the election ticket to anyone tainted by drug charges. “He (Khaira) is not winning anyways, and allotting the party ticket to him or any of his family members will not only send a wrong signal, but will also mean wasting a precious constituency during a crucial election,” said the Punjab minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/money-laundering-punjab-minister-rana-gurjeet-urges-sonia-to-expel-sukhpal-khaira-101642956423478.html

23-01-2022||Mumbai||Shiv Sena ‘wasted’ 25 years in alliance with BJP, says Uddhav Thackeray||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Sunday it is his belief that his party, the Shiv Sena, has “wasted” 25 years in alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He also claimed that while the Shiv Sena has now made the decision to abandon the BJP, it will never abandon Hindutva, for the “BJP is not synonymous with Hindutva”.Addressing party leaders and workers on the occasion of Sena founder late Bal Thackeray's birth anniversary on Sunday, Uddhav Thackeray said, “I reiterate that 25 years of the party were wasted in an alliance [with the BJP].”“We are criticised over leaving Hindutva,” said the Maharashtra chief minister and Shiv Sena president. “We have left BJP, not Hindutva. BJP is not synonymous with Hindutva.”Claiming that Shiv Sena's Hindutva “does not change based on convenience”, Thackeray attacked the BJP's version of Hindutva politics, calling it opportunistic.“I believe that the BJP's opportunistic Hindutva is for power,” the PTI news agency quoted the Sena chief as saying. “Those who were criticising the Emergency period are right now behind an invisible emergency in the country. And if we want to end this, the Shiv Sena is needed.”Moreover, the Maharashtra chief minister also said in his virtual address that the past couple of months had gone in his operation and medical recovery but he will soon be returning to active political campaigning soon.“My physiotherapy is still on,” said Uddhav Thackeray. “Soon, I will step out and tour the state.”Notably, the Shiv Sena fell out with BJP after the 2019 Maharashtra polls and tied up with Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress to form the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-wasted-25-years-in-alliance-with-bjp-says-uddhav-thackeray-101642953998935.html
23-01-2022||Mumbai||Fishermen duo rescues teen boys stranded in sea in seach for clams||Two fishermen rescued two 15-year-old teenagers who were stranded in the sea while searching for clams off the Satpati coast on Saturday evening.The boys, Omkar Gharat and Rohan Bhaiskar, were stuck in 6 feet deep water when the fishermen, who were fishing on a raft, spotted them. The boys were rescued and rushed to a nearby clinic and were discharged later.A group of 6 boys from Navli in Palghar had entered the water near Satpati coast in search of clams, usually found under rocks in shallow waters of the coast. The group would regularly catch clams to sell them in the local market and earn money.While 4 of them stepped away after a sizeable catch, Gharat and Bhaiskar continued their search and while doing so, the high tide set in, causing a rise in the water level. As it was getting dark, one of the boys switched on the torch on his mobile and called for help, which caught the fishermen’s attention. Pritam Meher and Sandeep Padekar were fishing when they saw the flashlight and sensed trouble.Upon reaching close to the two boys, the fishers pulled them onto the raft using ropes. “The boys had swallowed seawater and muck. If we had reached the spot late, the two would have met a watery grave,” said Meher.After the incident came to light, the Satpati gram panchayat said that it will honour Padekar and Meher on Republic Day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fishermen-duo-rescues-teen-boys-stranded-in-sea-in-seach-for-clams-101642955523614.html

The body still remains unidentified. However, the family of Kirit Kantharia, a 45-year-old resident of the building who has been missing since the tragic incident, has sought a DNA test before claiming the unidentified body. Kirit’s brother Yogesh will visit the BYL Nair Hospital on Monday to give his blood samples for the DNA procedure. “We have conducted the autopsy and kept a molar tooth and femur bone which will be sent to the forensic laboratory in Kalina along with the blood samples of the claimant,” said Dr Pawan Sable, head of the forensic department at the hospital.The friends and relatives of the Kantharia family examined the CCTV footage of the Kamala building and a neighbouring building to check if Kirit had stepped out anywhere before the fire. A relative said that he had some mental health issues. “We still have hopes,” said a relative Suketu Shah. “We don’t know if he went out somewhere before the fire. We just want to be sure before we claim the unidentified body. The DNA analysis will be helpful,” said Shah. On Saturday, the doctors could ascertain that the unidentified body was of a male. However, since the body was in a completely charred condition, none of the relatives could complete the identification process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kamala-building-fire-one-body-remains-unidentified-family-seeks-dna-test-101642954263422.html
23-01-2022||Chandigarh||Canadian MP Brad Vis backs petition for direct flights to Amritsar||Canadian MP Brad Vis has sponsored a petition in the House of Commons to push for direct flights from Vancouver and Toronto to Sri Guru Ram Das Jee International Airport in Amritsar, a long-pending demand of the Punjabi diaspora.Vis represents Mission-Matsqui-Fraser Canyon constituency of British Columbia in the Canadian parliament and is the shadow minister for Pacific Economic Development. Vis in a statement released on his social media channels said: “Many constituents in my riding and throughout all of British Columbia have family ties to Punjab, India. Despite the demand, direct flights from Vancouver and Abbotsford (both in BC) to Amritsar still do not exist. I am proud to support the FlyAmritsar Initiative’s House of Commons e-petition calling on the Government of Canada to explore options to create a direct flight to Amritsar.”The e-petition, which has garnered 6,500 signatures so far, was launched on Saturday by Mohit Dhanju, a resident of Surrey (British Columbia) and spokesperson of the FlyAmritsar Initiative — a civil society advocacy for connecting the Amritsar airport to destinations across the world. About the petitionThe petition urges the Federal government to leverage its ownership share in Air Canada for encouraging the company to explore direct flights from Vancouver and Toronto to Amritsar. It can be signed by citizens and residents of Canada by visiting the House of Commons website.“The House of Commons petition is a great tool for constituents to bring their issues to the notice of the Government of Canada. The petition can be signed by any Canadian citizen or resident of Canada irrespective of their age. The petition will be tabled in the Canadian Parliament when it is closed for signatures after February 11, 2022,” said Dhanju. ‘High demand for direct flights’While expressing gratitude to MP Brad Vis, FlyAmritsar Initiative’s global convener Sameep Singh Gumtala and North America convener Anantdeep Singh Dhillon urged Punjabis from across Canada to actively sign the petition.Dhillon said the petition highlights the fact that Canada has one of the largest number of immigrants from Punjab. “No airline currently provides direct flight services between Canada and Amritsar. The present travelling options are first flying to Delhi and then further travel to destinations in Punjab, either by road, rail or flying to Amritsar with a long layover at Delhi, thus adding 25-30 additional hours to an entire trip,” he said.Gumtala said numerous Canadian citizens, permanent residents, and other visa holders travel year-round from across Canada to Punjab for business, pleasure, and family reasons. “After complete Covid-19 lockdown in India during late March 2020, it was estimated that over 40,000 Canadian residents were stuck in Punjab. The huge demand for repatriation flights from Amritsar, instead of Delhi, made the Canadian government operate 25 such flights that brought back more than 7,500 Canadians,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/canadian-mp-brad-vis-backs-petition-for-direct-flights-to-amritsar-101642953004158.html
23-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: SSM to meet CEC to push for registration||To defend its case for registration as a political party before the Punjab assembly polls scheduled for February 20, farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal-led Sanyukt Samaj Morcha (SSM) has decided to meet chief election commissioner (CEC) Sushil Chandra. “We have submitted our case (for registration of our party) with the Election Commission (EC) of India as per provisions of the Representation of the People Act. The shortcomings pointed out by the EC are very minor, which we will rectify. To request timely registration of our party before the polls and allotment of the symbol from the options submitted, we are meeting the CEC,” said Prem Singh Bhangu, who heads SSM’s parliamentary committee. Bhangu said the matter can be resolved at the level of Punjab chief electoral officer, who the SSM leaders, including Rajewal, are expected to meet on Monday, followed by the CEC a day after. The EC has raised objections over several columns of the registration form left blank, submission of income tax returns for three months instead of one year as mandated, and address proof of registered office not as per the norms. “We are a new party and contesting polls on all the seats. Our party has widespread following in the state and people look forward to our candidates as stakeholders in the upcoming polls. We would seek allotment of one symbol for all the candidates,” said Bhangu. The SSM has given three options for the party symbol to the EC: tractor, tractor-trolley and trolley. As per the fresh poll schedule announced by the EC last week, notification will take place on January 25 and the last date for filing nominations is February 1. The SSM was formed on December 25 last year, and comprises 19 farm organisations that were part of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) that led the agitation against the now-repealed central farm laws.Eight more nominees announced, names of two withdrawnMeanwhile, the SSM on Sunday announced eight more candidates while withdrawing the names of two. Those fielded include Baba Chamkaur Singh (Bathinda Rural), Raj Kumar Mahal Khurd (Banga), Rashpal Singh Raju (Chabbewal), Chaudhary Khushi Ram (Phagwara), Jang Bahadur Singh (Garhshankar), Jaswant Singh Randhawa (Mukerian), Gora Singh (Bhadaur) and Kuldeep Singh Dalla (Jagraon). The two names withdrawn are that of Harvinder Singh Harpalpur (Rajpura) and Balraj Singh Thakur (Qadian). Bhangu said there was some “negativity” around the names of these two candidates, and their replacement will be announced soon. The SSM has decided to contest the elections in alliance with Haryana farmer leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni-led Sanyukt Sangarsh Party (SSP). While the SSM plans to contest on 107 seats, the SSP will get the remaining 10 in the 117-strong Punjab legislative assembly. With the Sunday’s announcement, the SSM is left with nominating just nine more candidates.

23-01-2022||Pune||Aspirants for MHADA recruitment exam allotted exam centre in other districts||PUNE The aspirants who have applied for the recruitment examination of Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) posts were shocked to find out that the exam centre allotted to them for the upcoming exams is in far away district, and not what they had applied for.Many students complained that they had given Pune district as an option of choice, but the exam centre allotted to them is in Kolhapur, Aurangabad and other districts. Aspirants are already furious with the authorities as the exam was earlier postponed last moment by the department to prevent the paper from a leak. Now, with the exam centres given far away from their residence, the students are unable to travel due to the ongoing MSRTC strike.“I stay in a village in Bhor Taluka, Pune district and as colleges are closed I have gone to my village for preparation of these recruitment exams. But I have been given a centre in Aurangabad district and I cannot afford to travel so far. I had already given my preference to appear for the exam in a Pune district centre,” said Ketan Jagdale an aspirant. The scheduled MHADA recruitment examination was to be held on December 12, 2021 and more than 2.75 lakh students were going to appear for it. There were 565 vacant posts in MHADA in various departments which include administration, accounts and survey departments. The application process for this recruitment had started in September 2021 for the posts of executive engineer, architect, sub-engineer, administrative officer, assistant legal advisor, junior engineer, junior architect assistant, assistants, clerks, surveyor and several other posts. Now, the MHADA recruitment exam is scheduled to be held from February 4 onwards. The recruitment exam for the post of clerk will be held on February 7 and 8. These exams are going to be held online in different schedules. While students are fearing to travel to other districts due to increasing Covid cases in the state and also the MSRTC bus strike issue. Another aspirant Smita Koli said, “We prepare for various state government recruitment exams in a hope to get a secure job, but from the last one year the state government is only playing with our emotions and dream to get government jobs. Earlier the exam was cancelled at the last movement and now we have been given exam centres which are too far in other districts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/aspirants-for-mhada-recruitment-exam-allotted-exam-centre-in-other-districts-101642950248111.html

In a 2.45-minute-long video, which was shot from the hospital bed, Badal, 94, thanked his well-wishers and prayed for communal harmony in Punjab.The Shiromani Akali Dal patriarch said that both the Centre and judiciary have approved the release of Bhullar, who has completed his jail term, but due to some “unknown reasons”, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal was not signing the release papers.Badal said that when all requisite clearances have been made, then this matter should not be kept pending, as it is not in the interest of the state and country. The former CM said that it is an emotional issue, and he requests Kejriwal to personally look into it.Badal, who was admitted to Hero Dayanand Heart Institute in Ludhiana on Wednesday, was scheduled to be discharged on Saturday, but was kept for further observation for two days after he again developed fever.Earlier, multiple Sikh bodies, including the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, have blamed Delhi’s Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government for the delay in Bhullar’s release. During his visit to the Golden Temple on Saturday, AAP’s Punjab CM candidate Bhagwant Mann had said that legal process in the case is going on and the Delhi government will take a decision on Bhullar’s release once it gets over.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/badal-makes-plea-for-delhi-bomb-blast-convict-bhullar-s-release-101642950182973.html

23-01-2022||Mumbai||Dust from Pakistan and Middle East settles over Mumbai after unseasonal rains||Mumbai A thick layer of haze settled over the city on Sunday, just a day after a western disturbance and cyclonic circulation over Rajasthan brought unseasonal rains to Mumbai, making it the city’s wettest January in at least a decade. Though citizens were quick to refer to it as a ‘dust storm’ on social media, experts and officials pointed out that Mumbai has not witnessed any stormy conditions, and attributed the haze to “dust raising winds” brought as a result of the same western disturbance which caused Saturday’s rains and a drop in Sunday’s temperature.Independent meteorologist Akshay Deoras said, “A prominent dust event is affecting parts of Maharashtra (including Mumbai-MMR), Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. This dust event has been triggered by a recent western disturbance, which is also causing the ongoing dip in Mumbai’s temperature.”Deoras said that western disturbances are present at high altitudes where aircraft fly, but they can induce a low pressure nearer to the Earth’s surface during their lifespan. “This western disturbance induced a low-pressure zone near Rajasthan and adjoining parts of Pakistan on the night of January 21. This caused an increase in the surface wind speed over Pakistan and adjoining eastern Iran, which started blowing the dust over these regions from the early morning hours of 22 January. Within a few hours, the dust was visible over the Gulf of Oman and the northern Arabian Sea, following which it entered Gujarat on the same day,” the meteorologist said. Winds from the northwest direction near the ground pushed the dust into Mumbai-MMR on January 23. Besides Mumbai-MMR, the dust has also spread across Nashik, Ahmadnagar, Pune, Dhule, Nandurbar, Jalgaon, Buldhana, Akola and Aurangabad districts of Maharashtra on the afternoon of 23 January, Deoras added.Mumbai has seen multiple such dust events in the past, including a prominent one in March 2012. The source of dust is always the arid regions of the Middle East and Pakistan. However, such events over the Middle East are generally more frequent during the spring and summer seasons when factors such as high temperature, atmospheric instability, strong northwesterly winds and thunderstorms create ideal conditions for the triggering of dust storms. Dust storms observed in June and July are not able to impact Mumbai due to monsoon conditions.Meanwhile, the incident pushed the city’s air quality index (AQI) in the ‘poor’ zone. As per the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily AQI bulletin, Mumbai recorded an AQI of 247 on Sunday, up from a ‘satisfactory’ AQI of 99 on the day before. However, as per the SAFAR network of air quality monitors in Mumbai, the AQI on Sunday evening was recorded at an index value of 333, the highest in at least six months.Officials clarified that the haze comprised more inert, crustal materials than pollutants. “This haze consists of mainly sand because it originates from the middle-east where the conditions are sandier. It cannot be defined as smog, which comprises a more complex mixture of pollutants,” said Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR. Sachin Ghude, a scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune, warned that air quality and visibility will remain poor till at least the afternoon of January 24.Following Saturday’s unseasonal, isolated drizzles, Mumbai also witnessed a steep dip in temperature, with the daytime maximum plunging to 23.8 degrees Celsius (seven degrees below normal), down from 29.7 degrees Celsius (one degree below normal) the day prior. This is the lowest daytime temperature seen in January in at least a decade. Sunday’s minimum temperature reading stood at 21 degrees Celsius (four degrees above normal) but is expected to dip to around 14 degrees Celsius on Monday. January’s highest maximum as per historical records stands at 37.4 degrees Celsius (in 2006) while the lowest minimum stands at 7.4 degrees Celsius (in 1962).Mumbai also recorded 0.4 mm of rain in the eight hours ending 5:30 pm on Saturday. Overall, the city has recorded 4.5 mm of rain this month, marking this the wettest January in at least a decade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/dust-from-pakistan-and-middle-east-settles-over-mumbai-after-unseasonal-rains-101642948865925.html
23-01-2022||Mumbai||Bombay HC rejects petition of man seeking custody of minor wife||Mumbai The Bombay high court recently rejected the petition of a man seeking custody of his wife who was detained and later handed over to the Child Welfare Committee as an ossification test had proved that she was a minor. The man said that he had married the girl based on her school leaving certificate which showed that she was born in 2002. However, the bench held that as the father of the girl had produced her birth certificate which showed that she was born in 2004 and the ossification test proved that she was 17-18 years of age so the petition was rejected.The division bench of justice Prasanna Varale and justice Anil Kilor. while hearing the habeas corpus petition of Chandrakant Vinjun, was informed by advocate Hare Krishna Mishra that his client was employed in Cooper Hospital as a ward boy for many years. A girl joined service in the hospital as a coolie and the duo became friends, fell in love and decided to get married. The couple got married as per Hindu Vedic rites and customs on May 17, 2021. Advocate Mishra submitted that on July 10, Sakhshi received a call from her family in which she was threatened after which a complaint was lodged in Juhu Police Station.On July 26, Vinjun received a call from Tulinj police station asking him to come along with his wife and documents related to the marriage. The couple reached there along with her school leaving certificate, mark sheet, Aadhaar and Pan card. The couple was told that the girl’s mother had lodged a complaint of kidnapping against Vinjun. Though Vinjun told the police that he had brought all documents to prove his wife’s age, the police told him that a medical test of his wife would be done. On July 31, the police told Vinjun that the CWC, Palghar had taken custody of his wife and some reports were awaited. Repeated requests to CWC to release his wife failed and hence he approached the HC. On its part, additional public prosecutor SD Shinde for the state informed the bench that after the father of the girl had submitted her birth certificate and an ossification test was conducted as the birth certificate stated her birth to be 2004 while the school leaving certificate said 2002.  The ossification test showed the age of the girl to be between 17-18 years. Hence as the girl was a minor her custody was taken over by the CWC.After hearing the submissions, the bench held that though the school leaving certificate was to be relied upon to ascertain the age, as the ossification test concluded that she was a minor hence the husband’s petition was not valid and maintainable. Therefore, his request to get the custody of his wife could not be allowed and was rejected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-rejects-petition-of-man-seeking-custody-of-minor-wife-101642948622899.html

23-01-2022||Pune||13,000 tonne of debris removed from Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary||PUNE One of the most popular biodiversity parks in Pune, the Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary, is facing a sharp decline in bird species it is home to owing to the dumping of debris. So much so that nearly 9,600 tonne of debris has been removed from the sanctuary since the last meeting held with minister Aaditya Thackeray on January 12 to resolve the issue.The 22-acre Dr Salim Ali Biodiversity Park in the city, named after the ‘Birdman of India’, lies along the Mula-Mutha river and is a paradise both for bird watchers and nature lovers as it attracts 130 different species of birds. During the meeting, it was decided to lift the debris by the end of this month and initiate police patrolling of the area to restrict illegal activities and entry into the sanctuary. It was also decided to appoint security personnel to guard the area, install CCTV cameras for surveillance, and put up fencing around the green area.The work of removing the debris started on January 18 and as per information provided by the PMC, a total 9,600 tonne of debris was removed in four days. The debris mainly comprised construction and demolition waste, and plastic and fevicol waste which will be lifted soon.Dr Siddhartha Dhende , deputy mayor of Pune, said, “The work is carried out by the road and garden department of the PMC under the nagar road ward office.”Meghna Baphna, a volunteer with the Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary action committee, said, “The work of lifting the debris is underway but the place has not yet been fenced and neither is there CCTV surveillance. They have not even appointed any security personnel to guard the place, which should be done on a priority basis.”However, MLA Sunil Tingre claimed, “Police patrolling to restrict illegal activities and entry has already started.”While Dr Dhende said, “The place is not guarded by security personnel as it is not enlisted as a sanctuary under the state or central government. Once the place is under the PMC jurisdiction, the work of fencing and CCTV surveillance will be carried out on priority.” Tingre added, “The work is expected to be completed by the end of this month as promised. The place is still not owned by the corporation for which a case has been filed in court.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/9600-tonne-of-debris-removed-from-salim-ali-bird-sanctuary-101642947482996.html
23-01-2022||Pune||PMC to introduce online registration of pets||PUNE In a bid to encourage pet owners to get their pets registered, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to introduce an online facility to register pets and issue license certificates to pet owners. Under the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act, it is mandatory for pet owners to obtain a license for their pets. The PMC is of the view that shifting the pet licensing process online will prompt pet owners to get their pets registered as they will not have to go through the hassle of visiting the ward office to obtain a license.Dr Sarika Punde, veterinary superintendent of PMC, said, “There are around 80,000 to 1 lakh pet dogs in the city, however only around 3,100 license certificates have been issued this year. Many pet owners do not even know that they are mandatorily required to obtain pet license certificates. Shifting the process online will spread more awareness and make the licensing process easier and quicker.” Also, if a complaint is lodged against a pet dog and the owner does not have a license, the PMC can register an offense against the pet owner.Earlier, pet owners were required to visit the respective ward office to get their pet license certificate issued. They were required to carry three passport-sized photographs of their pet; one for the license, one for the vaccination card and one to be retained by the civic health department. The owners were also required to submit a copy of the anti-rabies vaccination certificate of their pet, residential proof and property tax payment receipt to the ward office. The PMC would charge an advance registration fee of Rs500 (Rs50 for 10 years) for every dog. However, it was necessary to renew the registration every year in the ward office. A metal token for the licensed pet with the year of registration on it, and a card with rules to be followed while handling the pet written in Marathi were issued by the PMC.Now however, the entire process of documents’ verification and payment of fees will be carried out online to make issuing licenses hassle-free, according to Dr Punde. “PMC’s IT department is currently working to have the software system up and running. Within two to three months, the online system will be ready to register pets and issue pet license certificates,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-to-introduce-online-registration-of-pets-101642943825623.html

Though citizens were quick to refer to it as a ‘dust storm’ on social media, experts and officials pointed out that Pune has not witnessed any stormy conditions, and attributed the haze to “dust raising winds”. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting department of IMD Pune said, “There is currently haze over the city. The pollution levels are however normal though the moisture level has increased. There are partly cloudy conditions in the city. Since the moisture level has increased and the difference in day and night is less, there will be humidity. We have also forecast haze at isolated places in the city.”Independent meteorologist Akshay Deoras however said, “A prominent dust event is affecting parts of Maharashtra (including Mumbai-MMR), Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat.

23-01-2022||Pune||Your Space: Health staff shortage is the biggest test amid Covid spread||Many districts need health staff to contain Covid spread. With the majority of the 23,500 National Medical Commission (NMC) registered doctors stationed at medical colleges, many districts have to depend on these frontline staff to fight Covid spread. Our readers suggest steps to fill the demand-supply gap Depleting workforce in the healthcare sector is a big worry Across the country, Covid has once again made headlines. Now with the warning of an incoming third wave, the number of patients in Pune is increasing rapidly. The first two waves of s proved to be dangerous. Over the past two years, despite getting warnings from public health professionals, both central and state governments have failed to extend India’s healthcare capacities, like vital infrastructures, oxygen plants, ventilators, or its health workforce. Through recruitments under the National Health Mission (NHM), it has been seen that since June 2020, the Central government has claimed that they have hired 2,206 specialist doctors, 4,685 medical officers, and 25,593 nurses in public hospitals across the country. But it has come to light that these numbers have fallen short of the level the country needs. From the first wave of Covid, it has been seen that the number of medical professionals required for Covid patients is not sufficient enough. There must be some suggestions to reduce this increasing gap. National Medical Commission (NMC)should include more medical students, interns, nurses by increasing their supply through education and training. There should be a deployment of healthcare professionals into rural areas for a long period so they can assess and assist people. It is important for the entire medical staff; despite having different departments, to educate themselves about Covid safety majors. Siddhi Dharmadhikari Focus on how to keep the healthcare sector operational The whole country has become painfully aware of how crucial it is to have a proper healthcare system. Due to Coronavirus, Maharashtra has become one of the worst affected states. With the advent of the third wave, metropolitan cities like Mumbai and Pune are showing a rapid increase in the number of daily affected patients. Due to the shortages of essential protective wear, ventilators, Intensive Care Units (ICUs) and medical professionals, the first two waves of the pandemic proved to be the worst nightmare for the citizens. We have witnessed a huge demand-supply gap when it comes to the healthcare system. The number of patients and the demand for medical professionals are directly proportional to each other. But there is an acute shortage of doctors, nurses, assistants and paramedics to meet this demand. The lack of healthcare workers is not a new problem. A 2016 study report authorised by the World Health Organisation stated that the “lack of trained health professionals is a major constraint on the ability to achieve health delivery.” To deal with this huge demand-supply gap between Covid patients and medical professionals, the following suggestions can be taken into consideration: Doctors of other specialties should be trained in respiratory system related ailments so that they can perform the basic actions. Retired doctors and healthcare workers must be called in such a situation. Their experience will be beneficial. Final year students should not be deployed on the field instead freshers and juniors should be taught the basic practice needed to care for patients. All non-essential visits should be minimised and the maximum number of healthcare workers should be deployed for Covid-19 patients. Protective gears should be made available. Manisha Swain Allocate budget to hire more staff Health and education sector are two important pillars which need civic attention. The current situation is more vulnerable and so should be given more focus by hiring qualified staff. If we look across the globe, there is huge expenditure from the budget on its human resources. However, we are not even near to their expenditures. But time has come that our government should also think of spending more on its human resources. Barring few cities, other cities as well as rural areas need lot of attention in health sector. Qualified doctors and health staff is required, but given the present situation the need is urgent. The government should focus on how fast they can get it mobilised, because ultimately, it’s about saving own human power. Prof Rakesh Mittal Video consultation to reduce burden of patients Here are some ways to bridge this demand supply gap. Telephonic and video consultation: Telemedicine has emerged as a good solution for precaution, prevention and treatment and made a huge contribution to healthcare during the pandemic. There may be some challenges for treating patients but overall, this option can help the hospitals from getting overcrowded and doctors from being overburdened. For this to be successful, good internet connection is a must and that can be achieved by partnering with internet solution providers with statewide networks. Mobile Clinics:Minivans with facilities to test along with basic clinic infrastructure that can be manned by trained public health anganwadi or asha workers. For this to be successful, quality training must be imparted to the public health workers. Train and equip support groups, NGOs and organisations such as Rotary for delivering test kits, medicines, masks, and other medical needs. They can also be trained to take care of the non-urgent, asymptomatic patients and those with mild symptoms. These patients can stay at home and virtually communicate with doctors through phone calls or video calls. This can greatly reduce the infection to other patients and health care providers. It takes away the unwanted pressure on emergency rooms. Utilise vacant buildings such as school classrooms for consultation and treatment by setting up video call facilities and emergency supply of medicines. At-risk patients with co-morbid conditions who may need ICU should be monitored closely via daily teleconsultations to avoid in person visits to minimise their risks of exposure. If hospitalised, patients with similar needs should be placed in such a way that one doctor can monitor them. Create self-care short videos so patients can follow the steps to take care of their needs, complete quarantine and medications.

23-01-2022||Chandigarh||Navjot Sidhu's principal strategic advisor Mustafa booked for 'communal' remarks||Former Punjab DGP Mohammad Mustafa has been booked for allegedly making communal remarks at a public meeting in Malerkotla, police here said on Sunday.Mustafa is the principal strategic advisor to state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu.The FIR came a day after a video showing him making the alleged remarks was circulated on social media. "An FIR has been lodged under IPC Section 153-A and Section 125 in The Representation of the People Act," Malerkotla Senior Superintendent of Police, Ravjot Kaur Grewal, told PTI over the phone.The charges spell that Mustafa was booked for promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race and other identity markers to score gains in election.The FIR has been lodged on complaint of a police officer in Malerkotla. Mustafa is the husband of Punjab cabinet minister Razia Sultana who is the Congress candidate from Malerkotla assembly seat -- a Muslim-majority district in Punjab.The BJP had on Saturday accused the former Punjab IPS officer of making the controversial remarks against “Hindus” at a public meeting. Mustafa has denied the charge and said he never used the “Hindu” word.He had only targeted the Aam Aadmi Party workers after some of them allegedly chased and tried to manhandle him, he said.A video of Mustafa making the purported remarks was shared by BJP leaders Sambit Patra and Shazia Ilmi on their Twitter handles on Saturday. Mustafa said he had gone to an event of some Congress workers nearby and warned the AAP workers, who were also from the Muslim community.He said he used the word "fitno" (meaning mischief makers) for AAP workers belonging to the Muslim community and there was no question of warning Hindus."There was absolutely no Hindu-Muslim context to what happened in Malerkotla to which the quoted video clip relates. It was a verbal outburst unilaterally mischievously provoked by Jhaduwalas, all Muslims," Mustafa said in a tweet.In another tweet, he hit out at BJP, saying his “nationalist” credentials were superior than those from the party."Your intended branding will not work on Mustafa, as my nationalistic credentials are far superior to yours with a history of life long fight against enemies of India and destroyers of communal harmony in the state,” he wrote.Aam Aadmi Party leader Raghav Chadha had also castigated Mustafa for his remarks and alleged that the Congress was trying to disturb the atmosphere in the state ahead of the state assembly polls.The purported video clip was played by the BJP at a press conference on Saturday."I swear by Allah that I will not allow them to hold any event. I am a 'kaumi fauji (soldier of community)' I am not an RSS agent who will hide in the house out of fear."If they again try to do such a thing, I swear by Allah I will thrash them in their homes," the video allegedly showed him saying at the meeting held on January 20.BJP general secretary Tarun Chugh had also taken strong exception to Mustafa's remarks and demanded that party leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi clear their stand on the matter.Chugh accused Mustafa of trying to foment communal hatred in Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/navjot-sidhu-s-principal-strategic-advisor-mustafa-booked-for-communal-remarks-101642932680102.html
23-01-2022||Delhi||Seed flags for sustainable R-Day celebrations||The sight of plastic flags dumped on the streets, after Republic Day celebrations, has led to quite a few organisations and individuals take up concentrated efforts to mark the occasion with a sustainable approach. “Once the celebrations are over, we usually saw flags being dumped on the sides of the roads. With plantable flags, we want to manage waste, reduce plastic and encourage planting trees,” says Nayna Bansal from Back to Nature, which sells plantable flags across Delhi-NCR. “This Republic Day we aim to sell one thousand plantable flags. Our core focus is to educate kids in schools and even the underprivileged kids to use plantable flags instead of plastic flags. Post the Republic Day celebrations, all one has to do is sow the flag in a pot full of soil, and with some water, sunlight and care, within four weeks you’ll see seeds germinating.”The flags are created out of scrap paper and cotton collected from corporates and textile industries. “They are recycled, and embedded with seeds of tulsi, wildflowers, tomatoes, and marigold,” adds Bansal. Meanwhile, Manisha Kaushik, from Inner Wheel Club that promotes the use of seed-embedded cloth flags, adds, “We are empowering underprivileged men and women to make cloth flags instead of plastic flags. Thin seeds are put in the flags and dried. Once dry, it’s ready to be sold, and can easily be planted after being used as part of the celebrations. Our green chilly flags are very popular.” Bhavisha Buddhadeo, from a Noida-based NGO, Green Society India is working hard to create demand and spread awareness about eco-friendly flags among the children as well. “We are giving them out for office celebrations as people are becoming more and more conscious about avoiding single-use plastic flags. Flags with seed papers are much in demand at present. But due to the Covid-19 situation, schools are online and events are mostly less as compare to previous years.” For the Instagram page Plantables.store, the story of seed paper flags started way back in 2019. Garima Capoor Nanda from the store, says, “The apprehension around the idea of planting Indian flag was resolved by the fact that respectfully burying it in soil was not in violation of the Flag Code. In fact, it’s better than throwing plastic flags in garbage. We’ve been seeing a massive demand for such flags. Amid the pandemic restrictions, the dip in sales was expected, but the acceptance to shift to an eco-friendly alternative remains on a steady rise.” Author Tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter
23-01-2022||Chandigarh||Concentrate on the present, while building the future||Bindiya chamkegi, choori khankegi, the Bollywood number was playing at a construction site near our home the other day. It took me back to the leisurely lockdown- just-lifted days when we used to sit and exchange conversations in the staffroom. Students were coming in numbers that could be counted on fingers, and, lectures used to be far and few in between. One day, the random talk steered towards the bindi. Four teachers, by coincidence had worn a bindi that day, which wasn’t a routine for them, so, they were garnering compliments; and discussions began on the evolution of this simple-yet-elegant beauty accessory. The evergreen red and circular Shilpa bindi was glorified. The charm of the bindi matching with one’s dress was emphasised. The grace a bindi lends to the face was highlighted. Some co-workers and colleagues in other institutions, with their pet bindi styles were remembered. And the scientific importance, whereby a newborn baby looks at, gets attracted to and concentrates on the bindi on its mother’s forehead was brought to the forefront. When I came out of the reverie of that casual day, I wondered how nicely, with the help of a stereo, the construction-site labourers created a melodious environment for themselves, sweating yet enjoying. We often do the same in our staffroom now. Classes are at their peak, students coming in full numbers, and there are all sorts of other office tasks as well. Thankfully, as teachers come and go from this staffroom, greeting each other with smiles, attending to various chores, sneaking in a moment of break, or settling down for lunch, there’s a lovely music inherent in the entire day. The music reverberates of gratitude, professionalism, genuineness, and a calm-cum-serene contentment. Thankfully, the soulful echo resounds everywhere in the institution. And, the quest for growth and learning, a must, abounds. I appreciate the fact that being a teacher, I have ample opportunity to pass on this art of combining satisfaction with need-to-progress to my students. It is necessary to work for the future, but, live in the present also we must. This amalgamation often stems from the mundane chit-chats that help us enjoy the present and build energy for bettering the future (like, in the staffroom). Also, this blend often comes during a routine lecture when a chord strikes with the content being taught – because once the basics are clear due to previous learning(s) (denoting contentment), suddenly there is a desire to know more (denoting both curiosity and a desire to better the future). So, when recently some alumni of the college who had progressed to a more reputed institution, for a higher-level degree, sought my guidance on certain complicated topics; I had to, but grab the opportunity. Also, this would help me make a difference and grow myself – because in any case these two processes go hand in hand. So, seeking all these processes, I have shown the students a green flag for my free lectures, and look forward to both their and my own development – for I will have to prepare those topics more efficiently before being able to teach them effectively. Coming back to the bindi, which, I once read somewhere, retains energy and concentration; I deeply wish for everyone to be able to concentrate on their present, while building the future; I truly hope that everyone’s energies get channelised towards assisting themselves and others. And, since the area between eyebrows where a bindi is placed is considered to be the seat of concealed wisdom, I desire for us to be able to act on this wisdom, while enjoying the tune and melody within, as well. reemaban@gmail.com The writer is a Jagadhri-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/concentrate-on-the-present-while-building-the-future-101642923717510.html

Excited to be featured in the tableau, athletes are happily assembling to rehearse for their appearance, and photoshoots at Haryana Bhawan, Delhi. Some of the athletes in the Haryana tableau are defence kids, who share how it’s extra special to be part of the Republic Day celebrations. Paralympic discus thrower Yogesh Kathuniya says, “I remember when I was younger, I used to go see the jhankis with my father, who is a defence personnel. We even got VVIP passes the year Barack Obama (former US President) had come... Being a defence kid, I’m delighted to participate in the Republic Day parade, and be part of the tableau.” “Mere late father defence mein the, woh aaj bahut proud hote to see me in the Haryana jhanki,” feels Paralympian javelin thrower Sumit Antil, adding, “In the Tokyo Paralympics last year, out of a tally of 19 medals, six were won by five players from Haryana. Similarly, in the Tokyo Olympics 2020, out of the seven medal winners in the country, Haryana accounted for four. So, sports is certainly big in Haryana, and I’m glad the state is being recognised for that.”For Olympic medallist wrestler Bajrang Punia, representing Haryana at the Republic Day parade is a matter of great pride and a memory he will always cherish. “Main Haryana se belong karta hun aur mujhe Haryana jhanki mein shaamil hone ka mauka mila, yeh mere liye Indian hone ke naate kaafi garv ki baat hai. Bachpan mein TV pe parade dekhte the, ab usme khud shaamil ho rahe hai,” says Bajrang, sharing how his family is excited about seeing him on TV as part of the parade.And that is exactly the case with Olympian wrestler Deepak Punia, who is thrilled to be a part of the Haryana state tableau. But his true and ultimate happiness will always lie in winning medals for the nation. He shares, “Bahut achha lag raha hai ki bachpan se dekhte the Republic Day ki jhankiyon ko, aur ab waha khud jayenge state ko represent karne. Ghar pe sab TV pe dekhenge... Mera maqsad toh bas medal leke aana hai aur desh ke liye khelne ka hai. Parade mein shaamil hone ki bahut khushi hai, par medal jeetne ki khushi kuch alag hi hoti hai.”Many sportspersons are also looking forward to enjoying the Republic Day festivities. “The part of R-Day I loved seeing as a kid was when the airforce planes performed stunts. Everything that I had seen on TV, now I will get to see in reality at Rajpath. And I’m excited about it,” says Paralympic archer Harvinder Singh, adding, “And I just wish this Republic Day that India becomes Covid-free, as soon as possible.”Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/haryana-tableau-at-republicday-sports-stars-to-shine-bright-101642922161964.html

23-01-2022||Chandigarh||Jammu and Kashmir politicians question home minister Amit Shah over restoration of statehood||J&K politicians questioned home minister Amit Shah for restoration of statehood once normalcy is restored and sought the definition of “normalcy”.Shah on Saturday, while virtually launching the district good governance index of J&K, said as soon as the situation becomes normal, statehood will be given back.“Delimitation has started and soon elections will be held. I’ve given assurance in the Lok Sabha that as soon as the situation becomes normal in Jammu and Kashmir, statehood will be given back to J&K.”However, mainstream politicians have criticised the statement of Shah on normalcy and good governance index in J&K. “After quite literally terrorising people of J&K into silence to create a false normalcy narrative, the GOIs admission that situation still isn’t normal is self-contradictory. Also proves that silence shouldn’t be misconstrued as normalcy,” PDP president Mehbooba Mufti said in a tweet.Peoples Conference chairman Sajjad Lone sought the definition of normalcy from the home minister. “But who will define normalcy. And in a federal structure, can we really use normalcy as an excuse to assume power. Irrespective of the definition of normalcy possibly coined by the Union government, every single stateless day is an affront to federalism and to the people of J & K,” Sajjad Lone said in a tweet.CPI general secretary and Peoples Alliance for Gupkar Declaration Mohammad Yusuf Tarigami said that one of the principle fundamentals of good governance is participation and representation, a right which continues to be “denied” to the people of J&K. “Releasing such indexes is intended to help the government in optics wise. However, the ground reality of dilapidated roads, erratic power supply, inaccessibility of potable water combined with huge unemployment, social unrest is reflecting contrasting picture,” said Tarigami in a tweet.“Number of political prisoners detained on flimsy grounds under draconian laws in and outside J&K jails are ill. Families find it extremely difficult to meet them due to poverty and Covid restrictions. The administration continues to be insensitive,” he said.Earlier addressing the launch, Shah said, “I want to congratulate all residents of Jammu and Kashmir for the launch of the district good governance index. This is an important day not just for J&K but for entire India.”Shah said the beginning of this index in Jammu and Kashmir will slowly expand to all other states and a good governance competition will start in every district of the country. He said the index will benefit residents of Jammu and Kashmir in a big way as it will work towards improving the district machinery, make districts result-oriented and also improve their delivery mechanism.The district good governance index, which has been launched for 20 districts of Jammu and Kashmir on Saturday has been prepared by the department of administrative reforms and public grievances (DARPG) in partnership with the union territory’s administration and is a major reform in bench-marking good governance at the district level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jammu-and-kashmir-politicians-question-home-minister-amit-shah-over-restoration-of-statehood-101642888424932.html

He congratulated the local police, the CRPF, and other agencies for their role in counter-insurgency operations. He said, “The importance of both the union territories of J&K and Ladakh is well known and we have played our role as far as the security of this region is concerned with full dedication and devotion and are maintaining our complete dominance, whether it is Line of Control, Line of Actual Control (LAC), Actual Ground Position Line (AGPL) and International Border (IB).” He said, “The people of Kashmir have rejected terrorism, separatism, and gun culture, and after many years, the number of terrorists has gone below 200 in the Valley which is a big achievement”. “The ceasefire along the LoC has provided relief to the border residents.

Joshi is one of the few pilots who flew to China as part of the Vande Bharat mission in May 2020, and says that her parents have been a constant support throughout this phase where she has been serving the nation and humanity. “I was asked by my airline if I wanted to volunteer with the Vande Bharat mission and I spoke to my parents about it. They were hesitant initially because of Covid situation then, but supported me in my decision. And I continue to fly such flights even today,” says the Mumbai-based pilot, adding, “My dad is amazing. He is so proud of me. If he is at home, he waits for me whenever I’m getting ready for a flight. And he makes sure he’s there to see me off with a kiss and reminding me to take care. Since the pandemic has hit, it feels every flight is my first flight.”And when the daughter is flying, the father ensures that the relatives are filled in with the details of her noble deeds, as part of her duty. “Whenever I’m on a flight, my father is on touch with our relatives through WhatsApp groups. He enquires beforehand which are the rescue flights I’m going for, and will say, ‘Laxmi, my daughter is going to rescue these people. It’s his love as a parent, but it’s also something that keeps me going,” says Joshi.“We are still flying Vande Bharat mission flights. I feel lucky to be part of the rescue mission. It’s a privilege,” says Joshi, adding “Every time after landing the flight when I see happy faces of people who have reached their destinations, I feel so satisfied. To see people where they want to be is the best part of my job. Presently we are flying to San Francisco, California, New York and Vancouver and bringing people who are stuck there. There were students who have already paid their college fee and we got special approvals to fly them back.”There are incidents aplenty when on board, but this one specific time, Joshi recalls, “I was flying from New York, and there was a little boy travelling on board with us. It was a long flight, during which he made a very good drawing of the Earth, the pilots and the aircraft going from one place to the other. It read, ‘Thank you so much for taking us safely’. That moved me beyond words!”Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vande-bharat-pilot-laxmi-joshi-to-see-people-where-they-want-to-be-is-the-best-part-101642886084558.html

23-01-2022||Delhi||Positive or negative: Self-test kits causing Covid confusion?||New DelhiAs Covid-19 cases continue to be high in the Capital, various self-testing rapid antigen kits for Covid detection have been flying off the shelves. Many are picking up these self-testing kits from local pharmacists, to test whether the virus has affected them or not, in order to save themselves from anxiety and the time required in receiving reports from a test lab. But, is a negative or positive test result the ultimate correct answer? Well, healthcare experts warn against reading the results of self tests at face value.The curious case of a false negativeTake the case of Anand Vihar-based Sanchit Sharma, who upon experiencing a mild headache and sore throat after a long day at work in a Noida-based MNC, stopped by a local pharmacy to buy an at home self test kit. To avoid “waiting time for RT PCR testing”, Sharma and his family tested at home using the instructions on the pack. The ‘negative’ was “the mood changer” according to him.Sharma adds: “In the morning, my sore throat worsened and I developed a minor fever. Considering the situation, I immediately got my RT PCR done and the day after result shown was positive. It felt like I hit an iceberg. How can an ICMR approved testing kit be so wrong in showing the result? Now if anyone asks me, I’d suggest people not to rely completely on home based testing kits. Although the accuracy level of these kits have some error margin, but still the expectations of the people out there is much more at the moment and one must know that these aren’t final and binding.” Pharmacists busy home delivering kitsNot only are the rapid antigen self-test kits flying off the shelves, but are also being ordered over home delivery as per many city-based pharmacies. Jai Bharat, who works in a Dwarka-based pharmacy, says, “Each day at least 20-30 people take home these tests. We’re also being asked to home deliver these kits. And we are regularly getting these kits supplied to us to cater to the high demand. There are different brands available and each costs between ₹250-300 per kit. But of course whenever anyone asks us whether their result is absolutely correct, we tell them we can’t take guarantee.” Kits are useful like first aidDelhi-based software engineer Suhaib Roomy, who had tested Covid positive recently, says he used the self-test kit to monitor the Covid status. “I was advised by my doctor to take a self test a couple of days after my symptoms subsided. I purchased a self test kit from a nearby chemist shop for ₹250. I had previously watched a video on YouTube on how to perform a self test. It was really easy and took me just two minutes to perform those steps. The result was shown in the strip within five minutes,” says Roomy. And Model Town-based accessory designer Akassh K Aggarwal says these testing kits did turn out to be a useful tool for him, adding: “It helped me diagnose my Covid positive status at home. I followed it up with an RT PCR lab test, and by the time the results came, my symptoms had gone from severe to mild.”The doctor’s advice Delhi-based Internal Medicine specialist Dr Shuchin Bajaj shares these kits are useful if used correctly. “We need to make sure to give out the right communication. First, you should know how to use them correctly. At home, some don’t know how to insert the probe correctly, or they’re taking the sample just from the outer part of the nose or tongue. Secondly, if the test shows a positive, then it’s a positive, but the rate of false negatives is quite high. It could be as high as 10-15%. If you are symptomatic, and it’s come out to be negative, please get it reconfirmed through an RT PCR test.” Adding that about 50% of his urban patients come to him having already self-tested at home, Dr Bajaj says it’s a cause of worry to not report the Covid positive status.“Underreporting could be because of false negatives or faulty user behaviour. Even if they’re turning out to be positive, people are not reporting it to the concerned authority. These cases are escaping statistics. For instance, in some cases those using a test require the image of the kit to be uploaded after use, and then the app reports directly to the ICMR. But, most people are just visually inspecting the kit, and don’t upload the image. It could be because people do not want to isolate themselves for 14 days, when they are getting better in 4-5 days since it’s a mild variant. It’s also because there’s a social stigma around being Covid positive. People who have tested positive must be treated with compassion instead of making it look like they’re at fault if they have the infection,” the doctor says.Take of the testing labs Dr Shivali Ahlawat, Head of National Reference Laboratory at Oncquest Laboratories Ltd, which is “testing around 3,500-4,000 RTPCR samples daily” explains: “Home tests had good accuracy in case of a positive result, but could be misleading in case of a negative result. If a person has Covid like symptoms, she or he should get an RT-PCR test even if the home test came negative.”Explaining the difference between the two, the expert says: “Rapid self-kit test detects protein fragments specific to the Coronavirus. While the rapid test can get you results very quickly, the results may not always be as accurate as the PCR. On the other hand, RT PCR testing is considered the most robust approach in SARS-CoV-2 detection. This test detects genetic material specific to the virus and can detect the virus within days of infection, even those with no symptoms. The test is generally done by a trained professional. Turnaround time is longer as compared to rapid test but results can come back in as little as 24 hours.”Author tweets @siddhijainnFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/positive-or-negative-self-test-kits-causing-covid-confusion-101642883986188.html
23-01-2022||Chandigarh||Illegal sand mining: Citing audio clips as proof of CM’s patronage, SAD demands CBI probe||Alleging Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s involvement in a “multi-crore illegal mining racket” in his home constituency of Chamkaur Sahib, the Shiromani Akali Dal on Saturday demanded a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe and also asked the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to take note of it. Addressing a press conference here, SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia claimed to have busted the “racket” on the basis of a string operation on individuals carrying out the illegal sand mining in Channi’s home turf, including the forest land, in violation of the National Green Tribunal guidelines, allegedly in connivance with the chief minister. “Only an impartial probe can reveal the extent to which the CM and his family have plundered the state exchequer through the sand mafia,” he alleged. HT could not independently verify the veracity of the audio recordings of sting operation cited by Majithia in support of his allegations. Channi has been in the eye of a political storm since this past week after the recovery of ₹10 crore cash from his nephew Bhupinder Singh ‘Honey’ and others during the ED raids in an illegal sand mining case of 2018. Calling the ED operation a “political vendetta” by the Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre, the chief minister has denied any link with his nephew’s activities. Contesting Channi’s denial, Majithia claimed that the audio recordings proved “close nexus” between chief minister and Honey. “They were partners in the illegal sand mining trade,” he alleged. Former Akali minister, who himself was booked in a drug case by the Channi government last month, said that in the secretly-taped audio recordings, Salapur village sarpanch Iqbal Singh, alleged to be CM’s aide, and his son Binder Singh revealed that the illegal sand mining operation was being run with the “chief minister’s blessings”. Majithia also played an audio clip in which one Iqbal Singh is purportedly saying that the chief minister (Channi) had told him to do mining fearlessly, even on forest land. He alleged that a forest guard who raised alarm was browbeaten into silence and that the mafia was also using boats and forklifts to mine from the riverbed. He added that one Rakesh Chaudhary of Jammu was the kingpin behind the sand mafia operating in the Chamkaur Sahib area. Majithia alleged that Honey had been provided black cat commandos and an escort vehicle allegedly on Channi’s orders. “Since the chief minister is also holding the charge of the mining and environment departments, this favour to his nephew is a case of conflict of interest,” he added. Reacting to the allegations, Congress spokesperson Alka Lamba, without naming anyone, termed it an attempt to tarnish Channi’s clean image. “Till a few days ago, he (Majithia) was hiding in a drugs case,” she said, adding that those who live in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/illegal-sand-mining-citing-audio-clips-as-proof-of-cm-s-patronage-sad-demands-cbi-probe-101642883144603.html
23-01-2022||Chandigarh||Mandi hooch tragedy: Kingpin held, two illegal factories busted||The Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the Himachal Pradesh Police on Saturday cracked the Mandi hooch deaths case with the arrest of the key accused and busted two illicit liquor bottling plants at Hamirpur and Nalagarh.Director-general of police Sanjay Kundu said it was a major challenge for being first of its kind case in Himachal and required coordinated efforts of various teams of the SIT in carrying out raids, seizures and the arrest.“The case has been solved within 72 hours by the SIT,” said Kundu. The SIT was headed by the DIG, Central Range, Madhu Sudan.Five people had died after consuming toxic liquor in the Salapar area of Sundernagar in Mandi district on January 19 while two died the next day.After the tragedy unfolded, the police had registered a case of culpable homicide and criminal conspiracy and arrested four persons on January 20, who, the DGP said, were the foot-soldiers in the racket.The prime suspect in the case, Narender, alias Kalu from Maloh village of Sundernagar, was on the run since the incident. He landed in the police net on the intervening night of Thursday and Friday.“He revealed that the main supplier of the illicit liquor was Gaurav Manhas, alias Goru from Palampur, Kangra, who was arrested from a hotel in Zirkpur on Thursday,” said the DGP.During the interrogation, Manhas revealed that there was an illegal bottling unit in Hamirpur being run by two persons from UP, who carry out the mixing operations. Water for the above unit was procured from Hamirpur, empty bottles from a scrap dealer, bottle caps, boxes and cartons were procured from Parwanoo, spirit from a person named Sagar Saini in drums and the last procurement was 25 drums.He said “VRV Santra” stickers were made with the help of a graphic designer while bottling plant equipment was procured from Chandigarh and Jammu and Kashmir.“Nine teams of SIT carried out search and seizures at various places,” said Kundu. He said the Hamirpur team, which busted the illegal bottling plant, seized 6,000 bottles of liquor, empty bottles, cartons, plastic tanks, label strips, hologram stickers and other material. The premises named Rainbow Café was owned by Praveen Thakur, a local, who ran the illegal operation in collusion with Pushpender and Sunny from Bhawanigarh of Aligarh in UP.The DGP said the police recovered ₹25 lakh cash during a raid at the house of the kingpin in Palampur besides other documentary evidence.At the instance of Goru, another illegal bottling plant was raided by the Baddi police, the DGP said.The factory was apparently run by another illegal liquor production gang. A separate FIR under the Excise Act has been registered at the Nalagarh Police Station. It was also found that the kingpin had supplied 1,400 boxes of illicit liquor to distributers in Kangra, Una, Hamirpur, Mandi and Bilaspur.“Other people involved in this racket have been identified and are being interrogated. Among them are Sagar Saini from Ambala; AK Tripathi from Samba; Ajay Kohli from Baijnath of Kangra and Ajay Sharma and Prakash Chand from Parwanoo,” he said.The DGP said the deaths might have been caused by improper mixing of the ingredients at the Hamirpur plant, or impure spirit which may have contained methyl alcohol instead of ethyl alcohol.He said the role of excise officers may also come under the scanner in this case.
23-01-2022||Chandigarh||Congress seeks judicial probe into Mandi hooch tragedy||The opposition Congress on Saturday demanded a judicial probe into the Mandi hooch tragedy in which seven people died after consuming spurious liquor earlier this week. Addressing a press conference, Himachal Pradesh Congress Committee (HPCC) spokesperson Naresh Chauhan said that a sitting judge of the high court should conduct the inquiry into the case. Accusing the BJP government of trying to protect the accused in the case, Chauhan also questioned the slow pace of the probe. Chauhan alleged that the liquor mafia was flourishing under the patronage of the BJP leaders. After this tragic incident in the home district of the chief minister, the entire law and order situation in Himachal has been exposed, he said. Chauhan said that the pace at which illegal drug trade is spreading in the state was quite concerning. He claimed that the present government under the current regime had totally collapsed and the mafia was ruling the roosts and have no fear of law as they were being protected by the government. Chauhan demanded strict action against the culprits behind the hooch tragedy. He said that there is a need to keep a strict vigil on the borders so that smuggling of any kind of illegal drugs can be curbed. He said when the illegal liquor trade is going on unabated in the home district of the chief minister then the situation in other districts can be gauged easily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/congress-seeks-judicial-probe-into-mandi-hooch-tragedy-101642883027049.html

Channi said Majithia’s ‘slanderous and misleading’ campaign against him was to revenge the drugs case registered against him by his government. He also said the SAD leader was dancing to the tunes of the BJP.“I have never denied my relationship with my nephew Bhupinder Singh ‘Honey’ and being a relative, he might be present at family functions. It is not a crime if I get clicked with my relatives at my son’s marriage or some other event,” the CM said, while categorically denying any link in Honey’s activities and the money-laundering case he is facing.“Let me remind Majithia that he was investigated by the ED for his relations with drug peddlers, and a drug lord even named him for sheltering and facilitating smugglers. Majithia’s photos were with them; does that mean he did shelter them?”On the audio recordings of a sarpanch, Iqbal Singh and his son Binder, Channi said that if a person takes chief minister’s name for personal gains, it doesn’t mean that he (the CM) is associated with him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/majithias-sand-mining-allegations-against-me-out-of-revenge-channi-101642882664825.html

In a video circulating on social media, Mustafa, who is also the principal strategic adviser to Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, can be heard saying, “My ‘jalsa’ was scheduled here but they (AAP) tried to create noise. If it happens again, I swear, I will not let them gather. I am not an RSS agent who hides in fear at home. I am not contesting for votes. I am fighting for the community. I want to tell the police and civil administration that if permission is given for such parallel events, I will create a situation which will be difficult to handle. My community, Sikh brothers, Dalits and good Hindus are with me. I will beat ‘broom people’ at their households with ‘jharu’ (broom).” “I stand by my stance that if it happens again, we will teach them a lesson,” said Mustafa over phone on Saturday. AAP candidate Jamil-ur-Rehman said he filed a complaint with the election commission against Mustafa. “He threatened to beat up AAP workers and candidate. We urged the election commission to take action against Mustafa and transfer of local SHOs,” said Rehman. Malerkotla SDM-cum-returning officer Jasbir Singh said he has issued notices for violation of model code to Congress and AAP. BJP demands FIR against ex-DGP Chandigarh: The Punjab BJP on Saturday announced to file a complaint with the Election Commission of India (ECI) over an alleged “communal” speech made by Mustafa at a rally in Malerkotla. “Look at how low these Congress leaders can go to garner votes. The video shows the statement was made to orchestrate riots. Coming from a person who had taken constitutional oath as an IPS officer is most shocking,” said party’s national spokesperson, Shazia Ilimi, adding that an FIR should be registered against Mustafa for his alleged attempt to disturb communal peace. BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh also blamed the Punjab Congress for creating a serious threat to the national security and urged the ECI to order registration of a criminal case against Mustafa. “There was absolutely no Hindu-Muslim controversy. It was a verbal outburst mischievously provoked by jhaduwallahs (AAP workers). My nationalistic credentials are far superior to yours (BJP’s) with a history of life-long fight against enemies of India and destroyers of communal harmony,” Mustafa said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-ex-dgp-mustafa-threatens-to-beat-up-aap-workers-in-malerkotla-triggers-row-101642882184177.html
23-01-2022||Chandigarh||Flats for Punjab, Haryana officials: Chandigarh admn may shelve project||The UT administration is considering shelving the ambitious project to come up with luxury flats for officials and MLAs of Punjab and Haryana at IT Park, as both governments are yet to fulfil their financial commitments to the project.“We want to proceed with the project, but Punjab and Haryana, who are major stakeholders in the project, are yet to deposit their share of funds. In this situation, we cannot move ahead with the project. A final decision will be taken in the upcoming meeting of the CHB board,” said a senior CHB official.CHB has already finalised the architectural plans for the project, which is to come up on 6.73 acres. The board plans to construct 10 towers with 28 flats, each having a base price of ₹2 crore. In September 2019, CHB had sought opinions of both governments regarding these flats for their officials. Additionally, PGIMER had also expressed willingness to buy the flats. All three agencies are expected to pay ₹66 crore each for their share of flats.CHB officials have given presentations on different aspects of the project to the Punjab and Haryana officials, who have repeatedly assured that the payment will be made. But even after repeated reminders, they haven’t released 25% payment.The project land is part of the 123 acres that CHB got back from Parsvnath Developers after a long-drawn legal battle. It was in October 2006 that CHB had decided to develop residential, commercial and other infrastructure with Parsvnath Developers at IT Park, but the project didn’t take off because of multiple reasons. Thereafter, CHB failed to sell 18 residential and commercial sites at an e-auction in 2018, primarily due to the high reserved prices. Thereafter, it decided to launch a general housing scheme on two of the plots.Of the 11 residential sites, the high-end flats for government officials are planned to come up on one. In two plots, CHB will construct 728 flats and offer it to public under a general housing scheme. The rest of the eight sites are likely to go under hammer in a month’s time. In these freehold plots ranging from 3.5 acre to 6 acres, multi-storey apartments will come up, to be constructed by private developers.

The police stations include Sarabha Nagar, PAU, Haibowal, Division Number 5 and Division Number 8.Grewal said the SHOs of these police stations are being influenced by sitting Congress MLA Bharat Bhushan Ashu and his wife Mamta Ashu, who is a municipal councillor. Grewal said the presence of these officers in the constituency will prove to be a hindrance to free and fair conduct of elections.The SAD leader further said that during the recent police reshuffle, before the model code of conduct came into force, these SHO were shifted within the constituency. He requested the election commission to transfer the SHOs and bring in those officers who have not worked in the constituency for the past three years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sad-candidate-maheshinder-grewal-requests-ec-to-transfer-5-shos-out-of-ludhiana-west-101642881284158.html

23-01-2022||Chandigarh||Forgery of Punjab DGP’s orders: Accused removed bad entries from Ludhiana cop’s annual report||Adverse entries in the annual confidential report (ACR) of an inspector were also removed by the accused while forging orders of the then Punjab director general of police (DGP). This was shared with a local court that took up the anticipatory bail plea of one of the key suspects, sub-inspector Harwinder Singh, in connection with the recent forgery of Punjab DGP’s orders. The said inspector, Daljit, is posted in Ludhiana and as per the complaint from the DGP office, through an order, dated January 8, the bad entries in his ACR were eliminated. The order later turned out to be fake. The forged order stated that the said inspector had got appreciation letters from two senior officials for his work and thus his bad entries be removed. Considering the submissions, the court dismissed Harwinder’s plea for anticipatory bail. The Chandigarh Police had registered a case on January 11, following a complaint by Vibhor Kumar, a staff officer with the Punjab DGP office, Sector 9, Chandigarh. He had complained to the UT Police that he had received four fake promotion orders under the forged signature of the then Punjab DGP, Siddharth Chattopadhyaya. These fake orders included two regarding promotions of Punjab Police personnel, one removing bad entries from some ACRs and another about recruitment of two constables. A case under Sections 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (cheating), 464 (false document in the name of a fictitious person), 465 (forgery), 467 (forgery of valuable security, or to receive any money, etc), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered in this regard. So far, police have arrested six people in the case, including Kulwinder Singh, personal assistant of the former DGP, inspector Satwant Singh Sidhu, posted in Mohali; a dismissed sub-inspector, Sarabjit Singh; Sandeep Kumar and Bahadur Singh, both working as superintendents in Punjab DGP’s office; and head constable Mani Katoch, whose name figures in the forged promotion list. All are currently in police remand. Readied orders in DGP office Investigations into the forgery of the four orders revealed that the accused prepared the orders in the DGP office itself. The police are yet to arrest assistant sub-inspector Harwinder Singh, sub-inspector Satinder Pal Singh and constable Sanjiv, who are among the beneficiaries of the forged orders, issued on January 4 and 8. “Accused Satinder Pal and Kulwinder used to sit together in DGP office and prepare the forged orders. A laptop containing these orders has been recovered,” said Ketan Bansal, superintendent of police (City), Chandigarh.

A case under Section 420 of the IPC was registered after verification.PGIMER waives OPD registration fee Amid the spike in Covid cases, the PGIMER administration has decided to waive registration charges for patients visiting the OPDs after taking appointments via tele-consultation. The institute had suspended walk-in OPDs on January 10 and has been attending to patients in person only after providing them prior appointment through tele-consultation. The decision was taken to prevent exposure of co-morbid patients to the infection. Medical superintendent Dr Vipin Kaushal said, “The waiver is for the time being, as queuing up to pay the fee creates hurdles.

23-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: HC dismisses bail plea of gangster Monty Shah||The Punjab and Haryana high court has dismissed the bail plea of gangster Monty Shah in a December 2019 case registered by the Chandigarh Police.Shah, 28, had approached the high court for bail in June 2020. The FIR pertains to alleged recovery of a country made pistol and live cartridges from him. He had told the court that he had been in custody for more than eight months since his arrest in May 2021 and the challan had been presented.Had jumped bail beforeDuring the hearing, it came to light that Shah was arrested on December 10, 2019, and was granted interim bail due to the Covid-19 situation. The interim bail was extended from time to time up to December, 11, 2020. But he did not surrender thereafter and was eventually arrested on May 15, 2021, in another case. An aide of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, Shah has many cases of extortion, attempt to murder, robbery and Arms Act registered against him in Chandigarh. Before his arrest in 2021, police had announced a reward of ₹50,000 for any information about his whereabouts.Opposing the bail, UT’s counsel had told the court that he had jumped the interim bail and was further involved in seven more cases, so there was every chance of him absconding again.The bench of justice Avneesh Jhingan dismissed the bail plea observing that Shah’s conduct was evident from the fact that he never surrendered after availing of interim bail and was arrested in another FIR. No reason has been put forth for not surrendering on December 12, 2020. The involvement of the petitioner in seven more cases was an indicator of his antecedents, the bench recorded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhhc-dismisses-bail-plea-of-gangster-monty-shah-101642881224153.html

23-01-2022||Chandigarh||Guest Column | Jinxed elections to premier golf club||The process to elect a managing committee for the Chandigarh Golf Club has been stalled yet again. The last democratically held elections are 2018 vintage, after which polls could not be held for a lack of contestants, and then due to the pandemic. In these circumstances, a select set of office-bearers continue to hold the office, unelected. After the double whammy of a two-year long pandemic, polls to the golf club were finally to be held on January 30, 2022, and a triangular contest was in the offing, when the jinx struck again and the elections were indefinitely postponed, citing the threat of a third wave of the coronavirus pandemic. On the surface, the decision, which was announced 23 days before the polls, seems to be a well-meaning one. However, ironically, the very next day, the Election Commission of India, announced assembly polls in five Indian states. They also categorically said that campaigning may commence only after January 15, indicating that the third wave of the pandemic may subside by then. Undoubtedly, assembly and golf club elections are incomparable in scope, intent and impact, but it cannot be denied that they are two sides of the same coin, and thus certain facts cannot be ignored. Contestants could have campaigned virtually Firstly, golf club elections do not involve any campaigning worth its name and can easily take place through word of mouth, telephone calls, and social media posts – ensuring social distancing. Secondly, the golf club authorities assumed that the pandemic will continue to remain a threat in January-end, which is something that the Election Commission of India did not assume ab initio. Even if the authorities had taken the final call two days before the polls, there would not have been any administrative inconvenience as most formalities take place in-house. The premature announcement has led speculations about the vested interests of the decision-makers. No general body meeting called Thirdly, several members have off and on demanded that decisions of this magnitude, pertaining to the functioning of the club, be discussed in a general body meeting. However, no such procedure was followed, which speaks of the arbitrariness of the incumbent committee’s decision. Lastly, to obviate the gathering of unpermissible number of people on the day of the polls, voting could have taken place in slots or online. One must take into account that even in normal circumstances around 1,000 people turn up for voting, the number is sure to be lesser in these troubled times. Thus, a well-managed eight-hour window would have proven adequate for voting, considering the vast premises of the golf club. The order to postpone the polls, therefore, seems hurried, and there is more to it than meets the eye.

23-01-2022||Chandigarh||Guest column | The good old days of Doordarshan||Gone are the days, when watching television together as a community was a unique and blissful experience. The limited sources of entertainment in those times explain the immense popularity of Doordarshan – the only national broadcaster in the early 80s. Before OTT platforms came into the picture, one would watch films together at cinema halls, popularly known as the talkies, and eagerly wait for the circus to come to town, especially on festive occasions. There used to be just one theatre in my native town, Ropar – Kalyan Talkies, which held us in a thrall, as opposed to the wide array of choices available to us now, thanks to the proliferation of the internet. Delving into my childhood memories takes me to my octogenarian grandfather’s house. After my Class 10 examination, my younger sister and I moved to our grandparents’ home in Ropar for further education as there were hardly any higher education institutions in Nangal where my father was posted. Bhapa ji, as we affectionately called him, had a penchant for novel gadgets and purchased a black and white television set back in the late 70s, when it was considered to be a luxury. He was among the few fortunate people in our sleepy town to own a television. Our ancestral house doubled as a cinema hall on weekends, especially Sunday evening, when diverse viewers, comprising mostly children and the elderly from nearby dwellings, thronged our home to watch Hindi feature films on Doordarshan. Known for her magnanimity and warmth, my grandmother would always roll out a dari in the open verandah for the children to squat, and set out chairs for the elderly so that they could watch the Ramayana in comfort. The Hindi news bulletin, which broadcast at 7:30pm, was like an interval, and my grandmother graciously served shikanji (lemonade) during the hot summers and hot tea in winter with home-made sweets such as ladoos, shakarpare and salted cookies (mathis) to go with it. On cloudy days when the signal was unclear, I was always given the unpleasant task to go to the rooftop to rotate the pipe affixed to the antenna. My sister signalled me from the ground to stop moving when the photographs became clear and the humming sound faded. It proved to be wonderful lesson in synchronisation.Chitrahaar, a weekly programme, featuring popular Hindi film songs was another star attraction on Doordarshan which was broadcast every Wednesday at 8pm in the good old days. I am also reminded of few striking instances when the power went off unexpectedly, playing spoilsport, and the spectators whose favourite programme had been interrupted would pray for the restoration of power – eyes closed and hands folded. Once my grandfather bought a screen with coloured patches to give the impression of a coloured TV, but it strained the eyes, and he immediately replaced it with a blue screen.The standout in those halcyon days was the unadulterated camaraderie and intense social bonding that took place as one enjoyed with their near and dear ones. Thus, fostering a sense of affection and amity. Nowadays, even close-knit family members do not have the time to sit together. Distressingly, this unsavoury development reflects a sense of growing individualism, which has distanced us from our loved ones. Kudos to the mesmerising national broadcaster, which acted as a unifying force, keeping our social fabric intact.opinder.lamba@gmail.com(The writer is additional director (press) to the Punjab chief minister)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-the-good-old-days-of-doordarshan-101642880144338.html
23-01-2022||Chandigarh||Guest Column | Sorority bonding over K-dramas||The sorority bonding that one experiences when among a bevy of female friends and relatives one finds a kindred soul who is head over heals in love with K-Dramas is akin to finding an oasis in the middle of a desert or sighting land when you are lost in the high seas. It is no less than finding your one and only sibling, whom you had probably lost in the kumbh mela, or finding a misplaced favourite dress after a year. For Indians, the love for dramas or television series probably dates back to the mid-80s. Weekly series such as the Ramayana, Mahabharata, Buniyaad, Khandaan, and Nukkad were not mere shows but an integral part of the average Indian household. I vividly remember that once during a family gathering, my aunt quipped, “You may say whatever you want, but nobody is more beautiful than our Akshara.” My husband, who has a poor track record as far as TV series are concerned, looked at me quizzically and asked, “I didn’t know your aunt had a daughter named Akshara.” I had to explain it to him in muted tones that my aunt was not talking about her daughter but the heroine of a popular daily show! The Indian television industry has come a long way and is churning out soap operas and daily series of every variety and genre. However, ever since I started watching K-dramas, I confess, I have not been able to go back to the indigenous dramas. It all started when my younger daughter invited me to watch a Netflix series with her. After watching a couple of an English series, we moved on to Turkish, German and Spanish shows with English subtitles to help us cruise through. It was then that I struck gold with a romantic K-drama based on the love story between a ‘chaebol’ heir and his secretary. The information about the series read– romantic, ‘swoon worthy’ and ‘drool worthy’– terms which were cliché enough to put off a middle-aged woman like me. However, contrary to my expectations, the first scene had me hooked to it. The age factor was hurriedly swept aside as the die-hard romantic in me resurfaced, and not only rejoiced at the ‘sweet nothings’ of the love-sick young couple but also shared their numerous anxieties throughout the show. I have watched more than 50 K-dramas. What began as a mere source of entertainment has now become a source of exposure to another society– its culture, tradition, cuisine, music and vocabulary. In a manner similar to our own, parents there also fuss over their children’s education, career prospects and matrimonial aspects. Like Indians they, too, arrange memorial services for their departed ones. Food is an essential element of their culture and they cherish their cuisine, which is slowly making its way into the world food market. ‘Kimchi’ just like our desi ‘achaar’ is an essential element of their meals, is prepared in almost similar fashion and quantity, preserved over the year and distributed among family, friends and relatives. Thanks to ‘hallyu’– the Korean wave of entertainment– Oxford English Dictionary went on to add 26 Korean words to its existing lexis. The words include noona, oppa, hanbok, japchae . Also, the world learned a new language of love through ‘saranghae’ which means I love you popularised by the highly acclaimed series ‘Crash Landing on You’ and also through a number of good looking, chocolate faced ‘oppas’ like Hyun Bin, Park Seo-joon, Gong Yoo and Kim Seon-ho to name a few.There are critics out there who term these K-dramas not only ‘cringe-worthy’ but also unrealistic, clichéd and inaccurate. However, I feel that they are entertaining and instantly strike a chord with the viewers with their charming locales, technology and talent. What best describes Korean dramas is the fact that despite the dismal circumstances and everyday struggles of their characters, they continue to dole out messages of hope–hope that helps one survive in the darkest of times.sonrok15@gmail.comThe writer is an associate professor at SD College, Ambala Cantt||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-sorority-bonding-over-kdramas-101642879845421.html

23-01-2022||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz | Obit for grand old lady, Gulabo||At an estimated 35-40 years, Gulabo, one of the oldest sloth bears of India passed gently into the night. She was fortunate to have lived the last 16 years of her long life entirely on her own terms, punctual in her habits of basking in the sun, eating at regular intervals and keeping to herself. Her life was in two phases: the first one of suffering and exploitation, forced to perform tricks and dancing on her weak, aging limbs for the entertainment of mohalla crowds. “Her life as a ‘dancing bear’ was unkind in every way -- she was deprived of a nutritious diet and proper veterinary care, and as time passed, the neglect took a toll on her health. She developed arthritis and was suffering from complete blindness,” revealed a statement issued by the renowned NGO, Wildlife SOS. Gulabo’s life took a miraculous turn when she was rescued in 2006 by the NGO and rehabilitated at its centre located inside the Van Vihar National Park, Bhopal (MP). There, she received specialised treatment from vets. She passed away due to old age earlier this week, quietly in her sleep, surrounded by people who loved and cared for her. Along with Gulabo, the NGO has rescued 628 bears from the dancing trade. Geeta Seshamani, Co-Founder & Secretary of Wildlife SOS, told this writer: “As Gulabo leaves us with a certain heaviness in our hearts, we applaud her strength and perseverance. We find solace in knowing that she was able to live a peaceful life at Wildlife SOS, a place where she was cherished and treated with dignity.”There was something of sterling character that profiled Gulabo, much like a reclusive, dignified and doughty widow of an Army chief from ‘old school’ peerage. “Gulabo would come for food, dot at the appointed hour: 10 am (porridge), 1 pm (fruits) and 4 pm (broken wheat). Nothing could deter her from the food spot until she had her fill. She troubled no one and in turn wanted no one to mess with her lifestyle. She loved mangoes with a passion, especially Dasheri. She could sense mango season had set in with her sharp olfactory capabilities and would eat less porridge at 10 am so that she could relish more mangoes at 1 pm! But she could be very difficult when getting to weigh her or securing a blood sample. We would keep away from her when one of those cantankerous moods gripped her. Gulabo reminded me of a loner, self-possessed granny, firmly set in her ways,” Dr. Rajat Kulkarni, the vet who presided over her welfare in her twilight years, told this writer. A mother’s torment If she could cry like a distressed human mother, this Laughing dove would have to be dispossessed of her common English name. In our garden in Chandigarh’s Sector 19, dwells a pair of Laughing doves. For years, they have bred with mixed success, hatching chicks that sometimes perish on turning juveniles. This year, they met with a series of marauders at the nest stage.In July, when the breeding season was in full swing, the doves chose a niche spot deep in our hedge fronting the road. Their frenetic activity caught the attention of a Shikra and the raptor made a swoop on the dove as she emerged from the nest. A flurry of her feathers burst in the air as talons raked her. She survived the attack but shifted her nest. The spot was a totally exposed one, above the door on a narrow ledge over our domestic helper’s quarters. The House crows soon found out and that was the end of her two frail eggs.This week, the Small Indian mongoose that wanders around our garden, ferreted out the determined mother’s third try at nesting. The nest was well concealed in another part of the thick hedge but the cunning marauder scaled the foliage and came out with a single egg. The egg was relished and the mother dove just sat on the wire, looking down stoically at the pathetic remains of her egg, split open into two dry, empties. I am sure she is going to try again. But I entertain no prayer in favour of who should win the fourth round: mother or a marauder. vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzz-obit-for-grand-old-lady-gulabo-101642879546661.html
23-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Candidates’ kids take charge to meet voters, lead digital campaign||From holding conventional public meetings to organising digital campaigning, the children of many of those in the poll fray in Punjab are leading from the front with a view to ensuring the electoral success of their parents. They are helping their parents not only cater to the aspirations of the electors but also make sense of an ever-changing political landscape in the times of digital media. Rubal Manoj Bansal, daughter of Manoj Bala Bansal, the Congress candidate from the Maur constituency, has roped in a New Delhi-based social media agency for electioneering of her mother. Rubal, a PhD scholar who has also studied management, says meeting people in the rural belt is a joyous experience. She has taken charge of her mother’s Facebook page and Twitter handle besides video and photo profiling online.“My first stint in campaigning was in 2017 for my mother, a former district president of the Congress’ Mansa unit. There has been a major shift in electioneering and even voters expect a digital presence of the candidates. I am heading a team of 10 professionals for designing virtual campaigning,” she said.Since state finance minister Manpreet Badal is locked in a close contest from the Bathinda Urban segment, his daughter Rhea Badal has jumped into campaigning. A graduate in culture and communications from New York University, Rhea started meeting people on Friday.On day 1, she was seen distributing pamphlets highlighting Manpreet’s development initiatives in Bathinda.

23-01-2022||Chandigarh||Delhi govt to take decision on Bhullar’s release once legal process gets over: Bhagwant Mann||Aam Aadmi Party’s chief ministerial candidate Bhagwant Mann on Saturday said the legal process in the case of 1993 Delhi bomb blast convict Davinder Singh Bhullar is going on and the Arvind Kejriwal-led government will take a decision on his release once it gets over.It has been alleged by Sikh bodies, including the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), that Kejriwal is not giving clearance to the permanent release of Bhullar, who is undergoing life imprisonment after the Supreme Court commuted his death sentence.Talking to mediapersons outside the Golden Temple in Amritsar where he paid obeisance after being declared the AAP’s CM face, Mann said, “A decision will be taken as and when the process is over.”On a query about the AAP’s stand on giving Punjab river waters to other states, including Delhi, he said, “Punjab’s waters will remain in the state. Actually, Punjab does not have water. It has lost its groundwater level. The state’s Malwa region may turn into a desert in coming times.”The statement comes days after Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu asked Kejriwal to clear his stand on the Satluj-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal issue.Earlier, when Mann was about to enter the shrine, some Sikh activists attempted to approach him to question him over the issue pertaining to the release of Bhullar. This sent the police into a tizzy as some activists in nihangs’ attire were able to get close to him, breaching his security cover. Also, members of the Sikh Students Federation (SSF) staged a demonstration at Ram Talai Chowk against Kejriwal and burnt his effigy, accusing him of creating hurdles in the way of Bhullar’s release. Later, Mann paid obeisance at the Durgiana Temple and Ram Tirath temple besides visiting Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar. “Besides seeking blessings of God for contesting the battle for Punjab, I came here to pray for brotherhood, harmony and peace in the state. We want to make Punjab a prosperous state again,” he added.
23-01-2022||Mumbai||Mumbai fire: 6 dead, 24 injured in Tardeo’s Kamala building blaze; BMC orders enquiry||Mumbai: A level three (major) blaze in a 20-storey building in Tardeo, Mumbai Central, early Saturday morning, left six persons dead and 24 persons injured, including eight who are in a critical condition, even as 13 fire tenders and seven water tankers of the Mumbai fire brigade took five hours to douse the fire that broke out and was contained to the 19th floor of Sachinam Heights (also called Kamala building), built as part of a redevelopment project eight years ago. Three of the deceased — Hitesh Mistry, his sister, Moushmi and mother Meena Mistry — were residents of flat 1904, which is suspected to be the flat where the fire broke out. It was completely gutted in the blaze. Among the others who lost their life in the tragic incident included 75-year-old Manjuben Kantharia, who was a resident of the 19th floor, and Purushottam Chopdekar, a resident of the 16th floor. One of the deceased is yet to be identified as the body was charred beyond recognition. The civic body has conducted a DNA test to ascertain the identity of the person. The city’s chief fire officer Hemant Parab said that the building’s fire safety system, including its sprinkler system and fire alarms, was not functioning and the fire department is investigating the cause of the fire.Municipal Commissioner of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) Iqbal Singh Chahal on Saturday ordered an enquiry and directed the civic administration to submit its report within 15 days. This is the fourth such incident of such magnitude in a Mumbai high-rise in as many months, prompting the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to direct the chief electrical inspector to carry out an electrical audit of all high-rise buildings with a height of 15 m and above. Prime Minister Narendra Modi condoled the deaths and announced an ex-gratia amount of ₹2 lakh to the families of the deceased and ₹50,000 to those injured. Mumbai suburban guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray, who visited the tragedy site on Saturday afternoon, accompanied by the Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar, announced an ex-gratia amount of ₹5 lakh for the families of the deceased.Most of the 400 residents in the building were able to rush out soon after the fire broke out, even as thick smoke filled the passageways. The smoke was able to descend rapidly due to a duct that ran down the building and opened on to each floor. In many floors, the opening was not properly sealed. At least 30 people rescued by the fire department were rushed to different hospitals, including the nearest, Bhatia hospital, as well as other private hospitals including Wockhardt, Sir HN Reliance Foundation hospital and Masina hospital. The seriously injured were also brought to civic-run BYL Nair and Kasturba hospitals. While 17 people were discharged after treatment, at least eight persons are critically injured. The Kantharia family suspected that the unidentified deceased person could be their son, Kirit. Kamlakar Dalvi (64) had woken up to fill water, which is released by the municipal body between 7 and 8 am every day, when he first heard the screams. When he opened the door of his fourth floor flat, he saw the passageway filled with thick smoke emerging from the duct door. Rousing his family he rushed out along with other neighbours towards the ground floor.At 7.26 am, the Mumbai Fire Brigade’s control room received a frantic call: a massive fire had broken out on the 19th floor of a high-rise in Tardeo, located in the cramped lanes of Nana Chowk in Mumbai Central area. By 7.42 am, the blaze was declared a Level 3 fire and 13 fire engines as well as seven water tankers from 12 stations — the nearest a few minutes away — rushed to the spot.The firemen had to enter the building wearing breathing equipment in order to douse the fire. To start with, the fire blazed on the 19th floor of the 20-storey building. The skyline surrounding the building is a warren of wires and accessing the window of the flat where the fire blazed would have been difficult. The building itself was located inside a lane whose width was only enough for one fire engine to enter at a time.“The morning water comes between 7-8 am regularly and I was going to check the water valve when I saw smoke and heard screams from our neighbours as well. We alerted the remaining flats in our floor and managed to get out of the building. As the fire alarms were not working people didn’t get any warning sign and people had to literally rush out from their bed,” said Dalvi, who is also a member of the managing committee of the building.Fire system non-functionalCFO Hemant Parab said the building’s firefighting system was defunct. “The fire-fighting system inside the building was defunct. The sprinklers were not working and the extinguishers were outdated as well,” he said.According to Parab, the fire could have either originated inside a duct that ran through the length of the building or inside flat number 1904 which was gutted. The cause of the fire is under investigation, he said. However, the duct, which was filled with wiring and cables, aided in the spread of the fire. The duct opened onto each floor, but guidelines state that the shaft doors should be sealed or locked. Not all were and the duct became a conduit for the fire and the smoke to spread rapidly from the top floors down to the ones below. “All the electric cable lines that ran through the duct were burnt completely, therefore the corridors and staircases got covered with thick smoke and rescue operation became difficult for us,” Parab said.The MFB said that most of the deceased and injured were residents between the 20th and 16th floors of the building.The fire brigade will send a notice to the building (owners or occupiers/or the residents’ managing committee) under the Maharashtra Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures Act 2006, for flouting fire safety rules. According to the provision of this act, it is the responsibility of owner or occupier to maintain the inbuilt fire fighting system in good working condition at all times and a certificate in Form B issued by Government Approved Licensed Agency needs to be submitted twice in the year, which is the fire safety audit report of the building. The fire brigade said that the building had not submitted its bi-annual fire safety audit reports.Kamala building was a redeveloped apartment complex that was readied in 2013, and many of its residents had lived in slums located on the same plot. They began moving into the building in 2016. The last fire drill conducted in the building was four years ago. The building has 135 flats with eight on each floor; the carpet area of the flats range from 225 to 315 square feet.Nanda Chavan, a resident of the fourth floor said the instructions imparted during the mock fire drill helped her maintain composure during Saturday’s incident.“We followed our training during the mock drills and refrained from using elevators and chose to use staircases instead,” Chavan, whose relatives lived in the 13th floor and are in a critical condition, said.“In the morning, we heard screams of residents living in Kamala building. We saw smoke coming out from the top floors and many of our residents started to throw water from their windows as well,” said Kamal Shah, a resident of the neighbouring Matru Mandir Society.Residents of Matru Mandir arranged for food and water, and the community hall of this building became a triage area for those evacuated, who were given basic medical aid. “I was washing the cars in my building when I saw flames coming out. I rushed out and switched off the valve of the gas line to prevent any further damage,” said Chandan Singh, a society caretaker.BMC to conduct audit Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Saturday ordered an enquiry into the fire incident, and has directed the civic administration to submit the report in 15 days. The enquiry will be headed by the deputy municipal commissioner in-charge of zone 2, and the committee will consist of the assistant commissioner (ward officer) of the D ward, deputy chief engineer of the building proposals department, chief engineer of the mechanical and electrical department, and an officer from the Mumbai fire brigade. The enquiry will look into three aspects: cause of fire in consultation with Chief Fire Officer, reasons for the spread of the fire, illegal addition / alteration in the building beyond approved plans, if any. BMC also informed the office of chief electrical inspector to carry out the electrical audit of all the high rise buildings that have a height 15 m and above. Additional municipal commissioner Ashwini Bhide met CFO to conduct periodical electrical audit of residential buildings to prevent incidents of fire due to short circuits, a BMC statement stated.Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis tweeted his condolence on Saturday morning and said, “ Shocked & anguished to know nearby hospitals refused admissions to injured, which resulted into more deaths.”This prompted a statement from Dr Satyadeo Malik, chief executive officer, Bhatia Hospital (which is closest to Kamala building) later in the evening in which he stated, “All the patients were immediately attended, and all required treatment was provided.”“Twenty patients from the Kamla building fire incident were brought at Bhatia Hospital Tardeo today. The Immediate and timely intervention from the RMOs of Bhatia Hospital helped to save lives. Five of them were treated in casualty and allowed to go home. One was brought dead. Two patients with serious burn injuries were transferred to Kasturba and Masina hospital. Twelve patients were admitted, six of them are critical and kept under constant observation in the ICU. The other 6 patients admitted in the ward are stable. The patients are being treated for excess smoke inhalation and breathing difficulty,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-fire-6-dead-24-injured-in-tardeo-s-kamala-building-blaze-bmc-orders-enquiry-101642879187024.html
23-01-2022||Lucknow||UP polls: Yogi flags off LED raths, Anurag Thakur launches drive with placards||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) face in the 2022 UP polls, flagged off LED-screen fitted “raths” (motorised campaign vehicles) as Union information and broadcasting minister Anurag Thakur stood at the Hazratganj crossing in Lucknow, holding publicity placards with four others.The move signalled the BJP’s intent to come up with innovative campaigning models for the UP polls amid the election commission’s ban on physical rallies and road shows in view of Covid-19. The BJP has, along with virtual rallies, decided to use LED-screen fitted motorised campaign vehicles that would move in all the 403 assembly constituencies. During the launch of the innovative publicity drive, BJP cadres stood in batches of five holding placards. Anurag Thakur targeted Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav who earlier in the day had promised to create 22 lakh jobs in the IT sector. “During SP rule, IT meant income from terror and SP’s brand ambassadors were Mukhtar Ansari, Yunus Ansari, Ateeq Ahmad and Nahid Hasan. Back then, actual IT companies stayed out of UP whereas now, UP is emerging as an IT hub,” Anurag Thakur said. “Today, we have in line with EC directives launched a campaign with five-member teams holding placards on different themes. This would be done throughout the state,” Anurag Thakur said. The campaign raths, launched by Adityanath, left for their destinations while playing up the party’s theme song “UP phir maange bhajapa sarkar (UP again seeks a BJP government).” The raths have a couple of people on board are are carrying party’s campaign material to be distributed to the people. Along with the theme song, the raths would also play up other promotional songs.The LED screens would also play video clips of Prime Minister Narendra Modi washing the feet of sanitation workers in Kumbh, greeting masons who built the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor with a flower shower, Adityanath dining with Dalits in the countryside. This is part of the BJP’s attempt to continue the engagement with OBCs and Dalits, the mainstays of party’s spectacular wins in 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections and the 2017 UP polls. The song “bhool nahi jaana re (don’t forget)” will also be played up to remind the viewer about not getting complacent.

She said that people should opt for a government which focuses on development and strengthens infrastructure. She, however, questioned, “When a grand Lord Rama temple is being constructed in Ayodhya, why not a grand temple of Lord Krishna be constructed in Mathura?” She also encouraged people of the state to exercise their franchise in the coming state assembly polls under all circumstances, claiming that it will strengthen democracy.She also appealed to members of the transgender community to cast their vote in the state assembly elections. “When we vote for a healthy and vibrant democracy, it will surely bring overall development of the state benefiting all, including members of the third gender. One must realise the power of each and every vote and ensure that people come forward to strengthen democracy,” she added.State president of Kinnar Akhara, Swami Kaushalyanand Giri, aka Tina Mai, said that people should understand the power of their vote and every eligible voter must cast his or her vote in the state assembly polls. “We have been taking up voter awareness campaigns across the state,” she added.Mahamandleshwar Swami Kalyaninand Giri, aka Choti Guru, also appealed to citizens of the Sangam city to realise the power of their vote and choose a healthy government which would work for their development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/good-if-lotus-blooms-again-in-up-kinnar-akhara-chief-101642879064166.html

23-01-2022||Mumbai||Mumbai fire: Regular electrical and fire safety audits must to prevent accidents: experts||Mumbai: Last October, a fire was reported from the 19th floor of the 60-storey One Avighna Park in Currey Road, claiming one life. A month later, two senior citizens were killed in a blaze at Kandivali’s Hansa Heritage. The Kamala Building fire in Tardeo on Saturday, where six people died, was an addition to the list of major fires in the city in the last three months. Data from the Mumbai fire brigade shows 70% of the fire incidents are caused by electrical short circuit. An officer said, “There are three aspects to fire safety. Why fires do occur in residential high-rises; how a blaze that has already broken out in a building can be controlled; and how we can prevent loss of lives.” According to the fire officer, regular audits and repairs to electrical wires in buildings are a must. “A functional firefighting system is the first buffer of safety for residents, and it prevents damage to property as well. In the absence of it, the fire brigade has to set up its own equipment, which consumes the precious first few minutes. This in turn leads to raging fires, and loss of life.” The officer said citizens must be aware of fire safety rules and owners or residents of a building should hold regular fire drills. “Fire exits should not be blocked at any cost.” Owners or occupiers of all buildings are required to conduct bi-annual fire safety audits to ensure the firefighting equipment are in working condition. The audit reports should be sent to the fire brigade. The Mumbai fire brigade has also been tasked with fire compliance responsibilities. After the fire at Kamala Mills, a separate unit was set up with 34 fire compliance officers to carry out surprise inspections at residential and commercial buildings. From November 18, 2021, to January 8, 2022, as many as 223 high-rises were inspected and notices were issued under the Maharashtra Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures Act 2006. Recently, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation held a meeting of the chief fire officer, officials from its mechanical and electrical department, development plan department, and a representative of chief electrical inspector, Maharashtra. It was decided to conduct periodic electrical audit of all buildings to reduce the fire incidents caused by defective electric circuit. Vilas Nagalkar, a city-based architect, said, “It is crucial to have regular electrical and fire safety audits. There are also third-party agencies who can be hired for facility management in buildings.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-fire-regular-electrical-and-fire-safety-audits-must-to-prevent-accidents-experts-101642878884110.html
23-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi’s Sunday book market, mired in #WeekendCurfew||It’s the third Sunday in a row that the popular Sunday Book Bazaar, still remembered as the one from Daryaganj, will be missed by bibliophiles. An old haven for not just students but readers from all age groups, this weekly market has been the perfect place to scout or hoard anything from textbooks and novels to magazines and diaries or planners; that too at throwaway prices. But with the weekend curfew restrictions in the Capital, the 276 booksellers at this bazaar say they have no hopes of reviving their business. Irshad, a book seller who travels from Lakdi Market, near Welcome Metro Station, to set-up his stall at this bazaar shares, “Hum har hafte ₹2,000-2,500 kama lete the is bazaar se. Isse ghar ka kharcha nikal jata tha. Ab sab thapp hai. I hope ki jaldi normal ho jaye sab warna pata nahi ghar kaise chalayenge.” The weekly bazaar had got shifted from old Delhi’s pavements to Mahila Haat on Asaf Ali Road in 2019, and was running somehow until the pandemic hit. “For many months after the pandemic started in March-April 2020, the bazaar was only operational from 4pm to 8pm. During this time, we lost out on the morning influx of readers, jo subah subah aate the. Then, it had only been a month of normally functioning from 8am to 5pm, just when the weekend curfew made a blow to our businesses,” says Kamar Saeed, head of the Darya Ganj Patri Sunday Book Bazar Welfare Association. Pointing at the losses looming large for most of the sellers, Saeed informs that they are considering to appeal for financial help. “The book bazaar is the only dedicated book market in the area, and we’re proud to have contributed to the taleem (education) of students in Delhi. We only get a day in the week to earn and that with the ongoing weekend curfew, that avenue is also closed. It is necessary to have restrictions in place to curb the spread of Covid, but it’s unfortunate that this is affecting so many small vendors monetarily,” opines Saeed.Other book vendors chime in that with each passing weekend, it’s going to be a big challenge for them to sustain beyond a few weeks. “In case the Covid situation does not normalise soon, we are planning to write letters to the authorities to explain our plight. Madad ki guhaar lagayenge. It will be a big help if any section of the society could come forward to help us,” says Saeed. And Asharafi Lal Verma, the association’s vice president, adds: “More than 200 vendors live hand to mouth, week to week. They collect books for six days and then wait to sell them on Sunday. It’s not possible to shift the bazaar to any other day of the week or to sell the books online. We are planning to appeal to the authorities and general public to support us financially, via our website and via an NGO Seva Bharati, which recently distributed dry ration to us.” Those residents who are a regular at this market, too feel sad about the plight of vendors. “It’s here that I got all the exam related books, I needed, that too in fairly good condition and at just 30% of the printed price! I would not have been able to crack my exams if I had not got the books here at such a cheap deal,” says Prasu Jain, who recently cleared his exam and is now a statistics professional. And Meenu Rawat, a development practitioner with a non-profit organisation, who usually buys self- help and academic books from this market, adds: “This market excited and forced me to visit because of my love for books. It’s a heaven on the Earth for book lovers, and in my opinion it shouldn’t be closed else the condition of sellers will get worst. I know there’s a risk involved due to the pandemic, but if the buyers and the vendors both take safety precautions and if there is limited entry allowed, then we can keep enjoying the books here without the risk to public health.” Jain adds, “It should be made mandatory to produce vaccination certificate, for both the buyers as well as the sellers. But this part of Delhi’s culture, history and tradition of literature should not be allowed to wither away!” Author tweets @siddhijainnFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-sunday-book-market-mired-in-weekendcurfew-101642878837147.html

Often, in case there is a rift in the family, the bundle of joy helps mend that rift. Much the same is the case of Kesh Kumari, lodged in the Pratapgarh district jail for murdering her three-year-old son, last year.She delivered a baby girl a fortnight ago and that child is forcing a change of heart among family members, who had totally shunned Kesh Kumari, as well as fellow prisoners.Her husband, mother-in-law and other family members and fellow jail inmates, all have had a change of heart owing to the birth of the little one and have begun helping Kesh Kumari raise the newborn. Prison authorities, too, have begun providing much-needed nutritious food to Kesh Kumari as per the jail manual.The details are as follows. Rakesh Verma, a resident of Baijnath village of Antu police station of the neighbouring district of Pratapgarh is a labourer. On March 29, 2021, his wife, Kesh Kumari, insisted on going to her maternal home on Holi but Rakesh refused. It is alleged that an upset and angry Kesh Kumari killed her only son Yug (3) with a knife and even tried to slash her own throat. However, her screams of pain resulted in her mother-in-law, Prabhavati, waking up and crying out for help. Soon Rakesh and his father, Ramsukh, rushed in to find Yug’s body lying in a pool of blood, jail officials said.It is also alleged that the family members buried the body to escape police investigation. On the evening of March 30, when someone informed the police, the body was taken out and a post-mortem examination was carried out. On the complaint of Ramsukh, the police registered a case of murder against Kesh Kumari and also arrested Rakesh and Prabhavati for conspiracy.The latter two got bail but Kesh Kumari, pregnant at the time of the incident, was sent to jail. Soon, family members distanced themselves from her, prison officials said. After the birth of the girl, Kesh Kumari’s husband and mother-in-law went to meet her for the first time after a long gap and had even brought Sonthoura, Achwani and Pissua (ethnic preparations given to a woman who has delivered a baby) among other things for her and the baby. Because of this, her condition too has started to improve, officials said. Even the jail administration made arrangements of a special nutritional diet as per the jail manual. Officials said that as the jail staff and female prisoners were also concerned about the newborn, the little girl has started getting extra care from everyone. A woman head warder, considered very strict by the prisoners, has started massaging the newborn after her duty hours. Women prisoners are helping in preparing ‘Uptaan’ (the paste of turmeric and gram flour) and have brought oil for the massage of the child. Jail superintendent, RP Chaudhary, said, “After the birth of the girl, Kesh Kumari is being treated and provided all help according to the jail manual and the guidelines of the Supreme Court for pregnant women in jails.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/newborn-forces-change-of-heart-towards-mother-in-pratapgarh-jail-101642878705226.html

The violence was triggered after cattle carcasses were found strewn outside Chingrawathi village. Yogesh was among the 80 people, of which 27 were named and rest ‘unknown’, who were booked by the police for their alleged role in the violence. He was the Bulandshahr unit convener of the Bajrang Dal at the time of the incident but is no longer its member, an office-bearer of the right-wing outfit had told PTI in May 2021 after he had won the local panchayat polls. Syana assembly constituency goes to polls on February 10 during the first phase of elections in the state. The election results will be out on March 10.

As per data provided by the school education department, till January 21, 4.4 lakh of 6.54 lakh students in the 15-18 age bracket had received the first dose of the vaccine. In Mahendergarh, 91% eligible students have received the first dose, the highest in the state, followed by Gurugram (87%), Rewari (84%), Karnal and Faridabad (76%), Palwal (75%), Jind, Yamunanagar, Kaithal and Charkhi Dadri (74%), Jhajjar (72%), Bhiwani (71%), Ambala (69%), Panchkula (68%), Sirsa (64%), Sonepat (62%), Fatehabad (60%), Panipat (59%), Hisar (58%), Rohtak (44%) and Nuh (21%).As many as 76,363 government school employees have received both doses of the vaccine in the state, while 13,734 have received only the first shot. Haryana has 14,160 government schools with 1,04, 169 employees.Jhajjar district with 526 schools and 3,857 teachers reported 95% vaccination (single and double dose) among the school staff, followed by Karnal (94 %), Ambala (93%), Yamunanagar (92 %) , Faridabad, Rewari , Fatehabad and Gurugram with (91 %).Nuh district also performed poorly in vaccinating school staff, with only 61% employees vaccinated.

Twenty-one percent of the government staff are yet to receive the first dose in Rohtak, 19% in Hisar, 18% in Bhiwani, 17% in Sonepat and 16% in Jind.Nuh district immunisation officer Dr Basant Dubey said there is vaccine hesitancy among a sizeable section of Mewat residents, and that closure of schools had slowed down the process. “Our Asha workers, auxiliary nursing midwife (ANMs), and trained staff have been going to villages to persuade people,” he said, adding that parents’ illiteracy was another reason for the low rate of vaccination.On Rohtak’s poor performance in vaccinating children and teachers, civil surgeon Dr JS Punia said, “ We have decided to appoint teachers as nodal officers in their respective schools so that 100% vaccination can be achieved. The deputy commissioner has also taken a serious note of this issue and has sought a list of students and teachers who have missed the vaccination,” Punia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/33-of-haryana-govt-students-14-staffers-yet-to-receive-covid-vaccine-101642878583935.html

23-01-2022||Chandigarh||Experts sound caution after Ludhiana records 43 Covid deaths in 9 days||As many as 43 Covid deaths have been reported in Ludhiana in the last nine days, busting the myth that the third wave of the pandemic would be mild. While on Saturday, the district recorded seven Covid deaths, it saw 23 deaths over the last four days alone. Covid task force member, Dr Bishav Mohan said that there are three reasons for the spike in mortality rate. “Firstly, along with the new Omicron variant, the old and lethal Delta variant is also active in the state. Secondly, a large portion of our population is not fully vaccinated yet. Thirdly, majority of those infected were suffering from comorbidities, which is also adding to the mortality rate.”Dr Clarence J Samuel, head of the community medicine department of Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH), said, “The deaths are rising and the number of infections is also peaking. During the previous two waves too, we saw a rise in deaths two weeks after the infection rates started rising. More importantly, in all Covid waves witnessed so far, the infections started rising after a gap of six months.”He added, “We have to keep in mind that the Delta variant has not vanished yet, so we cannot afford to let our guard down.”In the last week of December, CMCH had shared a projection which stated that by January 6, over 1,000 cases will be reported from across the state and the infection will reach its peak by the end of January.“While majority of the residents were vaccinated around six months ago, there are many who did not take the second dose. However, the number of hospitalisations and deaths are relatively less as compared to the second wave,” added Dr Samuel.939 new cases detected In a small respite, the daily count of Covid cases went below the 1,000-mark on Saturday, as 939 infections were detected on the day. Seven fatalities were also recorded on the day, which included an 83-year-old man from Rahon Road, an 82-year-old man from Model House, a 65-year-old man from Daba Road, a 63-year-old woman from Civil Lines, a 63- year-old man from Jagraon, a 57-year-old man from Dhanas village and a 40-year-old man from GTB Nagar. The district currently has 7,676 active cases, of which 7,440 patients are in home isolation while 215 are admitted at private hospitals and 21 at government hospitals. The cumulative count has increased to 1,03, 578 of which 93,732 persons have recovered.The district administration is organising a mega vaccination drive on Sunday at 258 venues across the district. Deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma said that 28,58,021 persons (108.59 % of the targeted population) have received their first dose, while only 17,00,964 (64.63 %) have come forward for their second dose.He urged all persons whose second dose is pending, to come forward for vaccination.The DC reiterated that vaccination helps in boosting immunity and helps the body fight Covid if one gets infected. The deputy commissioner said all healthcare and frontline workers and those above the age of 60 years and having other ailments are eligible for a booster shot, if they have completed nine months from the date of administering the second dose. He also urged all government staff deputed on election duty to get vaccinated at the earliest. He said staff on election duty can get a booster dose after completion of 90 days from their second dose of vaccination. The DC further said that special vaccination camps for all election staff including teachers, government staff, bank employees, insurance sector etc who have been deputed for election duty, will be organised at all training centres on January 23, 2022. He said that both Covishield and Covaxin would be available at these camps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/experts-sound-caution-after-ludhiana-records-43-covid-deaths-in-9-days-101642878105721.html
23-01-2022||Lucknow||Keshav Prasad Maurya tweets reply to “UP mein ka ba”||PRAYAGRAJ: UP deputy chief minister and BJP candidate from Sirathu assembly seat of Kaushambi district Keshav Prasad Maurya on Saturday indirectly hit back at Bhojpuri singer Neha Singh Rathore through a tweet, albeit without directly referring to her or her song. In his tweet, Keshav Maurya said: UP mein e ba…Kisan ko chheh hajar ba, rashan do-do bar ba, mahilaon ko adhikar ba, sab gundan ko bukhar ba, dangai ki sampatti per bulldozer se prahar ba.” (This is there in UP: There is ₹6,000 for the farmers, two-time ration, right for the women, criminals in fever and bulldozer on properties of rioters). Through the tweet, Maurya seems to have pointed out that farmers in UP get income support of ₹6000 per annum under the PM Kisan Yojana, double ration is distributed to Antyodaya ration cardholders and eligible families, the rights of the women are protected, criminals are on back foot and rioters are being taken to task by the government targeting their assets. Maurya’s tweet is an apparent response to Bhojpuri singer Neha Singh Rathore’s latest number “UP Mein Ka Ba? (What is there in UP?)” which she had come out with after BJP MP Ravi Kishan’s song “UP Mein Sab Ba” (UP has everything) that chief minister Yogi Adityanath had released in Gorakhpur on January 15. Neha Singh Rathore, who is said to have brought out campaign songs during the Bihar assembly elections as well, through her song appeared to question chief minister Yogi Adityanath for his achievements, handling of Hathras incident and Covid-19. The song had also raised the issue of mowing down of farmers by a vehicle in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3, 2021. Ashish Mishra, the son of union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra Teni, is the main accused in the case. Without naming the chief minister or anyone else, Neha Rathore is heard singing, “Baba ke darbar ba, khatm rozgar ba. Hathras ke nirnaya jo hat, ladki ke parivar ba, arrey ka ba, UP mein ka ba, corona se lakhan mar gai le, lashan se Ganga bhar gai le (No jobs have been left in Baba’s darbar. What decision was taken with regard to Hathras incident? Lakhs died of Covid-19 and their bodies floated in the Ganga. What is there in UP?)” ‘Mantri ke bitwa badi rangatdar ba, mantri ke bitwa badi rangatdar ba, kisanan ke chhati pe raundat motor car ba. E chowkidar bolo ke jimmedar ba, ka ba, UP mein ka ba,” (The minister’s son had lot of influence and he mowed farmers down under his car. Chowkidar! Who is responsible. What is there in UP?). “Ram raj ke jhanki ba, Kashi Mathura baaki ba (Kashi and Mathura are yet to be achieved in their trailer of Ram Rajya),” she also sang. “Mandir masjid, mandir masjid main thanal gai rar ba, arey ka ba, UP mein ka ba. (There has been a dispute of temple and mosque. What is there in UP?),”the song went. Neha Rathore had shared the song on her Twitter handle and YouTube channel on January 16, a day after Ravi Kishan had released his song.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/keshav-prasad-maurya-tweets-reply-to-up-mein-ka-ba-101642878103903.html
23-01-2022||Mumbai||Clubhouse: One of three arrested accused a serial stalker of women, say police||Mumbai One of the three accused arrested by the Mumbai cyber police in the Clubhouse app case is a serial stalker of women on social media. Many victims are now coming forward after the arrest of Jaishnav Kakkar, 21, a senior officer said. “Since we have already added online stalking charges, we would use these women witnesses to make a watertight case against the accused.”Kakkar, Akash Suyal, 19, and Yash Parashar, 22, were arrested in Haryana on Friday for making objectionable comments against women, especially Muslim women, on Clubhouse, an audio chat application. They were brought to Mumbai and produced before a holiday court at Bandra on Saturday. Appearing for Suyal, advocate Shyam Rishi, opposed the police remand plea and said invoking sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Information Technology Act in the case was wrong. “They (the accused) were merely members of a chatroom, which is like a WhatsApp group.” He said the investigators had already seized their mobile phones and hence, there was no need for their police custody. “Our judicial system should treat them as victims and send them to correction homes.” The court, however, remanded the three in police custody till January 24. The cyber police are checking if there was anyone else instigating the young minds or if there was anyone supporting them financially or by any other means. DCP Rashmi Karandikar said, “As there were nearly 300 members in the chatrooms, we are trying to find out who else expressed their thoughts in vulgar and objectionable manners to defame women.” Rahul Kapoor, who was arrested by the Delhi police Special Cell on Saturday, was also under the Mumbai police’s scanner. He used fake name Bismillah-Ul Bilal Khan on Clubhouse.“Since he did not use vulgar language, he was not the immediate focus. We rather went after the moderator of both the chatrooms and those who were behind promoting their content on Instagram and other platforms,” a Mumbai police officer said. Two chatrooms were created on Clubhouse where participants were making derogatory statements about women and talking about auctioning their body parts.Suyal, who has passed class 12, was allegedly the moderator and main speaker of the two chatrooms. Kakkar is a BCom student, while Parashar is a student of law. Kakkar was using ‘@jaishnav’, while Parashar was using ‘Sherisingh ka papa’, ‘biker gang 5’ and pardhan@haryana_aala’ for promoting the chatroom talks. A crime branch official said two videos of the Clubhouse chatrooms were published by a Twitter user, ‘Jaimine’, and an Instagram account, ‘lotus watch’, on January 16 and 19, respectively. The moderator was using an ID, Kira XD, which was also used by Suyal. An FIR was filed by a woman with the cyber police on January 19. The complainant got to know about Clubhouse after she was alerted by a friend of her. “The complainant said her and her friend’s images were used in other Clubhouse chatrooms on October 27 and November 27, last year. Members used filthy, vulgar, and derogatory language and also auctioned private parts of the women,” a cyber police officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/clubhouse-one-of-three-arrested-accused-a-serial-stalker-of-women-say-police-101642878047490.html
23-01-2022||Other||Charging electric vehicles: Pioneering tech from IIT-BHU set to slash EV prices||Researchers from the department of electrical engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology-Banaras Hindu University (IIT-BHU) have developed a new technology for an on-board charger for vehicles, which costs about half the current on-board charger technology. This will reduce the cost of two and four-wheeler electric vehicles.Giving information about the new technology, Dr Rajeev Kumar Singh, associate professor and chief project investigator of the department of electrical engineering, said electric vehicles (EVs) are the best alternative to conventional IC engines but the lack of high-power, off-board charging infrastructure forces automakers to incorporate onboard chargers into the vehicle itself. The vehicle owner can charge the vehicles through the outlet. However, this facility makes EVs very expensive.He said that with the new technology developed at the institute, the cost of on-board charger can be reduced by about 50%. This will significantly reduce the cost of the vehicle. The technology will be completely indigenous and will have a significant impact on driving electric vehicles on Indian roads in a big way. Lab scale development has already been done at IIT (BHU) and upgrade and commercialisation is in progress.He further added that the country’s leading electric vehicle manufacturer has also shown interest in this new technology and is ready to develop a full-fledged commercial product that can be applied to existing electric vehicles. Experts from IIT Guwahati and IIT Bhubaneswar have also collaborated for this technology development.The on-board charger, its functioningA specific connector will be provided with the vehicle for its charging. Using the connector, the charger will be connected to an ordinary household three-pin power source. Prof Singh said that the electric vehicle may be charged easily at home.EVs to be accessible to general publicDr Singh said that this research is financially supported by the ministry of electronics and information technology, government of India. This innovative technology of the institute will also contribute to the e-mobility mission of the government. With the help of this new technology, the access of the general public to EVs will be possible. He explained that the EV contributes to sustainable development as it improves community health by eliminating tailpipe emissions, reducing reliance on fossil fuels, and with the integration of renewable energy into existing electricity networks, lower electricity rates can be reduced.Centre on EV tech to be set up at instituteDirector, IIT-BHU, Prof Pramod Kumar Jain, said that the developed technology will help in production of cheap electric vehicles which will be beneficial for the common man. The techno-commercial, social, economic and environmental impact of the technology will also be positive. He said that a few projects on developing autonomous vehicle, connected vehicles are already underway at IIT (BHU) Varanasi. One such project is Averera project that has already won the first prize globally in the Shell Eco Marathon last year.He further said that the IIT (BHU), Varanasi, is planning to set up an interdisciplinary Centre on EV technology to carry out design, fabrication, and testing of battery management systems, commercialise research, provide solutions to R&D problems and develop human resources in this area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/charging-electric-vehicles-pioneering-tech-from-iit-bhu-set-to-slash-ev-prices-101642878043950.html
23-01-2022||Mumbai||Maharashtra Covid surge continues as Mumbai cases drop||MUMBAI: Maharashtra reported 40,000-plus cases for the fourth consecutive day on Saturday clocking 46,393 fresh infections taking the state’s count to 7,466,420. Mumbai, on the other hand, recorded a drop in cases for the fourth consecutive day, with 3568 infections over the weekend, the first sub-5000 day since December 31 (5428 cases). The city’s overall case tally stood at 1,031,365 with 16522 deaths, giving a case fatality rate of 1.6. The city’s test positivity rate (TPR) on Saturday was 7.15%, with 49,895 tests conducted in the past 24 hours. On Friday, Maharashtra had recorded 48,270 cases, the highest single-day spike in the ongoing third wave, fuelled by the highly-transmissible Omicron variant. The highest one-day tally in the second wave was 68,631 cases on April 18. It also saw 48 casualties and the total number of fatalities stood at 142,071. With only 30,795 recoveries on Saturday, active cases in the state rose to 279,930, from Friday’s active cases tally of 264,388 cases. On Thursday, active cases in the state stood 258,569. In the last 48 hours, active cases in the state have risen 8.26%. In the same time, active cases in Mumbai have fallen almost 20% from 21,838 to 17,497. Genome sequencing results announced on Saturday put the daily Omicron cases at 416. Of these, 321 were reported from Mumbai, 62 from Nagpur, 13 from Pune, 12 from Wardha, six from Amravati, and one each Nashik and Bhandara. The state’s tally of Omicron cases reached 2759. So far, 1,225 patients have been discharged following negative RT-PCR tests, a state health department release said. State health officials said the state’s surge is likely to continue and will reach a peak by the first week of February. The daily spikes from January 19 – 43,697, 46,197, 48,270 and 46,393 – bear this out. While Mumbai cases are dropping, other major districts have been reporting high surges. On Saturday, Pune recorded 11,471 cases, the highest in the state, while Pimpri-Chinchwad recorded 4,825 cases. Nagpur reported 3,960 cases, Nashik 2,371 cases, Satara 1,466 cases, Aurangabad 1,334 cases, Ahmednagar 1,287 cases and Navi Mumbai 1,047 cases. “The Omicron wave continues in other districts, but this was expected,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state’s Covid-19 task force. “Our approach is to focus on four parameters — deaths, hospitalisation, oxygen and ventilators. We have to focus on symptomatic management of patients and identify people at risk, who are vulnerable to get severe disease and death. According to our projection, the peak is likely to hit the state by February first week. However, overall hospitalisation is significantly low.” In the last 24 hours, the state tested 223,370 samples with a positivity rate of 20.76%. However, the overall positivity rate of the state stood at 10.2%, the health department statement said. The state also vaccinated 358,618 doses on Saturday and has administered a total 146,036,688 doses till date, according to the data available on CoWin portal. (With inputs from Pratip Acharya)

23-01-2022||Chandigarh||Soak in the ‘India India Feeling’||What does India feel like? For England-based debut author, Vikas Dhawan, the answer lies in the rich memories of his childhood – the horse-driven tongas, impromptu parties during power cuts, gully cricket matches, and kites lazily soaring in the skies. In his book, India India Feeling, the author, who grew up in Punjab and Chandigarh, tries to encapsulate his love for India, taking the readers on a light-hearted exploration of the country he grew up in. Dedicated to his Panchkula-based parents and his son Ruhaan, Dhawan seemlessly links the olden days to the future. The memoir, which is infused with wit and humour, has an old-world charm to it. “I hope the readers are able to relive their own memories, and find comfort in them, especially in these troubling times.” A former civil servant in the United Kingdom, Vikas Dhawan, who has lived abroad for 20 years, says over the years he missed his family, friends,and the comfort of living in India. “I have written about how entire families used to travel on a scooter, a single household in a locality owning a telephone or a TV set, my schooldays, Doordarshan, advertisements popular in my youth.” One memory which stands out the most for Dhawan is receiving a postcard from author and columnist Khushwant Singh, in response to a collection of his articles, which he had sent Singh.

According to the data, the ratio of positivity among children was 7.0% on January 22 . On December 21 and November 21 last year, the positivity rates were 0.22% and 0.23%, respectively. In comparison, positivity rate on May 21 (during the peak of the second wave) was 24.61%. The state’s positivity rate among adults on January 22 was 15.13%. On December 21 and November 21, the figures were 0.51% and 0.39%, respectively. Karnataka health department said that since it was opined that the third wave could predominantly affect children, the department has been mandated to conduct at least 2% of the tests on children. “Out of total tests conducted between December 1 and January 20, 29% of the tests are conducted on children. We are also conducting random RAT tests in schools, colleges, restaurants once every 15 days,” read a statement. On Saturday, Karnataka recorded 60 million Covid-19 tests, said state health and family welfare minister Dr K Sudhakar, adding that now the state has about 268 testing facilities, including 99 government and 169 private labs. Karnataka has tested 60,114,815 samples so far, including 11,412,162 Rapid Antigen Test and 48,702,653 RT-PCR tests. While 14,196,065 samples were tested in 2020, as many as 42,391,357 samples were tested in 2021 and so far 3,527,393 tests have been conducted in 2022, he said. “Testing plays a vital role in this battle against the pandemic. Karnataka has always been aggressive in testing and tracking and it has been one of our cornerstones in this right against Covid. Karnataka has now achieved another milestone by crossing 6 crore tests,” Sudhakar said. “We have set up 3,678 (3,102 government and 666 private) swab collection centres -- one each for every 20,000 population. We have labs in government hospitals, medical colleges and also private hospitals. Initially, we had only 10-12 government labs with Covid testing facility, which has now increased to 57. With 108 NA Extractors and 139 RT-PCR machines, we have the capacity to test 120,800 samples per day in government facilities,” read a statement from the minister’s office. Meanwhile, minister for primary and secondary education BC Nagesh clarified that, unlike last year, there will not be any promotions and grace marks on the account of Covid-19 this year. The minister said the situation was different during the previous academic year, as students and schools were facing problems with technology. “Most of the schools in the state have completed 70% of the curriculum. In order to assist the students, 30% curriculum had been pruned down this year. Experts expect the coronavirus pandemic to substantially reduce by the last week of February or the first week of March. SSLC exams will be held from March last week to April 11. Depending on the situation prevailing then, a suitable decision will be taken,” said the minister.

Talking about the Hogenakkal phase 2 project proposed by the Tamil Nadu government, Bommai said that the government will fight the project politically and legally. “Whether it be Hogenakkal or the interlinking of rivers, as a government we had faced such questions in the past. We have opposed the interlinking of rivers in the Supreme Court. We will fight it politically and legally,” Bommai told reporters. Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin had said on Thursday that a detailed project report would be prepared for the second phase of the Hogenakkal integrated drinking water project at an estimated cost of ₹4,600 crore. The project is aimed at supplying water to Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri districts in Tamil Nadu. Alleging that the details of the project have not been furnished before the tribunal and the Supreme Court, Karnataka water resources minister Govind Karjol said Tamil Nadu cannot take up the project unilaterally. “I will convene an all-party meeting in the first week of February in which which law and parliamentary affairs minister JC Madhuswamy, water resources minister Govind Karjol and the floor leaders of various parties in the legislative assembly and legislative council will participate,” Bommai told reporters after a virtual meeting with legal experts fighting the water dispute-related cases in various courts. The chief minister in the meeting was briefed about the legal battle fought so far, the status of the court cases, the legal position to be taken in the interest of the state and to materialise various water projects. Speaking to media persons, Bommai said senior counsels in Delhi representing Karnrataka in interstate water disputes, the AG (advocate general) and irrigation technical experts took part in the conference. “The Bachawat and Brijesh Mishra Tribunals have delivered their award on Krishna river waters; the notification is awaited. Though the Mahadayi Tribunal has delivered its award, the issue has been taken to the Supreme Court. All the three riparian states have filed their claims on water allocation before the court,” he said. “In the past too, we have risen above political differences when it came to issues pertaining to the state’s land and water. Since the cases are at the crucial stages, I have convened the meeting in the first week of February where we will discuss with the leaders of the opposition parties and legal experts how to proceed further with these disputes and what should be our stand,” Bommai said. The chief minister said he along with Govind Karjol had a detailed discussion with the legal experts, who represented the state in various courts, through video conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/karnataka-cm-to-call-all-party-meeting-over-water-disputes-101642877203827.html

The cop in question, Baiju Paulose, was investigating the role of Dileep and his aides in a female actor’s abduction and sexual assault, which took place in 2017. The court also directed all the accused to appear before the crime branch for investigation. In the interim order, the single bench of justice P Gopinath allowed the crime branch to question the accused persons till January 25 (Tuesday) and warned them that their bail will be cancelled if they tried to influence the witnesses in the case. Though the prosecution insisted for custodial interrogation, the court said the final decision will be taken on January 27. The actor, who is seventh accused in the case, and others had moved the court after a fresh case was registered against them following the disclosure of film director Balachandra Kumar. Last month, Kumar had claimed that Dileep was in possession of the woman actor’s assault video and had tried to influence case witnesses. He also claimed to have met the main accused, Pulsar Suni, at Dileep’s residence in 2016. After Kumar’s revelations the Kerala government had approached the Supreme Court to extend the trial for six more months. During the Saturday proceedings, the court observed that the charges against accused were difficult to stand the test of law if they were merely based on the director’s statement . The court also directed the prosecution to file a detailed report on questioning, before Thursday. The defence lawyer argued that the conspiracy charge was foisted on the accused, without any proof, as the investigation team’s arguments in the main case were so weak. The prosecution insisted that the accused may try to influence the witnesses. At this point, the court observed that “conspiracy and inducements were two different things and a mere statement that someone would be killed cannot be taken as an inducement. “Two weeks back, the crime branch had registered a fresh case against Dileep, his brother Anoop, a relative Suraj, and two others Appu and Babu for allegedly conspiring to eliminate Paulose. The conversation allegedly took place in November 2017 at the actor’s house in Aluva in Ernakulam district, crime branch said in its first information report(FIR). They were charged under Sections 116 (abetment of offence), 118 (concealing design to commit an offence), 120 B (criminal conspiracy) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). A leading woman actor was waylaid, kidnapped and sexually assaulted by a criminal gang in Kochi while she was returning home after a shooting assignment . Six months after the incident, Dileep was arrested in the case. Prosecution alleged that the attack was planned at the behest of Dileep to settle an old score with the woman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kerala-hc-directs-dileep-4-aides-to-appear-for-probe-restrains-arrest-till-jan-27-101642876903746.html

Kolhe plays the role of Godse in “Who Killed Gandhi” film with its OTT release scheduled on January 30. The Congress has issued a press statement seeking a ban of the film and criticised Kolhe for accepting the role. Congress leader Arvind Shinde said, “Though Kolhe has clarified that he played the role in 2017 before joining the NCP, it is unacceptable. He is a good artist and touched everyone’s heart by portraying the character of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Sambhaji Maharaj. Now, the image is shattered by taking the role of Mahatma Gandhi’s assassin.” Shinde said, “As per Gandhiji’s principle, instead of making a difference between being professional and politician, he should publicly accept the blunder and make efforts to ban the movie.” Meanwhile, Congress leaders on condition of anonymity said that it is a good opportunity for the party to distance itself from the NCP and prepare for the upcoming municipal elections on its own.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/congress-opposes-ncp-mp-amol-kolhe-s-role-as-nathuram-godse-in-film-101642876423986.html

As SEC is an autonomous body, we will not interfere in its decision.” Following rise in Covid cases across Maharashtra, opposition parties have alleged that the state government may delay civic polls as maximum seats are with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). They allege that delay in conducting polls will allow the state government to appoint administrator for municipal corporations. Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) resubmitted the ward structure delimitation plan to SEC this week after the latter raised doubts to the earlier plan forwarded by PMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sec-may-conduct-civic-elections-as-per-schedule-says-pawar-101642876254533.html
23-01-2022||Noida||As ECI extends restrictions on campaign, aspirants in Noida focus on social media||The election campaign in Noida has shifted to Zoom calls and door-to-door meetings as the Election Commission of India extended on Saturday extended its ban on political rallies and roadshows in the five election-bound states, including Uttar Pradesh, till January 31 as the country continues to grapple with another wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. India recorded over 337,000 fresh cases of Covid on Friday. The Commission has, however, decided to relax some of the guidelines for candidates who will be contesting in the first phase on February 10 and second phase to be held on February 14. Now, candidates in Uttar Pradesh, which will vote in the first phase, will be allowed physical meetings in designated open spaces with a maximum of 500 persons or 50% of the capacity of the ground, but only from January 28 to February 8. UP will vote in seven phases from February 10 to March 7. Gautam Budh Nagar goes to polls in the first phase on February 10. Party supporters HT spoke to said unlike the rest of the state where social media campaigning may not practical in the large rural belts of the state, in urban Noida it could be used to far reaching effect. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate and sitting MLA Pankaj Singh, who was infected with Covid and isolating at home, is reaching out to the electorate mostly through Zoom calls, he said. Saturday was the last day of his home isolation. “We have to follow the norms and ensure that we don’t put others at risk. So, Zoom calls have been very helpful, and we have had a good turnout of people on the calls. It is easier to interact in person, but we take all questions and I even take questions from people during the online interactions,” Singh said. Congress’ Pankhuri Pathak, however, has preferred door-to-door campaigns. “We are sending out posters and messages to our voters on social media. However, I am also going door-to-door and meeting people individually. It is important to have a personal connect with our voters, which the current leaders have failed to establish,” Pathak said. She added that the party is also running a vigorous campaign on its Facebook, Twitter and Instagram handles. Samajwadi Party’s (SP) Sunil Choudhary has also been banking on both online and offline campaigns. According to him, meeting voters personally is important since it reassures the voters that their leader is approachable. “We are not holding rallies but I do meet small groups of people offline, apart from running a social media campaign. The ruling leaders did not understand people’s issues and did not meet them over the past five years. People cannot trust leaders who are not approachable. This is why we are establishing connection with voters both online and offline,” said Chaudhary. Online campaigning has encouraged independent candidates too, as they feel they have an equal opportunity to campaign and put forward their views. According to Yeshu Singh, a student in Gautam Budh Nagar, who has filed his nomination as an independent, it is better that most of the campaigning has shifted online. “We don’t have resources like political parties but and social media campaigning is proving to be a leveller. It gives people like us an equal chance to relate with the voters without having to hold big rallies or road shows,” said Singh. He said that he is contesting as a “youth candidate” from Noida with a focus on sustainable development and environmental issues. Political experts also feel that social media campaigning will help improve political participation, especially from the youth. “The fact that nominations, and especially rallies, are being conducted online also attracts more people since this provides those individuals who do not have a very strong financial background an opportunity to fight an election, and allows them to pose a challenge to the centuries-old money-power nexus,” said Dr Shalini Saxena, associate professor (political science), Amity Institute of Social Sciences, Amity University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/as-eci-extends-restrictions-on-campaign-aspirants-in-noida-focus-on-social-media-101642876253215.html

The deceased was identified as Bharat Singh Bhati, a resident of New Friends Colony in Ballabgarh. It seems that the woman, identified as Geeta, mixed some sedatives in Bhati’s dinner before the murder, police said, adding that the other suspect is yet to be identified.Police said Geeta’s husband works at a private company and had left for work around 8pm on that night. Narender Kadiyan, deputy commissioner of police (crime), said that the suspect had at several occasions threatened Bhati to transfer property to her and her children. “But Bhati was not willing to divide the property, following which she hatched a plan along with her friend,” he said. Jashoda Bhati, wife of the deceased who filed a complaint, said she was fast asleep when her husband was murdered. “It was around 6.30am when my neighbours started knocking at the main gate that I woke up. It has never happened that I slept past 5am. As I got up, I saw blood dripping from my husband’s neck and raised an alarm,” she said. Jashoda said that she had lost her younger son last year and on Thursday it was his death anniversary and relatives had come to attend prayers. “We had dinner cooked by Geeta, my elder daughter-in-law, around 9.30pm and within minutes we slept. I don’t know what she mixed in our food that I gained consciousness only after the morning commotion,” she said. The DCP said the prime suspect’s 15-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son saw her taking out a countrymade pistol from her almirah before the murder. “The daughter told her grandmother that her mother had hatched the plan with an uncle who often used to visit them when her father was away at work. She said that the uncle came at night and her mother packed a bag and fled with him after the murder. The minor also said that her mother had threatened to kill them if they revealed it to anyone,” he said. A family member and two neighbours allegedly saw an associate of Geeta entering the house on the night of the incident, said police, adding that there were five members present in the house at the time of murder. Police said the suspect had withdrawn ₹50,000 from her bank account to buy the weapon and for the last two months was planning to kill Bhati. “Both the children had heard several conversations between their mother and the co-suspect where they discussed plans to murder Bhati and to flee to other state to start a fresh life. We have taken the call detail records of the suspect,” said Kadiyan. Police said the suspect might have mixed sleeping pills in the victim’s food before the murder. “We have also sent viscera samples to the forensic science laboratory,” said Kadiyan. A case was registered against Geeta under sections 302 (murder), 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 34 (common intention), and 328 (causing hurt by means of poison etc with intent to commit an offence) of Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of The Arms Act at Ballabgarh City police station on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/woman-kills-father-in-law-in-faridabad-flees-with-her-friend-101642876251851.html

23-01-2022||Delhi||Unease of doing business: Traders say curbs throwing future in doubt||Businesses in the Capital are bleeding money as they rack up fixed costs in the face of curbs and curfews, while people are thronging malls and markets in neighbouring NCR cities over the weekend, traders’ representatives said on Saturday, issuing fresh appeals to the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) to roll back curbs keeping in mind their livelihood, the drop in cases, high vaccination rates, and low hospitalisation numbers, in the third wave of Covid infections.A Delhi government-led exercise to gather the vaccination details of workers employed in at least a dozen of the city’s large markets, such as those at Sarojini Nagar and Lajpat Nagar, separately found that 100% of the staff have taken both their shots of coronavirus vaccines.“When there was a need for such restrictions, all traders and market associations welcomed the weekend lockdowns and odd-even restrictions for shops. Even this time, when the third wave began, we did not say no and implemented all DDMA orders. But I must say that we are stretching the restrictions too far now because the positivity rate is declining, and most people are vaccinated,” said Ashwani Marwah, general secretary, Traders Association Lajpat Nagar (TALN).“Even European countries, which were badly hit by the third wave, lifted restrictions in a timely manner,” he added.There is a weekend curfew in the city since January 4 and restaurants and bars have been closed for dine-in service since January 11. None of these restrictions are in place in neighbouring Noida and Gurugram.On Friday, DDMA allowed private offices to reopen with 50% on-site staff from next week but maintained the weekend and night curfews, notwithstanding a request from the city’s elected government that sought these curbs to be rolled back.On Saturday, however, senior government officials involved in Covid-19 management indicated that DDMA was likely to begin relaxations next week. “This was anyway going to be the last week where status quo was to be maintained on the restrictions, unless cases start spiralling again. Next week, there is going to be a DDMA meeting to review the city’s Covid-19 situation and relaxing some of the curbs will be the main talking point vis-a-vis the downward trend in daily cases, positivity rate and hospitalisations,” said a senior official on condition of anonymity.The city recorded 11,486 new cases on Saturday, up 7% from Friday, driven by a significant 18% jump in testing. The test positivity rate fell from 18.04% to 16.36%. At its peak on January 13, the city recorded over 30% test positivity. But even then, hospitalisation numbers remained low, indicating no significant burden on health infrastructure by the milder Omicron variant which has driven the current wave.Praveen Khandelwal, secretary general, Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), said the association has sent a letter to lieutenant governor Anil Baijal demanding relaxation in the Covid-19 restrictions in Delhi. Baijal is the chairperson of the DDMA and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is its vice-chairperson.“CAIT has stated that the odd-even system has caused more trouble to the consumers. It leads to more crowding because 50% of the shops remain shut, while the number of customers remain the same. The odd-even rule and the weekly lockdown should be removed, and emphasis should be put on strict implementation of Covid protocols. CAIT has suggested that the working hours of markets should be changed from 10am to 5pm, while hotels and restaurants should be allowed to open with 50% capacity as given to private offices. Considering the requirements and obligations of weddings happening in Delhi, at least 100 persons should be allowed to attend instead of 20,” he said.This week, CAIT conducted an online survey in which it claimed that 96% of the traders said markets should be open on weekdays, while 97% insisted on strict adherence to Covid-19 safety rules. The survey also showed that businesses of 86% of the traders dropped to almost 40% of their regular earnings in the last 20 days due to Covid-19.Data from the state health department showed that, as on Saturday, at least 12 of the biggest or most popular markets and malls in Delhi are “fully vaccinated” -- an initiative which other states and UTs are now replicating. These fully vaccinated markets include those at Lajpat Nagar, Janpath, Sarojini Nagar, Madhu Vihar and Laxmi Nagar, and the malls DLF Avenue, Select CityWalk, V3S. These have been given official “fully vaccinated” certification by the Delhi government.A V3S mall executive said some people are going to Noida or Gurugram to purchase items or to eat out because the existing curbs give them a “lockdown-like” impression in the Capital. “Adjoining states such as Haryana and Uttar Pradesh do not have weekend curfew. They also do not have the odd-even rule. We are losing business to adjoining states because of all this,” said this person, asking not to be named.“There are so many shops on rent that pay over ₹1 lakh per month. How will traders pay rent and continue the work? The government should relax the norms,” said Anil Taneja, president of Nehru Place Market Welfare Association, said, their business has been badly hit.Paramjit Singh, vice president, Sadar Bazar Traders Association, said traders are not able to recover losses they faced in last two years. “The curbs must be relaxed because we are getting no concession in house tax, electricity/water bills, trade license fees for our shops. The government can also calculate on pro rata basis because ideally each shop is operating only for about 10 days a month under the existing rules,” he said.A demand for rolling back curbs also came from the BJP, the ruling party at the Centre, which appoints the LG. “Apart from traders, thousands of people who work in trading establishments are facing salary cuts while daily wage labourers are totally losing their income. I request you (Anil Baijal) to immediately convene a meeting of DDMA to review the restrictions and orderly withdrawal of the odd-even system for markets along with the lifting of the weekend curfew,” Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said in his letter to Baijal.

From paved walkways along the Rajpath, where the parade will be held, to pathways in the lawns and redeveloped canals, the work has been completed in less than a year, they added. For the Republic Day parade, the Central Public Works Department has made special arrangements, such as construction of temporary bridges over the canals, in addition to the 16 permanent bridges constructed as part of the redevelopment project. New benches have been installed for the public. Union housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri took to Twitter to thank the workers for their effort “Central Vista Avenue is ready as a result of the dedication & toil of more than 4000 workers from different parts of the country. A big shoutout & thank you to all of them,” Puri tweeted.Spread over 85.3 hectares, the area has been redeveloped to provide better civic amenities and make it accessible to the public. Parts of the area, especially beyond the canals, were inaccessible and underutilised, official said, requesting anonymity.The green cover in the area has increased, said a ministry official, as there are 4,087 trees in the redeveloped avenue as against 3,890 trees earlier.As part of the redevelopment project, the lawns have been redeveloped and 16,500 metres of paths have been developed to provide smooth pedestrian movement. The paths have been developed along the canals, which have been redeveloped on both sides. A green buffer has been provided along the canals. New benches have been installed at different locations. To maintain the lawns, officials said, micro-irrigation and storm water services have been introduced.While the construction in the area where the parade will be held is over, CPWD officials said that work on the pedestrian underpasses and amenity blocks will be completed later. A ministry official said that work on the construction of step gardens near the India Gate will be completed after January 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-central-vista-avenue-gets-a-new-look-in-time-for-republic-day-101642873783724.html

23-01-2022||Delhi||Less than 1/5th in hospitals needed oxygen during 5th Covid wave in Delhi: Study||The need to give medical oxygen support to people admitted with Covid-19 during the current wave of the outbreak is less than a third of what was recorded in the last two waves, and almost all of the people who were in intensive care were first brought in with other critical illnesses, according to a new analysis by a private hospital network.The analysis, carried out by Max Healthcare, is consistent with death audits carried out by the government earlier in the month: most of the people with Covid-19 in critical condition or those who died were suffering from more serious illnesses at the time of their admission. The government audit also said that a majority of the dead were unvaccinated.“At least 80% of the patients that died were people either above the age of 70 or they had multiple comorbidities, cases such as cancer, kidney along with lifestyle disease like hypertension and diabetes,” said Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, group medical director of Max Healthcare.The findings are based on 1,378 hospital patients in Max Hospitals’ network since the last week of Decembertill January 20– roughly a period of four weeks. In itself, this number alone was a third of the 12,444 hospitalisations recorded in the three months of the peak of the second wave, beginning in late March, 2021 and ending in early June.While the share of people in intensive care units (ICU) was higher overall – 45.9% -- compared to previous waves (34% during the second wave), Budhiraja explained this was due to two factors: “First, the 45% is of a far smaller number, some 1,300 odd, and second, many of the patients that were admitted to Covid ICU were already admitted with prior health conditions.”Budhiraja added that of the 82, people whose cause of death was primarily Covid-related complication were roughly five or six in number.In terms of the proportion of admitted patients requiring oxygen support, the share has been around 23% this time compared to close to 74% during the Delta variant-triggered wave.Budhiraja added that at the peak of the second wave, when the city was recorded new cases in the range of 27,000-28,000 infections a day, the peak occupancy rate in all of Max facilities combined was nearly 2,000. “This time, however, the peak was only around 435,” he added. “This could be because Omicron as a variant is milder but also because the vaccination status of people has improved now. During the second wave, the vaccination drive had just started and many people in Delhi were yet to be vaccinated,” he said. A Delhi health department representative said these trends further reinforce what has been seen in other hospitals. “We have stressed that the Covid deaths that we are reporting during this wave largely comprise either unvaccinated people or vulnerable people including senior citizens or those with severe comorbidities. Most of the patients are recovering at home with relatively milder symptoms,” said a senior health official. These trends are relevant to the debate around Delhi’s current level of curbs. The city’s elected government and the business community have asked the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), an agency led by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, which decides on public health measures in the Capital, to roll back the weekend curfew and allow all shops to open instead of only alternate establishments on any given weekday.The demands stems from three clear signs: the number of new cases are now far lower than the peak recorded more than a week ago, more than 82% of the city’s overall hospital bed capacity has remained vacant in all this while, and the Omicron variant of the Sars-CoV-2, which is causing the current outbreak, itself is less likely to lead to severe disease – especially since a large part of the population is already vaccinated.Budhiraja added that those at greater risk could be clearly identified: these were people with any serious comorbid illness like kidney disease or cancer, and people above the age of 70. An expert said this has implications on who should be shielded more and the targeting of booster doses. “This variant is highly transmissible and tends to infect a person within hours of contact with an infected person. While the infection period is shorter this time, the vulnerable sections are still are risk and the governments should strictly promote the use of masks and Covid appropriate behaviour in public places to protect this vulnerable section,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital.The Union government has allowed people above the age of with comorbid health conditions to take a third dose of a coronavirus vaccine, the so-called precaution dose. Studies have shown that third doses greatly reduce the risk of hospitalisation in all populations, and lead to even lower odds of death.
23-01-2022||Delhi||Man murders wife, attempts suicide in Delhi’s Saket after quarrel||A 57-year-old man allegedly killed his wife in their Saket home on Friday evening, and then tried to take his own life by slashing his neck with a kitchen knife, after an argument between the two, police officers familiar with the investigation said.The two were alone at home when the incident took place around 6pm, police said, and the exact motive and circumstances of the crime were still be ascertained. However, police were told by the couple’s family members that they often fought over whether or not they should sell the house they lived in.The man may have been suffering from depression since he lost his job due to the Covid-19 pandemic two years ago, said an officer with direct knowledge of the case. “The injured husband is getting treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a private hospital. His statement could not be obtained so far as he was not fit for the statement. The exact motive behind the crime can be ascertained only when his statement is recorded. Prime facie, the inspection of the crime scene does not suggest the role of any outsider for robbery or any other motive,” said the officer, asking not to be named.Police said the dead woman was identified as Shashi Lata Pandey, 57, a homemaker. Her husband, Chander Mohan Pandey, who worked in the front office of a hotel in Connaught Place, was unemployed for the past two years. The name of the hotel has been withheld pending further investigation, police said.A second officer said the couple lived with their son, Shivam, on the first floor of a four-storey building in Saket’s G block. The son, 23, works with a private company in Gurugram, and was in office at the time of the incident. Their daughter moved out of the house after her wedding in November last year, the officer added.“During the inquiry, Shivam told us that there were some issues between his parents over the house. His father wanted to sell it, but his mother wanted to stay there. Shivam also told us that his father was undergoing some depression since he lost his job,” said deputy commissioner of police (south) Benita Mary Jaiker, adding that police were informed about the crime through a call made at 7.09pm on Friday to the police control room.The first person to reach the spot was the injured man’s nephew, Kapil Pandey, who lives on the ground floor of the building, Jaiker said. Kapil was informed about a quarrel between the couple by his aunt (Chander Mohan Pandey’s sister), who lives in Indirapuram. She had called her brother when she heard that he and his wife were in the middle of an intense quarrel. She immediately contacted Kapil, and asked him to rush to the flat to check on them, police said.“Kapil told us that when he went up, his uncle (Pandey) opened the door. His clothes were soaked in blood, and there was a deep cut wound on the left side of his neck. His uncle asked him to call the police, and said, “Sab khatam ho gaya (everything is over).” Kapil called the ambulance services of a nearby private hospital. The ambulance doctor declared the woman dead,” said Jaiker. A team from Saket police station found the woman’s body lying on the floor in the bedroom. There was blood scattered inside the flat, and a bloodstained kitchen knife was found on the LCD panel in the drawing room. “There were no visible injury marks on the woman’s body. Prime facie, it appears that she was either strangled or smothered with a pillow. The exact cause of her death will be ascertained with the autopsy report that is awaited,” said the second officer.No police complaint on any domestic dispute was filed by the woman against her husband, Jaiker said.The couple’s neighbours said they did not hear any quarrel at the flat on Friday evening. An elderly woman who lives in an adjacent apartment said: “I learnt about the incident from our family members. We don’t know what exactly happened.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-murders-wife-attempts-suicide-in-delhi-s-saket-after-quarrel-101642872824002.html
23-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi rain hits January high, pushes maximum temperature to season’s low||Delhi equalled its record for the third-wettest January on record ever, after a rainy Saturday, when showers continued late into the evening, and a biting cold gripped the city, as the maximum temperature dipped to the season’s lowest. Delhi has so far received 69.8mm of rain this month, the same as it did in all of January 1995, and behind only 1989 (when the city got 79.3mm of rain in the month) and 1953 (73.7mm).Delhi received 5.5mm total rain till 8.30pm on Saturday, IMD said.The city also witnessed a severe cold day on Saturday as the maximum temperature at Safdarjung, Delhi’s base observatory, dropped to 14.7 degrees Celsius -- the lowest this season -- seven degrees below normal. The IMD classifies it as a severe cold day when the maximum temperature is 6.5 degrees or lower than normal. The city recorded a minimum temperature of 11.5 degrees Celsius, four degrees above normal.Weather officials attributed the rain to a western disturbance and an induced cyclonic circulation. IMD has forecast widespread light or moderate rainfall accompanied with isolated thunderstorms over Delhi and its neighbouring states till Sunday. “Thunderstorm with light to moderate intensity rain and gusty winds with speed of 30-50 Km/h would occur over and adjoining areas of few places of Delhi-NCR,” the weather office said in a statement on Saturday evening.Meanwhile, light showers and stronger winds helped improve the air quality in the city. Delhi recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 316 in the ‘very poor’ range on Saturday, compared to 365 on Friday, according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) 4pm bulletin. The Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), on Saturday said the air quality will improve Sunday on account of widespread rains leading to dispersal of particulate matter. It said the AQI may enter the poor zone (AQI between 201-300).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-rain-hits-january-high-pushes-maximum-temperature-to-season-s-low-101642872343733.html
23-01-2022||World||End of Covid-19 pandemic in Europe ‘plausible’ after Omicron: WHO||In what appears as a silver lining in these days of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the World Health Organisation (WHO) has for the first time in a while indicated that the pandemic could come to an ‘end’ in Europe after the current Omicron-driven wave passes over after infecting around 60 per cent of the population of the continent.Hans Kluge, the WHO Europe director, told the AFP news agency that the Covid-19 pandemic has entered a new phase with the Omicron variant, which could infect 60 percent of people in Europe by March, and that could eventually bring the pandemic to an end.“It is plausible that the region is moving towards a kind of pandemic endgame,” Hans Kluge told AFP, although urging necessary caution due to the virus's ability to mutate.The Omicron variant, which studies have shown generally leads to less severe infection among vaccinated people than Delta, has raised long-awaited hopes that Covid-19 is starting to shift from a pandemic to a more manageable endemic illness like seasonal flu.The WHO official's comments instill some hope for Europe, currently reeling under the highly transmissible Omicron-led wave, but also has a message for the rest of the world.Kluge said that once the current surge of cases in Europe subsides, “there will be for quite some weeks and months a global immunity, either thanks to the vaccine or because people have immunity due to the infection, and also lowering seasonality.”Covid-19 may still make a return near the end of the year; however, that does not necessarily equate to the “pandemic” returning, he said."So we anticipate that there will be a period of quiet before Covid-19 may come back towards the end of the year, but not necessarily the pandemic coming back," Kluge was quoted as saying.It is likely that the coronavirus disease will be returning as an endemic, but that is a more favourable situation compared to the current scenario, said the WHO Europe director.“There is a lot of talk about endemic but endemic means ... that it is possible to predict what's going to happen,” Kluge said. “This virus has surprised (us) more than once so we have to be very careful.”In the WHO Europe region, which comprises 53 countries including several in Central Asia, Omicron represented 15 per cent of new cases as of January 18, compared to 6.3 percent a week earlier, the global health body said. (With inputs from AFP)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/end-of-covid-19-pandemic-in-europe-plausible-after-omicron-who-101642957481285.html
23-01-2022||World||Who is Yevhen Murayev, named by Britain as Kremlin's pick to lead Ukraine?||Britain has accused the Kremlin of wanting to install a pro-Russian leader in Ukraine, and said Russian intelligence officers had been in contact with former Ukrainian politicians as part of plans for a military offensive.Britain's foreign ministry said Russia was considering the Ukrainian politician Yevhen Murayev to lead a new government, in comments that Russia has denied. Murayev also poured cold water on the claim in comments to the Observer newspaper.Who is Yevhen Murayev?Born in the eastern city of Kharkiv near the Russian border in 1976, Murayev is part of a group of politicians in opposition to the pro-Western leadership that took power after the 2014 Maidan street protests.He began his political career in Kharkiv as an ally of the former President Viktor Yanukovich, who fled to Russia after the Maidan uprising.In 2014-2019, Murayev was a lawmaker. He started in the Opposition Bloc faction, a party formed from fragments of the Moscow-backed Yanukovich's Party of Regions. But in June 2016 he distanced himself from Opposition Bloc and founded his own party For Life, with a similar ideology.In 2018, he launched another party called Nashi. Murayev registered as a presidential candidate in the 2019 elections but withdrew his candidacy before the vote.What are Murayev's political views?Murayev has promoted views that closely align with Russian narratives on Ukraine. He considered the Maidan protests a Western-backed coup d'etat.Last year, he referred to the war in Ukraine's eastern Donbass region as an internal conflict between the government and rebels, counter to Ukraine and the West's view that the conflict is between Ukraine and Russian-backed proxies.In 2021, he said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was controlled by the West and suggested, as Russia has, that Ukraine might try to regain territory held by Russian-backed separatists by force. Kyiv denies any such plan."Zelenskiy is a hostage and he is being blackmailed by MI6, the CIA, anyone. Tomorrow they can force him to launch an offensive against the Donbass, which will lead to a full-scale war," he said.Drawing Russia into an escalation "will mean the death of thousands of Ukrainians on one side and the other of the line of demarcation."How much influence does Murayev have?Murayev is less prominent than Viktor Medvedchuk, a pro-Moscow businessman and lawmaker who says Russian President Vladimir Putin is godfather to his daughter and who was thrown under house arrest last year in a treason case.Murayev nevertheless holds sway through his TV channel, called Nash, which began broadcasting in November 2018 and is officially owned by his father, Volodymyr.According to a poll by the Razumkov Centre think tank in December 2021, Murayev ranked seventh with 6.3% support among prospective candidates in the next presidential election in 2024. Another poll by the Rating group put him in fifth place.In 2017 he filed an asset declaration, a mandatory requirement as a lawmaker. He declared cash assets of $2 million, 1 million euros ($1.13 million), and 13 million hryvnias ($460,971).What do Murayev and the others say about Britain's allegations?Murayev rubbished Britain's claim, telling the Observer newspaper that the accusation "isn't very logical". He promised more comments in a Facebook post, accompanied by a photoshopped image of him mocked up as James Bond.In a later post, he called for an end to dividing Ukraine into pro-Western and pro-Russian politicians and said the country needed new leaders.Russia dismissed Britain's accusation as "disinformation". Ukraine's government had no immediate comment.Volodymyr Fesenko, a Ukrainian political analyst, found Murayev an odd candidate."Murayev, for all his pro-Russianness, is not a figure who is very close to the Kremlin, especially compared to Medvedchuk," Fesenko wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-is-yevhen-murayev-named-by-britain-as-kremlin-s-pick-to-lead-ukraine-101642946431718.html

But it is not a Pakistan-specific issue, Imran Khan said. "There are two phases of inflation. When we came into government, we had to deal with a massive current account deficit due to this, the prices of imports soared drastically. That was at that time and now the inflation is global because of Corona," Imran Khan said during his live air programme 'Aap ka Wazir-e-Azam, Aap key Saath'. Imran Khan said the United Kingdom has been facing 30-year record inflation because of the pandemic.Watch video “The biggest challenge we face today is inflation & rising prices of commodities.

"I get called out for not meeting Shehbaz as he is the leader of the opposition. But I see him as the nation's criminal," he said.Talking about Nawaz Sharif, Imran Khan said he is waiting for him to come to Pakistan. "They say he will come from London today, tomorrow. I pray he comes back. He will not come because he loves money and does not want to lose it by coming back to Pakistan. These are the people whose time is over," Imran Khan said."Some people are playing polo there, riding Rolls Royce. Even royal families don't spend so much money. Why will they come to Pakistan?" Imran Khan said. "They are in London since 2017 and we came to power in 2018," the PM said.Imran Khan's comments come a day after federal minister for planning, development and special initiatives Asad Umar said Imran Khan sent Nawaz Sharif to London. "PM Imran Khan conducted a meeting which held discussions on whether or not to allow Nawaz Sharif to travel abroad," the minister said adding that Imran Khan took the decision to let him go, Geo News reported.Maryam Nawaz Sharif reacted to Imran Khan's on-air speech and tweeted, "Imran Khan sounds like a person who is not only defeated but has also accepted his defeat. Four years into the govt and he is still only whining.""Every word that Imran Khan has uttered today reeks of failure, dashed hopes and no faith in his or PTI's future.

23-01-2022||World||UK MP says she was sacked from govt over 'Muslimness'||British minister Nadhim Zahawi on Sunday urged a probe into claims by a fellow Conservative MP that she lost her ministerial role because of her 'Muslimness', piling further pressure on the government.Nusrat Ghani, 49, was sacked as a transport minister in 2020, and told the Sunday Times that a whip said her "Muslimness was raised as an issue" at a meeting in Downing Street.She was also told her "Muslim woman minister status was making colleagues feel uncomfortable", she claimed.Chief whip Mark Spencer, whose role it is to keep MPs on board with the government's agenda, took the unusual step of identifying himself as the person at the centre of the claims, and denied the allegations."These accusations are completely false and I consider them to be defamatory," he wrote on Twitter."I have never used those words attributed to me. It is disappointing that when this issue was raised before Ms Ghani declined to refer the matter to the Conservative Party for a formal investigation," he added.The government whips are in the spotlight at the moment after they were accused by Tory MP William Wragg of "blackmailing" critics of under-fire Prime Minister Boris Johnson in order to prevent them from trying to oust him.Ghani, vice-chairwoman of the influential 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, told the paper that "it was like being punched in the stomach. I felt humiliated and powerless."She said she remained quiet for fear of being "ostracised by colleagues".Vaccine minister Zahawi demanded an investigation."There is no place for Islamophobia or any form of racism in our @Conservatives party," he tweeted, calling Ghani a "friend, a colleague & a brilliant parliamentarian.""This has to be investigated properly & racism rooted out."Justice minister Dominic Raab called it a "very serious claim" but told BBC's "Sunday Morning" that there would only likely be an investigation if Ghani made a formal complaint, which she has so far not done.Former equality and human rights commissioner Swaran Singh carried out an inquiry into claims of Islamophobia in the Conservative Party two years ago.He analysed 727 separate incidents as recorded between 2015 and 2020 and found no evidence of "institutional Islamophobia", but criticised senior Tory figures including now prime minister Johnson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-mp-says-she-was-sacked-from-govt-over-muslimness-101642933704146.html

23-01-2022||World||Canada: Three-decade high inflation hits Justin Trudeau’s popularity||Just four months after his Liberal Party returned to power in Canada after mid-term elections in September, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s popularity is taking a battering due to high levels of inflation.The government’s data agency, Statistics Canada has reported that the consumer price index for December was at 4.8%, the highest point it has reached in three decades.That has led to what is being described an “inflation anxiety”. Justin Trudeau’s opponents have used the hashtag #JustinFlation to good effect on social media.As a result, for the first time since he formed another minority government in September, after precipitating snap polls, Trudeau’s Liberals are trailing the principal opposition Conservatives in tracking polls. As per numbers released by Nanos Research, the ruling party has 28.2% support marginally behind the Conservatives who have 28.5%.A majority of Canadians, 57%, “say that it is currently difficult to feed their household”, according to a new poll from the non-profit, non-partisan polling agency Angus Reid Institute (ARI). In contrast, the number stood at 36% in 2019. More of the respondents, 29%, believed their financial standing will worsen in the next 12 months, six points higher than those who believed it will improve.As the dominant political issue, even amidst a fifth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic driven by the Omicron variant, there is concern that inflation, particularly for groceries, could escalate further as Canada has announced it will only allow in fully-vaccinated truckers from the United States, and experts expect a resultant supply crunch.Opposition finance critic and Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre tweeted, “Trudeau’s vaccine vendetta is emptying grocery shelves and ballooning food prices.”Justin Trudeau is likely to try and address the matter in the days ahead. Bringing down costs will be on the agenda as he heads a virtual Cabinet retreat this week, as “making life more affordable” was listed on the priorities, in a release from the Prime Minister’s Office.In addition, the Bank of Canada is expected to announce an increase in interest rates next week, as well, which could curb the inflationary trend.Such measures will be necessary politically for Trudeau, as 39% of those sampled in the ARI survey stated they were worse off now than they were last year. “This represents the largest group saying this in 13 years of tracking by ARI,” the agency noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-three-decade-high-inflation-hits-justin-trudeau-s-popularity-101642920357557.html

There's no doubt this is disappointing and will upset many holiday plans, but it's important to set these changes out clearly today so they can have time to consider those plans."Hipkins also said New Zealand's Cabinet has agreed to other precautionary measures, including reducing the interval between a second Covid-19 vaccine dose and a booster shot from six months to four months, and increasing the required length of stay for returning travelers from seven to 10 days in managed isolation and quarantine, as per CNN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/such-is-life-new-zealand-pm-jacinda-ardern-cancels-wedding-amid-omicron-surge-101642912896872.html

An investigation into the matter is ongoing, it added. “With the Philippine elections taking place this May, we remain vigilant about identifying and eliminating suspected information campaigns targeting election conversations,” a Twitter spokesperson said in an emailed statement.Marcos, who led last month’s presidential preference survey, has a dominant online presence. Independent fact-checker VERA Files said he benefited most from election-related disinformation last year.“While it is true that there could have been hundreds of Twitter accounts that were suspended, there is no certainty that all of them belong to the supporters of Bongbong Marcos,” his spokesman Vic Rodriguez said in a statement.The late dictator’s son has said he doesn’t employ online trolls and isn’t boosting his social media pages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-suspends-300-accounts-promoting-philippines-marcos-101642911673697.html

23-01-2022||World||‘Deeply concerning’: US on alleged Russia plot to install pro-Kremlin leader in Ukraine||The White House on Saturday called the UK government assessment of the Kremlin’s plan to install pro-Russian leader in Kyiv “deeply concerning”, saying it stands with the democratically elected Ukrainian government."This kind of plotting is deeply concerning," said National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne. "The Ukrainian people have the sovereign right to determine their own future, and we stand with our democratically-elected partners in Ukraine."The UK Foreign Office has accused Moscow of seeking to replace Ukraine’s government with a pro-Russia administration as tensions swell between the two neighbours. The British government said that Yevhen Murayev, a former Ukrainian member of parliament, is a potential candidate. The assertions, based on an intelligence assessment, were made without providing details or a timeframe on the intelligence to back it up.German navy chief resigns over ‘Putin deserves respect’ remark in New DelhiBritain also claimed that the Russian intelligence services maintain links with “numerous” former Ukrainian politicians. The four former Ukrainian officials mentioned by the UK – Serhiy Arbuzov, Mykola Azarov, Andriy Kluyev and Volodymyr Sivkovych – are already subject to Western sanctions. They are believed to reside in Russia.“Russia must de-escalate, end its campaigns of aggression and disinformation, and pursue a path of diplomacy,” UK foreign secretary Liz Truss said in the statement. “Any Russian military incursion into Ukraine would be a massive strategic mistake with severe costs.”Russia's foreign ministry has rejected the allegations as "disinformation" from Britain."Disinformation circulated by @FCDOGovUK is yet another indication that it is the @NATO Members led by the Anglo-Saxon nations who are escalating tensions around #Ukraine," the ministry said in a tweet."We urge the Foreign Office to stop spreading nonsense."The US and the UK have started sending military aid to Ukraine as part of their effort to bolster its defences against a potential Russian invasion. Meanwhile, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania plan to send US-made anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine, a move fully endorsed by the United States."I expedited and authorized and we fully endorse transfers of defensive equipment @NATO Allies Estonia Latvia Lithuania are providing to Ukraine to strengthen its ability to defend itself against Russia's unprovoked and irresponsible aggression," US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deeply-concerning-us-on-alleged-russia-plot-to-install-pro-kremlin-leader-in-ukraine-101642895601702.html

Russia has denied it plans to invade but the White House believes an attack could now come "at any point".Britain's Foreign Office on Saturday advised against all travel to two pro-Moscow separatist territories Donetsk and Lugansk, as well as Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.It also advised against all but essential travel to the rest of Ukraine and recommended that British nationals should register their presence in the country.A US State Department spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Saturday that they had no plans to evacuate US citizens from Ukraine, adding that commercial flights were currently available.'Quagmire'Few military experts believe that Kyiv's smaller forces -- although rapidly modernising -- could repel an outright Russian invasion.But British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss warned on Friday that Moscow still risked becoming embroiled in a "terrible quagmire" if it invaded.In a speech in Australia, the UK's top diplomat issued a blunt and personal warning to Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying he was on the brink of making a major strategic blunder.He "has not learned the lessons of history", Truss told Sydney's Lowy Institute."The Ukrainians will fight this, it could be a quagmire" she said.Russia has put pressure on Ukraine since an uprising nearly a decade ago toppled a government that had resisted calls to move closer to the West.Moscow seized the Crimean peninsula in 2014 when a pro-Russian insurgency broke out in eastern Ukraine that has since claimed more than 13,000 lives.Ukraine's calls to Western allies to bolster its defence capabilities have seen the United States, Britain and the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania agree to send Kyiv weapons, including anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles.Moscow insists it has no plans to invade Ukraine but has at the same time laid down a series of security demands -- including a ban on Ukraine joining NATO -- in exchange for de-escalation.Ukraine 'disappointed' in GermanyBut Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Saturday condemned Germany for its refusal to supply weapons to Kyiv, urging Berlin to stop "undermining unity" and "encouraging Vladimir Putin".Kuleba said on Twitter that Germany's statements "about the impossibility of supplying defence weapons to Ukraine" did not match "the current security situation".Ukraine's minister stressed that "today the unity of the West in relation to Russia is more important than ever".Ukraine is "grateful" to Germany for the support it has already provided, but its "current statements are disappointing", he added.Ukraine's foreign ministry meanwhile summoned the German ambassador to Ukraine to stress "the categorical unacceptability" of comments by German naval chief Kay-Achim Schoenbach.Schoenbach had said the idea that Russia wanted to invade Ukraine was "nonsense" and that what Putin wanted was "to be respected".Schoenbach made it clear in a subsequent tweet that his comments to a think-tank gathering in New Delhi on Friday, did not represent the government's view and had been ill-advised.But a German defence ministry spokesman said Saturday he would be asked to explain himself to the army chief of staff.Also Saturday, German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht said that Berlin would send a field hospital to Ukraine, but once again rejected Kiev's calls for weapons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-russian-defence-ministers-to-discuss-ukraine-situation-101642889944296.html
23-01-2022||World||Wildfire along California's Big Sur forces hundreds to evacuate, highway shut||Strong winds pushed a wildfire that broke out in the rugged mountains above Big Sur to the sea, forcing hundreds of residents on this precarious stretch of the California coast to evacuate and authorities to shut its main roadway.The fire broke out Friday night in a steep canyon. Fanned by wind gusts of up to 50 mph (80 kph), it quickly burned at least 2.3 square miles (6 square kilometers) of brush and redwood trees, said Cecile Juliette, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.“The fire lined up with the wind and the terrain and that gave the fire a lot of energy to make a big run,” she said Saturday.Authorities made contact with about 500 residents, urging them to evacuate the sparsely populated area between Carmel and Big Sur. More than 250 firefighters from multiple agencies and volunteer groups, aided by water-dropping aircraft, contained 5% of the blaze.“The winds have died down and that has worked in our favor,” she said.Authorities shut a stretch of Highway 1 with no estimated time for reopening. The highway along Big Sur is prone to closures due to fire and mudslides from heavy rain that made portions of the roadway collapse to the sea last year and in 2017.Evacuees shared on social media dramatic images of flames burning behind iconic Bixby Bridge. The tall concrete span has been the backdrop of many car commercials, movies and TV shows, most recently the HBO drama “Big Little Lies.”Strong winds were recorded across the San Francisco Bay Area overnight, knocking down trees and power lines and causing outages to at least 18,000 Pacific Gas & Electric customers in the region, the utility said. There were no immediate reports of injuries.In Sonoma County, firefighters extinguished a 5-acre fire on Geyser Peak, where gusts above 90 mph (145 kph) were recorded.The National Weather Service said a similar windy event happened in the region nearly a year ago on the night of Jan. 18. A red flag warning of extreme fire danger was issued then due to the strong winds and much drier conditions.This time, the region was still moist after December storms dumped heavy snow in the mountains and partially refilled parched reservoirs, providing some relief from what had been an exceptionally dry year.However, Juliette said the winds quickly dried up vegetation weakened by a prolonged drought and lowered humidity level.“It's unusual to have fire this size here on the coast at the end of January,” she said. “The fact that we had a fire this size is of great concern.”The cause of the fire was under investigation.Warnings of gusts from 50 mph to 70 mph (80-113 kph) were set to go into effect in much of Southern California by midafternoon Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wildfire-along-california-s-big-sur-forces-hundreds-to-evacuate-highway-shut-101642889169941.html

The assault on the Ghwayran prison in the northern city of Hasakeh is one of IS’s most significant since its “caliphate” was declared defeated in Syria nearly three years ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-coalition-denies-yemen-prison-airstrike-101642888283733.html
23-01-2022||World||Canada’s Trudeau vows action after four Indians freeze to death at US border||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday vowed action on human trafficking after the “mind-blowing” death of four Indian nationals, who froze to death while allegedly trying to illegally cross the border between Canada and the United States.“It was an absolutely mind-blowing story. It’s so tragic to see a family die like that, victims of human traffickers...and of people who took advantage of their desire to build a better life,” Trudeau said.“This is why we are doing all we can to discourage people from crossing the border in an irregular or illicit manner. We know there are great risks in doing so,” he added. Canada, Trudeau said, was working very closely with the United States to stop smuggling and help people “taking unacceptable risks”.The four victims - an infant, a teenage boy and two adults - were found in the Canadian province of Manitoba, just about 10km from the American border in Minnesota, where they were said to be walking across snow-covered fields during blizzard-like conditions.India’s consulate in Toronto has sent a team of officials to Winnipeg in Manitoba to coordinate with local officials and law enforcement. Canadian police have also briefed Indian officials in Ottawa.However, the identities of the four victims have yet to be established as the Manitoba Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) continues its investigation, with a post-mortem likely to take place on Monday.Seven other Indian nationals, linked to the tragic quartet found dead on the Canadian side of the border, were apprehended in the United States, and, according to an affidavit filed by a Homeland Security agent before the US district court for Minnesota, “all of the foreign nationals spoke Gujarati”. That makes it likely the victims were also from Gujarat, though that has yet to be confirmed by the police. One of those caught in the US told agents there he “paid a significant amount of money to enter Canada from India under a fraudulently obtained student visa”.One person, a 47-year-old resident of Florida Steve Shand was arrested by US authorities for allegedly “smuggling undocumented foreign nationals”. Two Indian nationals were found travelling with him in a passenger van, while five others were found wandering nearby, apparently seeking to rendezvous with Shand. One of them, a female, is in hospital suffering from severe frostbite that could lead to partial amputation.The bodies of the four victims were discovered on Wednesday after Manitoba RCMP in the morning received “concerning information” from their counterparts that the US Customs and Border Protection (USCBP) had apprehended a group of individuals who had crossed into the US from Canada, near the town of Emerson in Manitoba. According to a release from the Manitoba RCMP, they also found that one of the adults was carrying items meant for an infant, but that no infant was with the group.A search began and four hours later, at about 1:30pm, RCMP officers found the bodies of three individuals located on the Canadian side of the border, close to the town of Emerson. “Fearing there may be additional victims, officers continued their search and located the body of an additional male, believed at this time to be in his mid-teens,” the release stated.In a statement released on Friday, Jane MacLatchy, commanding officer of Manitoba RCMP, said the force has continued its search for survivors or additional victims, but no more have been located thus far.
23-01-2022||India||HT This Day: Jan 24, 1979 - Charan Singh, J. Ram become Dy PMs today||Hindustan Times CorrespondentNEW DELHI- Cutting short his Gujarat tour, former Home Minister Charan Singh returned to the Capital late this evening to be appointed one of the two Deputy Prime Ministers tomorrow. The swearing-in ceremony is scheduled for 9-30 a.m. Defence Minister Jagjivan Ram will be simultaneously elevated as the other Deputy Prime Minister.The preliminaries for the Rashtrapati Bhavan function were formalised today. Prime Minister Morarji Desai called on President Sanjiva Reddy and was with him for half an hour reviewing the current developments.The earlier efforts to administer the oath of office to Mr Charan Singh today itself did not succeed because the Prime Minister had not completed his round of consultations with his Cabinet colleagues.. Mr Charan Singh too could not cancel his departure, although he postponed it by a few hours after a State plane was made available to him.While the junior Ministers who had resigned in protest against Mr Charan Singh's ouster may return to the government later, Mr Rabt Ray, one of the general secretaries of the Janata Party and a staunch supporter of Mr Charan Singh, is expected to join the Cabinet as Health Minister tomorrow.Instead of waiting for the budget session to be over as proposed earlier, Mr Charan Singh will takeover the finance portfolio immediately. The present incumbent, Mr H. M. Patel will get Home currently being handled by the Prime Minister.The suggestion made by several supporters of Mr Desai that Mr Jagjivan Ram be shifted to Home, did not appeal to the Prime Minister. First, he felt that by giving Home to Mr Patel no snajor reallocation would be required immediately. In any case, Mr Patel had to be given an important portfolio when finance was being taken away from him.Apart from incidentally meeting the wishes of Mr Charan Singh, as conveyed by him through party president Chandra Shekhar, Mr Desai is reluctant because Mr Jagjivan Ram's performance as Defence Minister has been widely appreciated and the Prime Minister does not want to disturb him.As regards Mr Charan Singh's re-entry in the government, both, Mr Jagjiven Ram and his close associate Petroleum Minister H. N. Bahuguna reportedly told the Prime Minister that they did not want to come in the way of any solution that he might have conceived to get over the differences in the party. However, they are be. lieved to have expressed their misgivings about the functioning of the Cabinet, in view of certain "out-dated notions" entertained by Mr Charan Singh.It was also pointed out by some others that the appointment of Mr Charan Singh as Deputy Prime Minister after all that he had said about the Prime Minister and the government as a whole might be misunderstood by other segments of the party as a convenient tool to get things done by threatening a split This may have far-reachin consequences.The Prime Minister pleaded with all these dissenters that no hard and fast rule could be applied in such delicate matters. After all, the interest of the country as a whole had to be taken. And, in any case, Mr Charan Singh was not coming on his own terms.Some other party MPs expressed the fear that Mr Charan Singh might translate the plan of Mr Raj Narain and try to wreck the Government from within. He might act like Mr Liaqat Ali Khan who was Finance Minister in Nehru's interim Cabinet.Mr Desal asked all these sceptics not to harbour any misgivings. The formula as finally evolved should be given a fair trial.Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ravindra Varma was among those who are understood to have expressed their reservations. At the same time, he assured his full co-operation in the efforts to forge greater cohesion and unity.Mr S. N. Mishra and some other ardent supporters of Mr Charan Singh had consultation among themselves. While they agreed to wait and watch, some of them felt they had been let down by their leader. They also wondered if the proposed meeting of the erstwhile BLD on Jan. 28, would take piece at all.UNI adds:On his return from Ahmedabad tonight, Mr Charan Singh was received by three former Ministers of State, Mr Jagbir Singh, Mr Narsingh and Mr Ram Kinkar. Mr Rabi Ray and All-India Kisan Sammelan general secretary Narendra Singh were also present.From the airport, Mr Charan Singh drove to his Tughlaq Road residence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-this-day-jan-24-1979-charan-singh-j-ram-become-dy-pms-today-101642960437540.html
23-01-2022||India||Cracks in Bengal BJP widen as 2 former vice-presidents are charged with indiscipline||Fissures in the West Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) got wider on Sunday afternoon when the leadership issued show-cause letters to two of its former state vice-presidents, charging them with making statements against the party. The two leaders, Jay Prakash Majumdar and Ritesh Tiwari, were dropped from the state committee on December 22 when the Bengal unit announced the names of 11 new vice-presidents, five general secretaries, 42 organizational district unit presidents, 12 state secretaries, the new morcha (front) presidents and the heads of several cells. The rejig made not just some veterans, who were left out, unhappy but also left leaders from the Dalit Matua community, headed by Union minister of state Shantanu Thakur, upset. The dissidents have united under Thakur’s leadership. “I will continue to lead every dissident. Can the state leadership take disciplinary action against all of them?” Thakur, who has demanded the removal of Bengal general secretary (organisation) Amitava Chakraborty, holding him responsible for the crucial organizational changes, said after the show-cause letters were issued.Old-timers such as Pratap Banerjee, Biswapriyo Roy Chowdhury, Union minister of state Dr Subhas Sarkar, Raj Kamal Pathak and Debasish Mitra were also dropped from the panel of vice-presidents. Jay Prakash Majumdar was made a spokesperson while the others were left with no portfolio. A known hardliner, general secretary Sayantan Basu, was dropped as well. Most of these leaders left the Bengal BJP’s WhatsApp groups. Following some protests, Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar dissolved the cells and departments on January 13 but that did not change the scenario. “Information about the show-cause letters were given to the media on Saturday night and when the letters were issued on Sunday, the media got the copies before the intended recipients. This poses a serious question on who should be held responsible for breaching party discipline. I have never made any public statement against the party. My reply will reach the leadership in due time,” Majumdar told HT. Tiwari said: “The letter I received shows how ignorant the current office-bearers are. It was issued by an office secretary who wrote that he had been directed to do so by the state president. The letter does not mention when and how I breached discipline, under which section of the party’s rules the action was taken and what is the deadline for sending my reply.” “This is a conspiracy by those who became leaders after 2019. They represent the tatkal (instant) BJP. They neither have any base in the organization, nor followers on the streets. They can’t even organise a procession. I am in the party for 32 years. I will give my reply in an appropriate manner,” Tiwari told HT. Senior state BJP leaders said that Shantanu Thakur held a meeting with Majumdar and the other dissidents for more than two hours on Sunday evening. During the day he also held a meeting with Matua community leaders in his Bongaon Lok Sabha constituency where a picnic was also held. This was the second picnic Thakur held in less than 10 days. The dissident camp got agitated because neither Majumdar nor Tiwari had made any anti-BJP statement before the media on January 15 when Thakur held his first press conference with the dissidents at the Kolkata Port Trust guest house in the state capital. The duo remained silent even on January 16 when Thakur held his first picnic with the disgruntled leaders. Dissidence in the BJP has emerged even in Purulia and Bankura districts where the party performed well in the panchayat, Lok Sabha and assembly polls in 2015, 2019 and 2021 respectively. The central leadership in Delhi has been informed about the rumblings. Refusing to speak on the show-cause letters, Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said, “I am not aware of the details. This is an internal matter of the party.” The involvement of a Union minster has made the dissidence a serious issue for the party, some veteran Bengal BJP leaders said. Thakur said earlier this week that implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is the principal demand of the Matuas and they want to discuss it with BJP central leaders and Union home minister Amit Shah. Subrata Thakur, the minister’s brother, is the legislator from Gaighata in North 24 Parganas. Shantanu Thakur and four legislators left all WhatsApp groups of the West Bengal BJP on January 4. The Centre has said that it is in the process of framing laws for the CAA which the Parliament passed in 2020. The law offers citizenship to non-Muslims who entered India from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh before 2015. The Matuas are a part of the large Dalit Namasudra community that migrated from East Pakistan (Now Bangladesh) during India’s partition in 1947 and the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War to escape religious persecution. The TMC insists that the law is unconstitutional as it links citizenship to faith in a secular country.

Yet they went ahead and inducted him," news agency PTI quoted him as saying."From day one, I have said the man has no brains. He is just a waste of time. I had said all this to the Congress president when she had asked me how will he suit us (the party)," Amarinder Singh continued.“Sidhu was the only minister I dropped because he was totally incompetent. He did not clear and handle his files.”Amarinder Singh, who broke ties with the Congress last year following a bitter tussle with Navjot Sidhu, claimed that the Punjab Congress chief did not act against Channi in a #MeToo case as the woman IAS officer did not pursue her complaint, PTI further reported.Amarinder Singh’s newly-launched PLC is jointly contesting the February 20 Punjab assembly polls in alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and SAD (Sanyukt). Asked if he had said he would fight against Sidhu, Singh said, “I had said we will not allow him to win. Because he is a totally incompetent man". He recalled how Sindhu once told him in Delhi that he does meditation daily for six hours and he wondered if he was a stable person. "He told me that he does meditation daily for six hours and talks to God for one hour. When I curiously asked what does he talk to God, he replied ‘just the way we talk’," said Amarinder, adding he had told Sonia Gandhi later that Sidhu did not seem to be a stable person. (With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-brains-totally-incompetent-amarinder-singh-attacks-navjot-sidhu-101642955740781.html
23-01-2022||India||None can change history of Bengal, India, says Mamata; slams BJP on Netaji’s birthday||From shifting of the Amar Jawan Jyoti in Delhi to dissolution of the Planning Commission of India, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee picked every weapon in her arsenal on Sunday to target the Central government and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) while celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose in Kolkata. Hours before Prime Minister Narendra Modi was scheduled to light up the holographic image of Netaji at India Gate, Banerjee, who garlanded Bose’s old statue in the Maidan, accused the Centre of destroying India’s federal structure and downplaying the history of Bengal and the nation. Banerjee did not name any BJP leader during her 40-minute speech but the targets of her attack were apparent. She even referred to the proposed changes in the service rules for Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers and freezing of the bank account of the Missionaries of Charity, the institution set up by Saint Teresa in Kolkata where she worked all her life. Demanding a national holiday on January 23, Banerjee criticized the Centre for winding up the Planning Commission of India that Bose had envisaged. After coming to power in 2014, the first National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government led by Modi dissolved the Planning Commission of India and replaced it with the Niti Aayog. “Whether it is the clarion call of ‘Jai Hind’ raised by Netaji, the national anthem composed by Rabindranath Tagore or the national song penned by novelist Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, Bengal has been the torchbearer. Why is Bengal being ignored today in this manner? Nobody can ignore Bengal. I challenge them. Nobody can wipe out the history of Bengal and India. Those trying it will burn their hands. Lighting a torch or setting up a statue of Netaji does not bestow the respect he deserves. Why is Netaji’s disappearance shrouded in mystery 75 years after Independence?” asked Banerjee. “This (Central) government had promised to reveal the truth but it did nothing. Our government released all documents on Netaji that we had in our archives,” she added. Announcing that her government will set up its own planning commission, Banerjee said: “Bengal is the holy ground of our freedom movement. India could not have won Independence without Bengal. I say this with pride.…… To know Netaji, you have to first know his source of inspiration, Swami Vivekananda… Today some people want to divide the nation in the name of Hindus and Muslims. I will urge them to read the works of Netaji and Swami Vivekananda.” “I urge these people to know Gandhi, Ambedkar and Netaji. Rishi Aurobindo propagated the federalism we talk of today. None of them said nationalism can be established by dividing the country. Netaji said nationalism lives in unity. We will not accept those who try to make us forget history. It is necessary to include our history in school and college textbooks,” said Banerjee. “Gandhi was born in Gujarat and he ended all communal riots. When India was embracing her Independence in 1947, Gandhi was not present in Parliament. He was in Kolkata, holding a fast to end the riots,” said Banerjee. “Bengal’s history is India’s history. Bengal’s history is world’s history… Most of our freedom fighters were from Bengal and Punjab. Today you are doing politics with a war memorial. We salute all soldiers who laid down their lives. They cannot be divided on the lines of religion,” said Banerjee. “I recently attended a seminar. Historians present there said all efforts are being made to distort history. Are we supposed to sleep when this happens? India must rise. Hindustan must march forward. It must love Netaji, Ambedkar, Gandhi, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Bhagat Singh and Birsa Munda. A leader must lead for all. He must be accepted by all. He must be one who respects all and inspires all without looking at their political colour. Today you are trying to preach religion. Netaji’s right-hand man (in the INA) was Shahnawaz Khan. We did not choose him (Khan),” said Banerjee. “Vivekananda had food with a Muslim family. Leaders often visit Belur Math to pay homage to him. Do they know that there is a darga (mausoleum) inside Belur Math? Go and visit it once,” the chief minister said without making any reference to the visits of the Prime Minister and Union home minister Amit Shah. “We have to give proof of our religious identity. I don’t need any character certificate from the BJP party or anyone. I need my certificate from the people of this soil. Would it harm anyone if our tableau on Netaji was allowed at the Republic Day Parade? Why is there an allergy for Bengal? In the past, our tableau on Gandhi and Rabindranath were rejected. Today you are setting up a statue under pressure from us. What were you doing all these years? See our statue at Red Road. It is alive, not an artificial image. Setting up a statue does not end your responsibility,” said Banerjee. “You have spent crores on statues. Have you ever read the history of India? Have you protected our history? Today, everyone is afraid to speak up. Everybody is scared,” she said. “Despite being a Muslim, poet Kazi Nazrul Islam composed some immortal Shyama Sangeet (songs dedicated to Goddess Kali) that your blunt religious system cannot produce…. The bank accounts of the Missionaries of Charity were frozen recently. Luckily, we came to know of it and the accounts were restored. The matter was discussed even in other nations,” she added. “You are destroying our federal structure. You are withdrawing the original service rules for IAS officers. One fine morning you may recall our chief secretary to Delhi. Who will work here in that case? We will fight for our federal structure,” she added. “Netaji does not belong to Bengal alone. He belongs to the world and, to India…… We will set up a second university in his name and a monument dedicated to the Azad Hind Fauj. The present government of India dissolved the Planning Commission that Netaji envisaged. I cannot find words to condemn this act. What Netaji thought of is required even today. We will set up a planning commission in Bengal. Netaji may not find his place in Delhi, he will always be remembered in Bengal,” said Banerjee. Announcing a series of programmes, the chief minister said her government will set up Jai Hind Bahini in schools and colleges on the lines of the National Cadet Corps and several museums dedicated to Netaji and other freedom fighters. The Bengal BJP was quick to lead a counter attack on the chief minister. “TMC carries the legacy of the Congress which insulted and opposed Netaji and forced him to quit the Congress. These leaders have no right to make such statements. TMC’s Planning Commission will only help some people make money while the state’s debt burden will increase,” said Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya. Leader of the opposition in the Bengal assembly, Suvendu Adhikari, said, “No wonder Banerjee wants another holiday on Netaji’s birthday. She has already sent the entire state on a long holiday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/none-can-change-history-of-bengal-india-says-mamata-slams-bjp-on-netaji-s-birthday-101642958283790.html

23-01-2022||India||Assam orders probe into police firing at former student leader; opposition targets CM||The Assam government on Sunday constituted a one-man-inquiry commission to probe the incident of police firing on a former student leader in Nagaon district a day earlier. Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma announced setting up of a one-man inquiry committee comprising additional chief secretary Pawan Borthakur to probe the shooting. The committee will submit its report in a week. Kirti Kamal Bora, a former general secretary of students’ union of Nagaon College, was shot by police after he allegedly attacked a police team which was probing a narcotics case. The youth, who sustained a bullet injury on his leg, is admitted at the Guwahati Medical College Hospital (GMCH). While the police allege Bora was shot at after he attacked a police team and some vials of heroin were found in his possession, his family members maintain the youth is innocent and accused the police of targeting him without reason. “I had earlier issued strict instructions to the police to deal with criminals with a firm hand. But if any innocent is hurt by police actions, it won’t be tolerated. Measures will be taken against policemen, if they are found involved in wrongdoing,” said Sarma. Earlier Assam Police had informed that the police personnel involved in the shooting of Bora have been sent to police reserve with immediate effect and assured that if there’s any lapse, “guilty personnel will be taken to task”. “Police in police clothes were questioning a person suspected of carrying drugs. At that time, Bora reached the spot and asked the police team if they were police personnel. When the team members replied in affirmative, Bora started attacking the policemen,” Nagaon police superintendent Anand Mishra told journalists. “It was while trying to overpower Bora that the police team resorted to firing. If they had not done it, there could have been a fatal injury. If there is any lacuna on the part of the police it will come out during investigation,” he added. Bora was a member of the All Assam Students Union (AASU) and on Sunday its members and representatives from other student groups staged protest rally against police in town and outside Nagaon police station demanding the arrest of the policeman responsible for shooting the youth. “I strongly condemn police action against Bora, an innocent youth. Incidents such as this one has created an atmosphere of police terror in the state. It is an example of a brutal state. We want strict action against those guilty and warn police to refrain from such things in future,” AASU chief advisor Samujjal Bhattacharya tweeted. Saturday’s incident has led opposition parties in state to target the state government and specifically Chief Minister Sarma who had earlier directed the police to be strict with criminals and even shoot at those who tried to flee from custody or attack police personnel. “I visited Bora’s home on Sunday. He comes from a simple family and was trying to earn a living by giving tuitions. Police attack on such a youth is a reflection of licence to shoot given to the police by the CM,” said Congress state president Bhupen Kumar Borah. “We have been witnessing such extra-judicial shootings in the state in past months. Today it was Bora, but tomorrow it could be anyone of us. Public should come out against such police acts,” he added. Raijor Dal president and Sivasagar MLA Akhil Gogoi condemned the shooting and demanded the arrest of the accused policeman. He also sought suspension of the Nagaon superintendent of police. On January 11, the Gauhati High Court had directed the Assam government to file a detailed affidavit within two weeks on alleged fake encounters by the state police since May last year. Hearing a petition filed by lawyer Arif Jwadder, a division bench of Justices Sudhanshu Dhulia and Soumitra Saikia directed that a detailed counter affidavit should be filed by Secretary (Home) or Additional Secretary (Home). In his petition filed in December, Jwadder mentioned that 80 incidents of fake encounters had happened in the state since May 2021 (since the new government under Sarma took charge) and they resulted in 28 deaths and left 48 injured. 
23-01-2022||India||Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan asks PM to roll back new civil service cadre rules||Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday sent a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to drop the proposed amendment in deputation rules for the Indian Administrative Service and Indian Police Service officers.Many opposition-ruled states including West Bengal and Maharashtra have already expressed their strong reservations over the proposal saying it will weaken federal structure of the country. In the letter the CM said deputation rules are already loaded in favour of the Centre and the proposed amendment “will induce a fear psychosis among civil servants and create hesitancy among them to implement policies formulated by states ruled by parties that are politically opposed to the policies of the party at the Centre.”“The present deputation rules are themselves heavily loaded in favour of the Union and bringing further stringency will weaken the very root of co-operative federalism. The government of Kerala is of the opinion that the proposed amendments may be dropped,” he said in the letter adding it will weaken the federal polity of the country.He said in the federal setup, the state governments are at par with the Union government because both are elected by the people, though the division of authority in the Constitution gives the Centre jurisdiction over a wide range of subjects.“We need to recognise that in a vibrant democratic and federal polity, states and Centre can be ruled by political formations with different ideologies. But these governments function within the framework of the Constitution,” he pointed out in the letter. At least five states have sent letters to the Union government opposing the proposed changes. West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee has sent two letters in this regard saying the “Centre was taking the matter to non-federal extremes.” The proposed amendments to the cadre rules 1954 seek to change the norms for central deputation of IAS and IPS officers from different states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-cm-pinarayi-vijayan-asks-pm-to-roll-back-new-civil-service-cadre-rules-101642952703569.html

23-01-2022||India||Kerala crime branch interrogates Malayalam actor Dileep, four others||A day after the Kerala High Court stalled his arrest till January 27, Malayalam actor Dileep and four other accused appeared before the crime branch in Kochi on Sunday for questioning in connection with an alleged plot to kill police officers who investigated the actor abduction and assault case. Dileep reached the crime branch office in Kalamassery around 8.50 am and a senior officer said the questioning session will be recorded to avoid further charges in the high-profile case. The court had asked him to appear before the investigating team for three consecutive days. It also directed officials to file a report on the interrogation in a sealed cover by Thursday and asked all accused to co-operate with the investigation fully. The crime branch registered a fresh case against Dileep and others two weeks back following the disclosure of director Balachandra Kumar that the accused assembled at the house of the actor in November 2017 and hatched a conspiracy to kill police officers involved with the probe. The actor, who is the seventh accused in the actor abduction and assault case, and others, moved the court for anticipatory bail after a fresh case was registered against them. After the director’s revelations, the Kerala government also approached the Supreme Court two weeks back with a plea to extend the trial for six more months. The new FIR was filed against Dileep, his brother Anoop, another relative Suraj, and two others (Appu and Babu) and they were charged under Indian Penal Code sections 116 (abetment of offence), 118 (concealing design to commit an offence), 120 B (criminal conspiracy) and 506 (criminal intimidation). Kumar, a former friend of the actor, claimed last month that he was in possession of the video of the assault on the woman actor and that the accused had tried to influence many witnesses in the case. He also alleged that he had met the main accused in the case, Pulsar Suni, at the residence of actor Dileep in 2016 when he had gone there to discuss a film project. Later, the prosecution recorded his statement under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. A leading woman actor was waylaid, kidnapped and sexually assaulted by a criminal gang in Kochi while she was returning home after a shooting assignment in 2017. Six months after the incident Dileep was arrested and made an accused in the case. The prosecution alleged that the attack was planned at the behest of Dileep to settle an old score with the woman actor. In four years, the high-profile case witnessed many twists and turns. While opposing his bail plea, the prosecution on Saturday said he was the first in the country to give a contract to rape a fellow actor with whom he had some disagreements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-crime-branch-interrogates-malayalam-actor-dileep-four-others-101642950186417.html

23-01-2022||India||Trying to solve border issues made by Cong’s unplanned creation of NE states: Assam CM||Accusing the Congress of creating border issues in northeast through unplanned creation of new states, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Sunday that his government is trying to correct those mistakes. The CM’s statement came following opposition from Congress and other parties to the recent agreement between Assam and Meghalaya to sort out differences in 6 disputed areas through a give and take formula of land swap. As part of the deal, of the total disputed area of 36.79 sq km in the 6 areas Assam would get 18.51 sq km while Meghalaya would get 18.28 sq km Besides Meghalaya, Assam has border disputes with Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Nagaland. As per Assam assembly records, the total area of border disputes with all four states is around 690 sq km. “Before criticizing us, Congress should realize that Meghalaya was carved out of Assam by them. We had to give up Shillong, which was our capital, and set up a new capital in Dispur,” said Sarma. “Not just Meghalaya, Congress was responsible for creating Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Nagaland by dividing Assam. If they had not done it, or sorted out the boundary issues at the time of creation of these new states, we wouldn’t have been facing disputes till now,” he added. Sarma said that creation of new states within northeast was part of a Congress plan to weaken the region. He said the party hurriedly created new states in the region without trying to sort out disputes. “As a result of Congress’s policies, people in northeast are suffering and we are fighting among ourselves. It was the design of Congress to keep the region in a weak and defensive position,” he said. “If states fight amongst themselves, we can’t go to Delhi and ask for something together as a region. It was Congress’s game plan. We are trying to correct that after 50 years. People in northeast want to live in peace. We have to create such an atmosphere. We owe it to our future generations,” Sarma added. Sarma informed that border talks would soon take place between Assam and Arunachal Pradesh and with Mizoram in the near future. Since the border dispute with Nagaland is pending in Supreme Court, he expressed the hope that it would get sorted in another 2-3 years. Earlier, Congress and All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), the two biggest opposition parties in the state assembly, had opposed the land swap deal with Meghalaya and urged the BJP-led Assam government to discuss the issue in detail in the assembly before taking any hasty decision. Two regional parties, Raijor Dal and Assam Jatiya Parishad stated that while the Assam government is trying to portray that each state would get nearly 50% share of the 6 disputed areas, in reality Meghalaya would gain control of half the areas it had encroached while Assam will only get back half of its land, which the neighbour had earlier captured.

The new alliance has been named the Samajik Parivartan Morcha.

23-01-2022||India||BPF to be part of BJP, other ruling parties in Assam assembly, says Himanta Biswa Sarma||Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Sunday said that the opposition Bodoland Peoples’ Front (BPF) would henceforth be part of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its other coalition partners inside the state assembly. A former friend and ruling partner of the saffron party, BPF and BJP had parted ways in 2020 during elections to the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC). While BJP joined hands with the United Peoples’ Party Liberal (UPPL) to come to power in BTC and continued the association in the 2021 assembly polls, BPF became part of the Congress-led alliance. Following the assembly poll debacle, BPF had dissociated itself with the Congress-led alliance. “Considering the present political atmosphere and after due deliberations in order to ensure smooth passage of bills in the legislature we have decided to welcome BPF as a friendly party inside the state assembly,” Sarma said. “From now BPF MLAs would be part of the treasury benches in assembly. This understanding is with the BPF legislature party and is restricted to the assembly and we have not reached any political agreement with the party,” he added informing that UPPL’s consent was taken before the move. With the new development, the strength of the ruling alliance in the 126-member state assembly rose to 81 (BJP-62, UPPL-7, Asom Gana Parishad-9 and BPF-3) while the opposition’s numbers came down to 44. One seat is lying vacant. On a separate note, Sarma welcomed the move by banned United Liberation Front of Asom-Independent (ULFA-I) not to call for boycott of the coming Republic Day celebrations. The insurgent outfit, which had earlier announced unilateral ceasefire of its activities, had refrained from boycotting Independence Day celebrations. “I welcome the positive step and believe that through such confidence building measures we will be able to sit for peace talks with the outfit in future,” he said. The CM announced setting up of a one-man inquiry committee comprising additional chief secretary Pawan Borthakur to probe the shooting of a former student leader by the police in Nagaon district on Saturday night. The committee will submit its report in a week. Kirti Kamal Bora, a former general secretary of the students’ union of Nagaon College, was shot by police after he allegedly attacked a police team which was probing a narcotic case. The youth, who sustained a bullet injury on his leg, is admitted at the Guwahati Medical College Hospital (GMCH). “I had earlier issued strict instructions to the police to deal with criminals with a firm hand. But if any innocent is hurt by police actions, it won’t be tolerated. Measures will be taken against policemen, if they are found involved in wrongdoing,” said Sarma.

The hologram statue has been installed at the India Gate canopy, which once housed the statue of King George V, the imperial icon of the country that Netaji fought all his life.After unveiling Netaji's statue, Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighted the fact that Subhas Chandra Bose had refused to bow down before the British in all his years of struggle. “Soon, the hologram statue will be replaced by a grand granite statue,” the Prime Minister said. “Netaji's statue will inspire democratic values and future generations.”Also Read | In unveiling of Netaji's statue, PM Modi's message to the worldUnion home minister Amit Shah, who was also present at the event, said that the unveiling of the statue marks another step towards reviving Netaji's forgotten legacy in the history of India's freedom struggle. “Today marks a new beginning for the nation,” the home minister said, in his tribute to the life and works of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. “This is not just a granite statue but also a befitting tribute to the legendary Netaji, who gave everything for India’s freedom.”Earlier this day, Prime Minister Modi had expressed his happiness at the fact that there is “immense enthusiasm” in the country regarding the unveiling of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's hologram statue.I am glad to see the immense enthusiasm towards the unveiling of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s hologram statue at India Gate this evening at 6 PM. At the same programme, the ‘Subhas Chandra Bose Aapda Prabandhan Puraskars’ would also be conferred. https://t.co/7RJzLrLC7aSeven awards in total were also presented during the ceremony. According to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), the central government has instituted the annual Subhas Chandra Bose Aapda Prabandhan Puraskar to recognise and honour “the invaluable contribution and selfless service rendered by individuals and organisations in the field of disaster management.”The event comes across as especially historic since the country is celebrating its ‘Amrut Mahotsav’ this year, marking 75 years of Independence from British colonial rule. At the same time, the Prime Minister kickstarted Republic Day celebrations in a mark of respect for the date on which the Constitution of India came into effect turned the nation into a newly-formed republic.Also Read | 5 things to know about sculptor Adwaita Gadanayak who will make India Gate Netaji statueThis is the first time that India is beginning Republic Day celebrations from January 23 instead of January 24, to include the birth anniversary of late freedom fighter Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. It will end on January 30, the day Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated.Born on January 23, 1897, ‘Netaji’ (the title meaning ‘respected leader’ that Bose later earned) played a crucial role in India's freedom movement. Now, this grand statue of the freedom fighter seals his place in India's historic landscape as the nationalist hero who defied colonial rule and resisted the British as the leader of the Azad Hind Fauj, the army that faced the maximum attrition from the imperialists but never surrendered.The original statue, the digital version of which was unveiled today at the India Gate, was sculpted by Awaita Gadanayak, the director-general of the National Gallery of Modern Art.According to officials, the decision to install Netaji's statue was not taken in the spur of the moment by Prime Minister Modi but through intensive deliberations with the culture ministry and those manning historical archives. It is also befitting that Netaji, overlooking the Raisina Hills, will be taking salute of the Republic Day parade every year hence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/subhas-chandra-bose-birth-anniversary-pm-modi-unveils-netaji-s-digital-statue-at-india-gate-republic-day-celebrations-begin-101642938153073.html

We pay homage to all martyrs and freedom fighters. The Centre cannot create differences among soldiers who lost their lives for the nation. I challenge no one can delete the history of Bengal and India. If they do so, they are playing with fire."Netaji was born on January 23, 1897 and played a crucial role in India's freedom struggle.While there is a controversy over Bose's death in a plane crash in Taipei on August 18, 1945, the Central government had in an RTI (Right to Information) in 2017 confirmed that he had died in the incident, reported ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-rakes-up-promise-by-centre-to-unearth-netaji-mystery-101642937754344.html
23-01-2022||India||Ban opinion polls immediately: Samajwadi Party sends petition to ECI||The Samajwadi Party (SP) on Sunday wrote to the Election Commission of India (ECI) seeking a ban on opinion polls being aired by several television news channels.State president of the SP, Naresh Uttam Patel in a short letter to the ECI wrote: “Ban, with immediate effect, the opinion polls being run on television news channels”. Patel, also marking the copy of the letter to the chief electoral officer (CEO), UP, wrote in Hindi: “The dates for the elections to the UP assembly were declared on January 8 and the nomination filing for the first phase of the polls is already over. The state is going to have polls in seven phases for which the last date of polling is on March 7 and counting of votes will be held on March 10. Several television news channels are running opinion polls that are misleading the voters, and the elections are getting affected. At the same time it is also an open violation of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) for elections...So for free, fair, fearless polls it is necessary to ban opinion polls on television news channels with an immediate effect.”Samajwadi Party spokesperson Abdul Hafiq Gandhi said: “What’s the point in having an election, if TV channels are issuing verdicts like this that might affect voters’ mindset? It is necessary to ban the opinion polls to make it a level playing field for all in the fray. We all are well aware of the history of opinion polls and how off the mark they often turn out to be. And also the credibility of such survey has been under dispute.” “When these surveys happen, who does them; I have never come across any surveyor of any such opinion polls. Then there also is an issue about such poll surveys sample size. How could a tiny sample size against the vast population of the state, reflect a true picture of the entire state. Surveys must be banned,” the SP spokesperson emphasised.

23-01-2022||India||Shots fired at Netaji’s birthday celebration in Bengal town; TMC, BJP trade charges||A scuffle between Trinamool Congress (TMC) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers over garlanding a statue of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose at Bhatpara in Bengal’s North 24 Parganas district on Sunday afternoon marred the celebration of the freedom fighter’s 125th birth anniversary. TMC legislator from the district’s Naihati assembly constituency, Partha Bhowmick, alleged that security personnel of the BJP’s local Barrackapore Lok Sabha MP Arjun Singh fired seven rounds while the latter accused ruling party workers of opening fire, hurling bombs and ransacking his car. The allegations were raised after a quarrel between TMC and BJP workers over garlanding a statue of Netaji. The programme was organised by the TMC-controlled Bhatpara municipality. Singh alleged that he was stopped from garlanding the statue and subsequently attacked. “Arjun Singh is trying to unleash terror in this region. His security personnel fired seven rounds although not even a stone was hurled at him. I am asking local people to be on the alert. Singh’s men may try to create more disturbance,” said Bhowmick. Even as video footage captured by local television channels showed one of Singh’s security personnel loading a pistol and pointing it at some people who confronted the MP, police said the allegations of firing were being probed but there was no evidence of any clash or ransacking. “The fiasco started after a minor scuffle between two men. Only one man was injured. It has been alleged that shots were fired but no cartridge case was found from the spot. We are looking into this. The Member of Parliament went to the celebration without informing the administration, which is mandatory according to protocol. Policemen deployed at the spot said there was no violence or bombing,” said Manoj Verma, commissioner, Barrackpore Police. “Does the TMC hold exclusive rights to honouring Netaji? I was targeted. My security personnel were attacked with guns and bombs. My car was damaged. What can the police commissioner do? He is helpless. It is the job of the local police to track my movements and provide security cover but it is never done,” said Singh. Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar rushed to the spot. “A bullet narrowly missed one of the Central Industrial Security Force personnel accompanying Singh. We demand a probe by the Centre. Singh enjoys ‘Z’ category security cover,” said Majumdar. BJP central leaders targeted chief minister Mamata Banerjee who was celebrating the occasion in Kolkata at that time. “West Bengal under Mamata Banerjee has become lawless. From the gory post-poll violence under her watch which saw men maimed and killed, women raped, there isn’t a day her goons don’t run amok. Today, BJP MP Arjun Singh was attacked while garlanding Netaji’s statue, her police looked on,” tweeted Amit Malviya, head of the BJP’s national information technology cell and co-in-charge of the state unit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shots-fired-at-netaji-s-birthday-celebration-in-bengal-town-tmc-bjp-trade-charges-101642936860270.html

23-01-2022||India||Explained: The protest against JSW steel project in Odisha||BHUBANESWAR: More than 12 years after it signed a memorandum of understanding with Odisha government to build the largest integrated steel plant in India, Korean steelmaker Posco had to abandon its project in the face of popular resistance from a small village that formed the epicentre of protest. Dhinkia, the seaside village, one of the 8 villages in Erasama block of Jagatsinghpur district which were to be acquired by Odisha for the Posco steel project, forced the Korean company to retreat in 2017. A little more than four-and-a-half years later, the same village is now at the epicentre of protests against Sajjan Jindal owned JSW Utkal Steel that plans to construct a 13.2 million tonne per annum integrated steel project at the same site which would be fed iron ore from the company’s proposed 30 MTPA iron-ore grinding plant in Keonjhar district via a 312 km-long slurry pipeline. A 52 MTPA captive jetty located near the mouth of Jatadhar river mouth will also cater to the import and export requirements of the company. While people of Dhinkia village are still carrying on the fight against any industrial activity on their farmlands, on January 14, the protest took a violent turn after 12 platoons of Odisha police cracked down on hundreds of people resulting in injury to over 20 including women and children. Many villagers are still hiding wary of police arrest. Following two separate PILs in the Orissa high court, the court on Thursday directed the state government to submit a status report on the situation by the month end. What lies at the heart of protest? The JSW project requires 2,950.31 acres of land of which 2,700 acres was acquired by the government for the failed Posco project in 2013 and subsequently reserved for JSW after the company announced setting up of the 13.2 million tonne per annum steel plant in 2020. Though technically 2677.8 acres of the land is shown as forest land in government records, most of it is undulating sand dunes where people have built betel vineyards that does not take much capital, but brings in a steady stream of income for the impoverished villagers. Dhinkia grampanchayat which led the protest against Posco between 2005 and 2017, formed 30 per cent of total land requirement of the Korean steel project. But wisened by the past experience, the government by a sleight of hand has carved Dhinkia village into three separate revenue villages - Mahala and Jogisahi, Patana and Dhinkia- thus minimising the scale of protest. A public hearing held on December 20, 2019 turned out to be a ‘farce’ as many of the project-affected village residents did not participate in the meeting. The Dhinkia palli sabha also passed a resolution against the project that year. Activists allege that the government now has to deal with 45.56 acres of land in Dhinkia village alone having demolished betel vines in rest of the two hamlets. In the current phase of land acquisition for JSW project, 425 betel vineyards out of 625 tragetted have already been demolished by the district administration. The January 14 violence occurred after the villagers of Dhinkia wanted to resist the demolition of betel vineyards breaching a wall of police cordon. While the project has the forest clearance in place, Prashant Paikray of Jindal Pratirodh Sangram Samiti says the way the government is pushing through without the necessary environmental clearance smacks of an autocratic attitude of the government. “When the Indian Oil Corporation built its 15 million tonne refinery in early 2000, people of Dhinkia lost 62 acres of farmland. While the compensation ranged between ₹80000 to ₹1.03 lakh per acre, villagers agreed to give land when they were promised jobs. Even those from local villages who lost their homestead land did not get permanent jobs in the refinery which they were promised. With little education and skill level why would they trust JSW Steel or for that matter any company,” asked Paikray. Activist Prafulla Samantra points out to the distrust against industrialisation to the poor records of the Odisha government in rehabilitation. A 2018 study done by two professors from Koraput’s Central University of Odisha on development in villages displaced by Nalco, found that the living condition of the displaced people actually turned worse over the years. “There is lack of any employment. Villages lacked civic amenities while children were deprived of schooling. Most of the displaced people lived in semi-pucca house and source of drinking water continued to be either open well, handpump or pond water,” said Samantra quoting the study. Will JSW meet the same fate as Posco? Unlike Posco project where the state government dithered over taking a proactive approach, perhaps wary of the Tata Singur controversy in neighbouring Bengal that buried the CPI(M) government, in the case of JSW project, Naveen Patnaik seems to be interested in grabbing that last chance in big ticket industrialisation. Patnaik has become the butt of criticism after the Periodic Labour Force Survey showed that employment in Odisha declined by 19.3 lakh during 2011–12 and 2017–18 with many graduates and matriculates migrating to neighbouring states for livelihood. Amid the spiralling protests, JSW Steel officials said they have announced a rehabilitation project better than the state’s R&R in which the betel vine owners would get compensation of Rs. 17500 per decimal while the government rate was Rs. 6,000 per decimal. Additionally, a bonus of ₹50,000 per betel vine, irrespective of size would be provided after demolition. Besides, a door-to-door survey in the land losing villages have been done to identify one eligible member between the age group of 20-30 years for giving them direct or indirect engagement to one member in any of JSW group companies, associated company or contractors of the plant or project agencies, in a phased manner. For the time being, any work in the project site may lead to escalation of violence like that of January 14 as at least six of the leaders protesting the project, including Debendra Swain, the main leader, continues to be behind bars with police charging him with several cases under IPC including attempt to murder and criminal intimidation among others. On Friday, around 13 Opposition political party leaders approached the local police to talk about the release of protesters. The Congress leader who visited Dhinkia alleged that by escalating violence in Dhinkia, Naveen Patnaik is avenging the setbacks he received in the Posco project by using police force in Dhinkia against the villagers. Despite the government intent on acquiring the land for the steel project, much will depend upon how deftly the government handles the protest and how the public resistance shapes up in the coming days and the backing they receive from human rights organisations and political parties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explained-the-protest-against-jsw-steel-project-in-odisha-101642928278147.html

The observation was made early this month in its latest bulletin of the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics or Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genetics Consortium or INSACOG."Omicron is now in community transmission in India and has become dominant in multiple metros, where new cases have been rising exponentially. BA.2 lineage is in a substantial fraction in India and S gene dropout based screening is thus likely to give high false negatives," it said.Community transmission of Omicron in Delhi: What this new study claimsWhile most Omicron cases so far have been asymptomatic or mild, hospitalisations and ICU cases have been increasing in the current wave. The threat level remains unchanged, the expeSeveral states earlier said that Omicron was spreading in the community as patients without foreign travel history, without being a contact of anyone who has travelled abroad contracted the Omicron variant.Omicron, the variant first detected in South Africa on November 24 last year, is driving the third wave of the pandemic in the country. It has emerged as the dominant variant, replacing Delta, the variant which drove the second wave of the pandemic in India. In metro cities, Omicromn has already become the dominant strain, while in districts it is on its way to replacing Delta.The first few cases of Omicron in the country reported in December 2021 were among foreign travellers. Within weeks, Omicron spread rapidly indicating that the variant is not anymore confined within the person-to-person transmission, but has spread in the community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/omicron-is-transmitting-in-community-dominant-strain-in-metro-cities-centre-101642924579041.html
23-01-2022||India||In unveiling of Netaji's statue, PM Modi's message to the world||Prime Minister Narendra Modi today will unveil the digital statue of freedom fighter and leader of erstwhile Indian National Army (INA) Subhas Chandra Bose at the India Gate canopy, which once housed the statue of King George V, the imperial icon of the country that Netaji fought all his life. Home minister Amit Shah and culture minister G Kishan Reddy will also be present on the occasion as India celebrates the 125th birth anniversary of Netaji.While both PM and HM are slated to speak on the occasion, the installation of the granite statue of Netaji under the canopy is in recognition of the leader of INA as one of the foremost freedom fighters of India. INA was the army that faced maximum attrition (26,000 out of total 90,000 died) but never surrendered to the British. Its officers and men were captured and put on trial but never signed any surrender document before the British.From this evening, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s statue will be put at the place where the statue of George V used to reside till 1968. The imperial ruler for whom the 1911 Delhi Durbar was held with practically all the ruling prince and noblemen in India present to pay his obeisance to the newly crowned Emperor of India. It is also befitting that Netaji will be taking salute of the Republic Day parade every year hence.The installation of Netaji’s statue is not merely all about nationalistic pride, it is also a message to the world as India stands up to pay respects to a revolutionary leader who was with the losing side in World War II. According to officials, the decision to install Netaji's statue was not taken in the spur of the moment by Prime Minister Modi but through intensive deliberations with the culture ministry and those manning historical archives. According to a former foreign secretary, Netaji’s statue is also an assertion of India which will henceforth not be judged by yardsticks of western/chopsticks culture, or specifications.

23-01-2022||India||Congress urges Thackeray to ban ‘Why I killed Gandhi’ movie, AICWA writes to PM Modi||Congress will request Maharashtra chief minister Uddav Thackeray to ban a movie titled ‘Why I killed Gandhi’, the party’s state unit chief Nana Patole said on Sunday. The movie has triggered huge controversy since it is based on the statement submitted by Mahatma Gandhi’s killer, Nathuram Godse, to the special court explaining his reason behind assassinating Gandhi.Nana Patole said it is unacceptable if Mahatma Gandhi’s murderer is portrayed as a hero, reported news agency ANI. Highlighting India’s global image, Patole noted the country is known through Gandhi and his ideology of non-violence. He said the Congress party will oppose the movie’s release and will request the chief minister to impose a ban on it in Maharashtra.All India Cine Workers Association (AICWA) has, meanwhile, written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding a complete ban on the movie saying the film glorifies “Nathuram Godse the traitor and killer of the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi.”“Gandhiji is someone who is admired by entire INDIA and the world, Gandhiji's Ideology is a symbol of Love and Sacrifice for each and every Indian," the letter read."Nathuram Godse…doesn't deserve an inch of respect by anyone in this country, the actor who played the role of Nathuram Godse…is a sitting MP in Lok Sabha and is under the oath of Indian Constitution, if this movie releases the entire nation will be shocked and devastated by the display of the heinous crime which occurred on January 30, 1948," it further stated.The movie 'Why I killed Gandhi' is set to release on Limelight OTT on January 30, Gandhi's death anniversary, which is observed as Martyrs Day.Nationalist Congress Party MP Amol Kolhe, a leading Marathi actor who has played Godse in the movie, is facing criticism from a senior party colleague and also political opponents over the role. Kolhe, however, asserted he is a "firm believer" in Gandhian thoughts and maintained he took up the controversial role only to challenge himself as an artist. The actor-politician said he does not support the ideology of Godse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-urges-thackeray-to-ban-why-i-killed-gandhi-movie-aicwa-writes-to-pm-modi-101642918914327.html

Please send all other agencies like income tax, CBI, Delhi Police etc. We have all been raided before. 21 MLAs have been arrested in past.

He was allegedly abducted by the PLA on earlier this week. The district authorities said that Taron, along with a few others, was hunting in the bordering region between two countries when the incident took place.The Army contacted the PLA as soon as it received the information about the missing boy.A similar incident took place in September 2020 when the PLA had abducted five youths from Arunachal Pradesh's Upper Subansiri district and released them after about a week. The latest episode happened at a time when India and China are engaged in a nearly two-year-long standoff in eastern Ladakh.Notably, India shares a 3,400 km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh.So far, officials from both sides have held 14 rounds of military-level talks, but no resolution has been found.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/missing-boy-from-arunachal-found-china-s-pla-informs-army-101642918542347.html
23-01-2022||India||VIMSAR principal’s office properties attached over unpaid dues of retrenched staff||The official car of the principal of a leading government medical college and hospital in western Odisha, and two buses, numerous furniture, several computers and computer peripherals belonging to the college were attached by officials of a court on Saturday after a civil court ordered for its auction to pay wages amounting to ₹80 lakh to three of the 27 contractual employees who were laid off in 2007. Swetambar Purohit, the lawyer for the three entrenched contractual employees of Veer Surendra Sai Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (VIMSAR) in Burla, said the order of a civil court in Sonepur district for sealing of movable properties of the principal’s office was executed by the staff of senior judge, civil division, Sambalpur. “Armed with the orders of the civil judge senior division of Sonepur that passed the order for attachment of movable properties listed by the contractual employees for auction, the staff of the local court sealed the official car of the principal, two buses of the college, two pairs of table and chair, two sofa sets, 16 computers, 6 wooden tables, a glass table, 41 steel almirahs, 20 wooden almirahs, 7 printers and three xerox machines. It took more than 11 years to get justice for the three workers,” said Purohit. “Once these properties are auctioned off, the money accrued from them would be paid to the three employees who had moved court”. The authorities of Veer Surendra Sai Institute of Medical Sciences and Research in September 2007 removed 27 contractual employees from services without any notice. Three of them - a gatekeeper, an attendant and a sweeper - first moved the State Administrative Tribunal against the dismissal. Though the tribunal ordered for their reinstatement, the medical college and hospital authorities did not act following which the retrenched employees moved a labour court under Industrial Disputes Act. Though the hospital authorities contended that they did not come under ID Act, the labour court in 2016 asked them to pay the workers their arrear dues and reinstate them in their previous positions. When the VIMSAR authorities refused to act on the labour court orders, the three workers moved Orissa high court seeking execution of the labour court orders. The Orissa high court initially asked the workers to approach a civil court in Sambalpur for redressal of their grievances, but later allocated the case to the civil judge senior division in Sonepur district as several courts in western Odisha were on strike. The case lingered for 2-3 years in civil court in Sonepur till the Orissa high court asked them to dispose the cases quickly following which the warrant of attachment of movable property in execution of decree of money was acted upon. Court officials said once the movable properties are auctioned off, former gatekeeper-cum-electrician of VIMSAR, Khirod Kumar Sahoo will get ₹29.6 lakh as arrears from the proceeds. Rebati Kanta Kalet, who was a sweeper in 2007, would get ₹25.31 lakh while former attendant Sambhunath Sahu would get ₹25.46 lakh. “If the proceeds from the auctioned amount does not meet the cost, then another case regarding auction of immovable properties of VIMSAR authorities would be initiated,” said the lawyer of the former employees. He added that the remaining 24 employees who were retrenched can also seek judicial remedy by approaching the labour court as a precedence has been set by the three employees. However, legal cell officer of VIMSAR, Ashok Panigrahi said he welcomed the court order, but sealing the office at this juncture will affect Covid management with more than 20 doctors testing positive. “Our case is sub judice in the high court and it will be heard soon,” he said. The principal of VIMSAR, Dr Jayashree Dora refused to comment on the sealing of her office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vimsar-principal-s-office-properties-attached-over-unpaid-dues-of-retrenched-staff-101642918437130.html

23-01-2022||India||11 killed, 30 injured in two separate road mishaps in Odisha||BHUBANESWAR: At least 11 persons were killed and more than 30 injured in two separate road mishaps in Odisha on Saturday after a coal-laden truck hit a bus from its rear while a SUV carrying members of a bridegroom’s party rammed into a truck. In the first incident, six persons including a one-year-old girl and her parents were killed when the bus they were travelling from Manitri in Mayurbhanj district to Bhubaneswar was hit by a coal-laden truck on National Highway 16 at Soro on Saturday afternoon. The bus, ‘Shantilata’, was on its way to Bhubaneswar from Udala. At 1.10 pm, it stopped near Bidu Chhak on NH-16 to board passengers when a coal truck rammed it from behind. The impact was so severe, both the bus and the truck fell off the road and landed in a ditch by the highway. “While three persons died on the spot, three others died while undergoing treatment. Health conditions of six others are stated to be critical,” said Dilip Choudhury, owner of the bus. At least a dozen more passengers in the bus were injured while the driver and helper of the truck are said to be critical. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik announced compensation of ₹2 lakh each to the kin of the deceased. He also directed officials to ensure that the injured get the best medical treatment. Earlier in the day, five of a bridegroom’s party including a father-daughter duo were killed and five others seriously injured when the SUV they were travelling back to their home collided head on with a truck on a bridge over Mahanadi River in Sonepur district late Friday night. Sonepur SP Sitaram Satpathy said 10 people from Nimna and Panchmahala village under Ullunda block of Sonepur district were returning after attending a marriage function at Kaudiamunda village when the Bolero jeep they were in ran into the truck over the Mahanadi bridge at around 1 am.

Five others were rescued from the badly mangled vehicle by police and other rescue teams with the help of gas cutters. Fatalities rate in road accidents in Odisha is 33.33% higher than the national average. While 48 die in every 100 road accidents in Odisha, the national average is 36. There has been steady increase in number of fatalities from 2014 (3,931) to 2020(4,738), an increase of about 21%. As per State Road Safety Council officials, over-speeding contributed to 69 per cent of the deaths followed by violation of helmet law (41 per cent) and hit and run cases (20 per cent). The SC has recently pulled up the State government for not adopting a focused approach for preventing fatalities by enforcing stringent measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/11-killed-30-injured-in-two-separate-road-mishaps-in-odisha-101642909378474.html

23-01-2022||India||Is Omicron ‘subvariant’ more virulent? Concerns over BA.2 as India reports 530 samples to GISAID||British health authorities have identified hundreds of cases of the latest version of the Omicron variant, dubbed BA.2, amid concerns over its transmissibility. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) designated the Omicron variant sub-lineage as a variant under investigation due to increasing numbers of BA.2 sequences both domestically and internationally.Britain has so far confirmed 426 cases of Omicron BA.2 by conducting Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS), the earliest case reported on December 6, 2021. With 146 confirmed cases of BA-2. London has reported the highest number of Omicron subvariant in the UK, followed by the South East (97).While there is still uncertainty around the significance of the changes to the viral genome, early analyses, according to UKHSA, suggest an increased growth rate compared to the original Omicron lineage BA.1.“[H]owever, growth rates have a low level of certainty early in the emergence of a variant and further analysis is needed,” the health agency added.A total of 40 countries have reported 8,040 sequences of Omicron sublineage to GISAID, a primary source that provides open access to genomic data of influenza viruses and the coronavirus. The first sequences were submitted from the Philippines. With 6,411 sequences, most samples of BA-.2, so far, have been uploaded from Denmark. India has reported 530 samples of Omicron subvariant, followed by Sweden with 181 and Singapore with 127.‘Stealth Omicron’: All you need to know about fast-spreading sub-strainIs it more virulent?Dr Meera Chand, Covid-19 Incident Director at UKHSA, said the nature of viruses is to evolve and mutate so the emergence of new variants is expected as the pandemic goes on.“So far, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether BA.2 causes more severe illness than Omicron BA.1, but data is limited and UKHSA continues to investigate,” Chand said.French epidemiologist Antoine Flahault expressed surprise over the rapidity with which the sub-variant of Omicron has taken hold in Denmark, reported AFP."(France) expected a spike in contaminations in mid-January: It didn't happen and perhaps that is due to this sub-variant, which seems very transmissible but not more virulent" than BA.1, he said, stressing that countries have to be alert to the latest development as scientists ramp up surveillance.Citing early observations from India and Denmark, Tom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College, London, said that there is no dramatic difference in severity compared to BA.1.In a series of tweets, he stressed that "we do not currently have a strong handle on ... how much more transmissibility BA.2 might have over BA.1. However, we can make some guesses/early observations."He added that the latest variant should not call into question the effectiveness of existing vaccines.

23-01-2022||India||Administer vaccine doses three months after Covid-19 recovery: Centre to states||The health ministry has asked states to delay vaccine doses, including booster shots, by three months for people who have recently suffered a coronavirus infection.“Please note that: in case of individuals having lab test proven Sars-2 Covid-19 illness, all Covid vaccination including precaution dose to be deferred by three months after recovery,” additional health secretary Vikas Sheel said in a letter to the states on Friday.“I request you to kindly direct the concerned officials to take note and also ensure effective dissemination of the information to service providers as well as the general public through all forms of media,” the letter added.Covid-19 vaccination of children aged 15 to 18 years started from January 3, and administration of the booster dose for health and front-line workers, and people aged 60 years and above with comorbidities started from January 10 under the national Covid vaccination programme. India calls the third shot a “precaution dose”. The prioritisation and sequencing of booster doses is based on the completion of nine months (39 weeks) from the date of administration of the second dose, according to health ministry guidelines.In several countries administering booster doses, the gap is six months, which science has shown is the time when antibodies generated by the vaccine start decreasing. To be sure, immunity is a complex mechanism and driven by more then just antibodies. Science also says people can get vaccinated soon after they recover from a Covid infection, although many countries do prescribe a gap.Sheel said the letter was written because several states and UTs them wanted guidance on how to go about vaccinating either those with an active illness, or those who have recently recovered. In a briefing on Thursday, health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said that the guidelines are clear -- the vaccine is to be administered three months after recovery.“Our guidelines clearly state that three months after recovering from Covid infection, an individual can take his or her second or precaution dose. This is based on current evidence, and will be changed if there is enough scientific evidence to suggest a change. Our expert panel, NTAGI, is closely looking into it, and regularly deliberating over it,” he said. NTAGI is short for National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation in India.The health ministry’s directive of maintaining a gap of three months post recovery is based on the recommendations made by the same expert panel.

Banerjee said it goes against the “foundation of our federal policy and the basic structure of Constitutional scheme”. Earlier, Banerjee had written to the Prime Minister on January 13, urging him to not go ahead with the proposal.In his letter, Soren also said the move is likely to further strain the already stressed Centre-state relations. “It has immense potential to be misused for harassment of officers and vendetta politics against the state government.”“If the objective is to meet the shortage of officers, it is not a desirable move because the state government exclusively get the services of only three category of officers i.e. IAS, IPS & IFS whereas the Government of India gets a huge pool of officers from a poool of more than 30-odd other All India Services for which the UPSC males recommendations without fail. The shortage in ministries could be easily met from this pool of officers,” Soren said.The CM reiterated that Jharkhand currently has only 140 IAS officers (65%) working in the state against the sanctioned strength of 215, while 95 IPS officers (64%) are working the affairs of Jharkhand against the sanctioned strength of 149.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bury-proposed-amendments-to-ias-cadre-rules-jharkhand-cm-to-pm-modi-101642877684266.html
23-01-2022||India||How an Irish soldier’s dream pioneered India’s gold rush||When Tesla Motors decided to set up an office in India, the location selected was on Bengaluru’s Lavelle Road. Tesla, a pioneer in its own right, setting up its office on Lavelle Road was poetic as the road is named after another pioneer — Michael Fitzgerald Lavelle — the man considered as father of India’s gold rush. Lavelle, a retired Irish soldier from the British Army, wanted to make the second chapter of his life worthwhile. Little did he know, his quest will lead to the discovery of world’s second deepest goldmine — Kolar Gold Fields (KGF).In 1871, Lavelle came across a four-page article from the 1804 Asiatic Journal. The article was based on a report by Lt John Warren, who was serving His Majesty’s 33rd Regiment of Foot.As per the report, in 1799, after Tipu Sultan was defeated in the battle of Srirangapatanam, a deal was struck to hand over all the land seized from Tipu’s empire to the Mysuru princely state. Prior to this handover, a survey of the lands was ordered, and Lt Warren was a part of the team. As he was heading for the survey, he began hearing rumours about presence of gold in Kolar. Villagers turning up with bullock carts filled with mud and later washing it to isolate gold dust intrigued the officer, following which he ordered an investigation. The probe found that for every 120 lbs or 56 kg of earth, one grain of gold could be extracted using the villagers’ crude methods and with the help of professionals. Excited about the 67-year-old report, Lavelle left for Kolar to try his luck. “During his stay at New Zealand, he got acquainted with the gold mining process there,” said S Srikumar, author of Kolar Gold Field: Unfolding the Untold. “He visited the present KGF area in 1871 to do some preliminary investigations and successfully prospected certain locations, but kept the results a secret,” he added. In 1873, he wrote to the Maharaja’s government seeking a licence to mine. “Should I be successful in my search, it will be of greatest value to the government; in case I fail, it will cost the government nothing as the only assistance I require is the right to mine…” he wrote in the letter to the chief commissioner Mysore and Coorg. After securing a 20-year lease to mine in the Kolar, on 2 February 1875, Lavelle started the era of modern mining in India. Over the years he began running out of funds while conducting the gold mining operations. However, a novel written on Lavelle’s ventures came to his rescue. His vision of creating fields of gold had become the premise of the novel – Living Dangerously by FE Penny. Owing to the novel’s popularity in 1877, one Maj Gen Beresford of the Madras Staff Corps in Bangalore came to support Lavelle’s business. He along with three others – McKenzie, Sir William and Col William Arbuthnot – formed a syndicate with several other army officers called ‘The Colar Concessionaries Company Limited’, which took over the mining operations. The syndicate roped in a company that brought state-of-the-art mining engineering to India. The arrival of these engineers from Norwich, England started the golden era of KGF. Following this, Lavelle retired from mining and returned to Bengaluru.His successful expedition and the resultant prosperity made him a popular figure in the Bengaluru English circuit and the British Commandant renamed the street where he lived as Lavelle Road. He was rewarded with a grant of seven acres between Grant Road (now Vittal Mallya Road) and Lavelle Road. Lavelle built a bungalow over two acres on Grant Road. The property was called Oorgaum House in memory of Lavelle’s village where he had started the first mining expedition. In 1918, Lavelle left for England and sold this building to Peter George D’Souza, a high-ranking civil servant in the provincial government of Mysore. Even though the building made way for apartments over the years, Lavelle’s name remained the one constant. 
23-01-2022||India||18-year-old UP resident quizzed over hate chat on Clubhouse||Delhi Police have identified an 18-year-old man from Lucknow for allegedly creating the audio chat room on Clubhouse where participants were last week heard making offensive and derogatory comments against Muslim women, leading to a public outcry, officers aware of the matter on Saturday said.The suspect was identified as Rahul Kapoor, who joined the group using the ID “Bismillah” (in the name of God). Police said Kapoor, who joined the investigation in Delhi on Saturday afternoon, revealed the identity of the other five participants after which they too joined the investigation. The statements were recorded. Police have also seized their cell phones and other documents connected to the case.“We sent a team to Lucknow after identifying Kapoor as one of the participants. He is a first-year student. He created an ID by the name of Bismillah. He then created the chat room on the instructions of a person called Sallos. He handed the moderator keys to Sallos,” said KPS Malhotra, chief of the Intelligence Fusion Strategic Operation (IFSO) unit, which is Delhi’s Police’s cyber cell.Police said that Kapoor’s father works as an accountant at Lucknow’s Army Public School.Delhi Police on January 18 registered an FIR (first information report) against unknown persons in the case related to an offensive chat on Clubhouse, an audio based social media network. A portion of the conversation, which was shared across social media platforms, showed the participants making offensive and derogatory comments about Muslim women.Though HT could not independently verify the authenticity of the two-minute-twenty-second clip, the screen showed there were 70 to 80 participants in the chat room at the time, including users going by the names Sallos, Bismillah, Kira, Aanchal, Roma, Harsh, Jerry, Kavya, Mank and K.DCP Malhotra said the five other participants too have joined investigation. “Sallos is a class 12 student. He is 17 years old. He had initially created an account in Clubhouse by the name of Alcoholic Singh and later changed it to Sallos. Anchal Anand, a resident of Kerala is another participant. She had participated in a chat with another user Roma. But in the said chat Anchal had passed general remarks. Her phone and notepad have been seized. Roma Makkar is a resident of Nizamuddin. She is a yoga coach. She has admitted that the voice in the video is hers but said that she was there before the offensive comments were made.”Police identified participant Kira (mentioned above) as Naumaan Jabber, a resident of Jodhpur. Police said Naumaan had shared the details of his account with Akash Suyal(arrested by Mumbai police). “There is also a first year B Com student Harsh Pal of Dehradun. We have seized his phone and laptop too. He claimed that he was there in the chatroom for 10 minutes but did not take part in the chat. Rahul has already told us that the person behind user name Sallos is a 17-year-old, whom he knew virtually. Sallos spoke filthy in the chat and then left the group that day. His phone has also been seized.”On Friday, Mumbai Police’s cyber cell arrested three people from Haryana over the same case. Police said the three also participated in the controversial conversation. Mumbai Police registered an FIR in the case on January 19. The Mumbai police and Delhi Police are conducting separate probes.Of the three arrested by Mumbai Police, B.Com student Jaishnav Kakkar, 21 and law student Yash Parashar, 22, are from Faridabad, and Akash Suyal, 19, is a Class 12 student from Karnal.Explaining why Delhi police are yet to arrest any of the six suspects, DCP Malhotra said, “The controversy erupted over a video of the chat discussion on Clubhouse. Before proceeding, we want to ascertain the authenticity of the video recording. We want to build a water-tight case. We have to rule on any voice modulation in the video so that the case does not get affected during trial. The only evidence in the case so far is the first source who recorded a video of the audio conversation. That is the only evidence of the vulgar remarks. Club house also does not record the audio conversation.”This is third such case in the last eight months where offensive photographs or messages have been posted to target Muslim women on social media. The first was the “Sulli Deals” app (named after an offensive and derogatory term to describe Muslim women), on GitHub in July. The second one was the Bulli Bai app that also surfaced earlier on GitHub earlier this month. Both the apps featured doctored photographs of Muslim women and attempted to “auction” the women.Police in Delhi and Mumbai have so far arrested five people for creating the two apps. Police have maintained that two alleged app developers, Neeraj Bishnoi, a B.Tech student, and Aumkareshwar Thakur, a freelance web developer, were “self-radicalised”.In the latest case, the audio clips where participants made offensive comments towards Muslim women were shared on Monday (January 17). The clips were widely circulated, leading to a public outcry. While Delhi Police filed its case suo motu (on its own), the case in Mumbai was filed on the complaint of a woman who.Clubhouse, developed in the US, is an audio-only social media platform where participants can communicate with each other by creating specific groups. The firm told HT that it immediately suspended the accounts after they came to know about the chat room.The officials of Clubhouse, in their interactions with the media, have said that there are at least 2 million active users of the audio chat app in India.“Clubhouse is a place for people around the world to spend time with friends, meet others, engage in discussion and learn. There is absolutely no place for hate or abuse on the platform. We invest significantly in keeping our community safe and take swift action at any violation of our policies. There are hundreds of thousands of rooms created daily, the vast majority without incident. If and when a violation of our Community Guidelines is reported and confirmed, swift action is taken i.e. suspended or permanently removed from the platform, depending on the severity of the incident. In this instance, the room was reported and those involved in organizing were quickly actioned. As always, we can’t predict what humans will say but we can respond quickly once they violate our guidelines,” said a Clubhouse spokesperson, who refused to be identified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/18yearold-up-resident-quizzed-over-hate-chat-on-clubhouse-101642876963944.html
23-01-2022||India||Abide With Me hymn missing from Beating Retreat lineup||Abide With Me, a decades-old staple tune at the Beating Retreat ceremony and said to be a favourite of Mahatma Gandhi, does not figure in the lineup announced by the government on Saturday for the January 29 musical extravaganza that will feature a raft of military bands marking the end of Republic Day celebrations.The Christian hymn, composed by Henry Francis Lyte in 1847, finds no mention in an Indian Army hand out released on Saturday with details of the ceremony, staged on the eve of Gandhi’s death anniversary.This is the first time the hymn will be dropped. There were plans to not feature it in the ceremony in 2020, although it was restored at the last minute after reports of it being left out led to a controversy.“Soldiers relate to Abide With Me as it has been a part of our military culture. The tradition should continue,” said former director general of military operations Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia.A defence ministry spokesperson did not comment on why the composition has been omitted in the 75th year of India’s Independence, a move that could trigger a fresh political row on the back of the eternal flame controversy.The eternal flame, Amar Jawan Jyoti, at India Gate was extinguished on Friday after 50 years and merged with the flame at the adjacent National War Memorial (NWM), amid political finger pointing over the move aimed at creating a single site for paying homage to India’s fallen heroes and conducting all ceremonial functions.Beating Retreat has traditionally ended with Abide With Me. This year, military buglers will play the iconic patriotic song Sare Jahan Se Acha in the end. The other popular tunes that will be played at the ceremony include Kadam Kadam Badhaye Ja, Ae Mere Watan Ke Logon and Hind Ki Sena.Beating Retreat will feature bands from the Indian Army, Indian Air Force, Indian Navy and Central Armed Police Forces, apart from buglers and pipes and drums bands. The ceremony involves the lowering the flags against the backdrop of the setting sun and a simultaneous lighting up of the Rashtrapati Bhawan, South Block, North Block and Parliament House.A new show with 1,000 drones is expected to add sparkle to Beating Retreat. It is being organised by a startup, Botlab Dynamics, supported by Indian Institute of Technology Delhi and the department of science and technology. Only the US, Russia and China have the capability for a show with 1,000 drones, officials have said.The government on Saturday also released the schedule of the 73rd Republic Day Parade, India’s biggest ceremonial event that is being conducted in the shadow of the third Covid-19 wave and will be witnessed by fewer spectators at Rajpath.The Indian Army’s participation in the 90-minute parade will include a mounted column of 61 Cavalry (one of the world’s last remaining horse-mounted cavalry regiments), 14 mechanised columns and six marching contingents, apart from Param Vir Chakra and Ashoka Chakra awardees.The parade will begin at 10.30am, instead of the traditional timing of 10am, for better visibility to the parade and the fly past. The fly past, consisting of 75 aircraft in India’s 75th year of Independence, will feature flying formations to commemorate some glorious moments of India’s decisive victory over Pakistan in the 1971 war, including the historic Tangail airdrop and the Meghna heli-borne operation.Vintage army equipment to be showcased during the parade includes the Centurion tank that took part in the 1971 India-Pakistan war, OT-62 Topas armoured personnel carrier and the 75/24 Indian field gun, alongside modern tanks, infantry combat vehicles and artillery guns.The blend of old and new equipment seeks to demonstrate the army’s evolution over the years, as was done during the Army Day parade on January 15. The Republic Day parade will feature a total of 16 marching contingents, including those from the IAF, navy and paramilitary forces, and 25 tableaux of various states, government departments and the armed forces.The Indian Navy’s tableau will depict the naval uprising of 1946, which contributed to India’s struggle for independence, said Lieutenant Mayank Bhagour. It will also feature models of the indigenous aircraft carrier Vikrant, the light combat aircraft and some warships.Before the parade starts, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will lead the country in paying homage to India’s fallen braves at NWM, a monument dedicated to soldiers who fell in post-Independence wars and operations. The memorial was inaugurated by Modi almost three years ago, on February 25, 2019. As on date, the names of 26,466 brave warriors are inscribed on the memorial, including the ones who fell in the 1971 war.The spectator count at the parade will be massively curtailed this year due to Covid-related restrictions, with only 5,000 to 8,000 people to be allowed entry to Rajpath to witness the display of the country’s military might and cultural heritage.Only fully vaccinated adults and single vaccinated children of age 15 and above will be allowed entry.The January 26 parade was attended by around 25,000 spectators amid the ebbing first wave last year, compared to around 125,000 people who would usually showed up at Rajpath to watch the event in the pre-pandemic era.
23-01-2022||India||Kashi Vishwanath corridor to feature in Uttar Pradesh’s Republic Day tableau||Uttar Pradesh’s tableau at the Republic Day parade will showcase the cultural revitalization of the Kashi Vishwanath corridor in Varanasi and the state’s one district, one product scheme. Last year, UP’s tableau was on the Ram Temple being built in Ayodhya.“The UP tableau’s theme was approved by the tableau committee in New Delhi,” a state government official said on condition of anonymity. “This time it’s a dual theme – Kashi Vishwanath Corridor and ODOP. The tableau is being constructed in Delhi ahead of the Republic Day parade.”ODOP is the state government’s flagship scheme to promote traditional, signature crafts and products specific to particular districts, such as brass work of Moradabad, woodcraft of Saharanpur and carpets of Bhadohi.The Kashi Vishwanath corridor, inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 13, has been redeveloped and beatified at a cost of over ₹700 crore. It comprises 24 buildings, including the Kashi Vishwanath temple complex, tourist facility centre, auditorium, cafeteria, virtual gallery, Vedic library, Kashi museum, communal kitchen, and seven gates.Last year, the UP tableau featured the grandeur of the Ram temple being built in Ayodhya, the temple town’s culture and Ayodhya as a symbol of social and religious harmony. The tableau had showcased Ayodhya as a major religious tourism destination in India and featured a model of the temple, scenes from Ramayan and the new tradition of annual Deepotsav.The proposed tableaux of the opposition-ruled states of West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Odisha have been rejected, sparking controversy.
23-01-2022||India||Plea in SC seeks protection for Hindus against hate speeches||A Hindu organization has approached the Supreme Court demanding equal protection for Hindus against hate speeches made by Muslim leaders in the past.In an application seeking intervention in a petition where the court has sought response from Uttarakhand, the central government and Delhi police against hate speeches by Hindu religious leaders at a religious gathering in Haridwar and Delhi, the Hindu Front for Justice produced a list of hate speeches by Muslim leaders and clerics, some of which supposedly called for genocide against Hindus, against which no action was taken.“Every citizen of India is equally entitled to equal protection of the laws and therefore, the concept of majority or minority must not be introduced while analysing incidents of hate speech,” said the application filed by advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain.Seeking judicial review on what constitutes hate speech, the application by the organization and two of its members said, “Hate speech is given by individuals with an intention to cause unrest in society, provoke violence and communal tension. A speech with an intention to protect the members of a particular community with theme of self-defence cannot come within the ambit of hate speech.” To decide this issue, the applicants sought intervention in the proceedings pending before the top court.On January 12, a bench headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana had issued notice on a petition filed by senior advocate Anjana Prakash and journalist Qurban Ali demanding action against the participants of a religious congregation held in December at Haridwar, where calls were made for violence against Muslims. The petition also produced contents of another hate speech made at an event in Delhi organized by the Hindu Yuva Vahini and informed the court that similar events were planned in the coming months as well. The matter has not come up for hearing since.As a counterblast, the application by the Hindu Front for Justice highlighted speeches made by All India Majlis-e-Ittihadul Muslimeen leaders Akbaruddin Owaisi and Waris Pathan, who made speeches in 2013 insulting Hindu gods and goddess, and supposedly said, “We (Muslims) are 25 crore and you (Hindus) are 100 crores. Remove the police for 15 minutes and see the result.”The application produced video links and news clippings showing instances of hate speech by Muslim clerics. An Islamic cleric from West Bengal was shown in videos threatening to kill lakhs if Rohingyas were deported. No action has been taken against such provocative hate speech, the applicants said.“The provocative speeches delivered by Muslim leaders have created an atmosphere of fear and unrest in Hindu community. Such statements remind us the working of Muslim League, which resulted in the partition of the country,” the plea stated.The application sought the court’s intervention to prevent Muslim leaders from spreading hatred and violence against Hindus. “In view of the historical facts prevailing in the world and particularly for last more than 1,200 years in India, after independence, the Hindus are bound to take an exception of the hate speeches given by some members of Muslim community and they are fearful that a section of society is working for “Gajwa-e-Hind,” which means to Islamize the entire country,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-in-sc-seeks-protection-for-hindus-against-hate-speeches-101642876663923.html
23-01-2022||India||Dissent in Bengal BJP spreads to districts where it performed best in polls; rejig stalled||Dissent in the West Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) against appointment of many new leaders and removal of some old-timers during the recent organizational changes has spread to some of the districts where the party recorded its best performance in recent years. Rattled by the development, state leaders have been compelled to put the formation of state and district-level committees on hold although BJP national general secretary (organization) B L Santhosh wanted the process to be completed by mid-January said some of the office-bearers. “Dissidence has now emerged even in Purulia and Bankura districts where the BJP did well in the panchayat, Lok Sabha and assembly polls in 2015, 2019 and 2021 respectively. The central leadership in Delhi has been informed about the rumblings but no line of action could be charted till Friday night,” a top state BJP leader told HT on condition of anonymity. The rumblings started soon after December 22 when the Bengal unit announced the names of 11 new vice-presidents, five general secretaries, 42 organizational district unit presidents, 12 state secretaries, the morcha (front) presidents and the heads of several cells. The rejig made not just some veterans, who were left out, unhappy but also left leaders from the Dalit Matua community, headed by Union minister of state Shantanu Thakur, grumbling. Following some protests, Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar dissolved the cells and departments on January 13 but that did not change the scenario. Bengal’s tribal population stood at 5.29 million during the 2011 census, accounting for about 5.8% of the total population. In sharp contrast, the SC population, according to the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment, stood at 21.4 million, or 23.51 % of the total population of 91.3 million, which is now projected to be 101.9 million. The highest concentration of the tribal population is found in the districts of Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar, South Dinajpur, West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia. The scheduled tribe (ST) population has 16 assembly seats reserved for it. For the much bigger scheduled caste (SC) population, which is spread across Bengal, 68 assembly seats, out of the state’s 294, are reserved. Analysts and political leaders maintain that without the support of the SC and ST communities the BJP could not have set the record of winning 18 of Bengal’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019 and 77 assembly seats last year. In Bankura district, the BJP won both Lok Sabha seats in 2019 and seven of the 12 assembly seats in 2021. Amarnath Shakha, the BJP legislator from Onda in Bankura and Nirmal Dhara the lawmaker from Indus, left all WhatsApp groups of the BJP in December along with four other legislators after two new organizational district presidents were appointed. On Thursday, Shakha and Dhara wrote to the Union home ministry requesting recall of their security cover provided by the Centre. “I made the request for personal reasons,” said Shakha, claiming that he was not leaving the BJP to join another party. Even as Dhara made a similar claim, state BJP leaders said the two legislators, along with two others from Bankura district, Niladri Sekhar Dana and Dibakar Gharami, had shot an email to BJP national president J P Nadda seeking removal of the Bankura and Sonamukhi organizational district unit presidents, Sunil Rudra Mondal and Billeswar Singha, who are young leaders. In the adjoining Purulia district, the BJP controls all three Lok Sabha segments and six of the nine assembly constituencies. One of the MPs, Dr Subhas Sarkar, was made a Union minister of state last year. Five BJP legislators from Purulia have written a similar mail to Nadda demanding removal of the new district unit president Vivek Ranga, reportedly calling him an outsider. State BJP leaders said the unhappy legislators include Narahari Mahato, Kamala Kanta Hansda and Sudip Mukherjee. None of them commented on the mail. In West Midnapore district, where the BJP’s national vice-president and former state president Dilip Ghosh represents the Midnapore Lok Sabha seat, a Yuva Morcha (youth front) leader joined the Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Wednesday along with his followers. In Birbhum district, where the BJP could wrest only one of the 11 assembly seats last year, several leaders have left the party’s WhatsApp groups. “These are rumours. There is no rebellion here,” said Anup Saha, Birbum’s sole BJP legislator from Dubrajpur and a newly-selected national vice-president. A state BJP leader said that Sheikh Shamad, the BJP’s minority cell leader in Birbhum, a district with 37.06 % Muslim population according to the 2011 census, left the party last week. “There is unhappiness among Muslim workers and leaders in Jalpaiguri district in north Bengal and at Baruipur in South 24 Parganas district in south Bengal. The party had to put in a lot of effort to get them on board,” said the state leader, requesting anonymity. “I am not aware of the two letters reportedly sent to the central leadership from Purulia and Bankura. These are internal matters of the party and will be settled internally,” Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya told HT. These developments took place days after union minister of state and Dalit Matua leader Shantanu Thakur on Monday organized a picnic with his followers and a section of disgruntled BJP leaders who were removed from the state committee. Thakur and his brother Subrata, the legislator from Gaighata in North 24 Parganas district, said implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is the principal demand of the Matuas and they will discuss it with BJP central leaders and Union home minister Amit Shah. The Matuas are a part of the large Hindu Namasudra community that migrated from East Pakistan (Now Bangladesh) during India’s partition in 1947 and the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War to escape religious persecution. The Centre has said that it is in the process of framing laws for the CAA which the Parliament passed in 2020. The law offers citizenship to non-Muslims who entered India from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh before 2015. The TMC insists that the law is unconstitutional as it links citizenship to faith in a secular country. Shantanu Thakur and four legislators left all WhatsApp groups of the West Bengal BJP on January 4, saying the Matua community was not properly represented in the new committees. On January 15, Thakur demanded the removal of Bengal BJP general secretary (organization) Amitava Chakraborty without naming the latter. He said Chakraborty was responsible for the rejig and had brought in people of his choice. On January 17, huge posters, demanding Chakraborty’s removal, appeared around the Bengal BJP headquarters at Muralidhar Sen Lane in central Kolkata. In one poster, he was accused of being the agent of chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s election strategist Prashant Kishor. While Chakraborty avoided the media, Samik Bhattacharya said the former was above the bickering and was being unnecessarily dragged into a controversy. “Chakraborty sent a report to the central leadership after the posters appeared,” said a state BJP leader who did not want to be named. Amid speculation in political circles that some of the dissidents many eventually switch allegiance and join the ruling party, TMC leaders said the rumblings carry proof of the BJP’s organizational weakness. “Buoyed by the Lok Sabha results, the BJP thought it had built a massive organizational structure in Bengal. But this structure stood on a feeble foundation which is now crumbling. The BJP’s troubles started with the disgruntled old-timers and Matua leaders and has not spread to the districts. The party will collapse like a house of cards,” said TMC Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy. Though the BJP captured 77 seats in the assembly polls last year, its tally in the Bengal legislative assembly has now effectively come down to 70. Five BJP legislators have joined the TMC since June although none have resigned from the party yet. The ruling party also wrested the Santipur and Dinhata seats from the BJP in the by-polls that were held as the BJP’s winning candidates wanted to retain their Lok Sabha seats. The BJP had welcomed many TMC turncoats who could not win elections. Among them, Rajib Banerjee, a former minister, and Sabyasachi Dutta, the former mayor of Salt Lake, returned to the ruling party last year. Experts feel that the dissidence is the fallout of disillusionment. “Many BJP leaders had assumed that they would come in power in Bengal. The rumblings and dissent are an expression of their frustration,” said Kolkata-based political science professor Udayan Bandopadhyay. 
23-01-2022||India||Haryana’s tableau to showcase its golden boy Neeraj Chopra, other champions||Chandigarh: Haryana will celebrate its champion athletes when its tableau rolls past Rajpath this Republic Day, and a life-size image of India’s only track & field gold medallist, Neeraj Chopra, will be showcased as one of the centrepieces of the state’s sporting revolution.Chopra, the javelin thrower who won a historic gold at the Tokyo Olympics last year, is at the Chula Vista Training Center in San Diago, US for training. .Officials aware of the details of the state’s R-Day offering said that Chopra’s life replica will be the on the rear of the tableau, where the athlete will be seen in a famous posture -- hurling the javelin.Ten eminent elite athletes -- Olympic medal-winning wrestlers Bajrang Punia (bronze, 2020 Tokyo) and Yogeshwar Dutt (bronze, 2012 London); para athletes Sumit Antil ( gold, 2020 Tokyo) and Yogesh Kathuniya (silver, 2020 Tokyo), para archer Harvinder ( bronze, 2020 Tokyo), national women’s hockey captain Rani Rampal, former national women’s hockey captain Mamta Kharb, wrestler Deepak Punia (fourth, 2020 Tokyo), and para athletes Rampal and Ranjeet, who participated in 2020 Tokyo Games, will be on the tableau deck during the parade. Two wrestlers, Ashu (bronze medallist at the 2020 Asian Championships in 67kg Greco Roman) and Anil (who won gold in the 96kg Greco Roman at the 2010 CWG in New Delhi), will demonstrate a live wrestling bout on the deck aboard the tableau as it goes past the main stage. The tableau will also feature sporting disciplines in which athletes from Haryana are particularly proficient -- boxing, weightlifting, shooting, hockey, among others. Amit Agrawal, additional principal secretary to the chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, said since one distinct achievement of the state is highlighted on Republic Day, it was decided to highlight Haryana’s sporting glory on the back of India’s most successful Olympic Games. The national contingent returned with one gold, two silvers, and four bronze from Tokyo 2020 and five golds, eight silvers, and six bronze medals from the 2020 Tokyo Paralympics.“The tableau has to feature something special and unique, and so we decided to go with sport,” Agrawal said, adding that it was a matter of honour that sportspersons from Haryana, which has only 1.3% of the geographical area and 2.09% of the population of the country, have brought laurels for the country in several international competitions.Of the seven medals won by India at Tokyo Olympics, sportspersons from Haryana won four. Even before Tokyo, Haryana has been n the forefront of India’s sporting revolution. Four out of six Indians who won medals at 2012 London Olympics were from Haryana. The state also gave India two medallists at Beijing 2008 and one in Rio 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryanas-republic-day-tableau-to-showcase-its-golden-boy-neeraj-chopra-other-champions-101642876313350.html

They tried to book a room in a hotel, but were denied by at least 10. We later came to know that they were given a room at a local hotel in Khandwa, and approached the police to take action. We also called the family members of the woman as there was a possibility that the man had misguided her, but the police refused to take any action.”The police refused to take action against the couple, citing breach of privacy.“We inquired about the couple and they have come here according to their wish. The woman, who is pursuing an MBA from Bhopal, said she was not forced to come here and she doesn’t want any action. We didn’t call the parents because it would be a breach of privacy of the woman. I have asked Hindu Jagran Manch members to maintain their privacy and allow them to stay without any interference,” Kotwali police station in charge Baljeet Singh Bisen said.The police also did not file any charges against the right-wing group. “No action was taken against them as nobody filed any complaint.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ruckus-at-hotel-in-mp-over-stay-of-interfaith-couple-101642876311507.html

Although the fire was confined between the 19th and 20th floors, the entire building was engulfed in smoke, they said.“I opened the door at 7 am to collect milk that was delivered by the milkman. I saw the entire corridor of my floor filled with thick smoke that was coming out from the wire duct. We understood there must have been a fire. We woke up the remaining members and rushed out of the building,” said Nanda Chavan, a resident of the fourth floor.Chavan’s sister Shubhangi Salkhar, along with her husband Dilip and 10-year-old son Dhaval, is admitted at the Bhatia hospital. Chavan said her sister and her family reside in the 13th floor of the building.“After we came down, I started to look for my sister and her family members, but couldn’t find them,” she said. “After half an hour, we saw fire brigade personnel bringing them down.”Kamlakar Dalvi (64), a member of the managing committee of the building who stays on the fourth floor, said that the fire broke out around 7 am in the morning, when most residents were fast asleep.“The morning water comes between 7-8 am regularly, and I was going to check the water valve when I saw smoke and heard screams from our neighbours as well. We alerted the remaining flats on our floor and managed to get out of the building,” said Dalvi. “The fire brigade arrived around 7:30 am and started the rescue operation. As most of the members were sleeping, rescue operation became haphazard, as many of us had to go from door to door and alert the people.”A resident requesting anonymity said that the building was constructed in 2013, and between 2013 and 2016, there was an ongoing court case between the builder and some tenants who used to live on the plot earlier, another resident said, requesting anonymity. The building is a redevelopment project and the plot on which it is built used to be a slum, where Dalvi lived earlier.After the fire broke out, the residents took refuge inside the banquet hall of Matru Mandir society, adjacent to the Kamala building. Nearly 200 residents are staying inside the banquet hall at present and members of the Matru Mandir society have arranged basic civic amenities and food for the people. Also, many residents shifted to their neighbours’ and relatives’ places.“There were fire extinguishers in the building, but most of the residents didn’t know how to operate them, so we had to rush out,” said Dalvi. “Also, the fire safety alarm wasn’t working and we couldn’t hear any warming bell.”Another resident, Vijay Aperaj (61), said that after the fire broke out, the building went dark as the electricity was cut off.“All the electrical appliances stopped working and we opened the doors to check. We saw smoke coming out of the duct and also felt a burning smell,” said Aperaj. “We rushed out from the building immediately with all our family members. The interiors became suffocating.”There are two refuge floors inside the building, one on the eighth and the other on the fourteenth floor. However, Dalvi said the residents preferred to go downstairs instead of going to the refuge floors.There are 135 flats in the building, eight on each floor. Out of these, four are 315 sq ft and two are 225 and 250 sq ft each. The building is quite cramped and there is not much space between the flats.The building is located in a lane adjacent to Tardeo Road. The firefighting vehicles were parked at the entry point of the lane from where the water pipes were pulled inside and evacuation operation was carried out.A senior fire brigade official, present at the spot said that evenAlthough the exact cause of fire is yet to be ascertained, preliminary findings suggest there could have been a short-circuit inside the wire duct, a fire brigade official said.“The fire system was defunct and two flats have been severely damaged and there have been some serious loss of properties as well,” the official said, declining to be named. “The fire system in the building was defunct. Had it been working, the proportion of loss could have been lower.”Meanwhile, Gamdevi police has registered an accidental death report in connection with the incident.“We have registered an accidental death report in the matter, as six people have died and several others have been injured. We will write to all concerned departments like the fire brigade and BEST (Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport), and depending on their reports, decide on the further course of action,” said police inspector Rampyare Rajbhar of Gamdevi police station.“We are presently recording statements of the victims and eyewitnesses,” Rajbhar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/smoke-screams-surrounded-us-fire-survivors-recount-horror-101642876063977.html
23-01-2022||India||PM calls for doorstep delivery of services||District administrators must ensure doorstep delivery of services in every village through the Digital India mission by creating the necessary infrastructure, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday in a virtual interaction with district magistrates from different states and Union territories.The Prime Minister reviewed the central government’s aspirational districts programme, launched in January 2018 to quickly and effectively transform 112 most underdeveloped districts in the country. DMs must work on timebound targets to increase ease of living for the people, Modi said, asserting that India’s goal is to achieve 100% reach of its services and facilities.Modi spoke of the significant strides made in these regions over past few years.“During the last four years, Jan Dhan accounts have increased by 4-5 times in almost every aspirational district. Almost every family has got a toilet and electricity has reached every village,” Modi said. “For development in aspirational districts, a direct and emotional connect between the administration and the public is very important. An important aspect of this campaign is technology and innovation. Excellent results have been obtained by the use of technology and innovation in fields such as malnutrition, clean drinking water and vaccination in some districts.”The Prime Minister asked the DMs to identify priorities at the block level and set targets for timely delivery of projects, government programmes and services. He directed that detailed guidelines be developed for field visits, inspections and night halts for officials to ensure proper implementation and monitoring.He also emphasized the importance of integrating districts with the economic mainstream.“It should be a mission for you to get your district recognised at a national and global level,” Modi told the bureaucrats posted in various districts across the country. “For this, you all need to implement the mantra of vocal for local in your districts. You need to identify the traditional products and skills of your districts and strengthen the value chains.”The country is witnessing a silent revolution in the form of Digital India, Modi said.“No district should be left behind in this. Digital infrastructure should reach every village and it should become a means of doorstep delivery of services and facilities,” the Prime Minister said. “I urge NITI Aayog to devise a mechanism wherein all DMs can interact with each other on a regular basis to learn from each other and imbibe the best practises for their districts. Central ministries should also document the challenges faced by districts during this journey.”The virtual conference was also attended by the chief ministers of Gujarat, Karnataka, Assam, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.The aspirational districts programme leveraged competitive and cooperative federalism, driven by the Team India spirit, said Amitabh Kant, chief executive of NITI Aayog, the government’s think tank. “Best practises like smart classroom initiative from Banka, Bihar; Mission Aparajita to prevent child marriages from Koraput, Odisha, etc., were replicated by other districts as well,” he said.The government has now set a mission to uplift 142 selected districts on the lines of the focussed work done in the aspirational districts, said Nagendra Nath Sinha, secretary at the ministry of rural development.“The Centre and the states will work together to uplift these identified districts to address pockets of underdevelopment,” Sinha said. “15 sectors corresponding to 15 ministries and departments were identified. In the sectors, key performance indicators (KPIs) were identified. The aim of the government is to ensure the KPIs in the selected districts surpass the state average in the next one year, and that they come at par with the national average in two years.”“Each concerned ministry and department has identified its set of KPIs, on the basis of which districts were selected,” Sinha said. “The initiative is aimed at achieving saturation of various schemes by various departments in the districts in mission mode, in convergence with all stakeholders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-calls-for-doorstep-delivery-of-services-101642875889599.html
23-01-2022||India||Positivity rate, active cases drop in Capital||From around one in three people who were testing positive more than a week ago to fewer than one in six on Saturday, the test positivity rate as well as the hospitalisation rate in the Capital has continued to drop, offering yet more signs that the current Covid outbreak is now under control.The number of new cases, according to the health bulletin on Saturday, were 11,486, up 6.7% from Friday’s number – but taking into account the 17.7% higher number of tests, the new cases translate to a drop in positivity rate from 18.04% to 16.34%.In all, 2,504 people with Covid-19 were in hospitals across the city. This number hit a peak of 2,784 on January 17, and has consistently dropped since then. The beds occupied on Saturday represented a little over 16% of the capacity available in the city at present. Even at its peak, the number of new cases in the current wave posed no threat to the city’s health care infrastructure – at least 80% of the Covid-19 earmarked hospital beds were vacant throughout, with more surge capacity being available if needed.The city’s active cases on Saturday were down at 58,593, the lowest since January 8. This brings the hospitalisation rate as a share of active cases to a mere 4.2%.“We have averted the worst of this wave but we are still cautious and are keeping a close watch on the numbers. We have also slashed the testing costs so that people can come forward and get themselves tested easily now. Even as the numbers are now declining, we urge people to continue to wear masks and follow all Covid protocols,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain.An expert said the trends, including the high hospital vacancy rates, reinforce the conclusion that the situation is stable, and make the case for some restrictions to be rolled back.“The restrictions can be removed because it doesn’t help much, except for just creating a psychological consolation among people. The longer we impose the restrictions for, the longer it will take for the decline in cases,” Dr Jugal Kishore, head of department of community medicine at the Safdarjung Hospital said.Delhi on Saturday recorded 45 Covid deaths, the highest in the Omicron wave so far. While details of these particular fatalities were not available, audits of fatalities by the government and assessments by a major private hospital network showed most fatalities this month to have been in people who were either unvaccinated or suffered from significant comorbid conditions.The last time such a high death count was reported was on June 5, when the fatalities were 68.Experts pointed out that the trend was particularly encouraging because with the new testing guidelines the positivity rates are bound to be higher than past test programmes since the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) now advises tests to be targeted at those with symptoms.“The revised ICMR guidelines said that in a community setting testing should be done for people who are either symptomatic or have been exposed to a confirmed Covid case, especially people above 60-years and those with comorbid conditions. So, we are supposed to test people that are likely to test positive,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases department in Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).On Friday, Jain described the drop in numbers as a sign that the “the grave danger of the coronavirus has subsided in Delhi” and said more decisions would taken on lifting more restrictions shortly. The minister said his government had written to the Delhi Disaster Management Authority headed by the lieutenant governor, who rejected two of the three demands -- to roll back the weekend curfew and allow all shops in a market to open.Several states have rolled back curbs at similar levels of outbreak. Karnataka on Friday removed the weekend curfew after recording hospitalisation rate as a share of active cases of under 5%.Maharashtra, earlier in the week, too decided to roll back some curbs, including allowing schools to reopen.Schools in the Capital have been closed since late December.There is now a growing clamour for the government to allow some more businesses to open, especially over the weekends. “When there was a need for such restrictions, all traders and market associations welcomed the weekend lockdowns and odd-even restrictions for shops. Even this time, when the third wave began, we did not say no and implemented all DDMA orders. But I must say that we are stretching the restrictions too far now because the positivity rate is declining, and most people are vaccinated,” said Ashwani Marwah, general secretary, Traders Association Lajpat Nagar (TALN).“On January 15, when we were recording peak Covid infections, the positivity rate was 30.64%. Within a week, we have managed to bring down the positivity rate to half. This is also an indication that we were proactive in calling some curbs early, which also controlled the spread,” a senior health department official said, describing the trends as a big relief.A senior administration official indicated that some curbs -- night curfew, weekend curfew, and shops opening on an odd-even basis in markets -- may be rolled back next week after a meeting of the DDMA.(With Inputs from Sweta Goswami)
23-01-2022||India||Blaze in Mumbai high-rise: 6 killed, several battle for life||A major fire in a 20-storey building in south Mumbai early on Saturday left six people dead and 24 injured, including eight who are in critical condition, even as the Mumbai fire brigade took five hours to douse the blaze that broke out on, and was contained to, the 19th floor of the building in crowded Tardeo locality.Three of those dead — Hitesh Mistry, his sister, Moushmi and mother Meena Mistry — were residents of flat 1904, which is suspected to be the flat where the fire broke out. It was completely gutted in the blaze. Among the others who lost their life in the tragic incident included 75-year-old Manjuben Kantharia, who was a resident of the 19th floor, and Purushottam Chopdekar, a resident of the 16th floor. One of the deceased was yet to be identified as the body was charred beyond recognition. The civic body has conducted a DNA test to ascertain the identity of the person.Thirteen fire tenders and seven water tankers were deployed to douse the fire, which was first reported at 7.26am on Saturday. The city’s chief fire officer Hemant Parab said that the building’s fire safety system, including its sprinkler system and fire alarms, was not functioning and the fire department is investigating the cause of the fire.Municipal commissioner of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) Iqbal Singh Chahal on Saturday ordered an enquiry and directed the civic administration to submit its report within 15 days.This is the fourth such incident of such a magnitude in a Mumbai high-rise in as many months, prompting the BMC to direct the chief electrical inspector to carry out an electrical audit of all high-rise buildings with a height of 15m and above.Prime Minister Narendra Modi condoled the deaths and announced an ex gratia amount of ₹2 lakh to the families of the deceased and ₹50,000 to those injured. “Saddened by the building fire at Tardeo in Mumbai. Condolences to the bereaved families and prayers with the injured for the speedy recovery,” he tweeted.Mumbai suburban guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray, who visited the tragedy site on Saturday afternoon, accompanied by the Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar, announced an ex gratia amount of ₹5 lakh for the families of the deceased.Most of the 400 residents in the building were able to rush out soon after the fire broke out, even as thick smoke filled the passageways. Firemen told Hindustan Times that none of the residents congregated at the refuge areas located on the 8th and 15th floors. The smoke was able to descend rapidly due to a duct that ran down the building and opened on to each floor. In many floors, the shaft door of the duct was not properly sealed.At least 30 people rescued by the fire department were rushed to different hospitals. While 17 people were discharged after treatment, at least eight people are critically injured. The Kantharia family suspected that the unidentified deceased person could be their son, Kirit.Kamlakar Dalvi (64) had woken up to fill water, which is released by the municipal body between 7am and 8am every day, when he first heard the screams. When he opened the door of his fourth floor flat, he saw the passageway filled with thick smoke emerging from the duct door. Waking up his family, he rushed out along with other neighbours towards the ground floor.At 7.26am, the Mumbai Fire Brigade’s control room received a frantic call: a massive fire had broken out on the 19th floor of a high-rise in Tardeo, located in the cramped lanes of Nana Chowk in Mumbai Central area. By 7.42am, the blaze was declared a Level 3 fire and 13 fire engines as well as seven water tankers from 12 stations — the nearest three minutes away — rushed to the spot.The firemen had to enter the building wearing breathing equipment in order to douse the fire. To start with, the fire blazed on the 19th floor of the 20-storey building. The skyline surrounding the building is a warren of wires and accessing the window of the flat where the fire blazed would have been difficult.The building itself was located inside a lane whose width was only enough for one fire engine to enter at a time.CFO Hemant Parab said the building’s firefighting system was defunct. “The fire-fighting system inside the building was defunct. The sprinklers were not working and the extinguishers were outdated as well,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/blaze-in-mumbai-high-rise-6-killed-several-battle-for-life-101642875644109.html
23-01-2022||India||EC extends rally ban, but eases some curbs||As the country grapples with the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Election Commission of India on Saturday extended its ban on political rallies and road shows in the five election-bound states till January 31, while allowing exceptions for candidates contesting in the first two phases of the polls.The election watchdog has decided to relax some of the guidelines for candidates who will be contesting in the first phase on February 10 and the second phase on February 14, after consulting the Union health secretary, and chief secretaries, chief electoral officers and health secretaries of Goa, Manipur, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.Candidates in Uttar Pradesh, which will vote in the first phase, will now be allowed physical meetings in designated open spaces with a maximum of 500 people , but only from January 28 to February 8.“Since contesting candidates for Phase 1 elections will be finalised on January 27, 2022, Commission has decided to allow physical public meetings of political parties or contesting candidates in designated open spaces with a maximum of 500 persons or 50% of the capacity of the ground or the prescribed limit set by SDMA (state disaster management authority), whichever number is lesser, from January 28, 2022 till February 8, 2022 (excluding the silence period),” the commission said in a statement.Similar relaxations have been issued for the second phase of the polls, which will be held in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Goa on February 14. The revised guidelines will be applicable for the second phase candidates from February 1 till February 12.Elections to the five states were announced on January 8, even as India was in the midst of the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic driven by the Omicron variant that is highly infectious, but causes milder symptoms and results in fewer hospitalisations and deaths.According to the HT dashboard, the seven-day average of cases has risen from 14,418 on January 1 to 302,981 on January 22, although early hotspots such as Delhi and Mumbai are beginning to see a dip in cases. According to a HT dashboard on hospitalisations across 13 states and Union territories, 86.5% of Covid-19 bed capacity in hospitals remains unoccupied.While announcing the elections, the election commission barred rallies from January 8 till January 15, and then extended the ban by a week till January 22.Last week, it relaxed the norms and allowed indoor meetings of a maximum 300 people, or 50% capacity of the meeting hall, or limits prescribed by state disaster management authorities.Political parties, meanwhile, have been focusing on ramping up digital campaigns and events in keeping with the commission’s guidelines. Home minister Amit Shah on Saturday took part in a doorstep campaign in Uttar Pradesh, even as Congress’ candidates for Goa took a pledge and visited several temples in the state.On Saturday, the commission also relaxed restrictions on door-to-door campaigns. Instead of five persons, now 10 persons, excluding security personnel, will be allowed.“Commission has also allowed video vans for publicity with usual COVID restrictions at designated open spaces with a maximum of 500 viewers or 50% of the capacity or the limit prescribed by SDMA, whichever is lesser, in the poll going States subject to public convenience and no hindrance to smooth flow of traffic,” it said in the statement.The decision came after an extensive review. “Chief Election Commissioner Sushil Chandra along with election commissioners Rajiv Kumar and Anup Chandra Pandey accompanied by Secretary General and concerned Deputy Election Commissioners held a comprehensive review of the present situation with respect to status and projected trends of Covid-19 pandemic in the five poll going states,” the statement said.“Commission also reviewed Vaccination status and action plan for expeditiously completing vaccination for 1st, 2nd and booster dose for eligible persons amongst polling personnel. Commission deliberated on relaxing restrictions for physical rallies in the wake of prevailing situation.”It said fresh instructions on campaigning will be issued after a review on January 31.In view of the restrictions, the government last month increased the expenditure limit for candidates to facilitate larger spending on virtual campaigns during the pandemic. The limit was raised by the law ministry to ₹40 lakh in large states, up from the earlier ₹30.8 lakh, in keeping with the poll body’s recommendations.The elections for five assemblies will be held in seven phases from February 10. The results will be declared on March 10, the commission announced last week.Other containment measures include curbs on the number of vehicles accompanying a candidate for the submission of nomination, which will be restricted to two instead of five.The Commission has allowed only 1,250 voters in each polling station instead of the usual 1,500. The number was capped at 1,000 for the previous two rounds of state elections. There will be mandatory sanitisation of polling stations and thermal checking of all those casting their vote. The commission is also running a pilot project to live-track overcrowding of voters at various poll booths to ensure safety norms are followed.Covid patients and those who are quarantined will be allowed to cast their vote in the last hour of polling under the supervision of health authorities, the commission said. Sector magistrates will coordinate this in their allocated polling stations and record of such electors shall be maintained by the presiding officer, it said.All electoral offences will be brought to the fore and not just Covid-related offences. All violations will be dealt with by the chief secretary or the chief of the state disaster management authority of the concerned state.Last year, the commission courted controversy throughout the eight-phase West Bengal election, beginning with the prolonged duration of polls to not conceding to the opposition’s demands to club the last three phases in view of the alarming rise in Covid-19 cases. A police complaint was filed against the watchdog for culpable homicide by the wife of a Trinamool Congress candidate, who died of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-extends-rally-ban-but-eases-some-curbs-101642875643188.html
23-01-2022||India||Kamla building’s firefighting system failed, safety audit ignored: Fire Brigade||The firefighting system at the Tardeo’s Kamla building, also known as Sachinam Heights building where a massive fire killed six people and injured 23 on Saturday morning was not operational at the time of the fire, according to Mumbai’s fire department officials.Residents said they did not hear the fire alarm go off when the fire started.The fire gutted an apartment in Kamla building at Nana Chowk. The first information about the fire was received at 7.28am. It was classified as a level 3 (massive) fire at 7.42 am, and took the fire brigade 2.5 hours to bring it under control, and almost five hours to fully douse the fire.This is the fourth high-rise fire in three months in the city to have resulted in casualties.On October 23, one person was killed in a fire on the 19th floor of a 61-storey building called One Avighna Park at Currey Road in Mumbai. Two people were killed in another fire on the 14th floor of the 15-storey Hansa Heritage building in Kandivali on November 7. One woman was killed as a fire erupted in Notan Villa in Khan on September 23. In each of these cases, the firefighting system of the buildings were not functioning at the time of the fire.Of the 324 fires reported in the city’s high-rise buildings between January 2020 and October 2021, 127 buildings, or 39.2%, did not have an operational firefighting system, HT reported in November last year.In case of the Kamla building fire of Saturday, too, chief fire officer of the Mumbai fire brigade, Hemant Parab, said, “The internal firefighting system of the building was not working, and the building has not even submitted its biannual fire safety audit to the fire brigade.”The entire building was engulfed in smoke, even though the fire completely gutted only flat number 1904 and the common passageway of the floor. Smoke spread through the building due to a duct running along the length of the building.“The building has two refuge areas, but none of the residents were found in the refuge area,” Parab said. “The fire brigade rescued about 28-29 residents using the staircase of the building.”A total of 29 people were rushed to three hospitals: Nair, Kasturba, and Bhatia hospital. Three patients among these were later shifted to Masina, Reliance and Wockhardt hospitals for treatment. Seven of these patients have been discharged, while 16 others are still undergoing treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kamla-building-s-firefighting-system-failed-safety-audit-ignored-mumbai-fire-brigade-101642875525143.html
23-01-2022||India||Not fielded by BJP, Goa ex-CM Parsekar resigns from party||Former Goa chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar resigned from the Bharatiya Janata Party on Saturday and announced that he would be contesting as an independent.The three-term MLA and former state BJP president represented the Mandrem constituency in north Goa from 2002 until his defeat in 2017. He said he was taken for granted by the party and ignored in favour of a non-performing MLA.The BJP has fielded MLA Dayanand Sopte as its candidate in the Mandrem constituency. Goa will elect a new assembly on February 14. Results will be declared on March 10.“The people are disappointed in the present MLA. I was claiming for the ticket. I am a disciplined soldier of the party, so I didn’t go to town with my grievances. But they took me for granted, thinking that I will not resign,” he said. “Even now there are people who think that I will not be able to bring myself to resign from the party. But it is high time. I am resigning from the BJP.”“On January 20, it was announced that I was not getting the ticket. My supporters were intensely disappointed, but it soon became a demand that I should resign and contest as an independent,” Parsekar said.The former chief minister said that he sensed that there was popular anger in the constituency over the non-performance of the current MLA over stalled projects and a lack of new projects.Explaining the reasons why he lost, Parsekar said that during his tenure as chief minister, he got caught up in administrative work, which widened the gap between him and his voters.“At the time I didn’t campaign at all. I was the chief minister and the gap between me and the people widened. I was staying in Panjim since I had to focus on administration at the time,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-fielded-by-bjp-goa-ex-cm-parsekar-resigns-from-party-101642875285504.html
23-01-2022||India||SP chief Akhilesh Yadav makes Karhal poll fray entry official||The Samajwadi Party (SP) on Saturday announced that party chief Akhilesh Yadav will contest his first Uttar Pradesh assembly election from the party’s stronghold of Karhal in Mainpuri.“Our national president Akhilesh Yadav will contest the Karhal assembly constituency in Mainpuri, and he will win with a massive mandate,” SP chief national general secretary Ramgopal Yadav announced at a press conference in Lucknow, where Akhilesh Yadav was also present.On January 20, SP national spokesperson Ashutosh Verma spoke of Akhilesh Yadav contesting his first UP assembly election from Karhal, but said a formal announcement would follow.Ever since speculation on chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s candidature for the assembly polls surfaced, there has been talk about Akhilesh Yadav contesting as well. On January 15, the BJP named Yogi Adityanath the party’s candidate for the Gorakhpur urban seat in eastern UP.While Yogi Adityanath is a five-time former Gorakhpur MP, Akhilesh Yadav is the sitting Azamgarh MP. They have never contested assembly elections before. Both took the Vidhan Parishad route to become members of the UP legislature after they took office as chief ministers in 2012 and 2017Meanwhile, Akhilesh Yadav made more poll promises at the press conference.“The Samajwadi Party has taken more decisions for the public after we made (promises about) 300 units free power to domestic consumers, and free laptops to students. The SP will create 22 lakh direct employment in the sector in UP in the Samajwadi Party’s Rozgaar Sankalp, when the SP forms the government in 2022,” he said.Karhal is scheduled to go to the polls on February 20 in the third phase of the seven-phase UP assembly elections and Gorakhpur in the sixth phase on March 3.Karhal has been a Samajwadi Party stronghold since 1993, with only one exception. In the 2002 assembly election, the seat went to the BJP.The sitting Karhal MLA Sobaran Singh Yadav was with the BJP when he won the seat in 2002. Since 2007, he has been contesting the same seat on an SP ticket. Mainpuri, which includes the Karhal assembly segment, is SP chief patron Mulayam Singh Yadav’s Lok Sabha constituency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sp-chief-akhilesh-yadav-makes-karhal-poll-fray-entry-official-101642875105227.html
23-01-2022||India||Shah returns to the forefront of UP campaign with Kairana visit||New Delhi/Meerut Starting with a door-to-door campaign in Kairana, a constituency that has figured prominently in the Bharatiya Janata Party’s election discourse in Uttar Pradesh, Union home minister Amit Shah has signaled he is back in the saddle in the poll-bound state.Shah, who has been helming talks with allies, ironing out differences within the party unit, and lending an ear to disgruntled party workers, besides playing a key role in ticket distribution, will now be actively campaigning in the state, according to functionaries aware of the developments. He was in charge of the party’s campaign in the state in the 2014 election, when it won 71 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats. Shah has hit the ground along with party president JP Nadda, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, and state unit president Swatantra Dev Singh to mobilise support for the party at a time when large gatherings and rallies are prohibited (and will remain so till January 31). He is expected to address small groups and call on voters in door-to-door campaigns. “The choice of Kairana as the starting point for his campaign shows he’s invested in mobilising support and encouraging workers in the western part of the state, which is perceived as a challenging demographic for the party,” said a party functionary who asked not to be named. Kairana, where the Bharatiya Janata Party’s then MP Hukum Singh alleged an exodus of Hindu families, goes to polls on February 10. Shah met some of these families that moved out following alleged communal tension in the area in 2017. Singh’s daughter Mriganka Singh is the party’s candidate in the constituency. Of the 1.7 million- plus voters in Kairana, over 3 lakh are Muslims and 1.5 lakh are scheduled castes from the Jatav community, considered the traditional vote bank of the Bahujan Samaj Party. In his door-to-door campaign, Shah raised the issue of “palayan (Hindu exodus)” during the Samajwadi Party (SP) rule and stated that those who were forced to leave have now started returning. Shah distributed pamphlets carrying information about various welfare schemes that were launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Yogi Adityanath. He also visited a 70-year-old sweet shop in the Gumbad locality of Kairana where he met those who were previously forced to migrate out of the area, but have since returned. “This is my first visit to Kairana since January 2014. I see a sea change. All welfare schemes by Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji have been implemented by CM Yogi Adityanath till the grassroots level. It’s the same Kairana from where people were migrating earlier. Today, I interacted with many of those who had migrated earlier. I met all 11 family members of the Mittal family (who fled the area but have since returned). All of them said that CM Yogi improved the law and order situation and they have no fear. That’s why I say that those who made the people migrate have now migrated themselves,” Shah said. Party functionaries are resting their hopes on Shah’s campaign in the western region to help the BJP tide over the challenges posed by the recent farmers’ agitation that found support in the area and created friction between the Jats and the BJP. The party also faces formidable opposition in the region with the coming together of the Samajwadi Party and the Rashtriya Lok Dal. “We are hoping that the party will be able to repeat its 2017 performance in western UP ( it won 66 of the 76 seats then). Over the course of the next few weeks, Shah will cover several constituencies, meeting people and holding discussions with party workers on streamlining the election campaign,” added the first functionary.“In west UP, elections begin on February 10. With folded hands, I want to appeal to all the voters of west UP that if due to Covid-19, our cadres are unable to reach you, all of you should go out to vote early to help set up a BJP government with a massive majority for the next five years,” Shah added. Shah, also a former BJP president, is credited with scripting the BJP’s stellar show in UP in the 2014 general elections and the 2017 assembly polls, when the party saw its seat and vote share leap. From 47 seats and a 15% vote share in 2012, the party went on to win 312 of the 403 seats in 2017 and increased its vote share to 39.67%. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, it garnered almost 50% of the votes. In his recently released book, union environment minister Bhupender Yadav said that Shah opted for a four-pronged approach to turn around the party‘s fortunes in UP. The book details how he set out by building a cadre of booth level workers and recruiting about four lakh full-time workers to keep tabs on the ground. He also identified seats that the BJP just wouldn’t win and where contesting would be a waste of effort. “The third and the biggest challenge was social engineering required to navigate the caste politics of UP. Here, Shah focused attention on 30% of the backward caste voters, excluding the Yadavs, Jatavs and the Muslims, who had no political representation at the state and national levels. Finally, Shah devised various strategies to reach out to the voters. He organised election campaigns banking on (Narendra) Modi‘s popularity and his OBC status,” Yadav said in the book co-authored by him along with economist Ila Patnaik. The BJP’s ability to build a rainbow coalition of OBCs (other than the Yadavs) and some from the SC communities is believed to have helped it consolidate the Hindu vote. Similarly, ahead of the 2017 election, Shah was credited for building support through empowered booth-level committees. “Ahead of the 2017 elections, he gave clear directions to set up booth-level committees of about 10 to 20 people in every booth. The state was carved into zones and specific election campaigns were designed, keeping in view the peculiarities of each zone, which helped the party in addition to the focus on social engineering,” said a second functionary who too asked not to be named.
