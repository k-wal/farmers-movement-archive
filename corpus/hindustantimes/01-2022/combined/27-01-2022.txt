27-01-2022||Delhi||Weekend curfew over, dining out back in city||New Delhi: There will no longer be a weekend curfew, shops can be open on all days, and restaurants, bars and cinema halls can reopen for customers at 50% of their capacity, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) decided on Thursday, heeding to calls to at least roll back some curbs after the Covid-19 outbreak in the city appeared to be stable.The attendance cap on weddings, too, was raised to 200 people (or 50% capacity if the event is indoors) but the night curfew for non-essential activities between 10pm and 5am will continue, and schools will stay closed until a decision next week, officials said.In markets, complexes and malls all shops and establishments dealing with non- essential goods and services will be allowed to open between 10am to 8pm without the odd-even rule. Restaurants shall be allowed to operate at 50% of the seating capacity from 8am to 10pm, while bars shall be allowed to operate at 50% of the seating capacity from 12pm to 10pm, the DDMA order issued on Thursday night stated.Also Read | Cinema hall, schools, markets: What's open, what's closed in Delhi from FridayGyms and spas will, however, remain closed.At funeral gatherings, up to 100 people will be allowed, while for marriage related gatherings, halls or banquets can function at 50% capacity with a ceiling of 200 persons. The owners of these places will be responsible for maintaining social distancing and CAB.“However, it is clarified that assembly halls and banquet halls will remain closed except for the purpose of marriage. There shall be no weekend curfew on movement of persons in the city,” the DDMA stated.“After detailed discussions with experts, in view of the decline in positive cases, it was decided to gradually ease restrictions while ensuring adherence to Covid appropriate behaviour. It was agreed to revoke weekend curfew and to open markets without the odd even rule. It was also decided to open all government offices with 100% strength up to grade 1 level,” said lieutenant governor (LG) Anil Baijal, who heads DDMA, in a tweet after the meeting on Thursday.Baijal added that the health department has been asked to improve vaccination coverage and to carry out an epidemiological analysis of hospitalised patients. “Emphasised on all agencies to ensure strict enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour and to continue to be vigilant without lowering the guard,” he added.An official who was at the meeting said the existing restrictions were discussed at length, and it was decided that all curbs cannot be lifted at once. “The relaxations will be allowed in a phased manner. The other restrictions will be reviewed in the next meeting, including the reopening of schools,” the official told HT, adding that instructions have been sent to district authorities to improve the enforcement of safe behaviour, such as mask-wearing and avoiding crowding.In the meeting CM Arvind Kejriwal, who received multiple representations from the traders in recent days, pushed for lifting various restrictions so that the business community gets a relief, the person added.Thursday’s decision will be implemented once the DDMA issues a formal order, which was likely late on Thursday.During the DDMA meeting, the Aam Aadmi Party government also pushed for the reopening of schools, citing among factors the growing worry that parents have expressed of the continuing learning loss for their children.Schools in the Capital have been closed since December 28 when the government sounded “yellow alert” imposing various restrictions.Sisodia on Wednesday said it was crucial to reopen schools as the pandemic-induced closure was widening the learning gap.The Delhi education minister’s comments came after a meeting with a delegation of parents led by epidemiologist Dr Chandrakant Lahariya and other public policy experts. The delegation submitted a petition, endorsed by at least 1,600 signatories, seeking the reopening of schools.Sudha Acharya, chairperson of the National Progressive School Conference (NPSC), which has 122 Delhi schools as members, said that the continued closure of schools was disappointing for all stakeholders. “Schools could have been reopened from February 1 since cases are on the decline. If curbs can be relaxed for cinemas and restaurants, what is the problem with school reopening? The message being sent out is that cinema halls are safer than schools. Students are highly demotivated with the lack of a decision on reopening,” said Acharya.Cases in the Capital have been gradually falling, except for some days of spikes that were the result of increase in testing. On Thursday, the capital added 4,291 new cases with a test positivity rate of 9.56%. The new cases was the lowest since January 3 and the test positivity rate – a measure less sensitive to fluctuations in testing – was the lowest since January 4.Also Read | At 4,291, Delhi's Covid tally further dips; case positivity rate goes below 9.5%The peak of cases was on January 13, when 28,867 cases were recorded with a test positivity rate of over 30%.An audit report of Covid deaths prepared by Delhi government found more signs that this wave of infections has been significantly less damaging for the city. Among the 438 people who died between January 13 and 25, only 94 had Covid-19 as primary cause of death.In 318 deaths, a Covid-19 infection was incidental.Among the 94, 89 were eligible for a dose and of these, 57 were unvaccinated – translating to 64% of fatalities in the unvaccinated group.DDMA also asked authorities to focus on giving booster doses for those eligible as soon as possible, said a person at the meeting who asked not to be named.The Confederation of All India Traders welcomed the decisions taken on Thursday. “The withdrawal of odd-even rule and weekend curfew will ease the business environment in Delhi to a great extent and the business can be revived now though it may take a longer period for the trade to come out from the slumber caused due to restrictions,” said CAIT secretary general Praveen Khandelwal.Brijesh Goyal, chairman of the Chamber of Trader and Industry, an association of traders, said lifting of curbs will normalise the business conditions. A delegation of traders will soon meet Kejriwal and thank him for it, he said. “Raising the limit of persons for weddings and allowing eateries to function with 50% capacity will support livelihood,” said Goyal, adding that wedding season is round the corner.Community medicine experts supported the reopening.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital, said: “The government has taken the right decision to lift the curbs because the test positivity rate has been reduced to almost 10% and will further go down in few days. Keeping the strict curbs like weekend and restrictions on commercial activities was not an ideal move. Harsh curbs may further delay the drop in the curve because due to curbs there will be less movement of individuals which may slow down the infection spread. It is already proven that infection is mild with not much mortality, such curbs is more damaging particularly for school children who are suffering learning loss.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/weekend-curfew-over-dining-out-back-in-city-101643308140118.html
27-01-2022||Mumbai||Adani, L&T in race to revamp Motilal Nagar MHADA colony||Adani Realty and Larsen & Toubro (L&T) are two players in the running to undertake redevelopment of the 142-acre Motilal Nagar MHADA colony at Goregaon. Naman Developers, the third bidder, was disqualified after it failed to fulfil the technical aspects of this bid. The winning bidder has to rehabilitate 5,300 families which include the construction of 3,700 MHADA houses and 1,600 hutments. The residents will be given 1,600 sq ft houses. Besides, the winner also has to construct a mini township with schools, dispensaries and open spaces.Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) would be the nodal agency overseeing this ₹30,000 crore project.Anil Diggikar, Vice-President and Chief Executive officer (CEO), MHADA, said the final winner would be selected on basis of the commercial bid. “We have currently shortlisted two firms. The winner of this bid will be decided on basis of the company which will offer a maximum share of the remaining built-up area (BUA) to MHADA after rehabilitating the existing residents,” said Diggikar. This means that the company which offers the maximum low-cost houses will be chosen.“We will submit this report to the Bombay High Court and then open the final commercial bids based on their direction,” he added.The project will be undertaken under 33(5) of the Development Control & Promotion Regulations (DCPR), 2034.Diggikar has called it a win-win situation. “The existing residents will move to new bigger houses while MHADA will get a huge stock of affordable houses without spending a single penny,” he added.However, resident associations are not convinced and they accused MHADA of not taking them into confidence. “We are unaware of any such tender or who is going to redevelop our colony. We are owners and not encroachers and MHADA needs to take our consent before proceeding with its plans. In addition, we should be given not less than 2,000 sq ft houses,” said Yuvraj Mohite, president, Motilal Nagar Vikas Samiti.Motilal Nagar was built in 1960 to house people belonging to the economically weak sections. Though it has 200 sq ft houses, many have illegally extended their rooms. In the last few years, several builders such as the RNA, HDIL and Vichare have been offering redevelopment proposals to the residents. Even this present tender has come under scanner as some top builders accused MHADA of deliberately adding the ₹9000 crore net worth clause to exclude them from the bidding process.

He said the announcements made by Jai Ram on the statehood day was an election stunt to project his government has “pro-people and pro-employee”.The Congress president said that the announcement of providing free electricity up to 60 units was not adequate and should be increased to 100 units as Himachal is a major power generating state. He alleged that the central government also did not provide help of a single penny to the state during the testing times.He said that the BJP never talks about rising inflation and unemployment. He said that cement which is being manufactured in the state is being sold at higher prices as compared to the neighbouring states. Rathore also questioned the quality of ration being provided at fair price shops under PDS. “This is betrayal of people of the state and the government is playing dangerously with the health of the people,” he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-govt-failed-on-all-fronts-in-himachal-hpcc-chief-rathore-101643304298452.html

Earlier we were plying buses all across Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad on various routes from the airport. But passengers are preferring to travel by private cabs and auto-rickshaws, due to which most of our buses are plying empty,” said Dattatray Zende, PMPML traffic manager.There are electric buses given by PMPML to Pune airport at Lohegaon, and a dedicated space is given to parking the buses inside the airport premises. There are hardly any passengers taking these buses going towards Kothrud, Chinchwad, Swargate, Hadapsar and other parts of the city.“Now looking at the response by the passengers we are going to schedule more buses from the airport, as already organisation is going through financial losses. And giving more than 10 electric buses from Lohegaon to various destinations is making a loss on routes to our routine schedule,” added Zende.Vipul Alekar, a commuter, said, “As Covid cases are increasing in the city we avoid travelling by the public transport buses, recently I came from Lucknow to Pune airport. So, we preferred to travel by private cab and protect the family from getting infected.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmpml-reduces-buses-from-35-to-10-at-pune-airport-101643304058524.html

However, PMC officials confirmed that a drive has been planned against these constructions and that action will be taken very soon. The HEMRL wrote to the Pune municipal commissioner, Pune district collector and Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) and appealed that action be taken against the illegal constructions.The HEMRL letter read, “Fresh unauthorised constructions are underway in the restricted zone around HEMRL, within 50 to 100 metre of the boundary wall of HEMRL. The HEMRL is consistently following up with all civil authorities responsible for halting and demolishing of illegal unauthorised constructions. But the activity is ongoing so authorities should take necessary action.” The HEMRL also requested the PMC not to grant permission for any construction activity and include the area around HEMRL as a restricted zone.As per the notification, there are restrictions on any permanent civil activity within 500 yards of the boundary of HEMRL. HEMRL is a premier category ‘A’ lab under the DRDO and deals with the entire spectrum of high energy material.

27-01-2022||Pune||Pune Covid caseload plateaued; will daily tally decline here on?||PUNE With the daily caseload in Pune district reported to be around 10,000 cases for the last few days, it seems that the district has hit a plateau. The officials said the current trend indicates that the Pune tally has plateaued even as the rise or decline of daily cases can be said only after a week.Pune district on Thursday reported 7,874 fresh cases of Covid-19 and zero infection-related deaths in the last 24 hours.The district has for the past four days reported a daily caseload lower than its peak of 16,459 on January 21. Since then, the curve is on the downward trend with Wednesday’s caseload being 10,990 while on Tuesday, the district reported 10,669 cases. According to Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao, the district may have already hit the peak. While it is a little early to say that the Pune district has crossed the peak.“In the last three to four days, the number of new cases has decreased, however, it is too early to say that we are past the peak. We will have to wait at least for a week to understand the data more clearly,” he said.According to the state health department, between January 19 and January 26, Pune district has reported a rise of 35.07 per cent Covid cases. And the weekly positivity rate of Pune on January 26 was 42.49%.Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, said that there is not much possibility of transmission in the Pune district it seems.“In the past few days, we have seen that the daily caseload in Pune district has remained around 10,000. But the positivity rate is over 40 per cent. We also saw in Mumbai that two weeks back, the positivity rate in Mumbai was over 30 per cent and now is around 10 to 12 per cent. Similarly, after the Pune district has reached over 40 per cent positivity rate there are fewer chances of transmission to spread due to vaccination. The vulnerable population has been vaccinated which is good. And so, I think in the next one to two weeks, the overall cases for Pune will decline,” said Dr Awate.The Pune graph, According to Rao, is three weeks behind Mumbai.“If we follow the path of Mumbai, we can see that Mumbai’s caseload shot up and then saw a decline. The decline in Mumbai was quick. But our experience from the first and second wave states that this time for us, it is possible that the decline in cases is due to the plateau. We have seen a similar trend earlier and so we are more vigil,” said Rao.He added that in the weekly review meeting which will be held this Saturday, officials may discuss two important issues.“First is the question of school reopening. The decision will be based on data. Another important part is to form an expedited strategy to reach more beneficiaries for precaution dose. As of now, the response to the precautionary dose has been dull. Whereas beneficiaries between the age group of 15 and 8 years are taking the vaccine in huge numbers,” said Rao.As per the state health department, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has so far reported 642,359 Covid-19 cases and 9,334 deaths by Thursday.Pimpri-Chinchwad has reported 329,505 cases so far and a total of 3,543 deaths due to Covid-19.Pune rural has reported 410,593 total cases so far and 7,064 deaths due to the infection.In the Pune district, there are a total of 1,382,457 Covid-19 cases.

There has been a total of 20,291 deaths and at present, there are 90,303 active cases in the Pune district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-covid-caseload-plateaued-will-daily-tally-decline-here-on-101643303758681.html

27-01-2022||Pune||Covid infection among those above 71 years and above highest in Maharashtra||PUNE According to the latest report published by the Medical Education and Drug Department (MEDD), a maximum per cent of Covid-19 cases is from the age group of 71 years and above in Maharashtra.As per the report, as many as 511,323 persons in that age group have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus since the first wave which is 16.05 % of the overall population.Doctors and experts note that the response to precaution dose by this age group is not very good.So far, there are just 1,18,844 beneficiaries who have received the dose in the Pune district as per the CoWin dashboard till Thursday.Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director, health services, Pune region, said that the response from senior citizens to the precaution dose is not as expected.“Senior citizens, frontline workers and healthcare professionals are not very keen in taking the precaution dose, as a result, the beneficiaries’ turnout is not good. We have a good vaccine supply and those getting intimation should take their precaution dose,” said Dr Deshmukh.He added that a major reason for less turnout for precaution dose is also due to the Omicron variant.“Many beneficiaries feel that there is no need to take the vaccine as the Omicron variant is not very severe. But precautions are important for high-risk beneficiaries to keep them safe as we can see community transmission of the variant,” said Dr Deshmukh.Speaking about the precaution dose for elderly citizens, Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) Hospital Board of India, said that beneficiaries should take the precaution dose as soon as they are informed.“Many frontline and healthcare professionals are not taking precaution dose. It is important to take the third precaution dose for them as they are at higher risks than others,” said Dr Patil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-infection-among-those-above-71-years-and-above-highest-in-maharashtra-101643303578266.html
27-01-2022||Chandigarh||Bir theft case: Ahead of Punjab polls, SIT files chargesheet against Ram Rahim, 10 dera followers||Faridkot : Ahead of the February 20 assembly elections, the Punjab Police special investigation team (SIT), probing the 2015 politically-sensitive sacrilege incidents, on Thursday filed a supplementary chargesheet against Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim, three absconding dera national committee members and seven dera followers in connection with the bir (copy of Guru Granth Sahib) theft case. A 400-page chargesheet was filed in the court of judicial magistrate Tarjani against 11 persons, including Ram Rahim, three national committee members of dera --- Sandeep Bretta, Pardeep Kler and Harsh Dhuri --- and seven dera followers. Ram Rahim has been nominated as the main conspirator in the case. The move comes a month after Ram Rahim filed a plea in the Punjab and Haryana high court demanding that the CBI be asked to continue with the probe into the sacrilege FIRs of 2015. After questioning Ram Rahim at Sunaria jail in connection with Bargari sacrilege on two occasions in November and December, the SIT was pushing for his custodial interrogation but the court asked the probe team to quiz him in the jail citing the law and order situation. The SIT led by inspector general of police (IGP) Surinder Pal Singh Parmar found that the conspiracy of desecration of Sikh scriptures was hatched at the administrative block of Dera Sacha Sauda in Sirsa and that the followers never acted without the permission of sect head Ram Rahim. The “bir” was stolen from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village gurdwara on June 1, 2015. An FIR was registered the next day at the Bajakhana police station. On October 12, 2015, torn pages of the “bir” were found scattered in front of a gurdwara in the adjoining Bargari village, resulting in an outrage across the state and the killing of two Sikh protesters in firing. The Akali-BJP government, led by Parkash Singh Badal, had handed over the probe into the three sacrilege incidents to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on October 26, 2015. In July 2019, the CBI filed a closure report, but withdrew it later to reinvestigate the matter. The Captain Amarinder Singh government challenged the CBI move of reinvestigation and handed over the probe to the SIT led by DIG Ranbir Singh Khatra on April 22, 2019. In July last year, the SIT named jailed dera head Gurmeet Ram Rahim and national committee members Bretta, Kler and Dhuri, as accused in the “bir” theft case. The probe team also filed a chargesheet against seven dera men in the case. In January last year, the Punjab and Haryana high court asked the state government to replace the head of the SIT probing sacrilege cases, after which IG Parmar was appointed as the new chief. The HC had also directed CBI to handover all the case files and asked the SIT to file a supplementary chargesheet in “bir” theft case after taking into account the evidence filed by the CBI. Following this, a fresh chargesheet was filed against seven dera followers.

27-01-2022||Patna||Bihar Governor slams vigilance probe in state varsities, says creating ‘fear on campuses’||Amid the ongoing vigilance probe into alleged corruption in universities in Bihar in which premises of a serving vice chancellor were also searched, Governor Phagu Chouhan, who is the ex officio Chancellor of state universities, has shot off a strongly-worded letter to the state government, accusing it of bypassing the Raj Bhawan and “creating an atmosphere of fear on the campuses”. The letter comes two months after the Special Vigilance Unit (SVU), which comes under the home department headed by chief minister Nitish Kumar himself, searched the premises of Magadh University vice chancellor Rajendra Prasad in a corruption case, the first such action against a serving vice chancellor in the state. In a letter to chief secretary Amir Subhani, Governor’s principal secretary Robert L Chongthu has written that the provisions laid down under the Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA), 1988, (amended 2018) were not being followed verbatim and that the same had been brought to the notice of the Chancellor, under whose direction he was writing the letter. “It is not only violation of the Act, but also infringement on the autonomy of universities and creating an atmosphere of fear on the campuses to derail normal functioning,” says the letter, which has been seen by HT.The letter written on Monday, the day when a special Patna court rejected Prasad’s anticipatory bail plea, follows the previous letter the Raj Bhawan had sent on December 30. The Raj Bhawan has so far not removed Prasad, who had proceeded on medical leave after the raids on his residences in Bodh Gaya and Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh in an alleged ₹30-crore corruption case.“We will examine the letter,” Subhani said.“The SVU is directly approaching different universities for documents related to important decisions and financial matters, while the Act stipulates a proper channel has to be followed in such matters for prior sanction from competent authority,” Chongthu has written, adding prior sanction from a competent authority was necessary for the SVU before taking any such action.Citing the provisions, he has written, “No police officer can conduct any inquiry into any offence alleged to have been committed by a public servant under the Act, where the alleged offence is related to any recommendation made or decision taken by such public servant in discharge of his official functions or duties, without the previous approval”.“... With respect to universities, Chancellor is the competent authority. Taking action against university officials without prior sanction is not only wrong, but is also unnecessarily creating an atmosphere of fear on the campuses and hampering normal work and academic atmosphere,” he has written.Senior advocate RK Giri, who is also the counsel for the Raj Bhawan, said the provisions were clear in the amended PCA. “The insertion of Section 17 A (added in 2018) is to protect public servants in the bonafide discharge of official functions or duties. Even for any inquiry, prior sanction has to be taken. There have been court judgments also on this. How can SVU proceed with its decision to carry out searches without prior sanction? Whose sanction did it obtain?,” he said.SVU had earlier written to several universities, including Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University (TMBU), JP University (Chapra) and BRA Bihar University (Muzaffarpur), seeking information on bulk purchases related to examination/ university since January 2019 and other details, including total number of students who appeared in the university exams, total number of OMR sheets and rate per OMR sheet along with copy of agreement with the suppliers/agencies. The information, the SVU stated, was being sought with reference to the confidential inquiry in the case against MU VC. Meanwhile, Pataliputra University (Patna) vice chancellor RK Singh was on Monday given additional charge of Magadh University till VC Prasad returns from his medical leave, as per a notification issued by the Raj Bhawan.

Faizal Khan, popularly known as Khan sir, however, admitted he had started a digital movement. “Later, I came to know that students were angry by the results of the exams for non-technical popular category (NTPC) jobs conducted by the Railway Recruitment Board (RRB). I I appealed to them to stop agitating. If there is a fault from RRB side, they should also have talked to the students to find a remedy,” he said. He also released a video in which he had appealed to aspirants to keep their movement peaceful. Patna district magistrate Dr Chandrashekhar Singh said the FIR (first information report) against six coaching institutes was lodged on the statement made by four students arrested on Monday for violence. “Some WhatsApp chats and videos posted on social media were also examined,” he said.Since Monday this week, thousands of RRB aspirants have been agitating against the alleged irregularities in NTPC exam results. They have clashed with police and damaged railway properties at Gaya, Jehanabad, Bhagalpur, Sasaram, Samastipur and Chapra.On Wednesday, four bogies of an empty train were set on fire and train services disrupted in many parts of Bihar for the third consecutive day. Meanwhile, DM Singh and senior superintendent of police M S Dhillon held a meeting with owners and representatives of coaching institutes in the state capital on Thursday evening and assured them that no biased action would be taken against anybody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/named-in-fir-top-tutor-denies-role-in-violence-by-rly-job-aspirants-101643301178149.html
27-01-2022||Mumbai||Maharashtra's Covid tally continues to dip with 25,425 cases, Mumbai sees decline too||Maharashtra on Thursday witnessed yet another decline in its daily Covid-19 case count as 25,425 people tested positive for the disease, according to the state health bulletin data. Of these, Mumbai accounted for 1,384 of the cases, down from Wednesday's 1,858. Following the latest figures, the overall case tally of the western state has reached 76,30,606.The number of new fatalities in Maharashtra also saw a sharp drop to 42 in the last 24 hours as opposed to 79 on Wednesday. Mumbai too reported one fewer death due to Covid-19 after as many as 12 patients succumbed to the disease, down from 13 the day before. The state's cumulative death toll currently stands at 1,42,358, of which, Mumbai accounts for 16,581.The only negative sign in the latest figures is the fewer number of fresh recoveries in Maharashtra. A total of 36,708 individuals recuperated from Covid-19 on Thursday, down from Wednesday's 39,857. However, the same doesn't hold true for Mumbai, which saw a massive spike in new recoveries - from 1,656 on Wednesday to 5,686 on Thursday, according to bulletin data by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).Maharashtra also reported 72 new Omicron cases, with 33 of them reported from Pune, 19 from Aurangabad, five each from Mumbai and Osmanabad, three from Thane, two each from Ahmednagar and Yavatmal, and one each from rural Pune, Latur and Nagpur. Since the outbreak of the Omicron variant of Covid-19, as many as 2,930 patients have been detected with the strain in Maharashtra, of which, a total of 1,592 have already recovered.Notably, physical classes for students of grades 1 to 12 resumed in Maharashtra on Monday after the Uddhav Thackeray-led state government last week announced the resumption of them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtras-covid-19-tally-continues-to-decline-with-25-425-cases-101643296809547.html
27-01-2022||Mumbai||As Covid-19 cases decline, demand for self-test drops||As Mumbai reports a steady decline in daily Covid-19 cases, chemists have also recorded a drop in the sales of home self-testing kits over the past week. Chemists said they have been cautious about excess ordering the kits, well aware that the demand may fluctuate suddenly. “There is no return policy for these kits, so most chemists have ordered stocks that would last for a short term,” Hakim Kapasi, who runs a chemist shop in Marol, said. “I was selling at least 100 self-test kits daily in the first two weeks of January, but now I am barely selling eight to nine a day.” “People could have also hoarded a lot of kits in the beginning,” said Kapasi, a member of the Andheri Chemist Association with over 400 members. The availability of self-test kits during the third wave of the pandemic distorted the true picture, as a large number of patients have likely tested positive but have not updated their reports on the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) portal. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did take a note of this discrepancy and last week mandated the chemists to take down the names, addresses, and contact details of the people who bought the kits. However, the daily cases had already begun declining by then. “We have started sending the details to the BMC and the FDA every day. It’s easier now because the sales are very low,” said Kapasi. Vaibhav Pitalia, who runs New Empire Chemist in Vile Parle, said he was selling over 125 kits in early January and the highest sales were on January 4, 5 and 6. “Now, I am selling a maximum of 10 kits a day.” Mumbai’s test positivity rate (TPR) on January 7 was 29% and dropped to 21% on January 14. On Thursday, the city recorded 1,384 cases and its TPR further declined to 3.2%. City doctors have also seen a drop in their Covid-19 consultations, even as there is a spurt in flu cases due to the dip in temperature over the past few days. “It has been difficult to differentiate between Covid-19 and regular season flu as both have same symptoms,” said physician Dr Pratit Samdani who practises in south Mumbai. “I start patients on immediate treatment, but I prefer a RT-PCR test to confirm or rule out Covid-19,” said Samdani who was consulting over 25 Covid19-related cases in the first two weeks of January, and has now seen a 50% drop in such consultations. Infectious disease expert Dr Om Srivastava, who is also on Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force, has also recorded a 10% drop in Covid19-related consultations. “There is a slight drop but many patients continue to come with a positive home test result,” he said, adding that ICU admissions have not reduced. “It’s too soon to say that the wave is waning because so much self-testing is happening in the community. It’s best to wait till February-end to analyse the situation in Mumbai,” he said. Seven self-test kits have been approved by the ICMR including Coviself by Mylab, CoviFind by Meril Diagnostics, and PanBio by Abbott. Mylab’s managing director and co-founder Hasmukh Rawal said they have not recorded any decline in the sales as of now. “The sales and the number of cases do not always have a real-time relationship. There can be a lag due to the distribution channel and many other factors such as customers wanting to purchase the kits for future use.” According to BMC officials, of the total cases being reported every day, around 2% are of those from home testing. As per data, between January 1 and 24, a total of 1,98,000 people have uploaded their test results of whom 4,397 are positive. The daily contribution of cases out of home testing kits is not much to result in a spike in the near future, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/as-covid-19-cases-decline-demand-for-self-test-drops-101643298123169.html
27-01-2022||Mumbai||3 girls aged 3-6 years killed as truck overturns on hut in Bhiwandi||Three girls aged six, four and three years, died after a truck overturned while unloading coal and fell on their hut in Bhiwandi on Tuesday night. The Bhiwandi Taluka police have booked four accused in connection with the incident, charging them with culpable homicide not amounting to murder.According to police officials, the incident occurred at around 7.45pm on Tuesday at a brick kiln in the Tembavli village in Bhiwandi.“The coal was being removed from the truck with the help of a hydraulic crane. During this process, one of the shock absorbers of the truck suddenly gave way, causing it to tilt. Due to the load that the truck was carrying in its bed, it turned on its side and crashed onto a hut next to the kiln, trapping its occupants underneath,” an officer with the Bhiwandi Taluka police station said.The officer added that one of the kiln’s labourers, Balaram Walvi (40), used to sleep in the hut with his family at night. When the truck collapsed, Balaram, his wife and three daughters were trapped under the coal that spilled out of the truck’s bed.Other residents of the area, who had heard the crash, rushed over to help and removed the coal, after which the Walvis were rushed to the IGM Hospital in Bhiwandi. Meanwhile, the truck driver fled when people started venting their ire by pelting the truck with stones.Walvi’s daughters, Lavanya (6 years), Amisha (4) and Kirti (3) were declared dead before admission while Balaram and his wife were discharged after being treated for injuries. The Bhiwandi Taluka police subsequently registered an FIR on Wednesday.“We have booked the truck owner and driver, the kiln owner and the kiln employee who had ordered the coal. Inquiries so far indicate that Walvi had repeatedly requested the kiln owner not to unload the coal so close to his house on previous occasions, but this was not heeded,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/3-girls-aged-3-6-years-killed-as-truck-overturns-on-hut-in-bhiwandi-101643297577427.html

27-01-2022||Mumbai||Activists blame concretisation of Gauripada Lake walls for death of turtles in Kalyan||Even as the official cause for the death of the turtles in Kalyan’s Gauripada Lake is still unknown, animal rescuers and activists from the city have blamed the concretisation of the lake walls in the name of beautification for the incident.While for the sixth consecutive day, dead turtles are still being pulled out of the Lake, greens claimed that the civic authorities have left no place for these turtles for basking while beautifying the lake.Experts claim that turtles usually suffer from shell deformity, low bone density and digestive issues if they do not bask enough in the sunlight.“There is no proper sunlight penetrating into the lake water and due to the concrete walls built, there is also no proper space left for the turtles for basking. If the turtles don’t bask, their health is affected. Whenever a lake is developed or preserved, it is very necessary to ensure the requirements of the species living in the water. The civic body should plan the construction along the lake side keeping this in mind,” said Suhas Pawar, secretary, Wild Animal and Reptile Rescue (WARR).As per the animal rescuers and the forest department officials, the Indian flapshell turtles have been in the lake for several years.“These turtles naturally exist in the lake. However, some exotic turtles are also released into this lake. The lake is very old and people have been fishing actively here for decades,” said Pawar.Shashim Kedar, deputy engineer of KDMC, agreed that there is no basking place for the turtles at the lake and claimed that it is a good suggestion that they can adopt in the near future.“Two years back, before the pandemic, we had built the retaining wall for the lake. Also, nullah water that was entering the lake was diverted. There is another work of drainage on the main road that will also be done once the funds are allotted. However, it is true that we had not thought of a specific place for basking for the species. Henceforth, we will take the suggestion into consideration,” said Kedar.Since the last week, 58 dead turtles were removed from the lake by the forest department, while on Thursday, three more dead turtles were removed. The department also rescued 14 turtles alive, out of which four were exotic ones.“We are still removing the dead turtles from the lake. On Thursday, three more were found dead. Meanwhile, the cause of death is yet to be ascertained as we are still awaiting the reports from the laboratory. We have also written to the civic body to clean the water and ensure no more species die due to polluted or contaminated water,” said RN Channe, forest range officer, Kalyan.Earlier, the Gauripada Lake was a source of drinking water for the residents of Gauripada. However, the lake has turned unclean since the past few years due to waste dumping activities and lack of cleaning work by the Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC).More than 100-year-old Gauripada Lake, sprawls in a 22,915sqm area. The lake has a temple at one side, a children’s play area, seating area for the public and the other side is where the local fishermen carry out fishing for their living. It is one of the hangout places for residents of Kalyan (W), where people go for walking, jogging and pass time during morning and evening hours.“In the last few years, the local residents have started dumping waste on the sides of the lake that has led to pollution in the water. The civic body does not clean the lake or its banks regularly. Once, a board was also put up warning of a fine to be imposed if anyone dumped waste into the lake. However, it was not effective and the dumping activity continued,” said Rajesh Mishra, 39, a local resident.“I have seen the fish and turtles in the lake since my childhood. The incident is something that needs detailed inspection and action that the authorities are neglecting,” said Ravindra Erande, a 25-year-old social activist from Kalyan.
27-01-2022||Mumbai||Bombay HC orders action against officers failing to maintain CCTVs in police stations||Mumbai: The Bombay High Court has directed the Maharashtra chief secretary to take stern action against senior police inspectors of police stations that do not comply with the Supreme Court’s order which stipulated installing CCTV systems in all police stations and maintaining the recordings with regular backups.The HC issued the directions after it was informed that CCTVs inside a Nashik police station was not functional for two months. The court had sought the footage after it was told that a notice to maintain law and order issued by the police station to a complainant was fabricated and backdated after the petitioner approached the court. The petitioner approached the HC challenging the notice issued to him by Sinnar Police Station under section 149 (for prevention of cognizable offence) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).The division bench of Justices SJ Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav, while hearing the petition filed by Somnath Giri and another through advocate JM Inamdar, was informed that the notice issued to his clients on January 8, 2022, was arbitrary. It claimed that the notice was issued after the police received a complaint against the petitioners.In an earlier hearing, the police, represented by advocate Shruti Vyas, had informed the bench that the notice was issued to complainant as well and hence, could not be termed as arbitrary. It had also placed a copy of the notice sent to the complainant before the bench.After going through the letter, the bench concluded that the notice was issued at a later date but was back-dated as the petitioner had approached the HC. It asked the Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Nashik (rural), to be present before the bench on January 25. The bench sought to know why there was a difference between the letters to both parties if they were issued at the same time as claimed by the police officials.As the police officers were unable to reply, the court asked the station officer to produce the station diary and CCTV footage of the police station, to which it was told that the system was not operational for two months. On hearing the submission, the HC referred to a December 2020 order of the Supreme Court (SC) which reiterated the stipulation of a previous SC order wherein every police station in every state had to have CCTV installed and regular review of the footage was to be done by concerned officials.“Pursuant to the directions of the Supreme Court, the CCTV systems are installed in the police stations, merely by way of compliance to the Order, but the same are intentionally either not maintained properly to serve the purpose it is meant to serve, or are deliberately kept non-functional so that no evidence would be available in any matter, and no one is any the wiser as to what transpired at the police stations,” observed the bench.The bench thereafter directed the CS to prepare a report of the functional CCTVs in police stations in the state and to submit them to HC by February 15. The bench also directed the rectification of the non-functional CCTV systems and the duration for which the data is recorded, and steps taken for backing up the data. The matter was posted for hearing on January 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-orders-action-against-officers-failing-to-maintain-cctvs-in-police-stations-101643293918246.html

BSP’s Kuldeep Narayan will contest against the SP president from the Karhal seat while Brajendra Pratap Singh will contest against the PSP chief from Jaswantnagar assembly seat.Both Karhal and Jaswantnagar are unreserved seats – considered the stronghold of the Samajwadi Party. The SP has been winning Karhal and Jaswantnagar seats in consecutive assembly elections since 1993. “Considered committed and loyal party workers, Narayan and Singh will be contesting the assembly elections for the first time. Both belong to the Jatav community and have been working for the party at the grassroots level, strengthening the support base of the party in Mainpuri and Etawah,” said a BSP leader. To give a message to the party cadre that committed workers will be given preference in the assembly elections, BSP chief Mayawati decided to field Kuldeep Narayan and Brajendra Pratap Singh against the political heavyweights. The BSP hopes to mobilise the young party cadre when several senior leaders had deserted the party, he said. Mayawati on Thursday released the party’s list of 53 candidates for the third phase of UP assembly elections where polling will be held on February 20 in 59 assembly constituencies in 11 districts. Among the 11 districts - Mainpuri, Etawah, Firozabad, Etah, Hathras, Kasganj, Kannauj, Farrukhabad and Auraiya are called the ‘Yadavland of Uttar Pradesh’. They have been a stronghold of the Samajwadi Party. Among the 53 candidates, 18 belong to the other backward classes (OBCs), 17 are Dalits, 15 belong to the upper caste and three are Muslims. The 11 districts (in which third phase assembly election will be held) have a large backward and Dalit population. Keeping caste equations in consideration, the BSP chief has fielded maximum candidates from both the communities. Under the social engineering formula, Brahmin and Rajput candidates have been fielded in the upper caste majority seats, said the BSP leader. The BSP announced candidates for six assembly seats in which election will be held in the second phase. Yusuf Khan has been given ticket from Nawabganj, Shalini Singh from Faridpur and Brahmanand Sharma from Bareilly, Chandraketu Maurya has been fielded from Shahjahanpur assembly seat, Mohammad Rizwan from Kundarki and Moolchandra Chauhan from Dhampur assembly seat.

The accident left a 68-year- old woman dead, while 11 injured were admitted to a hospital in Boisar.Instead of pressing the brake, a Boisar resident,  Sanjay Zope (54), pressed the accelerator and slammed his car into a crowd of revellers at the beach.“The car dashed against a few food carts and rammed into people who were sitting on the chairs enjoying their snacks,” said API Srikant Koli of Vangaon police station.As the injured were rushed to a nearby Primary Health Centre (PHC) for treatment, enraged locals went on a rampage and destroyed the car and thrashed the driver as well as his co-passenger.Among the injured, the condition of Khatoon Nooraluddah Mansoori (68) and her daughter Nasima (45) was serious so they had to be shifted to a Boisar hospital,15 km away. However, the ambulance driver was not available due to the public holiday so a TV journalist, Pravin Babre, who was covering the news, offered to help. After getting permission from the doctor, he drove the ambulance and rushed the two women to a Boisar hospital.At the hospital, Mansoori was declared dead on arrival, while Nasima was admitted. In the same ambulance, Babre drove Mansoori’s body to the Tarapur PHC, where a post mortem was conducted.API Koli said that Zope was arrested under Sections 304(a) (causing death by negligence),337,338 (causing hurt) of the IPC and Section 184 of MV Act based on the complaint by Mohammed Imran Mansoori, son of the victim.“We have seized the car which belongs to Liladhar Ragho Patil and the investigation is ongoing. The accused was used to driving a manual car but was not acquainted with an automatic car (as there is no clutch) and lost control while trying to avoid a biker. Instead of the brake, he pressed the accelerator twice and rammed into a few food carts,” Koli added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/rday-revelry-turns-tragic-man-rams-car-into-tourists-on-dahanu-beach-101643293560303.html

With the help of an NGO, the PMC will start the service at Chandumama Sonawane Hospital. The facility here will be cheaper than the Central government health scheme.”The Pune Municipal Corporation will provide the health infrastructure required for the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and other equipments and manpower will be provided by the NGO, said PMC officials.A few private hospitals have the facility, but the civic body did not have any special ward in the hospitals that are run by them. This facility will be helpful for the citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/special-ward-for-burn-and-paralysis-patients-at-pmc-s-sonawane-hospital-101643292298586.html

Bails were granted to the accused more than two years ago and now you want us to interfere. We are not inclined to entertain any plea by the state government,” the bench, which included justices AS Bopanna and Hima Kohli, told senior advocate Ranjit Kumar.Also Read: 6th year into prohibition, Bihar begins a social audit of liquor ban impactKumar, appearing for the Bihar government, sought to persuade the bench that January 11 order may be cited as a precedent by other accused charged under the prohibition law and this could dilute the rigours of the Act.“There is no provision for anticipatory bail under Section 76 of the Act. We only want this court to say that there is no decision made on Section 76 of the Act,” Kumar argued.But the bench remained unimpressed. “Read our order. What did we say? We said that most of these accused were granted bail three-four years ago and therefore, there is no good ground to send them back to jail now. We also said that prosecution should rather work to prove its case and secure conviction if they are guilty,” the bench told Kumar.Also Read: Bihar considers relaxation in liquor lawThe bench added: “We are not going to say anything about the bail order any more. Also, the constitutionality of the Act is pending before some other bench. So, we are not commenting on the Act. Our order was confined to bail.”With the writing on the wall, Kumar opted to withdraw the state’s application without pressing it any further. On January 11, the bench rejected a clutch of appeals moved by the state government against bail granted to almost 40 accused.Also Read: Prohibition kept Bihar cops busy in 2021, 9 get death for hooch tragedy“Having regard to the fact that in most of the cases three/four years has passed since the bail granted to the respondents by the high court, we are not inclined to interfere with the impugned orders passed by the said court at this stage,” the SC order had said.It had further noted that there was no specific complaint of violation of the bail condition by the accused. “To achieve the object of the Act, the prosecution of the case should be made in all earnestness to secure conviction and punishment,” underscored the bench in its order on January 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/read-our-order-sc-refuses-to-cancel-bail-of-40-under-bihar-prohibition-law-101643291036847.html
27-01-2022||Lucknow||BJP’s polarisation strategy ineffective in western UP?||MEERUT Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders were doing their best to polarise voters in western UP on religious lines ahead of the UP elections but their efforts so far hadn’t yielded results, feel political observers.After the Muzaffarnagagr riots in September 2013, political polarization in the region (Meerut, Saharanpur and Moradabad divisions) worked magically for the BJP. The party won all 14 Lok Sabha seats in the 2014 elections and registered victory on 51 out of 70 seats of the region in the 2017 Assembly elections though it had won only 11 seats in the 2012 elections. Polarisation in 2017 election gave them a direct benefit of 40 seats, said political observers.But, the party’s “tried and tested strategy” suffered a jolt during the 13-month-long farmers’ movement against the contentious farm laws. The agitation brought the divided farmers’ community on a single platform again, irrespective of caste and religion. The movement also facilitated harmony between Hindus and Muslims, which was hit during the Muzaffarnagar riots, they opined.The RLD’s ‘Bhaichara’ conferences also played a vital role in this direction. Late Ajit Singh organized many such conferences and fielded Samajwadi Party’s Tabassum Begum as RLD’s candidate from Kairana in the Lok Sabha bypoll after the demise of BJP MP Hukum Singh and managed victory of ganna over Jinnah’. After Ajit Singh’s demise, his son Jayant Choudhary carried forward similar ‘Bhaichara’ conferences to promote harmony among people. Under the changed political and social equations, the BJP again decided to try out its old formula of polarization in western UP. Home minister Amit Shah kick-started his party’s election campaign from Kairana and raised the issue of ‘palayan’ (exodus). He met families that migrated and thereafter returned and appreciated UP CM Yogi Adityanath for “improved law and order situation in the area, which gave people a peaceful atmosphere to live in.”But apparently, party leaders’ efforts to polarize voters seem to be coming a cropper now. Villages said: “They now understand the politics of dividing people and would not fall in this trap again.” Maulana Zulfikar, state president of All-India Imams Association, said people had understood divisive politics. He said: “When they (BJP leaders) failed to mobilise people on the issue of exodus, union minister and MP from Muzaffarnagar Sanjeev Baliyan became a sympathizer of Muslims by raising questions over the decision of SP-RLD alliance of not fielding any Muslim candidate on six seats in Muzaffarnagar.” Maulana also believes that “tolerance of Muslims” was also making the saffron party’s efforts to polarize people ineffective. “We have asked people not to react and they are urged to believe in the strength of tolerance,” said Maulana who explained that Mahendra Singh Tikait formed the BKU on the basis of communal harmony and their sons Naresh and Rakesh Tikait eventually revived it by admitting publicly that supporting the BJP in three previous elections was their “big mistake”. Rehana Adeeb who runs an NGO ‘Astitva’ in Muzaffarnagar that works for the welfare of women stated: “We (Muslims) have been told to be patient and not react. This is the key point, which has deprived the BJP of getting any issue to mobilise polarisation.” Adil Choudhary, SP candidate from Meerut seat, reportedly made a comment on Monday: “We would see them after the formation of our government.” Subsequently, saffron party leaders reported the issue to the police, demanding action against him. Tejbeer Singh, a BJP supporter and pradhan of Harshauli village in Muzaffarnagar, opined that the election in the region would eventually be contested on communal lines. He said the farmers’ movement would not have an impact on polls after the withdrawal of three farm bills and 50% reduction in electricity bills. According to him, the BJP will retain power in UP. Singh, however, admitted that the farmers’ movement succeeded in “reviving the broken communal harmony in the region to an extent.”Gulam Mohammad Jaula, a popular farmer leader who was a close aide of farmer leader Mahendra Singh Tikait, also said that Amit Shah’s Kairana visit and his bid to raise the exodus issue won’t be effective. “They won’t be able to do their vicious politics because people have understood their divisive policies,” said Jaula, adding that Muslims will vote for the SP-RLD alliance and not for Hindus or Muslims. Rashtriya Jat Mahasangh state president Rohit Jakhar also believes that the political atmosphere had changed in western UP. He said divisive politics had been exposed and the BJP will suffer loss after three elections of 2014, 2017 and 2019. “People, especially in the rural areas, are not allowing polarisation on the lines of religion. Soon, Jat leaders would be deployed in Muslim areas to mobilise communal harmony during elections,” he added. Political analyst Jamshed Zaidi also opined that the BJP was unable to effect polarisation despite efforts to revive the ‘palayan’ issue in Kairana. He cited examples of Siwalkhas, Khatauli, Purkazi and Shamli constituencies, where BJP candidates and their supporters were chased away during campaigning. Zaidi believes that this political and social change was due to the farmers’ movement and “the ruling party’s weak governance in tackling issues of inflation and unemployment.” S Raju9412366629||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjps-polarisation-strategy-ineffective-in-western-up-101643290976757.html
27-01-2022||Mumbai||Greens complain of destruction of mangroves in Thane Creek near Airoli||Environmentalists have expressed concern over destruction of a vast stretch of mangroves in the Thane Creek near the Airoli toll naka.NatConnect Foundation and Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan have drawn the attention of the High Court-appointed Mangrove Protection and Conservation Committee to the strange phenomenon.NatConnect Foundation director, BN Kumar, said there should be a top-level investigation into the incident.“Normally, some mangroves wither due to pest attack during winter but the plants regrow on their own, but this kind of perishing of the plants is very strange,” said Nandakumar Pawar, head of Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan.Environmentalists have suggested that a thorough chemical analysis of the water might give clues to the contamination or pollution, if any.The green groups have earlier brought to the notice of the authorities the dumping of medical waste along the mangroves. Meanwhile, a case of dumping debris on the main road at Ghansoli has come to the notice of environmentalists.Adarsh Reddy, District Forest Officer, Thane, and Member Secretary of the High Court-appointed Mangrove Committee, said, “This particular issue was noticed by Mangrove cell last year and our team is monitoring the area. There might be a number of reasons of which the primary reason could be a hyblaea attack that is reported post monsoon every year. Over a period of time, every season, mangroves are getting affected twice or thrice than what it was observed a decade before. But one probably good thing that is observed is that naturally the species is getting replaced by other mangrove species. The area where these Avicennia trees are found dead has now been taken over by Sonneratia apetala, which is not favoured by hyblaea moths for feeding.”Reddy said that the department is undertaking restoration of the area by planting diversity of other mangrove species that are found locally and all the efforts will be made to restore the area with mangrove vegetation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/greens-complain-of-destruction-of-mangroves-in-thane-creek-near-airoli-101643290796617.html

They were produced before a court and remanded to police custody till January 31. A team of unit 11 of the crime branch had laid a trap at Dahisar check post on Wednesday morning after a specific tip off and intercepted the suspected car.“Four people travelling in the car were taken into custody for interrogation. During the search we found a bag containing 250 bundles of counterfeit currency notes of ₹2,000 denomination with a face value of ₹5 crore”, said deputy commissioner of police Sangramsinh Nisandar of the crime branch.During interrogation, the accused revealed that they brought fake currency from Delhi to distribute in the city and a few people had already reached the city with fake notes.

27-01-2022||Mumbai||Bombay High Court-appointed panel refuses to accept CIDCO contention that Panje is not wetland||In a major boost to the environmentalists fighting to save the 289-hectare Panje wetland and biodiversity, the Bombay High Court-appointed Wetlands Committee has refused to accept CIDCO’s contention that the inter-tidal zone is not a wetland.Regarding the NRI and TS Chanakya wetlands in Nerul, the committee referred the issue of violations and choking of the inter-tidal water flow to the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA).At the committee meeting on Tuesday, CIDCO had maintained that Panje is not a wetland and suggested closing complaints about landfill and violations, but panel member, Stalin D, strongly objected and said the city planner cannot sit in judgement on complaints against it. “There is an expert opinion from the then Chief Conservator of Forests (CCF) and the MCZMA stating that Panje falls under CRZ 1 and that it has to be conserved,” Stalin said. There is also ample evidence that Panje is a wetland and the property must be protected, he said and offered to present all evidence.The Wetlands Committee then decided not to close the series of complaints pending on violations at Panje and await expert opinion.Welcoming the “positive development,” NatConnect Foundation director, BN Kumar, said that Panje has all the characteristics of a wetland as defined by the Ramsar Convention. It is also an inter-tidal zone and CIDCO cannot play with it.NatConnect also recalled that the environment sub-committee report on the status of Panje is still awaited for over a year. The then Mangrove and Wetlands Committee’s head, Annasaheb Misal, called for the report in December 2020.Nandakumar Pawar, head of Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan, said the BNHS and several experts are keen to conserve Panje.The MCZMA has said in its affidavit to Bombay High Court that Panje is CRZ 1 area, while the Environment Minister had stalled fresh constructions there.Pawar said, “It has not been notified so far. It doesn’t mean that it’s not a wetland. It’s basically a failure on the part of our system and the concerned authorities responsible for this. In fact, this is the only highly bio-diverse, surviving wetlands left in the entire Navi Mumbai.”Konkan Divisional Commissioner, Vilas Patil, who is the de facto head of both the High Court-appointed committees, also took a strong objection to the procrastination by the respective district committees in resolving complaints of environmental violations and directed them to file their reports.CIDCO refused to comment on the development stating that it is always committed to conserving the environment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-high-court-appointed-panel-refuses-to-accept-cidco-contention-that-panje-is-not-wetland-101643289476695.html
27-01-2022||Mumbai||2 ATS officers attend Malegaon blast trial to ‘help’ NIA; Pragya Thakur objects||MUMBAI: Two officers of Maharashtra’s Anti-Terrorism Squad turned up at a Mumbai court to attend the trial in the 2008 Malegaon bomb blast but had to leave soon after in view of objections from lawyers of some of the accused including Bharatiya Janata Party’s Bhopal MP, Pragya Singh Thakur aka Sadhvi Pragya.The surprise appearance of the two ATS officers comes a fortnight after Maharashtra home minister Dilip Walse Patil’s statement that the ATS will appoint a lawyer to assist the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in the 2008 Malegaon bomb blast trialMohan Kulkarni and Dinkar Mohite, the two officers who attended Thursday’s proceedings in Mumbai’s special NIA court, investigated the case before the Centre ordered the NIA to take over the probe in 2011.The two officers told special NIA judge Prashant R Sitre that they have verbal orders from their senior officers to attend the trial on a day-to-day basis.Lawyer Jaiprakash Mishra, who is appearing for two of the seven accused in the case, Pragya Singh Thakur and Ajay Rahirkar, however, promptly objected to their presence. Mishra said the ATS officers didn’t have a locus standi in the case and might influence the witnesses if they are present in the court.Viral Babbar, counsel for another accused, Col Prasad Purohit, and other defence lawyers also objected to the presence of the ATS officers.Accused Sameer Kulkarni, however, maintained that the trial should continue in open court, in which anyone can attend the proceedings.To be sure, special judge Sitre’s predecessor, VS Padalkar, in October 2019 rejected requests by NIA to hold the trial in-camera that would have implied that no one other than the accused and their lawyers, prosecution and witnesses can be present. Pragya Thakur had supported NIA on this request but the judge made it clear that he intended to conduct the proceedings in a “transparent manner”.As the defence lawyers objected to the presence of ATS officers, NIA officers told the court that they didn’t have any instructions about the presence of ATS in court and can get back with the agency’s position only after ATS submits a written letter to the court.Thereafter, ATS officers left the court, saying that they will bring a written letter from their seniors to attend the proceedings on the next date of hearing, January 31.Home minister Dilip Walse Patil’s offer to designate lawyers to help NIA was made after multiple witnesses turned hostile in the bomb blast case.Six people were killed and over 100 injured when an explosive device strapped to a motorcycle went off near a mosque in Malegaon in north Maharashtra on September 29, 2008.Sayyed Nisar Ahmed, who lost his son Sayyed Azhar Nisar Ahmed, 20, in the blast, has already made a formal request to the judge through his lawyer Shahid Nadeem that NIA take help from the ATS team that once investigated the case.Of the 224 witnesses examined by the prosecution, 16 have turned hostile in the trial which started on November 2, 2018. The prosecution has submitted a list of around 286 witnesses that include doctors, police officials, forensic experts and independent witnesses.The court framed charges against the seven accused for terror, criminal conspiracy and murder under the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA).The accused facing trial in the case are Col Purohit, politician Pragya Singh Thakur alias Sadhvi Pragya, Major (retired) Ramesh Upadhyay, Ajay Rahirkar, Sudhakar Dwivedi, Sudhakar Chaturvedi and Sameer Kulkarni.Congress leader Arif Naseem Khan met Maharashtra ATS chief Vineet Agarwal on January 13, demanding that the ATS appoint its officers and law officers to join the trial, alleging that NIA was not prosecuting the accused with honesty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/2-ats-officers-attend-malegaon-blast-trial-to-help-nia-pragya-thakur-objects-101643289058166.html

Also read: Punjab elections: BJP releases second list of 27 candidatesKhaira had moved the court seeking bail on December 13. A Mohali court had dismissed his plea on December 7. The order was passed by the high court bench of justice Sureshwar Thakur. The detailed order is awaited. The central probe agency had raided his premises in March 2021. Proceedings have been initiated in connection with a first information report (FIR) registered in 2015. A court had convicted four persons and by the same order, Khaira was summoned as additional accused. Khaira claimed political vendetta In December 2017, the Supreme Court had stayed his summoning. Khaira, who joined Congress in June 2021, has all along maintained that these proceedings are a part of political vendetta. Khaira claimed that the ED’s action was a case of witch hunt as he had been vocal against the three farm laws, later repealed by the Centre. The ED had initiated proceedings under Prevention of Money Laundering Act in January, even as there was a stay from the Supreme Court in the 2015 matter, he had claimed. The ED on the other hand opposed the bail and further claimed that he was an accomplice of drug case convicts and fake passport racketeers. The ED has also been claiming that he did not cooperate during custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/money-laundering-case-hc-grants-bail-to-congress-leader-sukhpal-khaira-101643284556152.html
27-01-2022||Pune||Bail application of Hinjewadi waqf land case suspect rejected||PUNE A Pune court has rejected the bail application of Mohammmad Ishraq Khan alias Zarip Khan, a prime suspect in ₹9.64 crore Hinjewadi waqf land case, also being investigated by the Enforcement Directorate.Additional Sessions Judge PR Ashturkar observed in his order that the applicant had played a prominent role in the commission of offence.“The account statements filed on record clearly leaves behind every single trail of the flow of money from different accounts. Needless to say, this was as per the instructions of the present applicant only. The government deals which are used for commission of forgery are also yet to be seized. Thus, in a given set of facts and circumstances the presence of the applicant with police for custodial interrogation seems necessary. Without his custodial interrogation, the prosecution case cannot be unfurled thoroughly. Hence, order is application stands rejected,” the judge observed.According to the prosecution, Zarip is the mastermind behind the entire plan and has facilitated economical and other support to the main accused. He gave his reference for opening a new account in the bank and after creating a bogus account of Taboot Trust, Zarip siphoned huge amounts.. He transferred ₹ 27,500,000 in the account of his wife out of which ₹14,500,000 were used to purchase one flat in Privilege Society in Pune, the prosecution stated.The defence counsel argued on behalf of the applicant that he has not committed any offence as alleged. The High Court had granted protection to his wife and son. As such, in the same analogy, the present applicant is also entitled for bail. It was further argued that, applicant is a senior citizen and is ready to co-operate with the investigation. He is also ready to abide by conditions, if any imposed by court while granting bail.BOX: What the FIR statesAccording to the FIR, Taboot Inam Endowment Trust,which is registered with the Waqf board, owns eight hectares 57.1 R land at Gat no. 335/1 in Maan village in Mulshi taluka of Pune district. The state government acquired five hectares 51 R land out of the total land for the Rajiv Gandhi IT Park. The government were supposed to give around ₹9.64 crore to the trust in return and accordingly the government had released an amount of ₹7.73 crore. The amount was siphoned off by the accused who prepared bogus documents and resorted to cheating the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/bail-application-of-hinjewadi-waqf-land-case-suspect-rejected-101643284435872.html
27-01-2022||Lucknow||BJP has narrow mindset of making youth sell ‘pakoras’: Mayawati||Amidst continuing unrest among railway job aspirants in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, BSP chief Mayawati on Thursday accused the BJP of having a narrow mindset of making the youth sell “pakoras”.“There has been a huge uproar in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar over UPTNT and now over Railways' RRB-NTPC results, this is a proof of the failure of the governments. Beating up poor and unemployed youths for protesting, and playing with their future is totally unjustified,” she said in a tweet in Hindi.“Due to the wrong policies of the government, poverty and unemployment have reached the peak. Government jobs and reservation facility in them have become secondary. In such a situation, it is unjust to not have the examination even for small government jobs for years. BJP should change its narrow mindset of making the youth sell ‘pakoras’ (snacks)," she added.Mayawati was apparently referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s comments during an interview to a TV news channel in 2018 that selling pakoras is also a form of employment and can be seen in the light of “job creation”.Meanwhile, the railways had on Wednesday suspended its Non Technical Popular Categories (NTPC) and Level 1 exams after candidates went on a rampage in some states alleging irregularities in the process, whilst minister Ashwini Vaishnaw urged them not to destroy public property and assured redressal of their grievances.On Tuesday, the railways had issued a general notice, warning its job aspirants that those found involved in vandalism and unlawful activities while protesting would be barred from ever getting recruited in the railways. This came a day after protesters squatted on railway tracks in several places in Bihar.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had also condemned the "repression" of candidates and urged the government to find a solution to their problems through dialogue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-has-narrow-mindset-of-making-youth-sell-pakoras-mayawati-101643278415803.html

The target is to install total 500 in the next few months," he said at the ceremony organised near Delhi University campus in Timarpur assembly constituency."I have been told that in no city, tricolours (national flags) on flagpoles of this height have been installed on such a large scale. We will get it examined if it qualifies for a Guinness world record,  Kejriwal said.These high-mast national flags are being set up at public places like parks, big school buildings, market complexes, residential complexes, grounds, road roundabouts, among others.  Some of the locations where the 115 ft high tricolours have been installed include AIIMS roundabout, near Signature Bridge, Dhaula Kuan Enclave-2, Mall Road, Outer Ring Road, Pitampura, Delhi Cantonment, Rajiv Gandhi Stadium, near the Azadpur Metro Station, among others.Till August 15, 2021, the PWD had installed high-mast national flags at five locations in the city, that is, at East Kidwai Nagar, Rani Bagh, Patparganj, Kalkaji and Dwarka.The total number of high-mast tricolours in the city is now 80. The chief minister said the aim behind the move is that the national flag is visible to every citizen two to three times a day when they step out for work.“Many a times, we are caught up in our daily lives to an extent that we forget our country and the society. This tricolour will make us remember about those who sacrificed everything for the independence of the country. This will instil a sense of patriotism among people,” he said. The installation of high-mast national flags is being done by the Public Works Department (PWD) under Delhi government's 'Deshbhakti Budget' to celebrate India's 75 year of Independence.Under the project, installation of high-mast tricolours at 500 locations is to be done. Kejriwal said all these 500 flags were to be set up by this Republic Day, but due to ban on construction activities owing to rising pollution and coronavirus pandemic, the project was delayed. “Remaining tricolours will be set up in next few months,” he said.He said these tricolours will be erected in a way that those are visible at every 2-3 kilometres.In March last year, the Delhi government had announced its annual budget themed on patriotism and named Deshbhakti budget under which ₹45 crore were set aside to install high-mast tricolours at 500 locations across the national capital.Later in September last year, the AAP government had increased the budget and approved an amount of ₹104.37 crore for the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kejriwal-unfurls-115-ft-high-tricolour-to-mark-75th-year-of-independence-101643274184746.html

Schools and educational institutions, however, will still remain closed until further orders and a decision on this front will be taken at the DDMA’s next meeting. Thursday’s decision on the partial easing of curbs in the Capital will be implemented once the DDMA issues a formal order.Also, the daily night curfew from 10pm to 5am will remain in place, but bars and restaurants will be allowed to reopen with 50% capacity, and a maximum of 200 people will be allowed to attend weddings. Experts present at the DDMA meeting suggested a phased reopening of Delhi’s schools. In the first phase, schools from classes 9-12 should be reopened, then classes 5-8 in the second phase, followed by classes 3-4 in the third phase, they advised.“The existing restrictions were discussed at length in the [DDMA] meeting, but it was decided that the government cannot let all curbs end at once. The relaxations will be allowed in a phased manner. The other restrictions will be reviewed in the next meeting, including the reopening of schools,” a source told HT. The Covid-19 test positivity rate in Delhi has been steadily climbing down for the last few days. On Wednesday, Delhi added 7,498 cases, which were 10.59% of the 70,804 tests that were conducted that day, according to the state government’s health bulletin. The DDMA’s meeting on the pandemic situation was attended by top health experts, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, deputy CM Manish Sisodia, NITI Aayog member Dr V K Paul, health minister Satyendar Jain, DG ICMR Balram Bhargava and several top officials. Lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, who is the chairman of the DDMA, chaired the meeting.

Schools in the Capital have been closed since December 28. Sisodia on Wednesday said it was crucial to reopen schools as the pandemic-induced closure was widening the learning gap. In Thursday’s DDMA meeting, the Aam Aadmi Party government pushed for the reopening of schools. In Delhi, orders to close private offices were issued on January 11, a day after the city barred the last of non-essential activities, such as dining out. On January 21, the DDMA allowed private offices to reopen with 50% on-site staff, but ordered that weekend and night curfews would continue in the Capital. The DDMA order came despite a request from the Capital’s government that sought the curbs to be rolled back with the Covid-19 situation steadily improving. Traders had been opposing the DDMA’s decision and were demanding that the curbs be lifted immediately. Many trader associations have written to the LG Baijal, seeking the withdrawal of the curbs. Delhi’s BJP leaders also called upon Baijal last Tuesday and demanded that the weekend and night curfew should be withdrawn, while odd-even restrictions should also be lifted. Brijesh Goyal, chairman of the Chamber of Trader and Industry, an association of traders, welcomed the decision of the DDMA and thanked the Delhi government for pushing for the lifting of curbs so that the business community gets a relief. “It was making it difficult for traders to survive and keep supporting their staff because many shops could not open for more than two days due to the curbs. Now that the curbs have been lifted, the business community will get relief,” said Goyal. Community medicine experts supported the decision. Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital, said, “The government has taken the right decision to lift the curbs. Since the test positivity rate has been dipping and has reduced to almost 10%, keeping the strict curbs like weekend and night curfew and restrictions on commercial activities was not an ideal move.” During his Republic Day speech, Delhi CM Kejriwal had assured traders that the curbs would be lifted soon.

In a letter to chief secretary Amir Subhani, Chouhan’s principal secretary Robert L Chongthu cited the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act and said they were not being followed. It added it has been brought to the notice of the chancellor and the letter has been written as per his directions. “It is not only violation of the Act, but also infringement on the autonomy of universities and creating an atmosphere of fear on the campuses to derail normal functioning.”The letter came a day after the rejection of anticipatory bail application of Magadh University vice-chancellor Rajendra Prasad, who has been on medical leave soon since the raided his residences in Bodh Gaya and Gorakhpur in connection with ₹30-crore corruption case. The SVU is directly approaching universities for documents related to important decisions and financial matters, while the Act stipulates a proper channel to be followed in such matters to obtain prior sanction from competent authority,” the letter said.Subhani said that the letter was being examined.

27-01-2022||Chandigarh||Drugs case: Don’t arrest Majithia till Monday, Supreme Court tells Punjab govt||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday asked the Punjab government not to arrest Shiromani Akali Dal leader Bikram Singh Majithia in an alleged drugs case till Monday.As a bench headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana agreed to hear Majithia’s appeal against denial of anticipatory bail by the Punjab and Haryana high court, it said the state should wait till it hears the matter on Monday.Senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi, representing Majithia, mentioned the matter for an urgent listing before the bench, which includes justices AS Bopanna and Hima Kohli.“This is a case of political vendetta. They want him to be arrested during the election fever,” Rohatgi, assisted by a team of counsel from law firm Karanjawala & Co., complained.“What election fever, Mr Rohatgi? This is election virus. Everyone is rushing to courts now, “ the bench retorted.Rohatgi sought an interim order to protect his client from arrest till the next date of hearing. He added Majithia’s petition for anticipatory bail was rejected on January 24 and he was given protection only for three days. He added it was expiring on Thursday while seeking the protection.Senior advocate P Chidambaram, who appeared for the Punjab government, alleged Majithia has been in hiding since he was refused the relief by the high court.The bench told Chidambaram the state should not take any coercive step against Majithia since the top court has agreed to list his matter for hearing. “Mr Chidambaram, tell your state not to do anything till Monday when we hear him,” said the bench.Chidambaram said he would convey the court’s message to state authorities.The dismissal of Majithia’s bail plea came a day before the filing of nomination papers was to commence in Punjab. Majithia plans to contest from Majitha constituency in Amritsar district.Majithia, who is facing a case under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, was earlier granted interim bail by the high court on a condition that he will cooperate in the investigation.The state government opposed the continuation of this relief before the high court contending Majithia has not extended full cooperation during the probe.Majithia claimed that the case was registered against him in view of the elections. He added the sole intention of registering it was to take him into custody and torture him.In his appeal filed before the top court, Majithia called the case a blatant abuse of power and linked it to political vengeance ahead of elections. He maintained there is no credible evidence against him and that he has been cooperating with the investigators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dont-arrest-majithia-till-monday-sc-tells-punjab-101643267692899.html

The development was confirmed by the counsel from the government side as well. HC dismissed bail plea on January 24 On January 24, the Punjab and Haryana high court granted three days’ protection from arrest to Majithia but dismissed his anticipatory bail plea. Majithia had moved the high court after he failed to get anticipatory bail from a Mohali court on December 24. The high court while dismissing the bail plea had observed that that “complete and thorough investigation should not be a casualty in this political slugfest, especially keeping in view the grave and serious charges of drug trade”. “It cannot be denied that the petitioner indeed was at the helm of affairs at the time of occurrence of alleged offence(s),” the high court said. Majithia is the brother-in-law of SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal, who was the Punjab deputy chief minister till 2017. The drug racket case was unearthed in 2013 and allegations against Majithia had cropped up by 2014.

On the other hand, Punjab Police, have maintained that the government machinery was used for the benefit of drug cartels during the Akali regime in the state. Majithia was a key minister in the Akali government and it was during the SAD’s term that the cartel was unearthed, the police claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-drugs-case-sc-stays-akali-leader-bikram-majithia-s-arrest-till-monday-101643265052162.html

It added despite the repeated lockdown on account of the pandemic, the annual average values of PM2.5 and PM10 of all studied 10 south Indian cities exceeded the WHO’s revised standards.With over 12 million population, Bengaluru has nearly 10 million vehicles in an area of around 800 square km. Bad roads, poor planning, and increasing private vehicles have led to the rapid degradation in the quality of life in Bengaluru, which was once known as India’s garden city. The vehicular movement is so slow that the city gained global notoriety when it was adjudged to have the world’s worst traffic, according to a report by the Netherlands-based TomTom index.According to the ninth edition of the Annual Traffic Index by TomTom, a global provider of navigation, traffic, and map products, Bengaluru emerged top of the list beating 415 other cities across 57 countries in 2019.“Bengaluru takes the top spot this year with drivers in the southern Indian city expecting to spend an average of 71% extra travel time stuck in traffic,” said a TomTom report.Vehicular emissions are the biggest contributor to air pollution followed by construction in Bengaluru.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/bengalurus-pollution-levels-higher-than-who-standards-report-101643262711857.html

The active caseload in Delhi dropped by more than 50% within 12 days after it reached a peak of 94,160 on January 13. During the second Covid wave, it took 21 days for the active caseload to decline by half.Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said that the government will recommend the reopening of schools as excessive caution is now harming students. While the Covid cases and positivity rate are on the decline, Sisodia said, it would not be suitable to keep children away from schools, reported PTI.“During Covid, our priority was children's safety. But since various researches have now found that Covid is not so harmful for kids, it is important to reopen the schools, as now is the time for exams and related preparations," Sisodia, who holds the education portfolio, added.Delhi’s lieutenant governor Anil Baijal will chair the DDMA meeting to discuss the reopening of schools.

27-01-2022||Delhi||Calm in a teacup||Such a small place, but packed with so many points of interests. Delhi’s greatest poet, Mirza Ghalib, is buried here. So is the legendary poet and musician, Amir Khusro. This place is also home to the beautiful tomb of Atgah Khan, a noble in Akbar’s court. The white marble Chausath Khamba, Delhi’s only Jehangir-era architectural souvenir, is also here. Then there is the enigmatic Barakhamba monument. And, of course, the heart of Nizamuddin Basti beats in the Sufi shrine of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya, from whom this central Delhi village takes its name.You might have already been to these places. But now you have to come here to have a taste of Delhi’s most amazing chai. Apologies, it is tea - it has no milk. Every evening, Mr Mukhtar walks down the Basti’s lanes with the tea thermos in his hand. Almost every shopkeeper, fakir, flower seller, ittar seller, biryani hawker, barber, labourer, butcher, veggie seller, mask seller and beggar living in the area is a fan of his tea.“It is called lemon tea,” he explains.What’s the big deal? You might wonder. The thing is, it’s not the tea per se, but it’s the crucial embellishments that Mr Mukhtar makes to the piping hot brew.This icy cold evening, while making a customary round of Mirza Ghalib Street, Mr Mukhtar parks himself on one side of the lane (outside a Covid vaccination clinic) and generously reveals his recipe. It is very simple, he says with modesty. “I start the preparation in my room.” He lives in the Basti. “I heat water in a large pan, then I add normal chai patti to it, along with sugar, some black salt, some ginger, some laung and some kaali mirch. Then I keep the whole thing on boil for some time.”The concoction is finally transferred to a thermos that keeps it hot, after which Mr Mukhtar hits the lanes. His final touch to the tea occurs at the point of serving. Right now, attending to a flower seller, he pours the tea into a paper cup — and the steam comes out instantly. He sprinkles a pinch of “jeera and kaalaa namak roasted together”. (The spices go first!)The first sip itself starts the magic. The familiar flavour of lemon tea is interlaced with a soothing whiff of spices that freshens the palate and leaves a nice, pungent sensation in the throat. A feeling of intense relaxation courses through the body. This is just what you needed, you’ll realise.Nevertheless it is astonishing that such a watery spiced tea is managing to survive in a city that celebrates the sweet milky chai, malai maar ke. “They both have their place in the world,” says Mr Mukhtar judiciously.A native of Bihar, he worked in Delhi as a labourer for more than a decade, and started his evening chai service five years ago. He operates daily from 4pm to 8pm. Walk along the Basti lanes and look out for him. He tends to pop up like a djinn from a random turning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/calm-in-a-teacup-101643230390435.html
27-01-2022||Delhi||Hansraj students protest ‘cow shelter’||A cow shelter was being set up under the guise of setting up a centre for research on cow products, students of Delhi University’s Hansraj College have alleged.The students, who launched an online petition against the centre, said the college authorities have set up a “gaushala” in the name of Swami Dayanand Cow-Protection and Research Centre on the college premises. They also claimed that the land on which the centre has come up was reserved for a women’s hostel.College principal Rama Sharma refuted the allegations, and said that one cow in a shed doesn’t mean that the college has set up a gaushala.“We only have one cow at the centre for research purposes. Cow dung, cow milk, and other cow products will be used for research at the facility. If we wanted to set up a gaushala, we would have used a bigger area for the facility. We saw that the demand for cow products increased a lot during Covid. Cow dung is being used a lot in many ways nowadays. Our students could engage in cow-related research and innovation. We could start a plant to produce cow-dung rich manure in college or other new interventions,” said Sharma.Members of Students Federation of India (SFI), Hansraj unit, which initiated the online petition, however, said that there was no space for the “gaushala” on a college campus.“We, the students of Hansraj, unconditionally condemn and protest the construction of a gaushala, dubbed as a Swami Dayanand Cow-Protection and Research Centre at the very site which was reserved for a women’s hostel whose construction has been on hold for many years now,” the online petition said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hansraj-students-protest-cow-shelter-101643230099681.html

It is a “severe cold day” if the maximum is 6.5 degrees or more below the normal mark. Similarly for “cold wave” conditions to be declared, the minimum temperature should either be 4.5 degrees or more below the normal mark, or it should be 4 degrees Celsius or lower.IMD scientist RK Jenamani said the maximum temperature is expected to rise gradually, with an active western disturbance likely to raise the temperature further from January 28.“By the end of the month, the maximum temperature will touch 19°C, but for the next three days, we may see the minimum fall to around 4-5°C. The maximum temperature may hover around 16-17°C for the next two days, with a rise expected from January 29,” he said, adding that the dip in minimum temperature was a result of colder winds from the snow-clad mountains blowing towards Delhi.Delhi’s average maximum temperature for the month has been hovering at 17.6°C – 2.4 degrees below the normal. Met officials say that at present, Delhi is on course to record its coldest January since 2003, when the average maximum temperature for the month was also 17.6°C.Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of just 12.1 degrees on Tuesday, which was 10 degrees below the normal mark. This was Delhi’s coldest day of the season and the coldest January day in the last nine years, since it fell to 9.8°C on January 3, 2013.

27-01-2022||Noida||Jan 12-18 witnesses highest positivity rate in Ghaziabad||The district has reported the highest weekly test positivity rate during January 12-18 since the first week of December last year when the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic started, according to an analysis of the official records shared by the Ghaziabad health department. The week of January 12-18 had a positivity rate of 15.62% with 69,396 tests yielding 10,843 positive cases, the data shows. The first week (1-7) of December witnessed a positivity rate of just 0.03% and the rate continued to increase in following weeks with the highest recorded during January 12-18. The latest week of January 19-25 ended with lower positivity of 12.77% with 57,012 tests yielding 7,278 positive cases, according to the data. Officials from the district health department said on Wednesday that they are witnessing a declining trend. “During the previous week, the positivity remained high but it has started to decline now. We are witnessing a declining trend, but it is erratic as cases sometimes go up while they come down on other occasions. So, we need to observe the trend further for about a week or 10 days when we can actually say that there is a certain decline. We are focussing more on RT-PCR tests nowadays,” said Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar, chief medical officer (CMO), Ghaziabad. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, Ghaziabad recorded 504 new Covid-19 cases which took the overall tally to 80,776 since the start of the pandemic while 24,862 of them have come in January this year, according to the state health bulletin. However, the positivity rate declined to 6.54% on Wednesday from 10.83% a day earlier. Now, the district has 3,651 active cases. The district on Wednesday also recorded one more Covid-related fatality of a 51-year-old man from Nandgram locality. The officials said that the patient had comorbidities such as heart disease, hypertension and diabetes. With the death, the overall tally of the deaths has gone up to 468 which include seven in January this year. “In most of the death cases, the aggravating factors are co-morbid conditions and also people aged over 60 years. So, it is vital that this group of people get themselves vaccinated,” said the CMO. Experts said that the cases are definitely on a decline. “It seems that the peak has got over. The cases are still emerging but patients are recovering in 3-4 days with mild symptoms. Those who died were the ones who did not receive any vaccination or had comorbid conditions,” said Dr Ashish Aggarwal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter).

27-01-2022||Noida||Congress candidate hands over affidavit of promises to Greater Noida West residents||The Congress candidate from Dadri assembly seat, Deepak Bhati Chotiwala, on Wednesday handed over an affidavit to residents of Greater Noida West, promising to fulfil their demands if he wins the elections. One of the major demands of voters in this area is the resolution of homebuyers’ issues, which include delays in registration and possession of flats. According to representatives of the Noida Extension Flat Owner’s Welfare Association (NEFOWA) that comprises troubled homebuyers as well as residents of Greater Noida West, there are at least one lakh homebuyers who are either awaiting possession or registration of their flats.The residents’ association had demanded that the Dadri candidates should hand over a list of their promises on an affidavit so that later they are held accountable for it. “We have been suffering for years now. Whenever an election is held, the candidates promise to fulfil our demands but forget about their promises once they are voted to power. Hence, this time, we demanded from all party candidates in Dadri that they should mention their promises in writing on a stamp paper and give the affidavit to us,” said Abhishek Kumar, president of NEFOWA. Chotiwala became the first candidate to comply with the residents’ demand for an affidavit. The affidavit handed over by him says, “I promise to fulfil the following demands of homebuyers if I win the assembly polls. These include resolution of flat registry issues, possession of flats and other issues of the residents.” The Congress candidate said that no matter what the result of the elections is, he will continue to support and help the homebuyers. “I have had several dialogues with homebuyers and members of NEFOWA. It is sad that their issues have not been resolved so far. However, I have taken a pledge to resolve these issues once I win the elections from the Dadri seat. Even if I do not, I will still continue to help them in any capacity I can,” said Chotiwala. Tejpal Nagar of the Bharatiya Janata Party, who currently represents the constituency, was unavailable for comment.Raj Kumar Bhati, Samajwadi Party’s Dadri candidate, said, “Though I have met them, I am not aware of the residents’ demand for an affidavit. But I want to assure the residents that my promises to them are not hollow.”
27-01-2022||Gurugram||HSVP employees asked to resolve complaints, answer RTIs on time||Following complaints by several plot buyers regarding delays in the issuance of completion certificates, transfer permissions and other documents, the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) issued directions to its officials to ensure that applications and other services are processed as mandated by the Right to Service Act.The Haryana Right to Service Act is meant to reduce corruption among government officials and to increase transparency and public accountability. It provides a framework for the timebound delivery of services by various government departments. Under this Act, 16 services of HSVP are to be delivered within five to 30 days. For instance, the Act mandates that HSVP should sanction building plans within 30 days, issue completion and occupation certificates within 30 days, accord transfer permissions within 30 days, sanction water supply and sewage connections within 20 days and issue water connections within five days.HSVP also asked officials to promptly reply to Right To Information (RTI) queries and service CM Window complaints timely.In a meeting held last week, Jitender Kumar, estate officer II, directed officials to track CM Window complaints everyday and also ensure that RTI replies are given within the prescribed time. Kumar also said that office work, updating of files and related activities are completed within the Right to Service timeline.During the meeting, the estate officer also directed that recovery of outstanding dues should be tracked daily and the accounts department must issue notices regularly.“Master data of all sectors with details of all plots, demarcated plans, allotted plots, vacant and clear plots, resumed, cancelled and surrendered plots should be prepared from record files,” he said.He also asked HSVP employees to ensure a high level of honesty and integrity. “Any complaint of corrupt practices or their direct or indirect involvement will be viewed seriously,” the estate officer II said in the meeting.“There have been a lot of delays in the transfer permission of properties. The updating of files is not happening and plots under quota are also stuck due to delays,” said Narender Yadav, president, Gurugram Home Developers and Plot Owners Association.Yadav said that the estate management activities of the authority should be streamlined to help allottees. “A large number of plot buyers are expecting the authority to expedite work as repeated visits to their office are not possible due to Covid-related curbs,” he said.Sandeep Lot, junior engineer, HSVP, said that the authority will focus on removing encroachments and clearing the land it owns in the next few months. “The problems faced by people regarding delays will also be resolved. We have been working on clearing the land from encroachments in the last few months,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/hsvp-employees-asked-to-resolve-complaints-answer-rtis-on-time-101643226529807.html
27-01-2022||Noida||Ghaziabad: Independents have tough fight on hand||As the election campaign for the five assembly seats in Ghaziabad hots up, independent candidates, as well as candidates from lesser-known parties, will face off against heavyweights from well-known political parties.  According to district records, there were only two occasions since 1976-- when the district was created-- when an independent candidate won the assembly elections. The last time was in 2007 when Rajpal Tyagi won the Muradnagar seat by a margin of 3,020 votes against his nearest rival, Wahab (referred to by his first name on the Election Commission of India website), of the Bahujan Samaj Party. Prior to that, Tyagi had won the same seat in 1989, after defeating his nearest rival, also an independent, Vivek (referred to by his first name on the Election Commission website), by a margin of 7,681 votes.Before the district was created, independents in the region had won twice. According to Election Commission records, GS Chaudhri won as an independent in the 1967 assembly elections from the Muradnagar seat, while Meghnath Singh Shishodia won as an independent from the Dasna seat in 1962.This year, Ghaziabad goes to polls on February 10 under phase 1 of the seven-phase Uttar Pradesh assembly election. The district has five assembly seats of Loni, Muradnagar, Sahibabad, Ghaziabad and Modinagar--comprising 2,899,484 eligible voters-- including a part of Dhaulana constituency in Hapur district. Before November 14, 1976, Ghaziabad was a tehsil of the Meerut district and included Hapur as well. Hapur was declared a separate district in 2011. This election, only 14 independent candidates, whose nominations were cleared during the scrutiny process on January 24, are contesting the five seats in Ghaziabad. These include one candidate each from Loni and Modinagar, two from Muradnagar, four from Sahibabad, and six from Ghaziabad. The number is a reduction from the 2017 assembly elections, when two of the six candidates contesting from Loni were independents while three of 11 candidates from Sahibabad were independents. From Ghaziabad, five of 13 contesting candidates were independent, while seven of 14 candidates who contested from Muradnagar were independents. From Modinagar, three of the nine candidates were independents.The 2007 elections had seen even more independents contest -- for the three seats in the district then-- 13 of 27 candidates contesting from Ghaziabad were independents, while five of 13 candidates from Modinagar were independents. From Muradnagar, four of 11 candidates were independents.Making the competition tougher for independent candidates is a general lack of resources, something that major parties provide their candidates with in abundance.“I decided to contest as an independent as I have been doing social work for the past seven or eight years and am connected to the people in my constituency. However, candidates from major political parties have more resources and have been in politics for years. Also, campaigning becomes difficult for people like me who have day jobs and have to go to the office every day,” said Sudhir Kumar, an independent from the Ghaziabad seat. “I did not try to seek a ticket from any political party as their candidates have to abide by party policies. On the other hand, I want to focus on my constituency’s issues such as bad roads, the need for a hospital and a degree college,” he said. “There are many reasons why independents generally do not put up a good show. It is mainly because political parties have a lot of funds and resources that independents do not have. They also invoke and utilise caste and religion to divide voters,” said Dr Sapna Bansal, a Delhi University professor and an independent candidate from Sahibabad.According to experts, apart from resources and funds, independents generally do not put up a good show as they do not have many workers at their disposal for campaigning. “In present times, a political party is successful because it has a large base of booth-level workers who canvas for the candidates. Parties or people who don’t have booth-level workers, suffer defeat in elections. Further, the trend to vote for a candidate is slowly fading away and people now generally vote for parties. Instances of independents or candidates of lesser-known parties winning a seat are few and far between,” said KK Sharma, associate professor (history) at MM College in Modinagar.This time around, however, the pandemic and its related curbs also played affected the chances of independent candidates. several independents who contested the 2017 elections said they would not contest this year as the pandemic-related restrictions would make it difficult to garner support, both politically and monetarily.“It is not easy to contest elections as an independent -- we have to find funds for campaigning. Further, over a period of time, independent candidates have also understood that people vote more for political parties. Not to mention the difficulty in campaigning during a pandemic. All these factors are holding back independent candidates this time,” said Rajiv Sharma, who contested the 2017 elections as an independent from Sahibabad.This year, the major candidates who cleared the scrutiny process include the candidates fielded by major political parties such as the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Congress, Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party-Rashtriya Lok Dal combine. The last date for withdrawal of nominations is Thursday, when it is expected that some more independent candidates could pull out of the race. 
27-01-2022||Noida||Noida: SP-RLD uses Mihir Bhoj row to get Gurjar votes in Jewar||Samajwadi Party-Rashtriya Lok Dal (SP-RLD) alliance candidate Avtar Singh Bhadana’s supporters are using the King Mihir Bhoj issue during campaigning to unite Gurjar voters in the Jewar assembly segment. Bhadana, a Gurjar himself, is taking on incumbent MLA and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate Dhirendra Singh, who belongs to the Rajput community, in what political experts believe is going to be a tough fight.In September 2021, a row was triggered after the caste name of Gurjar was removed from the plaque beneath the statue of King Mihir Bhoj that was erected at a college in Dadri, about 20km away from Jewar. The 15-foot statue of the ninth-century ruler was unveiled by chief minister Yogi Adityanath on September 22, 2021. Soon after the event, Gurjars started a series of protest after their caste name was dropped from the plaque. Later, the community formed a group to fight for the inclusion of the caste on the plaque and also decided to vote against BJP in these assembly polls. Bhadana and his supporters are raising this issue at village meetings to mobilise Gurjar voters in his favour, sources said.There are at least 50,000 Gurjar voters, of a total around 3.2 lakh (320,000) voters in Jewar. The Rajput community has about 70,000 voters and the BJP is anticipating a tough fight from the SP-RLD candidate. Bhadana supporters, meanwhile, are also banking on 20,000 Muslim voters and the 24,000 Jat voters to win the seat.“If Gurjars are united for the alliance candidate, then Bhadana will do well, provided Muslims and Jats also consolidate in his favour. Keeping Gurjar voters together is a challenging task for Bhadana, but raking up the Mihir Bhoj issue may help achieve that, especially if the BJP is unable to counter it properly,” said Tikam Singh, a political expert and a social activist.Bhadana was not available for comment despite repeated attempts to reach him.Trilok Tyagi, national general secretary, Rashtriya Lok Dal, said, “We are fighting the election on wider issues that include unemployment, injustice to farmers, inflation, injustice to weaker sections and low compensation to farmers in lieu of land acquired for the airport project in Jewar, among others. We are winning this election because of the BJP’s misrule over the last five years. It is the BJP that is using caste and religion to divide and win. We neither talk of caste during campaigning, nor do we organise caste based events the way the BJP does.” Countering him, MLA Singh said, “We are fighting this election on the issue of development for all communities unlike the SP-RLD that is using caste and religion. Voters of Jewar are wise and understand the vicious games that the opposition parties are playing these elections. All community voters are with us because we have never discriminated against people on the basis of caste, religion or place. This election will teach a lesson to opposition parties, who want to divide people for votes.” This is the second time that Singh is contesting elections from Jewar on a BJP ticket. In 2012, he contested from Jewar on a Congress ticket and lost by 9,000 votes. Fighting on a BJP ticket in 2017, Singh won by over 22,000 votes.
27-01-2022||Gurugram||Gurugram’s minimum temperature to drop further as cold wave continues||The Gurugram’s minimum temperature is likely to drop further over the weekend, India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicted Wednesday, adding the cold wave is likely to continue till Saturday. According to IMD’s weekly forecast, Gurugram’s minimum temperature from Friday till Sunday is likely to hover around 4 degrees Celsius and the maximum temperature around 16 degrees Celsius.A cold wave is declared when the minimum temperature is less than 10 degrees Celsius and the maximum is at least 4.5 degrees Celsius below normal.On Wednesday, the city recorded a maximum temperature of 16.2 degrees Celsius, which was five degrees below normal for this time of year, and a minimum temperature of 6 degrees Celsius, which was one degree above normal. In the past 24 hours, Gurugram’s maximum temperature increased by 4.5 degrees due to a partially sunny day. On Tuesday, Gurugram recorded its coldest day of this season so far with a maximum temperature of 11.7 degrees Celsius--nine degrees below normal for this time of year.Manmohan Singh, the director of Meteorological Centre, Chandigarh, a regional centre of IMD, said, “Cold wave conditions are very likely to continue for the next three or four days in isolated pockets of Haryana, including districts such as Gurugram and Faridabad. During the next four days, a gradual fall in the region’s minimum temperature by three to five degrees is very likely. Dense fog conditions are also very likely in the night and morning, especially in open spaces.” The official said that a gradual rise in minimum temperature--by two or three degrees--is likely by next week. Meanwhile, Gurugram on Wednesday recorded “poor” air quality for the second consecutive day with an Air Quality Index (AQI) reading of 236 according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s 4pm bulletin. An AQI reading between 201 and 300 is considered “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.According to the weather bulletin issued by the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi-NCR, the air quality is likely to remain largely in the “poor” or “moderate” categories over the next few days due to moderate winds and better ventilation conditions which are likely to prevail for the next seven days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugrams-minimum-temperature-to-drop-further-as-cold-wave-continues-101643224727845.html
27-01-2022||Gurugram||Fake health officials dupe more than 500 persons across Haryana: Cops||The Haryana Police said they received over 500 complaints from people in several districts, saying they were duped by unidentified persons posing as health officials.The perpetrators would allegedly ask victims to register for a booster dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, share a one-time password (OTP) sent on their mobile phones, and then transfer money from the victims’ accounts to theirs.Police said there has been a significant rise in this booster dose scam over the last three months--the Gurugram police received 19 such complaints in November 2021, 27 in December 2021, and 33 in January so far. Similarly, Faridabad police received over 111 complaints since November 2021. Similar complaints have been filed in Hisar, Jind, Rohtak, Rewari, Palwal and Nuh, said police.KK Rao, commissioner of police, said that the suspects call people, pretending to be officials of the health department, ask for their vaccination status and tell them to register for a booster dose. “Once the person agrees, they send them an OTP and ask them to share it, following which money is transferred out from the victim’s account. In many cases, the perpetrators even send a registration link if the person has taken both doses, inform them of their eligibility for the booster dose and ask them to download applications for remote access and get all the details through their computers or laptops and dupe them,” he said.Rao said the suspects give the victims no time to check if the call is authentic or not and take advantage of the details they already have (of the victims’) with data of both the vaccinations.Police said gangs are majorly targeting senior citizens and people who are not tech-savvy so they can easily dupe them.Sameer Kapoor, a restaurant owner in DLF Phase 4, said that he received a call last week. The caller identified himself as a health official from Civil Hospital, Gurugram, and asked him if he was willing to register himself for the booster dose. “I checked on the Truecaller app, and it read Health Department, so I believed it, and when he sent an OTP and asked me to share it with him, I did. I was duped of ₹57,000. I have shared all details with the police,” he said.Suneel Rao, a resident of Sector 23, said that he was duped of ₹82,000 after he clicked on a link sent by the man posing as a health official. The man accessed Rao’s laptop remotely and transferred his money to other accounts. “The suspect called and shared details of both my vaccination status and my Aadhaar card. So I believed the call to be genuine.I followed his instructions then and clicked the link,” he said.On January 17, the health department had issued a statement warning people against the rise in fraudsters posing as officials from the department, calling people and asking them to get their booster doses. Officials said that the health department does not call people asking them to get vaccinated. The chief medical officer appealed to the residents to beware of such calls.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram said that such cases of fraud are being reported from different parts of the country. “No such calls are made by the health department and registration on the Co-Win portal is mandatory for the booster dose,” he said, adding that people should be careful while sharing their details and OTP with unidentified persons.

In the district, schools for classes 10 to 12 are scheduled to reopen from February 1.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram, said, “We are trying to vaccinate as many children as possible at the earliest. Almost 70% of teenagers in the district have been administered the first dose and we are trying to vaccinate the rest within one week. We are also waiting for revised population figures for this category from the state government, after which we will decide further action.”By January 31, several teenagers will be due for their second dose. This age group has been administeredCovaxin--there is supposed to be a gap of 28-42 days between both doses.The district health department had earlier set a target of January 10 to vaccinate all eligible teenagers with the first dose.Officials said they are hoping that the pace of vaccination increases in the next few days before schools reopen as vaccination is mandatory for students to attend classes. On January 15, Haryana health minister Anil Vij announced that children who have not taken the jab will not be allowed to enter schools across the state.On Wednesday, 686 doses were administered to beneficiaries in the district, including 152 first doses, 337 second doses and 197 booster doses. Gurugram has administered a total of 4,743,316 (over 4.74 million) vaccine doses to date. Eighteen children in the 15-18 age group received their first dose on Wednesday at private centres, as vaccination did not take place in government sites.Meanwhile, on Wednesday, Gurugram reported 2,261 fresh cases of Covid-19 and one death of a Covid patient due to comorbidities. The district recorded a positivity rate of 23.35%.“A 49-year-old fully vaccinated man who was being treated at a private hospital since January 4, passed away on Wednesday due to comorbidities.

27-01-2022||Gurugram||Schools in Gurugram to reopen on February 1||Schools in Gurugram will resume offline classes from February 1 for students in Class 10 and above while adhering to Covid-19 protocols,said district education officials. They added that only vaccinated students will be allowed to attend physical classes, the others can attend them online. Attending classes offline is optional and parents’ consent is mandatory, said officials. On Tuesday, Haryana education minister Kanwar Pal had tweeted: “Haryana government has decided to open schools for classes 10th, 11th and 12th from February 1, 2022.” On January 15, Haryana health minister Anil Vij announced on social media that unvaccinated children in the 15-18 age group will not be allowed to attend classes offline when schools reopen. On Wednesday, he said that it is important for all children to get vaccinated to ensure protection from Covid. “We want all the students and staff vaccinated and safe. Vaccination is for their own protection and they should not delay the vaccination. All schools have set up camps; and vaccines are available at all centres and hospitals so parents must ensure their wards are vaccinated,” he said. A senior education officer from the district said the government will fresh guidelines this week, and schools will have to follow all Covid-19 guidelines. If anyone violates the norms, strict action will be taken against them. After the second Covid wave subsided in Haryana in September 2021, the government agreed to reopen schools in Gurugram. However, schools were closed again on November 14 due to the region’s deteriorating air quality. They were reopened on November 26 as pollution dissipated a bit, but were again shut on January 2, 2022, due to a rise in the number of Covid-19 cases, and are now supposed to reopen on February 1. Government schools said they have not received any letter regarding the reopening and have only read the announcement on social media. However, they are prepared to reopen.Sunil Kumar Sharma, the principal of Government Girls Senior Secondary School, Jacobpura, said the school is prepared to resume classes and will follow safety measures and guidelines issued by the health department. The guidelines are still awaited. “In the meantime, we will ensure social distancing and the use of sanitiser at school. We will not allow more than 50% of the students to attend classes and will ensure all of them are vaccinated,” he said. Suman Sharma, principal, Government Model Senior Secondary School of sectors 4 and 7, said that they have not received any letter from the education department yet. “We will follow the department guidelines when they are issued and will reopen according to the directions. Ninety-nine per cent of our students has been vaccinated and 100% of our staff is vaccinated. Parents are willing to send their wards to school as their studies are suffering due to classes being confined to the online mode. For board preparation, students must attend physical classes to clear their doubts,” she said. Anju Sharma, the principal of Government Senior Secondary School, Basai, said that 800 students in the 15-18 age group were vaccinated within a week in the first week of January. “We are prepared to reopen classes from February 1. We will provide students with masks at the gate in case they forget to bring them, and monitor their temperature before they enter the school premises.We will sanitise classrooms twice a day and keep sanitiser in each classroom,” she said. Officials said students want to attend in-person classes as many of them, especially those in rural areas, face issues with online classes due to lack of access to technology. Several students also feel hey concentrate better during in-person classes. Aanya Gunwal, a student of a private school, said that she was vaccinated with the first dose and is anxiously waiting for schools to reopen. “It’s been very difficult to attend online classes teachers are unable to focus on all the students and solving problems becomes an issue. There are several distractions as well,” she said. Sandeep Kumar, the father of a 15- and 17-year-old, said his children’s studies have suffered a lot due to online classes. “Children play games and chat with their friends during online classes. There is no fear of teachers and moreover they are becoming lethargic at home. They are losing interest in studies ,” he said. Meanwhile, private schools have set up vaccination camps for their students and are coordinating with parents to ensure students appearing for board exams do not miss important classes. They have not received an official notification on the reopening either.Rashmi Malik, the principal of Salwan Public School, said that they have called teachers to school on Thursday to assess the status of their health. “As the infection has affected around 30% of our staff, we want to ensure everyone’s safety. We will reopen classes for students of Class 10 and above and call only half of them to school initially. Gradually, we will reopen for other classes to prepare students for final exams and we will follow Covid-19 protocols strictly,” she said. Alka Singh, the principal of Blue Bells Model School, Sector 4, said that it is not compulsory for students to attend offline classes. “We will follow all protocols and we are not forcing students to attend school. We will sanitise the school twice a day and ensure our staff is administered their booster doses as well,” she said.

The person on the other side said he had attempted to refund the money for the returned cellphone twice but failed,” Kumar said.He alleged that the conman then provided him with another number to call on the pretext of a network problem.“When I called the new number, he got me to download an application which gave him remote access to my phone,” he said.“The caller hacked into my phone and transferred ₹74,966 from my account in three transactions into different accounts,” he said.A police officer privy to the case said that cybercriminals advertise their contact numbers on the internet by paying charges to display them as customer care numbers of well-known e-commerce giants or travel websites.“People search for customer care numbers on the internet instead of searching on official websites, see these fake numbers and become victims of cybercrimes,” he said.He also said people from other states have also been duped after calling the same number which Kumar found on the internet. “We suspect the same gang behind all these crimes,” he added.Naveen Kumar, station house officer of Sector 10 police station, said police are investigating to find out from where the call was made.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/customer-care-number-turns-out-fake-gurugram-man-duped-of-75k-101643223347658.html
27-01-2022||Delhi||Biting chill but familiar winter fog eludes Delhi, least since 2008||January is into its last week, and despite the biting chill that has enveloped the Capital, one of the staples of the month -- the dense fog that reduces visibility, causes accidents on highways surrounding the city, and disrupts flights the airport -- has largely eluded Delhi so far.According to data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Delhi has so far this month seen only 175 hours of fog (where the visibility is below 1,000 metres). This number is the lowest since 2008, when the Capital got 166 fog hours, and well below the January average of 290 fog hours.Also Read | Delhi homeless shelters packed to the rafters amid record-breaking winterEven in December 2021, Delhi recorded only 75 fog hours as compared to a monthly average of 278 hours.According to IMD data, Delhi saw 75 fog hours over 22 foggy days in December 2021 -- the lowest since December 1982, when the Capital saw a similar low of 75 hours of fog over 14 fog days.Met officials said December 2021 was largely characterised by weak western disturbances which added little moisture to the air, and January this year saw more upper-level fog, instead of fog formation at the surface –leading to cold day conditions in the Capital.IMD declares a fog when the visibility drops below 1,000 metres. When the visibility is between 500 and 1,000 metres, it is categorised as a ‘shallow fog’, between 200 and 500 metres, a ‘moderate fog’. A fog is classified as ‘dense’ if the visibility drops below 200 metres.While Delhi has seen a spate of extreme weather events every month for nearly a year-and-a-half now, which scientists have flagged as the effects of the global climate crisis, experts said the lack of fog was likely an isolated weather phenomenon.IMD scientist RK Jenamani said Delhi sees an average of 570 fog hours over 52 foggy days between December and January, when fog formation in the city is at its peak.“In comparison, we have only seen 44 fog days and 250 fog hours in these two months combined this year, making it the lowest in the last 29 years. While there are five more days still to go in January, not much fog is expected in this period, because wind speeds will pick up once again this week,” said Jenamani.He said December saw multiple western disturbances, but each remained substantially weak, unable to add enough moisture to the air.“A western disturbance generally brings some rain. But even if it doesn’t bring any precipitation, a lot of moisture gets added to the air. This did not happen in December this time and we also had strong winds after the western disturbances departed,” explained Jenamani, adding that windy conditions are unfavourable for fog formation.While Delhi’s air has seen enough moisture air in January, the surface winds are still strong, leading to formation of fog 500 to 1,000 metres over the surface.“In January, we had two significant rain spells and enough moisture was introduced but instead of fog forming on the surface, it was forming nearly a kilometre above the surface, leading to upper-level fog formation and low clouds hanging over Delhi. This has led to cold day conditions, but at the surface, visibility has been very good and has ranged from 800 to 1,200 metres,” said Jenamani.Navdeep Dahiya, an amateur weatherman who runs ‘Live Weather of India’, said factors such as adequate moisture, a certain minimum temperature and calm winds are required for fog formation.“However, wind speeds in the region have generally remained high and instead of fog forming at the surface, the Indo-Gangetic Plains are seeing upper-level fog this year,” said Dahiya.Dipankar Saha, former head of the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) air laboratory, said that while extreme weather events are becoming more common, uneven patterns of fog formation couldn’t be linked to the impact of the climate crisis without deeper analysis.“Some weather events such as extreme rainfall, especially in the coastal parts are becoming more frequent. However, we have seen a similar spell of a lack of fog in 1991-1992 as well. This shows that such spells can happen, albeit very rarely. A long-term trend of fog would have to be analysed to link it to the climate crisis,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/biting-chill-but-familiar-winter-fog-eludes-delhi-least-since-2008-101643222747898.html
27-01-2022||Delhi||Beneficiaries of Delhi’s two in-situ rehab projects still wait to move in||New Delhi: Sheikh Mustafa’s dream of owning a house in the national capital came close to fruition last year when the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) decided to allot flats at Kalkaji Extension to 2,700 families of nearby Bhoomiheen Camp. But the 61-year-old, who owns a shop owner in the area, says that the DDA is yet to start the allotment as construction work is still going on.“It has been a long wait. DDA’s decision got our hopes up last year, but now we don’t know when we will be able to shift to our new homes,” said Mustafa, a social worker who has been pursuing the matter with DDA. Conceived in 2011, these flats are part of DDA’s second in-situ slum rehabilitation project. Former Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit laid the foundation stone for the project in October 2013. The plan was to rehabilitate 8,461 families of three slum clusters -- Jawahar Lal Camp, Navjivan Camp and Bhoomiheen Camp -- located in Govindpuri, Kalkaji, in a phased manner. In the first phase, 3,024 flats were to be constructed on a nearby plot and the remaining were to be constructed on the land vacated by slum residents.In September last year, DDA said that the construction work is 93% complete and the allotment was expected to start in December. “The allotment process will now start in March,” said a senior DDA official.Mustafa said, “In 2013, we were told that we will get the new houses within 2-3 years. Our families have grown and our children don’t want to live in the basti (slum). But we can’t leave this place, as we all work nearby.”Around 22km away from Kalkaji extension, 2,800 residents of Kathputli Colony have been living in a transit camp for over five years now in the hope of getting a flat. Though the in-situ slum project at Kathputli Colony was conceived in 2008, it faced stiff resistance from locals. In December 2016, the DDA finally started the demolition exercise and, amid protests from locals and civil society members, they took almost a year to clear the land. The construction work started in April 2018 and the first batch of houses were to be given by March 2019.Patasi (65), a Rajasthani folk artist and local leader of Bhat community (one of the many communities at Kathputli Colony), said, “We were to get our flats within two years after demolition of our houses. But it has been over five years and we have no idea when we will be able to finally have a house of our own.”DDA officials said that the two projects have been delayed due to the ban on construction activity followed by the Covid pandemic. “The Kalkaji flats will be completed soon. The construction work there was affected due to the ban. At Kathputli colony, we got permission to clear encroachments from a large piece of land at the site in April last year. Clubbed with the restrictions due to Covid, the work got delayed further. Close to 500 residents will be allotted flats at Kathputli by March and remaining 2,300 by December-end,” said a senior DDA official, aware of the development.The years-long delay in its two pilot projects has not deterred the DDA is already planning new projects and has invited bids for construction of 10,500 flats for in-situ rehabilitation of six slum clusters -- three sectors in Rohini, Haiderpur, Dilshad Garden and Shalimar Bagh -- on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis. “The proposals for the six projects will be finalised by the end of this month (January),” said a senior DDA official.In-situ redevelopmenthas been a poll promise of all political parties in the Capital, but no in-situ project has been completed in the past so many years, says Shakeel Ahmed, convener of Basti Suraksha Manch, an organisation working for the welfare of slum dwellers.“How long can people live in transit camps? The projects should have been completed in a time bound manner. But till date, no one has got a flat under the in-situ rehabilitation projects. The concept of in-situ on PPP mode is flawed . It has failed in Mumbai. Today, slum residents are scared of giving consent to such projects as they fear they won’t get the flats on time,” says Ahmed.Land and housing rights activists say that there is a need to learn from the past mistakes and look for new solutions to address the housing problem for people in the economically weaker sections.Enakshi Ganguly, executive director of the Housing and Land Rights Network, an advocacy group, said that while in-situ redevelopment is a solution, there is a need for an area or locality specific approach. “For redevelopment of slums, there is a need to find solutions by working around the needs of the people living there. One plan can’t be replicated everywhere. For instance, Kathputli Colony residents are mostly artists and they have a specific requirement related to their profession. The project has to factor in the needs of the people of the slum,” she said.In the baseline report prepared for the Master Plan of Delhi-2041, the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA) has said that there are 675 JJ clusters in Delhi occupying close to 800 hectares of land and containing over 300,000 housing units in the Capital. For their rehabilitation, housing rights activists say that there is a need to examine the provision for housing/shelter in the new master plan, which is likely to be notified this year.Housing rights activist Aravind Unni, a member of Main Bhi Dilli -- a campaign aimed at making planning in Delhi more inclusive in the Master Plan of Delhi-2041, said, “The in-situ rehabilitation on PPP basis has clearly not worked in Delhi. Now that the new master plan is being prepared, there is a need to relook the strategy. But the DDA is still continuing with the old strategy.”However, senior DDA officials said that PPP is the only way to rehabilitate and redevelop slum clusters. With close to 16 projects of in-situ redevelopment of slum clusters in various stages of planning, the land-owning agency recently has approved an amendment in the in-situ policy to “mitigate risks of prospective bidders for upcoming projects” and expedite the work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/beneficiaries-of-delhi-s-two-in-situ-rehab-projects-still-wait-to-move-in-101643222388423.html
27-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi homeless shelters packed to the rafters amid record-breaking winter||On Tuesday, the coldest January day in nine years, 88-year-old Chotelal Birla had just a bedsheet to ward off the chill from the cold pavement. Swathed in a thin worn blanket, he, like countless others in the national capital, is braving the harsh winter from a footpath near the Tibetan Market in Kashmiri Gate.Physically challenged, Birla relies on alms from passersby for a living and has no permanent roof over his head. Every evening around 9pm, he heads to the footpath where he retires for the night, after having been turned away by shelter homes brimming with people. “These shelters get full by 6-7pm these days, sometimes even before that. By the time I wrap up and go there, there is no space left and I’m turned away,” said the octogenarian, as he lay next to 10-15 others on the footpath in Kashmiri Gate on Tuesday night.On Tuesday, all weather stations in the national capital recorded their maximum temperatures 10 to 11 degrees Celsius below normal. The Safdarjung Observatory recorded a maximum temperature of 12.1 degrees Celsius, which was the lowest on a January day, after 9.8 degrees Celsius recorded on January 3, 2013.Also Read | Biting chill but familiar winter fog eludes Delhi, least since 2008The first come, first served policy of shelter homes is a disadvantage for people like him, says Birla. “We earn ₹10-50 a day, and it is not possible to reach the shelter by early evening. Even when there is space, preference is given to those who have been using the facility for years. We have no option but to spend our nights on the footpath,” he said.Sixty year-old Lalu, a daily wage earner, shares the pavement with Birla. Those in the shelter get warm food, a blanket and bed, he says, while individuals like him, who take refuge in the open, have to pass the winter cold and hungry.“The government doesn’t provide us any food and neither is there a public washroom in the vicinity. Life is tough on the road and we don’t sleep here out of choice. When we are repeatedly turned away from shelter homes, where else do we sleep?” said Lalu.Winter this January has been particularly unyielding. Delhi is currently in the middle of the sixth longest spell (since 1951) when the day temperature has remained significantly lower than what is considered normal for time of the year, according to the India Meteorological Department data. Wednesday marked the 12th day this month when the maximum temperature has remained below 17 degrees Celsius.Sunil Kumar Aledia, executive director of the Centre for Holistic Development, an advocacy group that works with the homeless and migrant workers in the city, said a survey conducted by the organisation between January 1-24 showed that as many as 145 homeless individuals have died from the biting cold this winter.Aledia said temporary shelters were only a stop gap measure and a permanent solution was needed for the homeless. “We need permanent building structures. These tin structures (shelter homes) are neither sustainable nor equipped with clean facilities. The first come, first served policy only ensures that people are forced to sleep in the open if they are unable to reach shelters on time. The number of shelters is anyway way less than the number of homeless -- they number in their thousands,” said Aledia.The Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) has set up 209 permanent shelters in the capital. In addition, temporary shelters are also set up every year. DUSIB member Bipin Rai said that while 60-70 temporary camps were set up every year, this year, 220 camps have been set up year and 30 more are on standby.“Based on need assessment, we set up temporary camps as and when required,” said Rai.He rejected claims that 145 homeless have died in the cold and called the data fake. “There is no basis to the data. Every time, the organisation comes up with shocking numbers to create “sensation”. Our rescue vans work throughout the night to take individuals to shelters,” said Rai.The government was constantly working on improving the facilities in shelters, he insisted, but some people chose to sleep on pavements, he claimed.“We cannot force people to take shelter. There are some who prefer to sleep in the open, in the expectation of donations from Good Samaritans,” he said.On Tuesday night, HT visited two shelters, in Kashmiri Gate and Sarai Kale Khan. Most inmates there said while space was limited, they were happy to have a roof over their heads when the mercury fell this low.Damyanti Devi, of Bihar, has been living in the shelter home next to Nizamuddin Metro station for the past year after arriving in Delhi with her husband, who is suffering from a kidney ailment and is getting treated at AIIMS.“We cannot afford to pay rent. I cannot complain as I have a place to rest at night. Sometimes, NGO workers also visit us and help us procure expensive medicines for the treatment of my husband,” said Devi.While meals were provided twice a day, the number of toilets was limited due to which sanitation was poor, she said.Rai said the number of individuals at the Sarai Kale Khan facility has increased lately and the government is cognizant of the need for more washrooms. “We are aware that there is some crisis, particularly during the morning hours. We are working on the addressing the shortage,” he said.Indu Prakash Singh, a member of the Supreme Court-appointed state-level shelter monitoring committee, said the DUSIB had been told to prepare more shelters this time. He said food was being provided at shelters along with other facilities such as blankets and beds. “We don’t think that there is a bias against people when it comes to admittance in shelter homes. Whenever required, the DUSIB does set up shelters,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-homeless-shelters-packed-to-the-rafters-amid-record-breaking-winter-101643222027709.html
27-01-2022||World||Trudeau isolating after Covid exposure; says test negative||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday that he was isolating for five days after learning that he had been exposed to someone with Covid-19, adding however that the rapid test he had taken came back negative,“Last night, I learned that I have been exposed to Covid-19,” Trudeau said in a tweet on Thursday. “My rapid test result was negative.”He said he was following health regulations and self-isolating for five days.“I feel fine and will be working from home. Stay safe, everyone – and please get vaccinated,” he added. Trudeau, 50, is fully-vaccinated, and in January received a booster dose of a Covid-19 vaccine at a pharmacy in Ottawa.There were no additional details available.Trudeau also self-isolated in March 2020, when the pandemic first arrived in Canada, after his wife Sophie Gregoire was infected while on a trip to England.Covaxin production in CanadaThe biopharmaceutical company which has partnered with India’s Bharat Biotech to make Covaxin in North America, has entered into an agreement to acquire a manufacturing facility in Canada.The Pennsylvania-based Ocugen announced on Thursday that it had signed a non-binding letter of intent with the Canadian company Liminal BioSciences for the acquisition of their manufacturing site in Belleville, Ontario.If approved, Covaxin will be “the first product manufactured in new upgraded facility”, a release from Ocugen said.Ocugen’s Canadian subsidiary Vaccigen has an application for emergency use authorisation of the vaccine with Health Canada. Ocugen plans to repurpose the dormant vaccine manufacturing facility and create capacity in Canada.“This site, after transformation into a state-of-the-art hub, with the support of the regional talent pool can help bring our innovative products – from vaccines to our modifier gene therapy assets – to the patients we will serve globally,” said Ocugen’s chairman and CEO Dr Shankar Musunuri said.The introduction between Ocugen and Liminal was facilitated by Canada’s minister of innovation, science and industry François-Philippe Champagne.Covaxin’s was submitted to Health Canada on June 30. However, there is no clarity on when, and if, regulators will clear the vaccine for use in Canada.In a tweet earlier this month, the agency said, “A decision will be made once all of the required information has been thoroughly evaluated by Health Canada. As the review is still ongoing, it is not possible to predict when a regulatory decision will be made.”Health Canada said it reviews vaccine applications through an independent process and authorises products based on “scientific rigour and medical evidence”.“Timing for the completion of Health Canada’s review depends on many factors, including but not limited to, the need for additional data, discussions with the sponsor, and requirements for updates to safety information,” it added.Covaxin was approved for emergency use by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in November 2021. It has been recognised in Canada for the purpose of travel since November 30 when the country started accepting those with two doses of Covaxin as fully vaccinated.

That was the biggest increase in 40 years.For the full year, inflation rose 3.9 percent, according to the data.Excluding volatile food and energy prices which have increased sharply in the year, the core PCE price index rose 3.3 percent in 2021, and 4.9 percent in the fourth quarter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-economy-grew-5-7-in-2021-6-9-in-q4-amid-omicron-hit-govt-101643292295164.html
27-01-2022||World||Working ‘closely’ with India to handle border problem, US should not interfere: China||China on Thursday said it will work “closely” with India to properly handle the ongoing border tension and strongly criticised the US for saying it was concerned by Beijing’s attempts to coerce its neighbours including India.The Chinese defence ministry added that the border problem is a bilateral matter and both China and India oppose interference from a third party.Defence ministry spokesperson, Wu Qian said “…some American politicians are so fond of using the word ‘coerce’, they seem to have forgotten that the US is the inventor and master player of ‘coercive diplomacy’.”China neither “coerces” nor is “coerced” by others, and strongly opposes the US forcing “coercive diplomacy” on other countries, Wu said on Thursday.Wu was referring to comments made by the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki ahead of the 14th round of military talks between India and China on January 12 to resolve the ongoing border tension between the two countries along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh. “We’ve been pretty clear how we view Beijing’s behaviour in the region and around the world. We believe it can be destabilising. And we’re concerned by the People’s Republic of China’s attempt to intimidate its neighbours,” Psaki said.“We continue to support dialogue and peaceful resolution of these border disputes,” she said, adding: “We’ll continue to stand with our partners on that.”Referring to the China-India border issue, Wu stressed that the Chinese side believed that the last round of talks were positive and constructive. “…China will work closely with the Indian side to properly handle the border issue through negotiation and consultation,” Wu was quoted as saying by the official China Military Online website.Referring to the joint statement issued after the talks, Wu said the two sides agreed that they should follow the guidance provided by the leaders of the two countries and work for the resolution of the remaining issues at the earliest. “Second, the two sides agreed to consolidate the previous outcomes and take effective efforts to maintain the security and stability on the ground in the western sector including in winter,” Wu said.“Third, they agreed to stay in close contact and maintain dialogue via military and diplomatic channels and work out a mutually acceptable resolution of the remaining issues at the earliest,” he said, adding that the two sides also agreed that the next round of the commanders’ talks should be held at the earliest.Indian and Chinese border troops have been locked in a border standoff in eastern Ladakh since May, 2020, when a violent clash in Pangong lake area led to both sides gradually deploying tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry along the border.Several rounds of military and diplomatic talks have only resulted in partial disengagement of troops until now.India has repeatedly and consistently rejected China’s allegations that Indian troops crossed over to the Chinese side of the LAC in eastern Ladakh, asserting that New Delhi has always taken a responsible approach towards border management and maintaining peace and tranquillity in the border areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/working-closely-with-india-to-handle-border-problem-us-should-not-interfere-china-101643291696889.html
27-01-2022||World||Wang Yi urges calm on Ukraine issue in phone call with Antony Blinken||Chinese state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi on Thursday urged all parties involved in the Ukraine crisis to remain calm and not hype up the tension, in a phone call with US secretary of state Antony Blinken.One country’s security cannot be at the expense of the security of other countries, and regional security cannot be guaranteed by strengthening or even expanding military blocs, Wang told Blinken.Wang, according to Chinese state media, urged all sides to cast aside the Cold War mentality and address Russia’s “reasonable” security concerns on the issue.Moscow has said it wants Nato to pull back troops and weapons from eastern Europe and bar its neighbour Ukraine, a former Soviet state, from ever joining.Washington and its Nato allies reject that position, but say they are ready to discuss topics such as arms control and confidence-building measures.Blinken, according to a readout from the US state Department, underscored the “…global security and economic risks posed by further Russian aggression against Ukraine and conveyed that de-escalation and diplomacy are the responsible way forward”.Earlier, agency reports from Wednesday said the US set out a diplomatic path to address sweeping Russian demands in eastern Europe as Moscow held security talks with Western countries and intensified its military build-up near Ukraine with new drills.On China-US ties, Wang told Blinken: “The top priority at the moment is that the US should stop interfering with the Beijing Winter Olympics, stop playing cards with fire on the Taiwan issue, and stop creating various anti-China ‘small circles’.”Blinken, according to Chinese media, told Wang that the US and China have both overlapping interests and differences, and the US is willing to manage differences in a responsible manner.The one-China policy of the US has not changed, Blinken said, adding, on the upcoming Winter Olympics, that the US will cheer for American athletes participating in the Beijing Games.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wang-yi-urges-calm-on-ukraine-issue-in-phone-call-with-antony-blinken-101643267694721.html
27-01-2022||World||Covid-19: Canada to relax testing norms to ease travel from India||Travel between India and Canada is likely to become easier soon as Ottawa is likely to relax restrictions related to Covid-19 testing that made the process cumbersome.According to sources, the Canadian government is likely to update its rules allowing for RT-PCR testing of air passengers from India to be permitted at several laboratories recognised by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR).At this time, the travel advisory for India that is in force, limits pre-departure testing to a single laboratory of the company Genestrings located at Delhi airport. Travellers have to provide a negative test result before they are allowed boarding for any Canadian destination, making the process problematic to those connecting via Delhi as getting the test taken and results received consume up to eight or nine hours. As of now, that test has to be done within 18 hours of scheduled departure.Another relaxation that’s expected is that of the mandatory requirement for travellers from India to be tested at a third country in case they are catching a connecting flight to come to Canada. The present norms read: “Passengers who travel from India to Canada via an indirect route still need to provide a pre-departure negative Covid-19 molecular test result from a third country before continuing their journey to Canada.”A test conducted in India is likely to be accepted for onward journey to Canada from a third country once the expected announcement is made. Sources said that announcement could come as early as this week.However, Canada still has in place a warning against any non-essential travel abroad due to concerns over the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. That, though, is relevant to those departing Canada rather than incoming passengers.The testing norms specific to India were introduced in September when Canada lifted its ban on direct flights between the two countries, which was imposed in April last year amid concerns over the Delta-driven wave in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-canada-to-relax-testing-norms-to-ease-travel-from-india-101643266852834.html
27-01-2022||World||Researchers find 2 paths to ‘super immunity’ against Covid-19, no correlation with age||There are two paths towards “super immunity” against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and both provide roughly equal levels of enhanced immune protection, according to a new study. Researchers at Oregon Health & Science University studied the quantity, quality and breadth of humoral immune response from and without natural infection in addition to vaccination against Covid-19. They found that the additional antigen exposure from Covid-19 substantially boosts immunity regardless of whether it occurs before or after vaccination.“It makes no difference whether you get infected and then vaccinated, or if you get vaccinated and then a breakthrough infection,” said Fikadu Tafess, co-author of the study. “In either case, you will get a really, really robust immune response — amazingly high.”The Covid-19 vaccines approved by the World Health Organization significantly reduce overall mortality and severe illness from the infection. Several studies have shown that people with hybrid immunity – induced through vaccination after recovering from coronavirus infection – have enhanced immune responses as compared with the vaccinated peers with no prior infection. But the effects of post-vaccination breakthrough infections on humoral immune response was yet to be determined.The OHSU researchers measured neutralizing antibody responses from 104 vaccinated individuals, including those with breakthrough infections, hybrid immunity, and no infection history. The participants, vaccinated with the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, were divided into three groups: 42 with no infection, 31 who were vaccinated after an infection, and 31 who had breakthrough infections following vaccination.“We find that human immune sera following breakthrough infection and vaccination following natural infection, broadly neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants to a similar degree,” the authors said in the study published in the journal Science Immunology.While age negatively correlates with antibody response after vaccination alone, the researchers concluded that there was no correlation with age in breakthrough or hybrid immune groups.“Together, our data suggest that the additional antigen exposure from natural infection substantially boosts the quantity, quality, and breadth of humoral immune response regardless of whether it occurs before or after vaccination,” the study said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/researchers-find-2-paths-to-super-immunity-against-covid-19-no-correlation-with-age-101643264713275.html
27-01-2022||World||Canada, India exploring opportunities in Indo-Pacific: Melanie Joly||Canada’s foreign minister Melanie Joly has stressed on “working together” with India in addressing challenges in the Indo-Pacific and to “bolster diplomatic and regional stability, trade and economic connectivity and sustainability”.Joly made these comments while appearing at a virtual Republic Day celebration organised by the Indian High Commission in Ottawa. Joly, who was the chief guest at the function, said that the two countries are “working together to explore opportunities in the Indo-Pacific”. She added that “as Pacific-facing nations, we share mutual interests in ensuring peace, stability and prosperity of the region.” Melanie Joly also described as “a remarkable achievement” the administration of over 1.5 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines in India.The matter of strengthening collaboration in the Indo-Pacific was also addressed by India’s High Commissioner to Ottawa Ajay Bisaria. He said the two countries “need to come together to defend the rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific” while conveying India’s appreciation of Canada’s “articulation of a vision” for the Indo-Pacific.When the new House of Commons met in November last year for the first time after the September elections, governor-general Mary Simon outlined the policy priorities of the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and among those was “making deliberate efforts to deepen partnerships in the Indo-Pacific”. Canada is currently formulating a comprehensive Indo-Pacific policy.“India and Canada as Pacific nations and G20 economies are natural partners,” Bisaria said, while pointing out that they are also observing 75 years of establishment of diplomatic ties.The event was also attended by Canada’s defence minister Anita Anand who conveyed her greetings on Republic Day. Also joining the function and extending their wishes were the leader of the opposition in Canada Erin O’Toole, and the premiers of the provinces of Ontario and Alberta, Doug Ford and Jason Kenney.Meanwhile, while there were protests in front of the High Commission in Ottawa as well as India’s consulates in Toronto and Vancouver, there were no reports of disruption of R Day functions. India had sought enhanced security from Canada this year after its consulate in Vancouver was blockaded by protestors in 2021 and pro-Khalistan speeches were delivered at the site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-india-exploring-opportunities-in-indo-pacific-melanie-joly-101643264331923.html
27-01-2022||World||Covid-19: 'Flurona' isn't real, people can get co-infection, say researchers||Some posts on social media talked about one such infection named ‘flurona’ in Israel, which the users said is a double infection of Covid-19 and influenza.Also Read | Can vaccination reduce long effects of Covid-19? Here's what we knowBut healthcare experts have now dismissed this, saying it’s not a different thing.“The contractions like ‘flurona,’ I think they’re very misleading to people. It presents the idea two viruses have somehow merged into one, which is not at all the case,” Dr Ellen Foxman, an immunologist at the Yale School of Medicine, told NBC News. “Somebody got a co-infection. People get co-infections all the time.”Watch: India's Covid cases breach 4-crore markOther researchers too agree with Dr Foxman. Dr Guy Boivin, a clinical virologist in Quebec, explained that co-infection can result in three outcomes: Little or no symptoms, severe illness due to virus attacks at the same time or one infection could block another.According to reports, the first case of ‘flurona’ was recorded late in December in a pregnant woman who was admitted to the Rabin Medical Centre in Petah Tikva to give birth. Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth reported that the young woman was not vaccinated.At that time, Dr Nahla Abdel Wahab, a doctor at Cairo University Hospital, had told Israeli media that ‘flurona’ may indicate a major breakdown of the immunity system as two viruses are entering the human body at the same time.Israel is administering a fourth vaccine shot against Covid-19 to individuals with a compromised immune system. It is mulling expanding the coverage to younger population as well.Also Read | Moderna starts clinical trials of Omicron-specific vaccine boosterLast week, the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) said that the Omicron variant is in the community transmission stage in India and has become dominant in multiple metros.It also said BA.2 lineage, an infectious sub-variant of Omicron, has been found in a substantial fraction in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-flurona-isn-t-real-people-can-get-co-infection-say-researchers-101643251343071.html
27-01-2022||World||Can vaccination reduce long effects of Covid-19? Here's what we know||Vaccination can help reduce the long effects of Covid-19 infection, researchers have found based on data collected from those infected with coronavirus. An Israeli report has surfaced that shows that people vaccinated with both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine were much less likely to report long Covid as compared to those unvaccinated.The study, which is yet to be peer reviewed, showed that those vaccinated and infected with Covid-19 can fully recover from the disease showing no more symptoms than a person who has never got Covid.Researchers of the Israeli study, published in the Nature journal, sampled more than 3,000 people whom they asked whether they were experiencing any persistent symptoms of the long Covid. The data was collected between July and November 2021 from people who had tested Covid positive between March 2020 and November 2021.“Here is another reason to get vaccinated, if you needed one,” said co-author Michael Edelstein, an epidemiologist at Bar-Ilan University in Safed, Israel, as quoted by Nature journal.What is long Covid?The term ‘long Covid’ refers to a condition where people continue to experience certain symptoms of the viral infection – such as fatigue, shortness of breath, difficulty in concentration or 'brain fog' – weeks and months, and in some cases years, after being infected by Covid-19.What did the researchers find?According to the study, fully vaccinated participants who had also had Covid-19 were 54 per cent less likely to report headaches, 64 per cent less likely to report fatigue and 68 per cent less likely to report muscle pain than were their unvaccinated counterparts.The result also echoed several other researches conducted around the world, including a UK-based study that found vaccination could halve the risk of long term symptoms of Covid-19.However, this is not to say that fully vaccinated people do not develop  the condition, especially since it is still unclear if the vaccine protects people from Omicron and its after effects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-vaccination-reduce-long-effects-of-covid-19-here-s-what-we-know-101643248685878.html
27-01-2022||World||Ukraine crisis updates: What to know as tensions rise||Russia has placed more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine's border and ratcheted up war games in the region.Moscow denies it is planning an assault, but the United States and its NATO allies fear that Russia is planning for war — and are making preparations of their own.Here are things to know about the international tensions over Ukraine, a crisis reminiscent of the Cold War.THE U.S. SAYS NOThe U.S. has made no concessions to the main Russian demands over Ukraine and NATO in a long-awaited written response delivered to Russia on Wednesday in Moscow, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.Blinken said the U.S. response, delivered to the Russian Foreign Ministry by U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan, gave up no ground on “core principles” such as NATO’s open-door membership policy and the alliance’s military presence in Eastern Europe.Blinken said the document made clear that the U.S. is standing by its oft-stated positions. “There is no change, there will be no change,” he said. But, he said the written response to Russia also contains “serious” offers for a diplomatic path to de-escalate soaring tensions over Ukraine by addressing Russian concerns on other matters.The U.S. response comes as Russia is warning that it would quickly take “retaliatory measures” if the U.S. and its allies reject its security demands and continue their “aggressive” policies over Ukraine.Russia has demanded guarantees that NATO never admit Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations as members and that the alliance roll back troop deployments in former Soviet bloc countries, a region Moscow still views as its sphere of interestWHAT DO UKRAINIAN LEADERS SAY?Ukrainian officials have sought to calm nerves as tensions escalate.Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Wednesday that while the concentration of Russian troops near Ukraine poses a threat, “their number is now insufficient for a large-scale offensive.”“They are still missing some key military elements and systems to mount a big, full-scale offensive,” Kuleba told reporters.He also noted that causing alarm could be an end in itself. Russia, he said, hopes to destabilize Ukraine by “spreading panic, raising pressure on Ukraine’s financial system and launching cyberattacks.”WHAT IS THE MOOD ON UKRAINE'S FRONT LINE?Soldiers and civilians in eastern Ukraine are waiting with helpless anticipation to see if war comes.They understand that their fate is being decided by politicians in distant capitals. Even politicians in their own capital, Kyiv, have found themselves on the sidelines of several rounds of high-stakes diplomacy that so far have not yielded a breakthrough.The battle-weary region has been fighting pro-Russia separatist fighters since 2014. It is an area close to where Russia has massed tens of thousands of soldiers in a troop buildup that U.S. President Joe Biden says could mount the largest invasion since World War II.WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE DIPLOMATIC FRONT?Envoys from Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany met Wednesday for more than eight hours in Paris to discuss the separatist conflict in Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland. Although there was no breakthrough, they promised to meet for new talks in two weeks in Berlin.The French president’s office said afterward in a statement that the parties support “unconditional respect” for a cease-fire in eastern Ukraine.The Ukrainian representative, Andriy Yermak, was cautiously optimistic. He also acknowledged Wednesday’s talks did not directly address current tensions at the border or resolve past differences.WHAT IS BRITAIN'S STANCE?British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has urged European nations to do more to support Ukraine, saying “we would like to see our allies do more to help supply defensive support to Ukraine.”The U.K. has sent anti-tank weapons to Ukraine in response to Russia massing troops near its border. It has ruled out sending combat troops, but Truss said Britain has “ruled nothing out in terms of sanctions.”“In fact, we’ll be legislating to toughen up our sanctions regime and make sure we are fully able to hit both individuals and companies and banks in Russia in the event of an incursion,” she told the BBC.“What’s important is that all of our allies do the same, because it’s by collective action, by showing Vladimir Putin we’re united, that we will help deter a Russian incursion.”WHAT IS GERMANY DOING?Among the NATO allies, Germany in particular has faced calls to help Ukraine more and been faulted for a perception that it is prioritizing its economic ties with Russia over Ukraine's security.Amid that backdrop, German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said Germany will deliver 5,000 military helmets to Ukraine following a request from the country’s embassy. She said that it was “a very clear signal that we stand by your side.”Ukraine’s ambassador to Germany welcomed the planned delivery of the helmets but described it as a “purely symbolic gesture.” Andriy Melnik told German news agency dpa that “this is only a drop in the ocean.”He added that “Ukraine expects a 180-degree turn from the German government, a real paradigm change.”Germany has said that it won’t deliver lethal weapons to Ukraine.Yet German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock insisted Wednesday that the European Union’s common goal in the Ukraine crisis “is and remains the defense of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.”WHAT DO ITALIAN BUSINESSES WANT?Like Germans, some Italians are suspected of putting business ties with Russia ahead of solidarity with Ukraine.On Wednesday, Italian business leaders held a video conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin even though the Rome government asked that the conference be canceled, or at least that companies with government stakes not participate.During the call, Putin underlined Italy’s role as its third-largest EU trading partner, with $5 billion invested by Italian companies in Russia and $3 billion by Russian companies in Italy.The president of the Italian-Russian Chamber of Commerce, Vincenzo Trani, said the two countries have always been able to overcome “challenging outside factors in recent years ... through dialogue.”Participants included Marco Tronchetti Provera, CEO of Pirelli tires, who is president of the Italian Russian entrepreneurs committee. La Repubblica said the CEO of the oil company ENI and the SNAM energy infrastructure company, which are partially state-owned, canceled.WHAT ABOUT THOSE COMMENTS IN CROATIA?Croatia’s prime minister sought Wednesday to defuse an uproar after the country's president said “Ukraine does not belong in NATO" and Croatian troops should not be part of any Western response force in case of a war.President Zoran Milanovic is known for populist-style and undiplomatic statements. His remarks Tuesday angered Ukraine, which summoned Croatia’s ambassador in response.Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic described Milanovic’s comments as “unreal in many ways” and said Croatia, a member of NATO and the EU, will continue to have “friendly and partner” relations with Ukraine.“I can speak for the Croatian government,” Plenkovic said. “Croatia’s core position is respect of Ukraine’s territorial integrity.”WHAT IS CANADA DOING?Canada is extending its mission to train Ukrainian soldiers by three years. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday that Canada will also expand the mission, known as Operation UNIFIER.Trudeau said he has authorized the Canadian Armed Forces to deploy 60 personnel to join 200 troops already on the ground, with further capacity to increase that number up to 400. He said Canada will also provide nonlethal equipment, intelligence-sharing and support to combat cyberattacks.“We are seeing around the world right now a backsliding of democracy, an attack on democratic principles in many different forms," Trudeau said. "But the direct threat of a Russian invasion, to take control of Ukraine, to take away the choice of Ukrainian people to chose their future ... . It’s something that concerns all of us who cherish democracy.”WHAT DOES POPE FRANCIS WANT?Pope Francis prayed that political leaders put aside personal interests and let dialogue prevail amid concerns of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.Francis kicked off a daylong prayer for peace in Ukraine on Wednesday with a special appeal at the end of his weekly general audience. “Please, never again war,” Francis said. “Let us insistently ask the Lord that in this land may fraternity overcome wounds, fears and divisions."Noting that Thursday marks Holocaust Remembrance Day, Francis said Ukrainians had suffered tremendous cruelties during World War II.“They deserve peace,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ukraine-crisis-updates-what-to-know-as-tensions-rise-101643250310432.html
27-01-2022||World||Afghanistan hanging by a thread; cannot abandon Afghan people, says UN Chief||With Afghanistan "hanging by a thread" six months after the Taliban takeover, the world cannot abandon the country now - for the sake of its people and overall global security, said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Wednesday."At this moment, we need the global community - and this Council - to put their hands on the wheel of progress, provide resources, and prevent Afghanistan from spiralling any further," Guterres said in his briefing to the UN Security Council on Afghanistan.Guterres also outlined action for the de facto rulers of the country, the Taliban, calling on the fundamentalists to expand opportunity and security for Afghans, uphold human rights, and demonstrate real commitment to be part of the international community, the UN said in a statement.The Secretary-General said Afghanistan has long been unfairly used as a platform for political agendas, geopolitical advantage, ideological dominance, brutal conflicts and terrorism."As a matter of moral responsibility - and regional and global security and prosperity - we cannot abandon the people of Afghanistan," he said, adding Afghans need peace, hope, and help, and they need it now.The country's economy is collapsing amid another brutal winter, and daily life has become "a frozen hell". Over half of all citizens are facing extreme levels of hunger, and some families have been forced to sell their babies so they can buy food, said the statement.Meanwhile, sanctions and mistrust by the global banking system have frozen nearly USD 9 billion in central bank assets, and vital systems are starved of much-needed funds.As the economy spirals downward, human rights are also losing ground.The UN chief highlighted the situation of women and girls, who are once again shut out of offices and classrooms. He also appealed for the release of women activists who were arrested or abducted recently.Guterres reminded the Council that earlier this month, the UN launched a more than USD 4.4 billion appeal for Afghanistan to keep the food, education and economic systems from collapsing.He urged countries to suspend rules and conditions that constrict both the Afghan economy and lifesaving humanitarian operations.The Secretary-General underscored the need to "jump-start" the Afghan economy through increased liquidity, including by freeing-up frozen currency reserves and through cash injections.The UN chief also urged the Taliban to demonstrate real commitment to be part of the international community. "The window for trust-building is open. But this trust must be earned," he said.Afghanistan has been a fertile breeding ground for terrorist groups for far too long, and the UN chief underscored the critical need to promote security and fight terrorism."If we do not act and help Afghans weather this storm, the region and the world will pay a heavy price," he said, urging the de facto authorities to work together with the global community to suppress the terrorism threat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-hanging-by-a-thread-cannot-abandon-afghan-people-says-un-chief-101643249455024.html

On this day, the UN urges every member state to develop educational programs to help prevent future genocides.The theme of this year’s Holocaust remembrance and education is “Memory, Dignity and Justice”. The theme encompasses safeguarding the historical record, remembering the victims, and challenging the distortion of history often expressed in contemporary antisemitism. It encourages action to challenge hatred, strengthen solidarity and champion compassion, according to the UN.“The writing of history and the act of remembering brings dignity and justice to those whom the perpetrators of the Holocaust intended to obliterate,” the UN says on its website.UN approves resolution condemning Holocaust denialThe UN organises Holocaust commemorative and educational activities to draw attention to the actions taken by the survivors to reclaim their rights, history, cultural heritage and traditions, and their dignity.On Thursday, the UN Chamber Music Society will perform a virtual concert in memory of the victims of the Holocaust. The virtual concert will include a classical music programme featuring Jewish composers, special performances from musicians from Maestro Daniel Barenboim’s West–Eastern Divan Orchestra.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will speak at the Holocaust memorial ceremony hosted by Melissa Fleming, UN under-secretary-general for global communications. The speakers include Petra Gelbart, granddaughter of Romani Holocaust survivors Helena “Margita” Nová and Antonín “Ruda” Hránek, and Elisha Wiesel, son of Holocaust survivors Marion and Elie Wiesel. The ceremony will include testimonies from Holocaust survivors from Canada, Israel, South Africa and the US.A virtual seminar “Legacy of Medicine During the Holocaust and its Contemporary Relevance” will be presented to catalyze critical thinking on the relevance of the Holocaust for contemporary medicine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/international-holocaust-remembrance-day-theme-significance-events-scheduled-101643249559579.html
27-01-2022||World||North Korea fires 'unidentified projectile', ignores US offer of talks||North Korea fired an "unidentified projectile" early Thursday, Seoul said, its sixth apparent weapons test this year as the nuclear-armed country flexes its military muscles and ignores Washington's offers of talks.The last time North Korea tested this many weapons in a month was in 2019, after high-profile negotiations between leader Kim Jong Un and then-United States president Donald Trump collapsed.Since then, talks with the US have languished, and the country is reeling economically from biting international sanctions and a self-imposed coronavirus blockade."North Korea fired an unidentified projectile into the East Sea," Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said, referring to the Sea of Japan.Pyongyang fired two suspected cruise missiles on Tuesday, which are not banned under current UN sanctions on North Korea.It also tested suspected ballistic missiles on January 14 and 17, and fired what it said were hypersonic missiles on January 5 and 11.The string of sanction-busting tests drew global condemnation, including a closed-door meeting of the UN Security Council meeting.The United States also imposed new sanctions in response, prompting an angry reply from North Korea, which last week hinted that it could resume nuclear and long-range weapons tests.Pyongyang has not tested intercontinental ballistic missiles or nukes since 2017, and has continued to observe a self-imposed moratorium even after diplomacy with the United States stalled.'Offensive weapons'The North's saber-rattling comes at a delicate time in the region, with Kim's sole major ally China set to host the Winter Olympics next month and South Korea gearing up for a presidential election in March."The Kim regime is developing an impressive diversity of offensive weapons despite limited resources and serious economic challenges," said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Seoul's Ewha University."Certain North Korean tests aim to develop new capabilities, especially for evading missile defenses," he added."Other launches are intended to demonstrate the readiness and versatility of missile forces that North Korea has already deployed."After a decade in power, leader Kim has little to celebrate, with a Covid-battered economy causing food shortages at home, diplomacy with the United States stalled and biting sanctions taking their toll.That may explain why North Korea has carried out five weapons tests in the last three weeks, analysts said earlier in the week -- and a dramatic demonstration of the nuclear-armed country's military prowess offers a quick win ahead of important domestic anniversaries.The country is preparing to mark the 80th anniversary of the birth of Kim's father, late leader Kim Jong Il, in February, as well as the 110th birthday of the country's founding leader Kim Il Sung in April.It may also be looking to conduct tests ahead of the start of the Beijing Winter Olympics next week, lest it anger its sole major ally China by raining missiles on its parade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-fires-unidentified-projectile-ignores-us-offer-of-talks-101643245696533.html

27-01-2022||World||Covid-19: Moderna starts clinical trials of Omicron-specific vaccine booster||US biotech company Moderna announced on Wednesday that it has begun clinical trials of a booster dose of vaccine designed specifically to combat the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.The trials will involve a total of 600 adults -- half of whom have already received two doses of Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine at least six months ago, and half of whom have received two doses plus the previously authorized booster dose.The booster specifically targeting Omicron will therefore be evaluated as both a third and a fourth dose.The company also reported results on the efficacy against Omicron of the booster that has already been authorized.It said that six months after the booster injection, the levels of neutralizing antibodies against Omicron were reduced by six times from the peak observed 29 days after the injection -- but remained detectable in all participants.These data were obtained by studying the blood of 20 people who received the 50 microgram booster, half the amount of the first two injections."We are reassured by the antibody persistence against Omicron at six months after the currently authorized" booster, Moderna chief executive Stephane Bancel said in the statement."Nonetheless, given the long-term threat demonstrated by Omicron's immune escape, we are advancing our Omicron-specific variant vaccine booster candidate and we are pleased to begin this part of our Phase 2 study," Bancel continued.Moderna's statement came the day after rivals Pfizer and BioNTech said they had begun enrollment for a clinical trial for an Omicron-specific vaccine.Both vaccines are based on messenger RNA technology, which makes it relatively easy to update them to keep up with mutations specific to new variants.Several countries, including the United States, have begun to see a decline in cases associated with the infection wave caused by Omicron, the most transmissible variant detected so far, but the number of infections worldwide continues to rise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-moderna-starts-clinical-trials-of-omicron-specific-vaccine-booster-101643242927557.html

But such a move, he said, would do serious damage to diplomatic efforts to ease rising tensions over Ukraine.

That proves the government’s ability and “the resolve to carry out disinvestment effectively in non-strategic sectors in the future,” he added.Air India board members, along with former Air India chairman and managing director Pradeep Singh Kharola, secretary of civil aviation ministry Rajiv Bansal, and chairman and members of Tata Sons reached the airline’s headquarters around 2.30pm. The process of final handover was completed by around 3.30pm.After completing the process, Tuhin K Pandey, department of investment and public asset management (DIPAM) secretary said; “All formalities have been completed. AI disinvestment transaction is closed. ₹2,700 crore has been received by the government. The shares have been transferred to Talace Pvt. Ltd. and so the new owner is Talace. The debt of ₹15,300 crore has been accepted (by the new owner). Air India is now not with the government.”Soon after the formal handover of the airline, Tata Sons in a statement said: “The transaction covers three entities – Air India, Air India Express and AI SATS. Air India is India’s flag carrier and premier full-service airline. Air India Express is a low-cost carrier. AI SATS provides a comprehensive suite of ground handling and cargo handling services.”Also Read | Welcome and welcome back: Tata Sons chairman's message to Air India employeesWhile Chandrasekaran did not comment on the formation of the new management, officials close to the development indicated that all four executive directors of Air India may be retained. “The board will be expanded in the coming days. The new members are awaiting security clearance,” an official said.One of the officials, who asked not to be named, said Amrita Sharan (currently director, personnel) will be the new human resource head of Tata Air India. Company representatives did not confirm the plan.On Thursday evening, Air India also sent out a circular to all its pilots to mandatorily make special welcome announcements in all departing flights on Friday.Talace Pvt Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Sons, has received 100% equity shares of Air India and AI Express. It will also get the government’s 50% stake in ground-handling company AISATS.“It’s a very historic day because Air India gets a fresh lease of life under Tata’s control,” said Jitender Bhargava, a former executive director at Air India who’s written a book on the carrier’s downfall, news agency Bloomberg reported. Air India has weaknesses, Bhargava said, but the Tatas have the wherewithal to turn it around. “Air India will not only give Tata the scale, but also the number one position because of its vast network of international operations and a huge chunk of trained pilots and aircraft maintenance engineers,” he added.Also Read | Air India flights under Tata Group will have these changesThe airline, with its Maharaja mascot, was once renowned for its lavishly decorated planes and service championed by founder JRD Tata. Air India was founded in 1932 and nationalised in 1953 and in the 50s, 60s and 70s, it led the global aviation boom.Since the mid-2000s, Air India’s reputation declined as financial troubles mounted when it began to lose market share to low cost airlines like SpiceJet and IndiGo.In October 2021, the government announced it sold its 100% stake to the autos-to-steel Tata conglomerate for ₹18,000 crore.The Tatas won the bid by beating a ₹15,100 crore offer made by a consortium led by SpiceJet promoter Ajay Singh. The reserve price was ₹12,906 crore.The bid amount includes about ₹15,300 crore of the carrier’s ₹61,562 crore debt. The remaining will be transferred to Air India Assets Holding Limited, a special purpose vehicle formed by the government.On October 11, a Letter of Intent was issued to the Tata Group confirming the government’s willingness to sell its 100% stake in the airline. On October 25, the Centre signed the share purchase agreement for this deal.For Tata Group, AI is the third airline. It holds a majority interest in AirAsia India and Vistara, a joint venture with Singapore Airlines Ltd. It will also get the AI’s prized landing and parking slots. AI has control of 4,400 domestic and 1,800 international landing and parking slots at domestic airports. It also has 900 slots at airports overseas such as London’s Heathrow and New York’s JFK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delighted-it-s-back-tata-group-takes-over-air-india-101643308199843.html
27-01-2022||India||Covid was the primary cause of death in 21% victims from Jan 13-25: Delhi govt analysis||New Delhi: Between January 13 and 25, only a little over 20% of the 438 Covid-19 classified deaths were due to a coronavirus infection with the rest being primarily caused by other comorbid illness, the death audit committee of the Delhi government has found, according to details accessed by HT.The 94 deaths spread over 13 days means there were a little over seven fatalities a day caused primarily by Covid-19 on average, corresponding to a period when cases were at its peak. The death audit committee also found that 64% of the deaths in which Covid-19 was the primary cause were in unvaccinated people.Also Read | At 4,291, Delhi's Covid tally further dips; case positivity rate goes below 9.5%It was not immediately clear whether the rest were in people who were fully or partially vaccinated.“We can now say that in this wave fewer infected people are dying of Covid-19. Data from the last 13 days shows that 318 or 72.6% of those who lost their lives, died due to other serious illnesses such as cancer or kidney, liver, or heart diseases,” said a senior health department official who asked not to be named.“Mostly, we are seeing that the Omicron variant is not impacting even mild to moderately comorbid patients, if they are given timely and correct treatment after quick diagnosis. The learning is that people with comorbidities, especially those with serious comorbid conditions should be extra cautious,” this person added.Prior to the current wave, the last time there were seven deaths a day on average over a week was in the third week of June, at the end of the Delta variant-triggered wave.The data was presented at the meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Thursday, where it was decided that some of the curbs, like the weekend curfew and the complete ban on dine-in service at restaurants, will be rolled back.Also Read | Weekend curfew over, dining out back in cityOf the 94 people who died primarily of Covid-19, 89 were eligible for vaccines. In this, only 32 were vaccinated. The numbers are consistent with previous analyses of deaths, when 66-75% of the deaths were found to be in unvaccinated people. Experts said the most recent number needs to be further studied.Eight of the 438 Covid-19 classified deaths were due to other causes such as accident and suicide. “In this category, they came to hospitals due to burn injuries, asphyxiation, trauma and so on and they were later found Covid-19 positive when RT-PCR tests were conducted as per the admission protocols,” the official said.The bulk of the fatalities were classified as incidental Covid-19 positives – that is, they were detected with the virus because they underwent mandatory testing.The data presented at the meeting also showed that citywide genome surveillance found 79% of 2,503 samples to be of the Omicron variant, while 14% were of the Delta variant and its sub-lineages.A second official present in the DDMA meeting said experts such as Dr VK Paul, member (health) NITI Aayog and Dr Balram Bhargava, ICMR chief, asked authorities to carry out genome sequencing of 100% hospitalised cases so that it is known which variants are causing how many deaths.“They were also asked to prepare age-wise details of hospitalised cases so that it is known which age group is more susceptible to falling serious post infection. It will help plan necessary interventions,” the official said requesting anonymity.Dr Suman Batra, medical superintendent of Deep Chand Bandhu hospital said the number of patients reporting at the casualty section of their facility are mostly patients with mild symptoms who are recommended home isolation by the doctors.“This time we had a maximum of about 30-40 Covid-19 patients admitted in our hospital on a single day. All of them either have co-morbidities or are elderly. Many of them came with complaints such as high sugar or chest pain, but not because of Covid-19. So, when we do their Covid-19 test after admission, they come out positive. They are admitted not for Covid-19, but for the comorbidities and once that co-morbidity is treated, they recover very fast. Whatever little deaths are happening, it is because of severe comorbidities,” she said.The number of hospitalisations also decreased from 2,684 on January 18 to 1,887 on Thursday. Patients needing oxygen decreased from 909 to 725 during the same period. However, serious cases have seen only a marginal decline. On January 18, there were 575 patients on ICU beds, who also needed oxygen. On Thursday, this came down marginally to 497. At the same time, 140 patients were on ventilators on January 18 and on Thursday, the number increased to 155.Of the total 15,420 Covid beds available, 13.9% or 2,137 were occupied as on Wednesday. The maximum occupancy was in Central government hospitals where 722 (21.3%) of its 3,391 Covid-19 beds were occupied. Delhi government hospitals had 246 (5.1%) of its 4,791 beds taken , while private hospitals had 1,169 (16.2%) of their 7,238 Covid beds occupied.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital, said death audit is important to find out the relationship with death but it is not a causal association. “We need to know from among the 94 deaths labelled as primary cause, how many are actually associated with comorbid conditions and older age groups? Omicron as such is not involving lung or other major organs so the cause of death could be secondary infections,” Dr Kishore said.

27-01-2022||India||India calls for ‘greater urgency’ in trade negotiations with EU||India wants “greater urgency” and “faster movement” in negotiations with the European Union (EU) for trade and investment pacts, though there are challenges such as the demands of the 27-member bloc and non-trade issues, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Thursday. Jaishankar made the remarks while participating in a virtual conversation with his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian that focused on the EU-India partnership in the Indo-Pacific during the French presidency of the bloc. Le Drian announced France will host a ministerial forum on the Indo-Pacific on February 22 to come up with concrete proposals for cooperation in security and defence, connectivity and digital, and global challenges. The two foreign ministers spoke extensively on cooperation between India and France within the Indo-Pacific region on a wide range of issues, including Covid-19 vaccines, regulations for the blue economy, connectivity projects that are transparent and respect the sovereignty, and promoting regional peace and stability. When Jaishankar was asked by the moderator of the discussion about India-EU negotiations for trade and investment agreements, he cited two specific challenges in the case of the European bloc – the involvement so 27 countries, and the need to “harmonise and prioritise” their demands and some non-trade issues. Negotiators from both sides have been in touch since India, and the EU agreed at a virtual summit last year to resume negotiations after a hiatus of eight years and are “quite active”, he said. “There has been movement but obviously the expectation level is high. We would like to see greater urgency, faster movement,” he said. India is “quite ready” to move faster and is hoping the progress in similar negotiations with other countries “adds to our credibility where Brussels is concerned”, Jaishankar said. Le Drian remarked that trade discussions are never easy, and bound to be complicated when they involve as many players as the 27 members of the EU. “The path is sometimes difficult, but if the will is there, we will get there,” he said. Recent reports have suggested that India and the EU are working to finalise an investment agreement before they take up the more complicated issue of a free trade pact. Le Drian outlined France’s plan to organise a ministerial forum on the Indo-Pacific on February 22, which he said would be the first such event during his country’s presidency of the EU. The forum will focus on three areas – security and defence, connectivity and digital, and global challenges – and will be part of efforts to preserve an Indo-Pacific governed by rule of law, he said. It is also part of a stronger European commitment to face up to the security challenges of the vast region, and will come up with concrete proposals to tackle such issues in line with the EU’s strategy for the Indo-Pacific, he said. “We wish to work within this forum for the emergence of a production capacity of a vaccine for all of the indo-Pacific because the production of vaccines...is a key challenge to which we can bring collective answers,” Le Drian said, speaking in French. There is also a proposal for India and the EU to create an “Indo-Pacific campus on health” that will foster exchanges in training, innovation, and cooperation on pharmaceutical products. Le Drian suggested this campus could be based in India as a “symbol of the common will to make the Indo-Pacific an area of sharing and partnership”. At the same time, the EU is working on a “coordinated maritime presence” in the Indo-Pacific for greater stability and better security in the region, he said. Both Jaishankar and Le Drian said the close cooperation between India and France in a range of key areas could serve as a foundation for collaboration within the EU framework in the Indo-Pacific. Jaishankar said India’s position on connectivity partnerships and the EU’s Global Gateway initiative for smart and secure links in the digital, energy and transport sectors are based on similar principles, including democratic values, good governance, transparency, commercial viability, local ownership, and respect for the territorial integrity of countries.

Police personnel did a flag march before the wedding procession of Rahul Meghwal, a resident of Sarsi village of the district. “The father of the bridegroom, Fakirchand Meghwal, had sought police protection a few days ago for his son Rahul who was the first person from the scheduled caste committee of the village to have booked a horse for the wedding procession,” said Kanhaiyalal Dangi, town inspector Manasa. “As many as 100 police personnel were deployed in the village on Wednesday to keep a watch on the law and order situation,” Dangi said. A local Bahujan Samaj Party leader Radheshyam Commander said, “History was created in the village as people from the scheduled caste committee were afraid of riding a horse in the village to their wedding. A few goons of the village used to stop them from riding a horse so we requested police protection.” Earlier, on Sunday, some villagers in Ganiyari village of Sagar district attacked the house of Dalit groom Dilip Ahirwar for riding a horse. Ahirwar rode a horse during a wedding procession called Racch under police protection but later in the night; about 20 people attacked his house and pelted stones. The police have booked 20 people under relevant sections of SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and arrested six of them. 
27-01-2022||India||India-born priest becomes England Bishop with Indian rosewood staff||An India-born vicar, who grew up in a leprosy hospital in Bangalore where his mother was a nurse, has been consecrated as Bishop in the Church of England with a staff, or crozier, made of Indian rosewood.The Right Reverend Malayil Lukose Varghese Muthalaly, known as Saju, aged 42 became one of the youngest Bishops when he was consecrated during a Eucharist service at St. Paul’s Cathedral in London by the Archbishop of Canterbury on Tuesday."I have been preparing for this service very much aware of what a great privilege it is that people around the world are praying for this moment. There is a very strong sense of the wider church affirming this calling," said Rt. Rev. Saju.Two of his four children, Zipp and Abraham, joined him for prayers during the service this week.While he has started work towards his new role, he will be formally installed and known as Bishop of Loughborough only after a Welcome Service with guests and representatives of the diocese at Brockington Church of England Academy in Enderby, Leicestershire, on February 5.The service in London marked the feast day of the conversion of St. Paul the apostle, and an insightful sermon was preached on that topic by Dr Selina Stone, tutor and lecturer in theology at St. Mellitus College."I absolutely loved the service… There were so many people there cheering you on from here in Leicestershire and from Dubai, from India and other parts of the world,” Rev. Saju told the BBC.Rev. Saju has previously spoken about how he was born in India and spent the first half of his life there, around the beautiful backwaters of Kerala and then Bangalore. He has spent the last 21 years in England, where he arrived during a gap year and fell in love with Katy, now his wife."I sensed the call to live and work in England. And now, Loughborough feels like home. Our experience is that Leicestershire people are so welcoming,” he said.On his priorities for his new role in the East Midlands region, the reverend added: “The first year I want to just spend time with as many people as I can. I am a stranger to this place, there’s a lot to learn and a lot to listen to."He also revealed his early to bed, early to rise routine, which includes lots of reading and reflecting. With his four young children, aged between eight and 12, he enjoys playing cricket, which he believes is among the most beautiful contributions the English have made to the world.As a sporty person, he also enjoys running and has completed a few marathons.Saju, whose appointment as Bishop in the Church of England was approved by Queen Elizabeth II in November last year, was educated at the Southern Asia Bible College in Bangalore, and trained for the ministry at Wycliffe Hall, Oxford. He served his title at St. Thomas’, Lancaster, in the Diocese of Blackburn and was ordained Priest in the Church of England in 2009.Previously, Saju was appointed Associate Vicar at St. Thomas’, Kendal, and St. Catherine’s, Crook, in the Diocese of Carlisle, north-west England, in 2011. He has served at St. Mark’s, Gillingham and St Mary’s Island in the Diocese of Rochester since 2015 – initially as Priest-in-Charge, before being appointed Vicar in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiaborn-priest-becomes-england-bishop-with-indian-rosewood-staff-101643305340426.html

27-01-2022||India||TMC to move motion in Parliament against Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar||Bengal’s ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Thursday decided to place a Substantive Motion in the Rajya Sabha criticizing the actions of Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar with whom the state government’s acrimonious relationship has touched an all-time low in recent months, TMC leaders aware of the development said. The decision was taken at a closed-door meeting that chief minister Mamata Banerjee held with her party’s Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha members on Thursday evening to discuss strategy for the coming session of the Parliament. TMC leaders publicly describe Dhankhar, the state’s 28th governor, as “an agent of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)” and call the Raj Bhawan in Kolkata an “extended office” of the saffron camp. The motion will describe Dhankhar’s activities as violation of Constitutional norms and practices, senior TMC leaders told HT. Since a governor is protected by the Constitution, the TMC may not directly demand Dhankhar’s removal and focus on his actions instead. The TMC will also talk to parties opposed to the BJP to garner support for the motion. No party in India has done this in recent history and the attempt may be futile, Constitutional experts said. The rule book of the Rajya Sabha says: “A substantive motion is a self-contained proposal made in reference to a subject which the mover wishes to bring forward.” “Dhankhar has crossed all limits when it comes to interference with governance. He arbitrarily summons bureaucrats and demands explanation for their actions. He shows no respect for the chief minister. We will present the scenario before the Parliament,” said TMC Rajya Sabha member and lawyer Sukhendu Sekhar Roy who was asked by the chief minister to draft the motion in consultation with experts. Asked whether the party will demand Dhankhar’s removal, Sudip Bandopadhyay, the party’s leader in the Lok Sabha said, “This governor should leave on his own without waiting for such a demand.” In a significant move, Banerjee also told her leaders that from now on she will give more time to organizational work by taking out time from her official duties. Dhankhar was sworn in on July 30, 2019, and the face-off started in less than two months. On September 19 that year, he raised eyebrows by rushing to Jadavpur University to “rescue” the then Union minister and BJP leader Babul Supriyo who was gheraoed by agitating students. Five days later, Dhankhar visited Siliguri town in north Bengal and reacted sharply when local people’s representatives and administrative officials did not show up for a meeting that he had convened. “It does not make any difference to me if people do not attend my meeting. I will visit every district and call similar meetings in future,” Dhankhar said, implying that he could not be deterred. The exchanges continued, with Dhankhar and the government taking to social media or exchanging letters that were released to the media from both sides. In April 2020, when the state was grappling with the Covid-19 pandemic, Dhankhar’s consistent jibes at the state over handling of the crisis prompted the chief minister to shoot off a 15-page letter to Raj Bhawan. “You appear to have forgotten that I am an elected chief minister of a proud Indian state. You also seem to have forgotten that you are a nominated Governor. You may continue to ignore all advice and inputs given by me and my council of ministers (as you appear to have taken upon yourself to do since the day of your appointment), but at least you should not ignore the wise words of Babasaheb Ambedkar in the Constituent Assembly on 31/5/1949,” Banerjee wrote and went on the quote what Ambedkar said on several occasions. A constitutional expert and former principal of Presidency College (now a university), Prof Amal Mukherjee told HT that the motion will be rejected outright by the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha because it has no validity. “Motions can be brought only against members of the Parliament, not outsiders. A governor is above those rules. In many ways a governor enjoys more privileges than the President of India. The Parliament may initiate impeachment proceedings against a President of the country but not against a governor,” Mukherjee said. Conflict between a governor and the ruling party is not new in Bengal but the present scenario is quite unique, political observers have pointed out on several occasions. In 2007, when the Left Front was in power, violence at Nandigram in East Midnapore district claimed 34 lives between January and November over farmers’ opposition to a proposed land acquisition for a special economic zone (SEZ). The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government was compelled to scrap the plan. The then governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi, the grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, criticised the violence in a nearly 700-word statement in November 2007. It immediately triggered vitriolic reactions from the Marxists. 
27-01-2022||India||HT This Day: January 30, 1961 -- Taj Mahal A Glorious Sight Says The Queen||Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip today spent about an hour at Taj Mahal and about 50 minutes inside the Agra Fort. “It is a glorious sight,” the Queen was heard to say. Leaving the Taj, the Queen abruptly stopped at the main gate to have a last look at the monument. They again visited the Taj shortly after 9 p.m and stayed there for nearly an hour. With an overcast sky there was only a dim and hazy moon. On their visits to the Taj and the Fort during the day the Queen and the Prince were accompanied by the Commissioner of Agra Division, who explained details about the architecture and Mrs Vijayalakshmi Pandit. Inside the Taj Mahal an attendant shouted thrice and the Queen listened to the echo with rapt attention. She also saw the alcove where the Kohinoor was once kept. Special overshoes in scarlet velvet had been provided by the authorities. At the Fort, where fountains played for the first time in many years, the Queen spent some time in the Sheesh Mahal, the octagonal tower where Shahjehan was imprisoned, and the Diwan-e-khas. On behalf of the citizens the Queen was presented with an album of coloured photographs of Agra. Queen Elizabeth on her arrival at Kheria airport was received by Mrs Sucheta Kripalani, U.P. Minister for Community Development, on behalf of the State Government, the Mayor and officials. About 5,000 spectators gathered at the airport, decorated with Tricolours and Union Jacks. Two large open cars belonging to the Governor’s Household which were brought to Agra from Lucknow drove up to the Queen’s Britannia as it came to a halt. The Queen, dressed in a turquoise dress and a white hat walking beside Prince Philip, smilingly shook hands with Mrs Kripalani and others, including 12 U.K. nationals in Agra. The Queen seemed to have borne the flight from Delhi to Agra, which must have been bumpy, fairly well. As the Queen got into the car with Mrs Kripalani, the crowd cheered. Simple Reception The reception at Agra airport was simple and did not take more than a few minutes. Even the national anthems were not played. The reason perhaps was the bad weather. But it seems that the reception at Agra was deliberately kept simple. Except for Mrs Kripalani, no other dignitary, neither the Governor nor the Chief Minister or other Ministers came to Agra from Lucknow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-this-day-january-30-1961-taj-mahal-a-glorious-sight-says-the-queen-101643302978613.html
27-01-2022||India||HT This Day: January 28, 1950 -- India goes gay on Republic Day||Unforgettable scenes of enthusiasm and rejoicing marked the beginning of a new era in the history of India yesterday when the Republic of India was born with the swearing in of Dr Rajendra Prasad as its first President. The glittering ceremony in the Durbar Hall of Government House, the excitement of hundreds of thousands of people lining the five-mile route through which the President drove in State and the spectacularly colourful parade at Irwin Stadium where the President hoisted the National Flag and took the Republic salute will remain in people’s memory for long. It was the people’s day, and they left no one in doubt about it. They crowded the streets, roofs and all available vantage points all along the route right from Government House to Irwin Stadium. Even though they could not watch the President, the Prime Minister and the Cabinet Ministers being sworn in they associated themselves with the ceremony by rushing into the forecourt of Government House and expressing their joy at the inauguration of the Republic. The swearing-in ceremony at Government House and the accompanying functions were most impressive. They took about two hours and went off exactly as planned. The audience in the Durbar Hall felt thrilled first when Rajaji read out the Proclamation establishing the Republic and next when the President took the oath of office in the national language and also made his brief speech first in Hindi and then in English. (Details of this function are published elsewhere in this issue.) While crowds were awaiting expectantly, the President in white cap, black achkan and white pyjamas, stepped down the Durbar Hall steps to the State Coach accompanied by his Private Secretary, his Military Secretary, and two picturesquely dressed A.D.C.s. The 35-year-old coach specially renovated for the occasion, bearing the new State emblem of Asoka’s Capitol, and drawn by six sturdy Australian valours had already pulled up at the foot of the steps. The trappings of its saddlery had also been changed from crowns to Asoka Capitols. As Dr Rajendra Prasad stepped into the coach and the two A.D.C.s took their seats facing him there were shouts of joy and crowds once again made a rush through the cordons. The Coach drove out of Government House at a slow trot escorted by the President’s Body Guards. All along the route the President was welcomed by shouts of joy. The President responded to the greetings of the people by bowing to them with folded hands. The drive, which began exactly at 2:30 p.m., ended exactly at 3:45 p.m. at Irwin Stadium where 3,000 officers and men of the three Services and the police with massed bands had taken position for a ceremonial parade. The Stadium was packed with visitors, with National Flags and the new flags of the Services fluttering all around the Stadium, it presented a site of splendour, the colourfulness of the scene being heightened by the drab walls of the historic Purana Qila in the background. FANFARE OF TRUMPETS A fanfare of trumpet announced the arrival of the President and there was loud cheering as he stepped down from the coach, and was received by the Defence Minister, Sardar Balder Singh. The three Service Chiefs were then presented to the President, who accompanied by the Defence Minister and the Service Chiefs, went to the Saluting Base. The parade gave the national salute to the President, the National Flag was broken at mast and while the whole assembly stood massed bands played the National Anthem. A brightly-painted jeep took the President and the Commander of the Parade. Brig. Dhillon, round the units on parade. The inspection over, the President returned to the base of the dais and a salute of 31 guns was fired in three instalments. In between the parade fired a fes-de-joie thrice. The most exciting moment came when the parade gave the President three jais while a flight of I.A.F. Liberators roared past over the Stadium. The march-past now began and the admiring crowds cheered each unit as it crossed the base. It was a smart turn-out and among those who received specially loud cheers were the Air Force, the Gurkhas and the boys of the Punjab Regiment. The massed bands were the last to march past and were cheered equally loudly. On the President’s departure from the Parade Ground there was another sound of trumpets and one of the most impressive ceremonies seen in years came to an end. The President drove from Irwin Stadium to Government House at 4:30 p.m. The crowds had swelled the route through Kingsway and they cheered the President all along. Historic in its significance, it was an unforgettable day. It was a day of joy and the ruminations all over the Capital at night showed how happily and enthusiastically the people welcomed the advent of the Republic. P.T.I. reports: A spectacular parade of the Defence Services climaxed the five-mile-long Presidential procession. Twenty thousand spectators, including President Soekarno of Indonesia, Pandit Nehru, the Deputy Prime Minister, Sardar Patel, and other Cabinet Ministers, members of the diplomatic corps, members of Parliament and men, and women and children from all walks of life watched the President take the National Salute. Tricolours, a huge Asoka capitol placed in the main stadium, the flags of the three Services, the multicoloured berets, caps, turbans and buckles, the gorgeous costumes of the massed bandsmen, the picturesque uniforms of the President’s Bodyguard escorting the President’s coach-and-six, the saffron and red decorations--everything contributed to a feast of colour and pageantry befitting the first ceremonial parade held in the capital of the new Republic. A tremendous cheer went up as they sighted the President’s coach, drawn by six chestnut horses and escorted by his mounted Bodyguard in scarlet tunics and a detachment of the Gwalior Lancers. Liveried footmen held aloft a red and gold umbrella. A fanfare of trumpets heralded his arrival. Dr Rajendra Prasad, wearing black achkan and churiders and Gandhi cap, bowed smilingly in acknowledgment of the cheers of the multitude. The parade-the Navy as the seniormost Service formed to the left, the Army in ochre green in the centre and the Air Force, boys of the Punjab Regiment and the police to the right then gave the President the National Salute, which replaced the old Royal salute. The National Flag was broken at half-mast and massed bands played Rabindranath Tagore’s Jana Gana Mana. Conducted by the Officer Commanding the parade, Brig. J. S. Dhillon, Dr Prasad then inspected the parade from a green-painted jeep flying the Presidents Flag. As the President returned to the dais 31 guns boomed and the men assembled in parade cracked their rifles thrice, firing feu-de-joie. each volley followed by the National Anthem. The parade gave the President three vigorous jais as the artillery smoke hid the view for the spectators perched precariously on top of the crumbling walls of the Purana Qila.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthis-day-january-28-1950-india-goes-gay-on-republicday-101643302077989.html

Pointing to the defections that the party is seeing, BJP's Amit Malviya said at a time when the party is facing rebellion in Uttarakhand, Punjab, Rahul Gandhi is worried about his Twitter followers.Former IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said, "May be large number of leaders who are leaving Congress, their followers are now unfollowing Rahul Gandhi." May be large number of leaders who are leaving Congress, their followers are now unfollowing Rahul Gandhi! 😀 https://t.co/YZi05qsTLMRahul Gandhi had written the letter on December 27, but it has only come to the surface on Wednesday. "I believe Twitter's unwitting complicity in curbing free and fair speech in India," Rahul wrote in the letter addressed to Twitter's CEO Parag Agarwal. In his letter, he also sent an analysis of data from his Twitter account showing that the follower count has not increased for several months. He also said that this is "not so coincidental".Twitter on Thursday issued a statement stating that follower counts are a visible feature and the numbers are accurate and meaningful.Amid this to and fro, Amit Malviya asked will Rahul Gandhi also write to the Election Commission for not getting votes. "Rahul Gandhi has written to Twitter complaining that his followers count has not increased since his account was temporarily suspended in 2021…Rahul doesn’t get audience in the real world and now virtual world too! What next? Write to EC and complain for not getting votes?"The Congress said Rahul Gandhi's stand was vindicated that democracy and social media platforms cannot be suppressed or subjugated by the ruling government||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-leaders-mock-rahul-gandhi-s-twitter-complaint-says-maybe-this-is-the-reason-101643299217965.html

27-01-2022||India||Impose, lift local curbs based on test positivity, hospitalization: MHA to states||Reiterating that state governments must observe all precautions and not let their guard down, the Union home ministry on Thursday extended the existing Covid-19 guidelines till February 28. It has asked the states to impose or lift local curbs on the basis of case positivity and hospitalization status in respective areas. Issuing an order under the Disaster Management Act, Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla said the guidelines issued on December 27 last year to ensure compliance to the normative framework for taking evidence based Covid-19 containment measures at district/local level will remain in force till end of February. He separately wrote to the chief secretaries of the states and union territories asking them to issue necessary directions to the districts and other local authorities concerned to take measures for prompt and effective management of Covid-19, strict compliance of various advisories issued by the central health ministry and strict enforcement of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour – social distancing and wearing masks. “Due to the current Covid-19 wave, led by the new variant – Omicron, there has been a steady increase in the number of Covid-19 cases in the country and the active cases have increased to over 22 lakh. Though a majority of active cases are recovering fast and a low percentage of cases are in hospitals, it is still a matter of concern that 407 districts in 34 states and UTs are reporting a positivity rate of more than 10%,” Bhalla’s letter read. Therefore, he added, looking at the current trends of the Covid-19 virus, there is a need to exercise caution and vigilance. The home secretary said, “In this background, I would like to reiterate that all the states/UTs must observe all precautions and not let their guard down.” He asked the authorities to continue to take prompt and appropriate action. “Imposition and lifting of local curbs should be dynamic and should be based on case positivity and hospitalization status at the local level”. The ministry has also told the states to focus on the five-fold strategy of Test-Track-Treat-Vaccination and adherence to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour to avoid any surge in Covid-19 cases, especially keeping in view Omicron, the new variant of concern (VOC). The government has already clarified through previous orders that any person violating the guidelines will be “liable to be proceeded against as per the provisions of Section 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, besides legal action under Section 188 of CrPC, and other legal provisions, as applicable.” India reported 2,86,384 new Covid-19 cases and 573 deaths in the last 24 hours, according to the Union health ministry bulletin on Thursday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/impose-lift-local-curbs-based-on-test-positivity-hospitalization-mha-to-states-101643295897373.html

27-01-2022||India||India for ‘greater urgency’ in trade negotiations with EU, says EAM Jaishankar||India wants “greater urgency” and “faster movement” in negotiations with the European Union (EU) for trade and investment pacts, though there are challenges such as the demands of the 27-member bloc and non-trade issues, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Thursday. Jaishankar made the remarks while participating in a virtual conversation with his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian that focused on EU-India partnership in the Indo-Pacific during the French presidency of the bloc. Le Drian announced France will host a ministerial forum on the Indo-Pacific on February 22 to come up with concrete proposals for cooperation in security and defence, connectivity and digital, and global challenges. The two foreign ministers spoke extensively on cooperation between India and France within the Indo-Pacific region on a wide range of issues, including Covid-19 vaccines, regulations for the blue economy, connectivity projects that are transparent and respect sovereignty, and promoting regional peace and stability. When Jaishankar was asked by the moderator of the discussion about India-EU negotiations for trade and investment agreements, he cited two specific challenges in the case of the European bloc – the involvement so 27 countries, and the need to “harmonise and prioritise” their demands and some non-trade issues. Negotiators from both sides have been in touch since India and the EU agreed at a virtual summit last year to resume negotiations after a hiatus of eight years and are “quite active”, he said. “There has been movement but obviously the expectation level is high. We would like to see greater urgency, faster movement,” he said. India is “quite ready” to move faster and is hoping the progress in similar negotiations with other countries “adds to our credibility where Brussels is concerned”, Jaishankar said. Le Drian remarked that trade discussions are never easy, and bound to be complicated when they involve as many players as the 27 members of the EU. “The path is sometimes difficult but if the will is there, we will get there,” he said. Recent reports have suggested that India and the EU are working to finalise an investment agreement before they take up the more complicated issue of a free trade pact. Le Drian outlined France’s plan to organise a ministerial forum on the Indo-Pacific on February 22, which he said would be the first such event during his country’s presidency of the EU. The forum will focus on three areas – security and defence, connectivity and digital, and global challenges – and will be part of efforts to preserve an Indo-Pacific governed by rule of law, he said. It is also part of a stronger European commitment to face up to the security challenges of the vast region, and will come up with concrete proposals to tackle such issues in line with the EU’s strategy for the Indo-Pacific, he said. “We wish to work within this forum for the emergence of a production capacity of a vaccine for all of the indo-Pacific because the production of vaccines...is a key challenge to which we can bring collective answers,” Le Drian said, speaking in French. There is also a proposal for India and the EU to create an “Indo-Pacific campus on health” that will foster exchanges in training, innovation, and cooperation on pharmaceutical products. Le Drian suggested this campus could be based in India as a “symbol of the common will to make the Indo-Pacific an area of sharing and partnership”. At the same time, the EU is working on a “coordinated maritime presence” in the Indo-Pacific for greater stability and better security in the region, he said. Both Jaishankar and Le Drian said the close cooperation between India and France in a range of key areas could serve as a foundation for collaboration within the EU framework in the Indo-Pacific. Jaishankar said India’s position on connectivity partnerships and the EU’s Global Gateway initiative for smart and secure links in the digital, energy and transport sectors are based on similar principles, including democratic values, good governance, transparency, commercial viability, local ownership, and respect for the territorial integrity of countries. 
27-01-2022||India||In Assam, 246 insurgents of two outfits lay down arms, surrender||A total of 246 terrorists from two outfits of Assam, the Tiwa Liberation Army (TLA) and United Gorkha Peoples Organisation (UGPO), formally surrendered and laid down arms before Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma in Guwahati on Thursday. According to Assam Police, members of both the outfits deposited 277 types of arms, grenades and 720 rounds of ammunition at the event held at Srimanta Sankardev Kalakshetra. Nearly 77 cadres of TLA surrendered and laid down arms, while the rest 169 were from UGPO. “All the main operatives of both the outfits including their chairmen, commander-in-chiefs, general secretaries have surrendered today. A few of their cadres, who are in jail or absconding, may have remained. We will deal with them later,” said Hiren Chandra Nath, additional DGP (Special Branch), Assam Police. Formed in 2014, TLA was mainly active in Marigaon, Nagaon and West Karbi Anglong districts while UGPO, which was formed in 2007, was active in Kokrajhar, Chirang, Baksa and Biswanath districts.

27-01-2022||India||India-Central Asia cooperation key to regional stability: PM Modi||Cooperation between India and Central Asia has gained in importance for regional security and stability in the aftermath of developments in Afghanistan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said while chairing India’s first summit with the five Central Asian states on Thursday. The summit will also create an effective structure for cooperation, Modi said in his opening remarks at the virtual summit that was joined by the presidents of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The summit will also forge an “ambitious roadmap” for cooperation, he said. The virtual summit was organised as the leaders of the Central Asian states were unable to attend India’s Republic Day celebrations on Wednesday because of a surge in Covid-19 infections. The five leaders were invited to be chief guests at the event, though no formal announcement was made by any of the countries. Connectivity, trade, forging an institutionalised framework for cooperation and the situation in Afghanistan were on the agenda for the summit, the first interaction of its kind between the leaders of the six countries. The six countries currently have a mechanism at the level of foreign ministers, called the India-Central Asia Dialogue, and its third meeting was hosted by New Delhi in December. India has sharpened it focus on Central Asian both to counter China’s growing presence in the region and to strengthen cooperation on Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover of that country. “We are all concerned with the developments in Afghanistan,” Modi said, speaking in Hindi. “In this context, our mutual cooperation has become more important for regional security and stability.” Modi listed the three main objectives of the summit – to make it clear that mutual cooperation between India and Central Asia is essential for regional security and prosperity, to create an effective structure for cooperation, and to create an ambitious roadmap for cooperation. “On behalf of India, I would like to clarify that Central Asia is central to India’s vision of an integrated and stable extended neighbourhood,” he said. An effective structure for cooperation will establish a framework of regular interactions at different levels and among various stakeholders, and the roadmap will enable the six countries to adopt an “integrated approach for regional connectivity and cooperation in the next thirty years”, he added. As India and the Central Asian states mark 30 years of diplomatic ties, Modi noted that cooperation in the past led to many successes but the time had come to define an “ambitious vision for the years to come” that can fulfil the aspirations of the people, especially the younger generation. Modi also referred to India’s close ties with all the Central Asian states at a bilateral level, and described Kazakhstan as an important partner for the country’s energy security. “I express my condolences for the recent loss of life and property in Kazakhstan,” he said, referring to violent protests over a rise in gas prices in that country. India’s state governments are active partners in growing cooperation with Uzbekistan, while there is an active partnership with Kyrgyzstan in education and high-altitude research. “Thousands of Indian students are studying there,” Modi said. “We have long-standing cooperation in the field of security with Tajikistan, and we are continuously strengthening it,” he said. Modi described Turkmenistan as an important part of India’s vision for regional connectivity, and said this was evident from “our participation in the Ashgabat Agreement”.

I have learned that to preserve what is best about the past, requires constant change. It is by evolving, adapting and embracing the future that we best honour a glorious history," the letter read.The Air India divestment procedure was complete with the present board members resigning and with the formal handover of the shares.

The corporators included Mayor Tahira Shaikh who joined the other ruling ally in the presence of deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and state NCP president Jayant Patil.Congress is part of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government along with Shiv Sena and NCP. The move is likely to upset the Congress, which is already protesting over not being included in key decisions and allocation of less funds to departments held by its ministers.The election to the municipal corporation is scheduled this year. In the last elections, Congress had won 28 seats in the civic body that governs the Muslim-dominated Malegaon city in North Maharashtra. It won on its own but now it’s entire unit in the civic body has quit the party. “We were planning to hold a huge rally for induction of the corporators but it could not be held because of the Covid-19 pandemic as daily cases are being detected in big numbers. Ultimately it was decided to hold it at the party office. NCP chief Sharad Pawar has never discriminated against people over religion, caste, creed or relations,” said Ajit Pawar after inducting the corporators along with the mayor at the NCP headquarters at Ballard Pier.Atul Londhe, the Congress spokesperson said that the people of Malegaon are with Congress. “Even if corporators have left the party, the people of Malegaon city are with the Congress. This time again the party will win the upcoming civic body elections,” said Londhe.Significantly, Congress candidate in the last assembly elections Asif Shaikh resigned from the party last year. He is likely to join NCP. Shaikh was a Congress MLA but was defeated in the 2019 elections by AIMIM candidate Mufti Mohammad Ismail.

Its 100% stake was sold to the autos-to-steel Tata conglomerate for ₹18,000 crore. The Centre announced the sale on October 8.Talace Pvt Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Sons, gets 100% equity shares of AI and AI Express. It will also get the government’s 50% stake in ground-handling company AISATS.In a tweet, department of investment and public asset management secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey said: “The strategic disinvestment transaction of Air India successfully concluded today with transfer of 100 per cent shares of Air India to M/s talace Pvt Ltd along with management control.” He added a new board, led by the strategic partner, has taken AI’s charge.In a statement, the finance ministry said the strategic disinvestment transaction has been completed with the government receiving ₹ 2,700 crores.Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran said they are totally delighted that this process is complete. “We are very happy to have Air India back in the Tata fold. We look forward to working with everyone.”In a tweet, civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya M Scindia said, “Best wishes to the new owners. I am confident that the airline will bloom under their wings, and pave the way for a thriving & robust civil aviation industry in India.”An internal message sent to AI employees on Monday said the closing balance sheet was to be submitted by the end of the day.

The sub-strain of Omicron, which is Omicron BA.2, is more prevalent in India, the ministry said. “We have been observing an early indication of Covid plateau, but it is only limited to some regions,” health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said. A total of 10 states are contributing to 77% of the active cases. More than 90% of cases are under home isolation, the health ministry data revealed. Covaxin, Covishield to be available in hospitals, clinics; apex body gives nodTalking about Omicron and its sub-strains, Sujeet Kumar Singh, the director of the National Centre for Disease Control, said, "Initially when the variant was being spread through foreign travellers, then BA.1 was prevalent. But now as Omicron transmission is in the community, the prevalence of BA.2 is noted. This prevalence is also limited to some states. As on today, we can see Delta only in three states: Odisha, Maharashtra and West Bengal.""Delta cases are also found in India. Even in Delhi, Delta variants are found," Sujeet Singh said.Between December 2021 and January 2022, Omicron has replaced Delta, according to genome sequencing data. But active cases and corresponding deaths compared to previous waves remained lower. This is also because of the vaccination as it led to fewer cases, fewer hospitalisation and fewer deaths, the ministry said. On May 7, 2021, at the peak of the second wave, there were 4,14,188 new cases and 3,679 deaths while only 3% of people were fully vaccinated. Comparing this with the data of January 21, the ministry said on January 21, 2022, there were 3,47,254 new cases and 435 deaths and 75% of people are fully vaccinated.According to health ministry data, the third wave is now peaking in Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan. Districts that are recording high cases and increase in positivity include Pine, Ernakulam, Thiruvananthapuram, Ahmedabad, Nagpur and Kozhikode.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/omicron-sub-variant-ba-2-more-prevalent-3rd-wave-plateau-may-be-coming-centre-101643282791228.html
27-01-2022||India||‘Surrender and seek bail’: Nitesh Rane gets 10-day arrest shield from SC||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday granted Maharashtra BJP MLA Nitesh Rane protection from arrest for ten days in connection to an attempt to murder case to let him surrender and seek regular bail from the trial court. A bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana made it clear that the court is not commenting on the merits of the case, and that the interim protection for 10 days is granted to Rane for the purpose of him seeking regular bail from the trial court concerned.“We are not going to decide the facts...That is for the trial court. You surrender and seek regular bail,” the bench, which also comprised justices AS Bopanna and Hima Kohli, told Rane’s lawyers.Rane is accused of being the mastermind behind the attempt on the life of a Shiv Sena member on December 18 last year in the Kankavli area of Maharashtra. Rane, son of union minister Narayan Rane, represents Kankavli assembly seat in the Sindhudurg district.Senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi and Sidharth Luthra, representing Rane, argued that the charges against the leader were “completely bogus”.“The prosecution’s version is that there was a ‘deep-rooted conspiracy’ to stab the complainant with a ‘paper-cutter’. This shows the extent to which the state and the ruling party will go against my client who is a two-time MLA. This is a case of the police being more loyal than the king,” Rohatgi submitted.Sidharth Luthra added that the alleged victim was roaming around the day after the alleged incident in December 2021. “How can you have a conspiracy, hire killers to cause a simple injury with a paper-cutter on the complainant, who is a member of an opposition party? Can this version be believed?” he asked.Appearing for the Maharashtra government, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi opposed Rane’s appeal against denial of anticipatory bail by the Bombay high court on January 17.“My learned friends are trying to over-simplify the incident. The weapon is not a blunt paper-cutter found on a study table but a formidable one, which caused serious harm. There is evidence to show a link between the petitioner, his close associates and the attack. A detailed investigation has been done along with a test identification parade,” contended Singhvi.The bench decided to dispose of Rane’s petition by asking him to approach the trial court for regular bail while protecting him from any coercive action from the police for the time being.The case was registered against Rane after a Shiv Sena member filed a police complaint, alleging he was assaulted by certain persons linked with the MLA. The incident took place in December during the campaigning for the Sindhudurg District Co-operative Bank election.The Bombay high court on January 17 refused to grant pre-arrest bail to Rane in the case, noting that a balance was needed between conflicting considerations of personal liberty and a proper investigation in the matter.A single-judge bench of the high court, which rejected the anticipatory bail applications of Rane and another accused Sandesh Sawant, allowed a similar plea of the third accused in the case, Manish Dalvi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/surrender-and-seek-bail-nitesh-rane-gets-10-day-arrest-shield-from-sc-101643280115326.html

The session assumes importance coming in the backdrop of the elections in five states including Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Goa and Uttarakhand. The political stakeholders of these polls, such as the BJP, Congress, AAP, Akali Dal and Trinamool Congress might see an opportunity in this session for maneuvering with an eye on the polls. For the Congress, the larger issues are effective floor coordination with like-minded parties and picking up raging issues such as price rise, the economic situation while it also struggles with internal dissent and key leaders leaving the organization to join the BJP or rival parties. The Congress will also take a call in the meeting on its equations with Trinamool, another key Opposition force—after the recent spat over Goa elections where the Congress refused to tie up with an eager TMC. Overall, the equations between the two sides have turned frosty over the public statements of TMC leaders against the Congress and the poaching of leaders by TMC. But the focus of the Congress would be on the Budget and some of the key bills such as the upcoming crypto bill, the personal data protection bill and amendments to wildlife act.The strategy meeting, chaired by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, would also see attendance by LoP Mallikarjun Kharge, party’s Lok Sabha floor leader Adhir Chowdhury and other senior leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-budget-session-congress-to-hold-parliamentary-strategy-group-meet-tomorrow-101643279695029.html

But another leader Jairam Ramesh took a dig at Azad. “Right thing to do. He wants to be Azad, not Ghulam,” he tweeted in reference to former West Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee’s refusal to accept the Padma Bhushan.There was speculation about Azad leaving the Congress and forming an outfit in Jammu and Kashmir with support from the Bharatiya Janata Party.

Each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.In September 2020, the PLA had abducted five youths from Arunachal Pradesh's Upper Subansiri district and released them after about a week.

One of his tweets was recently taken down for violating Twitter’s content guidelines.“I want to bring your attention to what I believe is Twitter’s unwitting complicity in curbing free and fair speech in India… I have been reliably, albeit discreetly, informed by people at Twitter India that they are under immense pressure by the government to silence my voice,” Gandhi wrote. HT has seen a copy of the letter.The spokesperson said that Twitter removes millions of accounts each week for violating the company’s policies on platform manipulation and spam.

The central government had, earlier this week, said that it aims to complete the disinvestment process on January 27.Although the Air India flights will not be flying under the Tatas' banner just yet, it is an important declaration of the airline's handover to the autos-to-steel conglomerate nearly 70 years after it was taken.The “enhanced meal service” will be provided on four flights – AI864 (Mumbai-Delhi), AI687 (Mumbai-Delhi), AI945 (Mumbai-Abu Dhabi) and AI639 (Mumbai-Bengaluru) – scheduled for today.It will be served on the AI191 (Mumbai-Newark) flight and five Mumbai-Delhi flights on Friday and will be expanded to more flights in a staggered and phased manner.Meanwhile, the takeover is expected to take place on Thursday, as reported by Hindustan Times earlier.Following a competitive bidding process, the government had on October 8 last year sold Air India to Talace Private Limited – a subsidiary of the Tata Group's holding company – for ₹18,000 crore.The national carrier began its journey under the Tatas 90 years ago before the government nationalised the sector in 1953.Talace Pvt Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Sons, will get 100% equity shares of AI and AI Express, along with the government’s 50% stake in ground-handling company Airport Services Private Limited (AISATS).This is the first privatisation of an airline since 2003-04.At the same time, with the takeover, Air India will become the third airline brand in the Tatas' stable, making it a dominant player at No. 2 spot in the domestic market after IndiGo. The Tata Group already holds a majority interest in AirAsia India and Vistara, a joint venture with Singapore Airlines Ltd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tata-to-offer-enhanced-meals-on-flights-as-first-move-in-air-india-takeover-101643252561334.html

The central government, in a bid to complete the disinvestment process, is expected to hand over the airline to Tata Group today.The process started two decades ago, when former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee invited bids to sell the government's 40 per cent stake in the national carrier. Singapore Airlines and Tata Group showed interest, but the disinvestment process could not be completed.Since then, the government has tried to sell the airline, burgeoning with losses, to raise funds. It finally succeeded in its bid in October last year.The foundationAir India was founded by industrialist Jehangir Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata (as Tata Airlines) in 1932 and over the next few decades, it grew into India's flagship international carrier.The first scheduled flight took off from Karachi and brought air mail and some passengers to Bombay. It went further to Chennai.In 1939, its routes were extended to Thiruvananthapuram, Delhi, Colombo and Lahore.A public companyIn 1946, Tata Airlines was converted into a public company and renamed Air-India Limited. Two years later, the coverage was expanded internationally - to Cairo, Geneva and London from Bombay - and Air-India International Limited was formed.NationalisationThe government of India nationalised all Indian airlines in 1953 and created two corporations - Indian Airlines for domestic flights and Air-India International for worldwide services. The latter's name was changed to Air India in 1962.The national carrier expanded its international routes and cargo operations in the following years.Govt allows private airlinesThe central government allowed private airlines in 1994, which put additional strain on Air India. It began posting losses and in 2017, Indian Airlines and Air India were merged.The government aggressively began exploring ways to privatise the airline in 2017 and finally found success in October 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tracing-air-india-s-eight-decade-long-journey-101643245131992.html

27-01-2022||India||Bengal govt rolls out Netaji tableau in Kolkata; TMC, BJP trade charges||KOLKATA: The West Bengal government on Wednesday rolled out its tableau on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose at the Republic Day parade at Kolkata’s Red Road, days after it was rejected by the Centre for the parade at Raj Path in New Delhi. The rejection triggered a tussle between the state and the Centre with chief minister Mamata Banerjee accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government of not honouring Bose on his 125th birth anniversary. She also shot a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. After union defence minister Rajnath Singh replied to Banerjee, saying a tableau on Netaji and the Indian National Army wasmade by the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) for the event in Delhi, TMC leaders said the job of paying homage to Bengal’s biggest freedom fighter should not been entrusted with a department that builds roads and bridges. Even as Wednesday’s event at Red Road was attended by Banerjee, governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, assembly speaker Biman Banerjee, Kolkata mayor Firhad Hakim, senior bureaucrats, more than a dozen foreign diplomats and senior officers of the armed forces, the leader of the opposition in the assembly, Suvendu Adhikari, alleged that he was not invited. “This is the first time the leader of the opposition was not invited to the state’s official Republic Day programme. This was done because Banerjee cannot forget that I defeated her at Nandigram in the assembly polls last year, forcing her to get re-elected from Kolkata. Man has invented the cure for cancer but there is no cure for jealously,” Adhikari said. He celebrated the day at his constituency in East Midnapore district. TMC leaders countered Adhikari. “Adhikari never attends any official programme. He was absent from the Independence Day event last year,” said the Kolkata mayor while Trinamool Congress (TMC) state general secretary Kunal Gosh said Adhikari had gone mad. “If Adhikari was so keen on witnessing the parade he could have gone to Red Road on his own. Nobody would have stopped him,” Ghosh added. The BJP also took potshots at the chief minister who maintained her distance from Dhankhar during the event. The two were seen talking for around 30 seconds after the governor approached the chief minister. “Protocol says the chief minister should greet the governor when he arrives. Banerjee violated it,” said Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar. TMC leaders did not react to the allegation although many in the ruling party said Banerjee’s behaviour was a fallout of the governor’s non-stop attacks on the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-govt-rolls-out-netaji-tableau-in-kolkata-tmc-bjp-trade-charges-101643236489007.html
27-01-2022||India||Visually-challenged man’s papers for sarpanch rejected because he signed in Braille||A 40-year-old visually-challenged tribal man in Nuapara district of Odisha has moved the Orissa high court protesting against the rejection of his nomination papers for the post of sarpanch on the ground that he had used Braille script to sign the papers, instead of Odia language.Shantilal Sabar, a resident of Dabripada village under Gandamer grampanchayat of Komna block in Nuapada district filed his nomination papers for the post of sarpanch in the forthcoming panchayat polls scheduled to be held next month. However, during the scrutiny of papers, the block development officer (BDO) rejected his nomination stating he was unable to read and write Odia language, as required under the Orissa Grama Panchayat Act to contest the polls.A livid Sabar said while he could pass the matric examination conducted by the Odisha Board of Secondary Education using Braille script, it was inexplicable why the returning officer for the panchayat polls was rejecting his papers.“Braille is an internationally accepted language for visually impaired persons. In the examinations, we are given helper writers during examinations. But we can read and write Odia using Braille script. By rejecting my nomination, the government will discourage visually-challenged candidates from participating in panchayat polls,” he said.In Nuapara district, 732 persons filed nomination for the post of sarpanch of which papers of 28 candidates including Sabar were rejected on several grounds.Election to the three-tier panchayatiraj bodies in Odisha are scheduled to be held between February 16 and 24 for 853 zilla parishad seats, 91,916 wards and 6,794 gram panchayats.Nuapara sub-collector Taranisen Naik said the rejection of Sabar’s papers should not be seen merely on the grounds of inability to read and write in Odia, but in totality.“A sarpanch is expected to deal with people’s grievances over several allowances including old age allowance, PDS rice and many other government schemes. The letters of people would not be in Braille script. So how would a visually-challenged person function,” he asked.Odisha Bikalanga Mahasangha, an association that espouses the cause of visually-challenged persons, said the rejection will send a wrong message to the visually-challenged persons.“If visually-challenged persons can work as state administrative service officers, lecturers and school teachers in our state, what stops them from becoming sarpanch or holding political posts. The government can surely amend the Odisha Grampanchayat Act to let the visually-challenged candidates participate in the polls,” said Niranjan Behera, president of the Mahasangh.Sabar, who is a keen player of chess and sells products like phenyl, candle and chalk through a self-help group, said he expects the high court to take up his case quickly and allow him to participate in the panchayat polls.While Sabar’s nomination papers were rejected, many other physically-challenged persons are in the fray in the panchayat polls. Parameshwar Mallick, who was born without arms, has filed nomination for the post of Ward member from Ward No-4 of Mangalpur Grampanchayat under Tihidi block in Bhadrak district. Mallick has promised to take up issues like all-weather road, tubewell, pucca houses and old age allowance for people of his area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/visuallychallenged-man-s-papers-for-sarpanch-rejected-because-he-signed-in-braille-101643235469175.html

JD (U) Lok Sabha MP Ramprit Mandal was also present. Sharing the reason for joining the JD(U), Joykishan said, “We need a national party which can give a new light and hope (for the people in the state).

JD(U) National President Rajiv Ranjan alias Lalan Singh will be arriving here tomorrow. The elections to the 60 assembly constituencies of Manipur will be held on February 27 and March 3.

On January 18, Manipur Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) suspended senior MLA Joykishan from the party “on the recommendation of the Disciplinary Action Committee, MPCC.” Fifty-six-year-old Joykishan was elected for the first time from Thangmeiband assembly constituency on an All India Trinamool Congress ticket in 2012 elections. A science graduate, Joykishan joined the BJP in May 2015 and helped the party reopen its account in the state assembly in the mid-term polls in November 2015. Later he resigned from the BJP in December 2016 and re-elected as a Congress MLA in 2017 elections.

27-01-2022||India||After PM Modi dons Uttarakhandi cap, Mussoorie artist starts getting queries||MUSSOORIE: Ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modi wore an Uttarakhand cap during the Republic Day Parade on Wednesday, the artist in Mussoorie who is the brain behind the creation of the Brahmkamal ‘topi’ has been surprised by the number of queries he is receiving from different parts of the country for his product. Sameer Shukla, who runs Soham Himalayan Art and Heritage Centre, a museum dedicated to Uttarakhand’s traditional art forms in Mussoorie, is surprised to receive queries for the Uttarakhand ‘topi’ as soon as it was seen being worn by PM Modi during the Republic Day parade. “Many people from different parts of the country are calling and enquiring about the cap”, he said. When asked how the cap reached PM Narendra Modi, Sameer Shukla said: “I can say only this much that as per the interest shown by the person concerned last week, the cap was delivered directly that was worn by the PM during the republic day parade.” “It is 100 per cent made in Mussoorie product in which around six to seven traditional tailors were involved in 2017 when the cap was launched on the Republic Day function in Mussoorie”, he added. “It is indeed a day of pride for us that our traditional product in form of Uttarakhandi cap was worn by PM Modi,” said Kavita Shukla, wife of Sameer who assisted him in its designing. Sameer Shukla said there are different styles of caps prevalent in Uttarakhand but “we thought to make it trendy and attractive so that youngsters of the state are attracted to it by incorporating Brahmkamal, the state flower which is offered to Lord Shiva in Kedarnath, and the four coloured stripes depicting the natural elements of nature”. Jagtam Das, 75-year-old tailor belonging to the Dalit community who was assigned the task to stitch these caps in 2017, said, “For me, it was a dream come true when I saw my stitched cap being worn by the Prime Minister himself. We have been able to sell more than 8000 caps so far and the demand has risen suddenly now”, added Jagtam Das Sameer Shukla said the objective of designing and marketing this Uttarakhandi cap was to stop the traditional art form of stitching these caps from becoming extinct and to motivate the younger generation of the craftsperson and tailors to earn a dignified livelihood from it. Sharing the pictures of late General Bipin Rawat and NSA chief Ajit Doval, Shukla said that the first CDS General Bipin Rawat was the first celebrity of that stature to adorn the Uttarakhandi cap when it was gifted to him last year. NSA Ajit Doval followed him subsequently, he added. “Wearing Uttarakhandi cap was the best tribute that can be paid to the late CDS General Bipin Rawat, the son of the soil said”, Kavita Shukla. The local resident from Mussoorie Ramprakash Panwar said, “It is indeed a day of pride that locally made traditional Uttarakhandi cap has been adorned by our Prime Minister Narendra Modi as it will motivate other traditional artisans to continue with their tradition.” We are happy that our effort of several years has finally been acknowledged in the state, said Sameer Shukla. Uttarakhand Chief minister Pushkar Dhami tweeted, “Today on the occasion of 73rd Republic Day, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji has made the culture and tradition of our state proud by wearing the Brahma Kamal cap of Devbhoomi Uttarakhand”. Ganesh Joshi, MLA Mussoorie, tweeted, “The cap worn by PM Modi ji today has been designed by Sameer from our Mussoorie. The efforts made by Sameer ji for the local artisans are commendable. Today Modi ji has given this message that ‘Vocal For Local’ is not just a slogan for him but his resolve”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-pm-modi-dons-uttarakhandi-cap-mussoorie-artists-start-getting-queries-101643226528413.html

PLA responded positively indicating handing over of our national and suggested a place of release.”“They are likely to intimate date and time soon. Delay attributed to bad weather conditions on their side,” he added.The Indian Army had earlier sought assistance from PLA after Miram Taron, a 17-year-old native of Zido village in Upper Siang district of Arunachal Pradesh, went missing from near the LAC on January 18. The teen, officials believe, was allegedly abducted by PLA when he and a few others went hunting in the area.India and China have been locked in a standoff since mid-2020 along the LAC in Ladakh. There have also been reports of Chinese activity near the LAC in Arunachal Pradesh, including efforts by Beijing to develop villages in the area.On Sunday, PLA informed India that an “Indian boy” was found on their side but was unable to confirm his identity. However, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP from Arunachal East, Tapir Gao, who had earlier tweeted about the alleged abduction, claimed the teen found by the PLA was Taron.On Tuesday, Rijiju announced that India had shared details of the missing teenager with PLA to confirm the identity of the youth in their custody.In September 2020, five young men from the Tagin tribe, who worked as porters for the Indian Army, went missing from Upper Subansiri district on the Indian side of the McMahon line, bifurcating Arunachal Pradesh and Tibet autonomous region (TAR) of China.Following their disappearance, the brother of one of the men claimed on social media that they had been abducted by PLA. The same accusation was made by Gao and Congress MLA Ninong Ering from Pasighat.It was later revealed that the men had strayed across the border during a hunting expedition. They were handed back to India after 10 days.
27-01-2022||India||Padma Shri Muthukannamal, 82 wants to continue teaching Sathir||R Muthukannamal, 82, is ecstatic that she has won the Padma Shri in the arts category for Sathir, an ancient dance form which is a predecessor of the more popular Bharathanatyam, in which she performed her “arangetram” (on stage debut) when she was only 7 years old.“I’m so happy. It’s priceless that I don’t even feel hungry,” says Muthukannamal speaking over the phone from her native in Viralimalai in Tamil Nadu’s Trichy district. Her family says she’s tired from receiving an influx of guests and media interviews since morning but she doesn’t let that show.Still filled with enthusiasm and passion for her art, Muthukannamal says she hopes she can perform at Pollachi in a temple if an annual festival happens this February or March which has been cancelled over the past two-years due to Covid-19. “I will be there for ten days if it happens. I couldn’t dance in the past two years because temples couldn’t conduct festivals,” she says.Muthukannamal is a seventh generation dancer having performed across Tamil Nadu and Kerala. She was taught by her father. “We are a Sathir family so it was only natural that I also learnt from a young age,” she says.The art form involves these artistes to sing and dance at the same time. It was used to entertain Gods during festivals and the performing women artistes are called Devadasis who are employees of temple establishment. It is believed that Muthukannamal is the last surviving dancer of the 32 devadasis who once performed for the deity at Viralimalai’s Murugan temple in Trichy. In 2018, she was a recipient of the Dakshina Chitra Virudhu, an annual award given by The Madras Craft Foundation and The Friends of Dakshina Chitra.Muthukannamal has three children who didn’t take to the art form but it skipped a generation and she now teaches Sathir to her two granddaughters. “I will continue to teach to whoever is interested,” she says, hoping to keep the traditional art form alive.
27-01-2022||India||Tamil Nadu: Christian group denies charge of religious conversion||The Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary Congregation that runs the 160-year-old school in Thanjavur – where a 17-year-old-girl died allegedly by suicide – in a statement on Wednesday denied the charge of religious conversion linked to the girl’s death.The superior general of the congregation said they run their institutions based on the principles of the Indian Constitution and provide secular education for all.The superior general said the child had been studying in this school since when she in class 8. “She wanted to stay with us, even on vacation, without going home. Thus she grew up to be the child of all of us. That’s why she got 489/500 marks in 10th class,” the statement stated.The institution defended it by saying that it has been involved in academic work for the past 180 years. The school in this case was started 160 years ago and the hostel has been functioning for 90 years.“The contribution of the church is paramount in women’s education and women’s emancipation on Tamil soil,” it stated, adding that they have always taken in students from poor and backward communities. “The children, who study with us, belong to many religions and communities… In that context, we provide secular education for all. We do not interfere in anyone’s religious beliefs.”The institution also said it was cooperating with police and the education department since the girl has blamed its hostel warden, 74-year-old Sahaya Mary, for harassing her to death.BJP, AIADMK differ The case has also led to differences between allies as the AIADMK has kept mum while the BJP is leading the charge that the girl was forced to die by suicide because she was tortured as she had not agreed to convert to Christianity.A day ago during the BJP’s protest in Chennai, former AIADMK leader and now a BJP MLA Nainar Nagendran said the AIADMK lacked spine and manliness in the state assembly. “It is the BJP which is behaving like the opposition, not the AIADMK,” he said. After it led to a row with the leading ally, Nagendran backtracked saying his comments were misunderstood.AIADMK members reacted by challenging Nagendran to contest alone without their support to see if he wins. Tamil Nadu BJP president K Annamalai sought to diffuse the situation. Annamalai said he reached out to AIADMK’s coordinator O Panneerselvam and joint coordinator Edappadi Palaniswami on Wednesday.“I couldn’t catch OPS on the phone but I spoke to EPS. I conveyed my remorse to him. What was spoken came out wrong. It is not the stance of the BJP and even Nagendran. The AIADMK is functioning very well as the opposition.”

She joined the IAF’s fighter stream in 2017 and flew the MiG-21 Bison aircraft before being posted to a Rafale squadron based in Ambala.She hails from Varanasi.Only a handful of women --- less than 20 --- have been commissioned as fighter pilots so far after the government launched a scheme for their induction into the IAF’s combat stream in 2015, a watershed in the air force’s history.Shivangi was in her teens when her grandfather drove her to an air force museum for the first time, the fateful trip marking the beginning of an unending romance with aviation for the young and impressionable girl.Apart from Rafales, IAF’s women pilots are operating the MiG-21 Bison, Sukhoi-30 and MiG-29 fighters.There are more than 9,000 women currently serving the army, navy and air force, with the services giving them more opportunities to boost career progression. The headcount of women in the military has increased almost threefold over the last seven years.While women have now been allowed to serve on warships; tanks and combat positions in the infantry are still no-go zones. They were allowed to join the armed forces outside the medical stream for the first time in 1992.In December, the Indian Navy said it was going ahead with a plan to give women officers more opportunities to serve aboard warships alongside their male counterparts, with several women already assigned to frontline ships operating in the broad expanse of the Indian Ocean Region.Also, the National Defence Academy is set to induct its first batch of women cadets in June 2022. The Supreme Court opened the doors of the academy to women in a landmark order in October 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-first-woman-rafale-pilot-part-of-iaf-s-tableau-101643225088175.html

The award was conferred posthumously. The poet had died in June last year after he contracted Covid- 19. He was 67.

His poem, Yarige Banthu, ellige bantu, nalvathayelara swatantrya (who got, where did it come, (19)47’s Independence), propelled him as one of the leading voices of the movement, converting the song into an anthem which is used even now in protests and other rallies of backward communities. The poet was one of the most prominent voices for social justice and was one of the co-founders of the Dalit Sangharsha Samithi. “Posthumous Padma Shri honour for people’s poet S Siddalingaiah in the field of literature and education,” Basavaraj Bommai, the chief minister of Karnataka said in a post on Twitter. “The Padma Shri award has been awarded posthumously to noted literature personality, Dalit poet for his outstanding service. It is a matter of pride for the entire state that he was conferred this award for all his achievements,” BS Yediyurappa, senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader said.

A resident of Tirurangadi in Malappuram district, Rabiya was confined to a wheel chair since she was 14 due to polio. But, she never allowed the disability to come in her way of spreading literacy among the needy. “The country has recognised my work and honoured me. This is the biggest recognition. I am really humbled,” said Rabiya. “I could not believe,” she said when she got a call from New Delhi the other day saying that she was being awarded the Padma Shri.She had started a small literacy campaign in 1990. Later, the state government had launched the state literacy mission and made her the mascot of the project. She also founded an organisation called Chalanam which runs six schools for differently-abled and intellectually disabled children in the district. Besides this, she started 60 neighbourhood self-help groups for women and trained them to make pickles, carry bags and other products.“Getting knowledge is foremost and imparting this to others is equally important. I feel education serves its purpose only if you impart the same to others and empower them,” she said. Besides polio, she was afflicted with cancer at the age of 32 and later her backbone was affected after she survived a fall. Her heroic fight against odds found its way to school text books in the state. She has also authored many books, including her autobiography “Swapnangalkku Chirakukalundu” (Dreams have wings). A born fighter, she kindled light of knowledge in many.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keralas-literacy-hero-gets-padma-shri-says-nation-has-taken-note-of-her-work-101643224908027.html

27-01-2022||India||Left Front in tizzy over Lokayukta ordinance||As controversy over the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government’s move to promulgate an ordinance to clip wings of the anti-corruption body Lokayukta raged, differences have started appearing in the ruling alliance.The Communist Party of India (CPI), a partner in the ruling LDF, secretary Kanam Rajendran said the issue was not discussed at the alliance meeting and the government should have brought it in the state assembly to avoid such a controversy.“Normally, there is no need to discuss administrative matters in the LDF meet. But since this is major shift in policies upheld by the LDF, it has to be discussed in detail. It should have been brought before the assembly,” he said in the state capital. There are reports that many CPI(M) leaders and some other alliance partners are also upset with the decision to enact an ordinance.The opposition Congress-led United Democratic Front said it will meet Governor Arif Mohammad Khan on Thursday with a request not to sign the ordinance.People close to the Governor’s office said he will seek legal experts’ opinion on the ordinance passed by the cabinet and submitted to him for his assent on last Saturday. As per the main amendment, even if Lokayukta found a person guilty and barred him from holding the government position a “competent authority” can ignore the verdict after conducting a hearing within three months of the verdict and it can either reject or accept the verdict of the Lokayukta.Interestingly, the government’s move surfaced at a time when left parties were demanding that all high offices including the prime minister should come under the ambit of Lokpal. Once the ordinance is passed it is not binding on the government to go by the verdict of the anti-corruption body, last word on the verdict will rest with a “competent authority,” the chief minister or the cabinet, says the ordinance.The amendment now arms the “competent authority” to either to accept or reject the verdict of the Lokayukta after conducting a final hearing. The “competent authority” can go through the verdict in detail and can take a decision within three months of the verdict, it says. The decision was taken at the last cabinet on Jan 19 and sent it to the Governor’s approval two days back discreetly. The government rushed with the ordinance when the assembly is set to meet in two weeks.Amid the controversy CPI(M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan strongly defended the move. “Kerala Lokayukta norms are stringent and usually there is no appeal for its verdict. In a state, elected government is supreme but some of the verdicts of Lokayukta are posing a threat to very existence of the government,” he said, adding the decision to promulgate ordinance was taken last year.But opposition leader VD Satheesan said the Lokayukta Act was there for last 25 years and the government got panicked after four cases against the government came up before the anti-corruption body. “These cases forced the government to curtail powers of the body. We will not allow this to happen. The CPI(M) central leadership owe an explanation whether they agree with the ordinance or not,” he said.Minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan also criticised the move. “It seems the government is scared of the anti-corruption body and set to weaken it fearing some adverse verdicts from it,” he said in New Delhi.Lokayukta is probing three complaints against the CM for allegedly abusing his position to grant financial help to three “ineligible persons” from his disaster relief fund. Complaints say he misused funds meant for disaster relief and distributed lakhs of rupees to former party MLA KK Ramachandran’s family to clear his debts, help to the family of former NCP leader Uzhavoor Vijayan and relief to the family of a gunman who died on escort duty of CPI(M) state secretary Balakrishnan.Similarly, higher education minister R Bindhu is also feeling the heat of the Lokayukta. Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala had moved the body last month citing two letters she wrote to the Governor recommending the re-appointment of Kannur vice- chancellor Gopinath Raveendran. Chennithala said the minister has no right to send such letters to the Governor and it was a clear case of nepotism and misuse of power.Last year, higher education minister K T Jaleel was forced to resign after the Lokayukta found him guilty of nepotism. Jaleel was found to have lobbied for a relative to be appointed as the general manager of state minority welfare corporation. He allegedly diluted some of the qualifications required for the post. Jaleel moved the high court but it refused to entertain his plea against Lokayukta’s ruling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/left-front-in-tizzy-over-lokayukta-ordinance-101643224789440.html

As many as 26.73 lakh labourers have been registered by the Karnataka Building and Other Constructions Workers Welfare Board. The Board has distributed ₹628.16 crore among 14,527 organised workers and their dependents,” he said. “Under 15 state-government schemes, 10.10 lakh beneficiaries have been paid (a) subsidiary amount of ₹1,136.05. A sum of ₹8,390 crore has been collected as customs. As many as 11.82 lakh labourers have been paid ₹2,000/per person amounting to ₹236.46 crore during the second lockdown,” he said.Incidently, the governor’s statements come at a time when labour activists in Karnataka carried out a candle-light vigil in support of the 57th day of the struggle by workers of ITI, a public sector enterprise.“On Republic Day, we stand in vigil with those who build the republic. We demand that the Management of @ITILTDINDIA stop violating the constitutional rights of workers (sic),” read a Twitter post by the All India Central Council of Trade Unions (AICCTU) on Wednesday.Cautioning about the third wave of Covid-19, Gehlot also called on the citizens to handle the situation with “total seriousness” and said there should be no room for negligence.This is Gehlot’s first Republic Day as the governor of Karnataka.Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai, few of his cabinet colleagues and top government officials were among the select invitees, who attended the low-key event held at the Manekshaw Parade Ground here, by following the Covid protocols.The governor said different fields like management of Covid war room, telemedicine, identifying the infected and quarantine observation were managed efficiently with advanced technology and this has resulted in less number of deaths in Karnataka when compared to other parts of the world.The governor also said that fresh tenders have been called to upgrade the water distillation units in Koramangala and Challaghatta valley to stop pollution in Bellandur and Varthur lakes.The two lakes, which were once a lifeline for Bengaluru’s irrigation and drinking water needs, have gained global notoriety for foaming and toxic content. Over the years, thousands of crores have been spent on reviving these lakes which continue to remain in a pitiable state.Gehlot also said that several roads in Bengaluru have been taken up under the Smart City Project.“Under the Bengaluru Smart City Project, 77 roads covering 158.27 kms have been selected for white topping. Out of these 83.91 km of road is completed and 31 main roads have been developed and made available for public transportation,” he said. “To provide pedestrian friendly experience, 12 roads covering 17 km in the first phase and 35 roads covering 16 km in the second phase have been taken up and 10 roads covering 12.37 km in the first phase and 29 roads covering 10.27 km have been completed,” the governor said.He also highlighted the government’s focus on watershed development, mobile and technology based crop survey, among others.With Agency inputs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/guv-lauds-state-on-labour-practices-covid-19-control-in-maiden-speech-101643224788088.html

27-01-2022||India||Governor’s language remarks sparks row with Tamil Nadu government||Tamil Nadu governor R N Ravi’s speech on the eve of Republic day wherein he urged students to learn new languages, and his stand on the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) has come under criticism from the government. Reacting to the speech, Tamil Nadu school education minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi on Wednesday told reporters that the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) has maintained a two-language policy (Tamil and English) since the time of C N Annadurai (DMK’s first CM in 1967). He further said that they have opposed the three-language policy of the National Education Policy (NEP), 2020. “We will never backtrack from our two-language policy,” said Poyyamozhi. “We have opposed four main points in NEP and this is one of them. Our stance will not change. He (governor) has said his opinion.”The previous regime led by the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), an NDA ally, had also opposed the three-language formula. After the DMK government took over in May last year, the state said that it would come out with its own state education policy and has opposed the NEP on a few fronts. Amidst these developments, this is the first time that the governor has expressed his thoughts on the contentious language issue, which has been causing friction with the central government.On Tuesday, the governor praised Tamil as the oldest language in the world while stressing that students here should also learn other languages. “While it is important that the Tamil language is given a wider spread in the rest of the country, it is also important that our school students learn other Indian languages like students in other states,” the governor said.“Depriving our students of knowledge of other Indian languages is unfair to all. Besides fostering brotherliness and better mutual appreciation, a linguistic intellectual and cultural cross-pollination will enrich all of us and also open several opportunities for our harmonious growth,” former Nagaland governor Ravi said.The governor’s statement came on the day when chief minister M K Stalin said that he was only against the imposition of Hindi while addressing a virtual conference on the sacrifices of the language martyrs during the anti-Hindi agitations in Tamil Nadu. “We are not opposing Hindi. We are opposing Hindi dominance and imposition, not the language. We are lovers of Tamil, but not haters of any language,” Stalin had said. In his 7-page statement, the governor said that “improving the quality of education in our government schools is the crying need of the time”, pointing out that the learning outcomes different from private schools are worrisome. Minister Poyyamozhi responded that Stalin and the education department were pulling all stops to improve government schools. “We cannot change a system overnight. It will take time. We will make a lot of changes step by step,” Poyyamozhi said. Ravi also spoke on the NEET, saying that before its introduction, the share of students from government schools to government medical colleges was hardly 1%.The previous AIADMK sought an exemption from NEET for the state but that bill was rejected by the president. In August 2020, the then AIADMK regime passed a 7.5% reservation for government school students in medical colleges.“Thanks to the affirmative action of 7.5% reservation for government school students that number has improved significantly. However, there is an urgent need to improve the quality of education also in the Government schools,” the governor said.The governor’s statement comes when the DMK government has passed similar legislation in the assembly in September last year seeking exemption from NEET and Ravi is already under severe criticism for not forwarding this bill to the President for four months.“As admitted by the Governor, it was only 7.5 % inner reservation that paved the way for the entry of government School students and not NEET. The inner reservation was not in pre NEET days, and the comparison is not just and fair,” said Prince Gajendra Babu, general secretary, state platform for the common school system. “The governor is using the Republic Day message to justify his silence on the Medical Course Admission Bill pending with him for more than four months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/governors-language-remarks-sparks-row-with-tamil-nadu-government-101643224548047.html

27-01-2022||India||Hijab row: Karnataka govt sets up expert committee||Karnataka government on Wednesday set up an expert committee to resolve the controversy at the government pre-university college in Udupi district. The decision comes after a controversy erupted over six students being denied entry to the classroom for wearing hijab, since the last week of December, 2021. The government order informing the setting up of the committee stated that all the students at the college should adhere to the uniform rule till the committee decides on the issue and maintain “status quo” till the issue is discussed and resolved by the expert committee. The order was issued by SR Umashankar, principal secretary of the primary and education department to Rudra Gowda principal of the Women’s Government Pre-University College on Tuesday. “…students in Udupi are asking to wear a dress of their choice despite knowing and accepting the college’s dress code. The issue that was not there till now has been created and it is not from an educational perspective,” read the order. The committee will study the dress code and uniform norms being followed in various states and the orders passed by several courts before submitting its report to the state government, as per the order. The order, however, doesn’t mention a timeline for the submission of the report and what the status quo would be since there is no uniform code issued by the government for students at pre-university colleges. The government’s order comes a day before the college is set to reopen on Thursday. The college was shut for six days after six students tested positive for the Covid-19. The committee has been set up after Udupi MLA Raghupati Bhat and the chairman of the college development committee had written to the state government regarding the issue and demanded its intervention in the matter. Bhat said that everyone should obey the government’s order and attend the classes. “The high-powered committee constituted by the government will study the existing norms regarding multiple orders passed by the courts in the past about dress code and uniform,” he said. “The committee will study the dress code and uniform norms being followed in different states before submitting its report to government. Till that report is received by the state government from the committee, status quo will have to be followed at the Women’s Government PU College, Udupi and hijab will not be allowed,’’ he added. On Tuesday, Karnataka minister for home affairs Araga Jananendra and education minister BC Nagesh had hinted at bringing a uniform code for government colleges in the state. “If students start behaving like religion is more important, then what sort of future are we building? There must be a universal feeling in our schools and colleges that we all are Indians. So, they should all follow the uniform code set by colleges,” the home minister had said. Education minister BC Nagesh too hinted at possible changes in the uniform code in the state. “We will look into the decisions of other states in such matters (allowing hijab) and court verdicts, following which we will take further steps. Till then, all colleges /schools will continue with the current norms they have set, including the one in Udupi,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hijab-row-karnataka-govt-sets-up-expert-committee-101643224367207.html

Construction work of the school would be completed this year. Discussions are on with the defence ministry to adopt the school. The defence ministry is almost likely to convert it into a military school. Hostel and all the required facilities are coming up on around 100-acre land,” Bommai added.“State government is committed to keep alive Rayanna’s ideals of patriotism, integrity and valour in the present society,” Bommai said, reiterating how the BJP was trying to revive and preserve the warrior’s legacy.“Orders would be issued today itself to have Rayanna’s portrait displayed in all schools and colleges,” Bommai said. The chief minister said that necessary programmes would be formulated to spread Rayanna’s principles and ideals. BJP MP from Bengaluru central, PC Mohan on Wednesday submitted a proposal to name--or rename--some of the roads in the city after freedom fighters on which Bommai has said that a suitable decision would be taken shortly.The BJP is also proposing to install a statue of Rayanna in New Delhi.“There is a statue of Kittur Rani Chennamma in New Delhi. Rayanna should be present where Chennamma is. A letter has been written to the concerned authorities to install Rayanna’s statue at a suitable spot in New Delhi,” he said.The chief minister has already announced the installation of the statues of Rayanna and Chenamma at the Suvarna Vidhana Soudha in Belagavi district.Rayanna was the military commander of Rani Chennamma of Kittur and is believed to be one of the first rebellious leaders in the country to wage war against the British in 1824.Rayanna is an icon of the politically influential Kuruba community.The announcements by BJP are seen as a possible move to bag votes from the Kuruba community. Former chief minister and incumbent leader of the Opposition, Siddaramaiah as well as senior BJP leader and Cabinet minister, KS Eshwarappa among others belong to the Kuruba community. Both national parties have tried to earn favour from the community, which holds key votes that could swing elections in several of the state’s assembly constituencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-bommai-military-school-to-be-named-after-19th-century-commander-101643224187890.html

To be sure, Azad was included as a star campaigner for Uttar Pradesh elections in a list released by the party this week Azad led the G-23, the group of 23 senior Congress leaders ,who, in August 2020, wrote a letter to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi seeking an overhaul in the party.Another G 23 member and former Union minister, Anand Sharma, tweeted, “Heartiest congratulations to Ghulam Nabi ji for well-deserved recognition of his lifelong enriching contribution to public service and Parliamentary democracy.’’ And so did Shashi Tharoor, another G-23 leader: “Warm congratulations to Shri @ghulamnazad on his Padma Bhushan. It is good to be recognized for one’s public service even by a government of the other side,” Tharoor tweeted.Manish Tewari, also part of G-23 tweeted, “I congratulate @ghulamnazad on being conferred the Padma Bhushan for his public Service. It is a well-deserved recognition.”The rally of support came after Rajya Sabha MP Ramesh’s harsh words soon after the awards were announced. Referring to former Bengal CM Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee’s refusal to accept the Padma Bhushan, he tweeted, ‘’ Right thing to do. He wants to be Azad (free) not Ghulam (a slave).’’Also Read | ‘Be Azad, not Ghulam': Jairam Ramesh lauds Buddhadeb move to decline Padma awardThe party remained silent and didn’t comment on this exchange. However, the episode was criticised by the old guard of the party, even those who aren’t a part of the G23. Former Union Minister Ashwani Kumar said, “Congress Rajya Sabha Whip’s criticism of Ghulam Nabi Azad for receiving the Padma award is nothing less than a shameful innuendo intended to rob both the award and its recipient of the deserved dignity . Such a mindset does not to justice to the dignitarian ethos of the Congress.’’The award and the aftermath resulted in speculation about Azad leaving the Congress party, and perhaps forming a regional outfit in J&K , with support from the Bharatiya Janata Party. He issued a clarification that he had not changed his bio on twitter: “Some mischievous propaganda being circulated by some people to create confusion. Nothing has been removed or added to my Twitter profile. The profile is as it was earlier.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rumblings-in-congress-after-padma-honour-for-azad-101643224128028.html

27-01-2022||India||PM Modi writes to global academics, cricketers with ‘Indian connect’||New Delhi: A select group of people, including academicians and cricketers of international repute, received a letter from Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the occasion of India’s 73rd Republic Day on Wednesday.According to a person aware of the details, the letters are in line with the ongoing programme to celebrate 75 years of India’s Independence. The government of India has launched the ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’ to mark India’s freedom struggle.The letters from PM Modi acknowledge the achievements and contribution of the receivers to their respective areas of expertise and acknowledges their connection to India.“…26 January this year is even more special because it is happening at a time when India mark 75 years since freedom from colonial rule. Thus, I decided to write to you and a few other friends of India with a sense of gratitude for your affection towards India and hope that you continue to work closely with our nation as well as our people,” the letter says.Among the recipients of the letter are Amrita Narlikar, professor and president of the German Institute for Global and Area Studies. In the letter to Narlikar the PM wrote, “ Academics, researchers and teachers play a crucial role in pushing the boundaries of knowledge by constantly venturing into new frontiers as well as sharing it with society. The world’s future is being written by people like you who enhance its intellectual capital and ensure upcoming generations benefit from it.”In the letter to author and academic Vivek Wadhwa, the PM said India is witnessing a series of historic socio-economic transformations, which he is confident will empower lives and contribute to the global good.“I appreciate your deep understanding of the tech sector, its utility and possible dangers. The digital infrastructure that India is building, is aimed at bringing the fruits of technology to every citizen, while at the same time providing the necessary and requisite protection of privacy and data. I am confident that your expertise in policy prescriptions will help India to work better in this regard,” the letter further said.Writing to Anuradha Doddaballarpur, captain of Germany’s women’s cricket team and a cardiovascular scientist, the PM said, “… The remarkable dexterity with which you handle two starkly diverse worlds of being a cardiovascular scientist and a cricketer is indeed commendable. Taking a double hat-trick and becoming the first female international cricketer to do so in the T20 match against Austria was indeed a remarkable feat... You also share a special bond with India.”Gad Saad, professor and evolutionary behavioural scientist, also received a letter from the Prime Minister. Tweeting about the letter Saad wrote, “ I just received an official letter from a very high representative of the prime minister of one of the leading democracies in the world. I am not at liberty to share any additional information but it is truly incredible.”Tel Aviv-based novelist Ashley Rindsberg also received a letter. “Public intellectuals, policy analysts and researchers play an important role in democracy by understanding complex policy dynamics and communicating it to the people. In helping design policy as well as intersecting policy outcomes, they bring people and policymakers closer,” the PM said in his letter.Cricketers Jonty Rhodes and Chris Gayle also received the letter acknowledging their connection with India. In his letter to Rhodes, the Prime Minister said,”Over the years, you have developed a profound connection with India and its culture. This special bond was truly reflected when you name your daughter after this great nation. You are truly a special ambassador of the strong relations between a nations.”Gayle also tweeted about the letter but did not disclose the contents. He tweeted about the letter “reaffirming” his “close personal ties with him (PM) and to the people of India.”Trinidadian actor and singer Machel Montano also tweeted his thanks to the PM for the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-writes-to-global-academics-cricketers-with-indian-connect-101643223828694.html
27-01-2022||India||Karnataka health dept flags concern over surge in self-testing kits||A surge in demand for at-home antigen testing kits is becoming a cause of concern for the authorities, as several Covid-19 cases are untraced due to lack of reporting, Karnataka health officials said on Wednesday. Senior officials of the health department said that the issue has been flagged to concerned authorities. Compared to the RT-PCR test, which costs between ₹600-1000 in the market, at-home antigen testing kits cost between ₹200-300 apiece. A recent state government guideline asked people not to visit hospitals for testing (testing is free at government hospitals) if they have mild or no symptoms. According to pharmacy owners, these factors make the home test kits popular. “We sell around 10 kits a day,” said Suresh Murthy, who runs a pharmacy in Bengaluru’s Frazer Town. “There are no instructions for us to take the details of the persons who are buying these tests or ask them to upload the details on the government portal if they test positive. We tell people to do it (upload results), but we are not sure how many uploads it,” he added. As per the protocol, each of these easy-to-use testing kits has a unique QR code to ensure traceability and genuineness. A user is instructed to log into the app of the respective brand after entering their mobile number. “Then they have to scan the unique QR code. After running the test, they have to take a photo of the test on the card through the app to confirm the result,” Murthy said. However, to know the results, there is no need to upload the data on the mobile application. A simple internet search shows what the results mean. As the test results are already available without uploading them on the app, users could keep away from doing so to avoid quarantine. Dr KV Trilok Chandra, health commissioner (BBMP) said that the government has made uploading the results easier for the people. When a person purchases the home test kit, they are expected to report the result on the CoviSelf application. “If it is positive, the results go directly into the ICMR portal, which connects to every state and district, and BU (Bengaluru Urban) numbers are assigned,” said Chandra. The official also added that as per the current guidelines only those with severe symptoms have to be admitted to a hospital, and those with mild symptoms can home isolate. He said that people should come forward and report the test results. He said if the patient shares the test results, the zonal team then calls the person, assesses their condition and categorises them as one who could stay in home isolation or move to a Covid Care Centre or hospital. He added that monitoring would help the person in case the situation gets worse while they are in home isolation. Meanwhile, waste collectors employed with various dry waste management centres of the civic body claim that the number of used Covid kits are increasing over time. Besides demanding better protective gear, these frontline workers in Bengaluru also appealed to residents to segregate waste at home and dispose of medical waste separately. “It (medical waste) should be wrapped in paper. People should now segregate three kinds of waste – wet waste, dry waste, and sanitary waste; and masks should be thrown in sanitary waste,” said Mansoor, supervisor of one of the waste management centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-health-dept-flags-concern-over-surge-in-self-testing-kits-101643223647850.html
27-01-2022||India||At 77, Kaajee Singh becomes first Gorkha-Nepali musician to receive Padma Shri||SILIGURI: Hours after the Centre announced on Saturday that he has been honoured with the Padma Shri award, 77-year-old percussionist Kaajee Singh said he could have earned more laurels and money had he not left the Mumbai film industry 39 years ago to return home and study Gorkha and Nepali music and Shree Maadal, a traditional drum. “I never worked for awards and laurels. I returned from Mumbai thinking that Shree Maadal should be preserved and made popular among people of the coming generations,” said Singh. Credited with popularising the traditional Maruni dance and the Shree Maadal, Singh lives in the Kalimpong hills of north Bengal. Based in Darjeeling, the family has been contributing to music for three generations. The father of two children invented the classical notations for Shree Maadal in 1974. He also published more than five books on the instrument and local folk music. Though maadals are commonly used in traditional Indian music, the Shree Maadal is a typical part of Nepali and Gorkha folk music. Born in 1945, Singh developed an interest in folk culture and music during his childhood under the influence of his parents. Singh started with the Maaruni dance form in 1952. As he grew up, he took to Maadaley Geet, a traditional song, and also started taking lessons in Shree Maadal from his father Indrajeet Singh Sardar who was one of the pioneering exponents. Singh went to Mumbai in 1974 and worked with legendary composer duos such as Laxmikant-Pyarelal, Kalyanji-Anandji and Shankar-Jaikishan and composer Ram Laxman for nine years. He returned to Kalimpong in 1983. “Though my father was doing very well in Mumbai, he never forgot his roots. He always thought of popularising our traditional music through books. This was the primary reason for his research,” said the veteran’s son Nishaant Singh who is a guest professor of Pakhawaj, another old percussion instrument, at the department of cultural affairs of the Ramakrishna Mission at Belur Math, Howrah. Kaajee Singh still works for more than eight hours a day, doing research or writing books. He also runs the Sanskriti Sangrakshan Sansthan in Kalimpong. 
27-01-2022||India||Controversy rages as two more return Padma awards||A day after former West Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee refused one of India’s highest civilian awards, legendary singer Sandhya Mukherjee and tabla exponent Anindya Chatterjee too refused the awards, although their refusal, unlike Bhattacharjee’s, which was prompted by a seeming disdain for state-awards, has more to do with the stature of the award.Also Read | Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee declines Padma Bhushan award after MHA announcementAmong the awards announced on January 25 was a Padma Shri , India’s fourth-highest civilian honour to 90-year-old Sandhya Mukherjee whose career spans over 70 years. The student of Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, Mukherjee has sung thousands of songs for Indian cinema and produced albums of modern, classical and semi-classical music. She received the national award in 1970 for play-back singing.Mukherjee’s relatives told the media that she expressed her refusal when an official called her on Tuesday afternoon, telling him that accepting the Padma Shri would be demeaning for her.She found support on Wednesday, but the matter has acquired distinctly political overtones.Also Read | Bhattacharjee is latest among those who’ve refused Padma honours. Here’s a list“This was intentionally done to insult her because she is a Bengali. A few people, who are not even fit to be Sandhya Mukherjee’s students, have been awarded the Padma Bhushan. I wish I could leave this country because the government has no respect for its people,” said singer and former Trinamool Congress (TMC) Parliament member Suman Chatterjee who won the national award a few years ago.“The Centre has proved that it is run by people who have no idea about those being honoured. The Centre would have felt honoured had it chosen the right award for Mukherjee,” added writer Abul Bashar.The same allegation was made by Anindya Chatterjee on Tuesday. He said he was awarded the Padma Shri by people who know nothing about him or his career.Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee refused to accept the Padma Bhushan (India’s third highest civilian honour) on Tuesday itself, saying in a statement: “I do not know anything about the Padma Bhushan award. Nobody said anything to me about this. If I have been given the award then I refuse it. ”Among the 17 people selected for the Padma Bhushan, 77-year-old Bhattacharjee and veteran actor Victor Banerjee were the only ones listed as Bengal residents. Another Padma Bhushan recipient, Hindustani classical singer Rashid Khan, was listed as a resident of Uttar Pradesh, where he was born, although he has been living in Kolkata since the age of 10. “This is an honour for Bengal,” Khan told the media.But he too commiserated with Mukherjee“The awardees should be selected judiciously. Sandhya Didi (elder sister) did the right thing. I felt bad for her” Khan told a television channel on Wednesday.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleged that the refusals were an expression of the anti-Centre stance of Bengal’s people.“People of Bengal always seem to believe that they are not a part of India. This was prevalent during the Left Front era and things have not changed during the TMC regime. What is the harm in accepting an award from the government? The TMC is doing politics over the Padma awards,” said BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh.Countering the BJP, the TMC alleged that politics influenced the selection process.“Why was Bhattacharjee awarded the Padma Bhushan in a year when former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh, whose tenure witnessed the demolition of the Babri Masjid, was honoured posthumously? This is a political strategy to keep the CPI(M) in good humour because the BJP has grown in Bengal with Left votes,” said TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh.The Congress and CPI(M) targeted the BJP as well.“I feel that Bhattacharjee did not want to be honoured by a government that has created divisions among people of this nation,” said Congress Rajya Sabha member and former state president Pradip Bhattacharya even as the CPI(M) maintained that its leaders never accept such awards.“By refusing the awards, Sandhya Mukherjee and Anindya Chatterjee have brought more honour upon themselves. The Centre’s decision proves that the awardees are chosen at random, not through an evaluation of their life and work,” said CPI(M) Rajya Sabha member and former Kolkata mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/controversy-rages-as-two-more-return-padma-awards-101643223590418.html
27-01-2022||India||CM Bommai assures to protect rights of minorities||A day after eminent personalities of the state wrote a letter to Karnataka chief minister concerning attacks on minorities, Basavaraj Bommai on Wednesday said that the rights of minorities and other vulnerable sections of society are protected in the state.“As far as Karnataka is concerned, all the rights of minorities and others which are enshrined in the Constitution are protected to the hilt. If there is any excess, immediate action has been taken,” Bommai said.At least 34 eminent personalities, including historians, academics, poets and activists, shot off a letter to the chief minister, expressing grave concerns over the rising number of cases relating to moral policing, religious intolerance and attacks on minorities in the state.While one letter condemned the actions to target minority groups, another letter sought support against the persecution of Christians, who are being targeted for alleged forcible religious conversions.“We will protect minority rights and also other vulnerable sections in the society,” Bommai added. Bommai further said that the minority groups will not just be protected, but also supported with state-sponsored programmes to empower them to become active participants in nation-building.“I believe in three ‘Es’ which is education, employment and empowerment of these sections. We are committed to that,” he said.The letter stated that recent acts like anti-conversion and anti-cattle slaughter among others “are pogroms against the economic and cultural rights of religious minorities”.“We are a group of senior scientists, writers, academics, artists, and lawyers, and we write with concern about Karnataka’s deteriorating governance and the frequent violence against religious minorities. Over the past few months, the state has witnessed the brutal killing of youths in several districts, rampant ‘hate speeches’, public threats and disruptions of worship by religious minorities, ‘honour killings’, ‘moral policing’, misogynistic statements by legislators, and incidents of hostile and violent encounters between various religious groups. “These trends have been encouraged by the callous and un-constitutional statements made by legislators and the inability of the state machinery to rein-in fringe anti-social groups,” stated the letter.The list includes Prof. Vinod Gaur (former secretary, department of science and technology and geophysicist), Flavia Agnes (lawyer and author), Mumbai, Prof. Janaki Nair (historian),Prof. Vidyanand Nanjundiah (scientist), Dr Ramachandra Guha (historian and commentator), K.P.Suresha (poet, essayist, and translator), Dr Yellappa Reddy (forester and environmentalist), Bezwada Wilson (human rights’ specialist) and Prof. A.R.Vasavi (social anthropologist), among others.“Such trends go against the long history of Karnataka as a progressive state that facilitated social harmony of a plural society and initiated model welfare programs for all sections of the population,” the letter added.The restriction on allowing six students in a Udupi school with a Hijab into the classroom is one of the latest instances of attacks on minority rights in Karnataka. In recent times, there have been several instances of moral policing from right wing groups as well as hardline Muslims who have accosted and attacked people from different faiths in any kind of interaction.A report by the Association for Protection of Civil Rights (APCR) in December last year, indicated that there were at least 305 incidents of violence in the 273 days of 2021 between January and September in their report ‘Christians Under Attack in India”.Of this Karnataka had accounted for around 32 instances, which was one of the highest in the country.“We note with both sadness and alarm that these traditions of tolerance and shared well-being are being torn asunder. Instead, the state is losing its identity on multiple fronts. On the fiscal, administrative, and political fronts Karnataka is losing its federal strength. Recent legislation such as the ‘cow protection’ and ‘anti-conversion’ acts are pogroms against the economic and cultural rights of religious minorities. No longer are harmony, peace, and tolerance the hallmarks of the state. It also needs to be stressed that if the above issues are not addressed, even Karnataka’s reputation as a business destination is bound to be impacted negatively as all types of economic activity depend upon an atmosphere of social peace and harmony.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-bommai-assures-to-protect-rights-of-minorities-101643223589230.html
27-01-2022||India||LTTE using fake ID documents in revival bid: NIA||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) is investigating a case where forged Indian identity documents are being procured by “active cadres” of Sri Lankan Tamil separatist group, Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), to use a bank account here to revive its activities, according to senior officials familiar with the matter. This is the second probe launched by NIA into LTTE’s activiies in the country in the past 10 months. The arrest of a Sri Lankan woman , Letchumanan Mary Franciska, by Tamil Nadu police on October 1 last year revealed the involvement of LTTE, following which the Centre has now handed over the probe to the central anti-terror probe agency to investigate whether there is a larger conspiracy, said one of the officials cited above.Along with Franciska, four other suspected LTTE workers, Kenniston Fernando, K Baskaran, Johnson Samuel and L Sellamuthu are under the scanner in the case, registered by NIA on January 18. “The preliminary investigation has revealed multiple Indian identity documents such as Indian passports being obtained by submitting forged documents and these documents were being used to withdraw money from Indian Overseas Bank, Mumbai Fort branch to further the activities of LTTE,” said a NIA senior official, who asked not to be named. The development comes at a time when NIA is already investigating an arms and drugs smuggling racket having direct links with LTTE members. In October last year, NIA had arrested a former intelligence officer of LTTE , Satkunam alias Sabesan in its probe into the seizure of five AK47 rifles, thousands of rounds of 9 mm ammunition and 300 kg of heroin from fishing vessel Ravihansi, which was intercepted by the Coast Guard off the coast of Minicoy in Lakshwadeep on March 18. “Sebastian played a crucial role in routing the proceeds of drugs trafficking to former LTTE cadres in Sri Lanka for the revival of LTTE,” the agency said in a statement in October 2021. In the latest case, Franciska obtained an Indian passport, valid till December 2030, from Regional Passport Office (RPO) Chennai, using fake documents. She was arrested on October 1 at Chennai domestic airport while travelling to Bengaluru, with her final destination mentioned as Mumbai. The officer cited above said Franciska came to India in December 2019 using her Sri Lankan passport on an electronic tourist visa, which was valid till December 2020 only. Initially, she claimed that she could not go back due to the pandemic and obtained Indian passport using details of a gas connection in her name and rent lease agreement . She had also obtained an Indian Voter-ID card during her stay here. A thorough investigation revealed that active cadres of LTTE are involved in the racket, according to another official cited above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ltte-using-fake-id-documents-in-revival-bid-nia-101643223527928.html
27-01-2022||India||At UNSC meet, India seeks ‘concrete progress’ by Taliban on terror group support||NEW DELHI: India on Wednesday called for “concrete progress” by the Taliban setup in Afghanistan to ensure that UN-sanctioned terror groups do not get support from Afghan soil or from terrorist sanctuaries in the region, an apparent reference to Pakistan.India’s ambassador to the United Nations, TS Tirumurti, outlined the country’s position while addressing a meeting of the UN Security Council that discussed the situation in Afghanistan in the aftermath of the takeover of Kabul by the Taliban. Tirumurti said the world community’s expectations regarding Afghanistan and the Taliban setup were clearly outlined in UN Security Council resolution 2593, which also laid down the requirements in terms of the fight against terrorism. As a contiguous neighbour and long-standing partner of Afghanistan, India is concerned by recent developments in Afghanistan, especially the deteriorating humanitarian situation, he said. India also shares the world community’s concerns on issues such as providing humanitarian aid, ensuring formation of a truly inclusive and representative government, combating terror and preserving the rights of women, children and minorities. “Terrorism continues to pose a serious threat to Afghanistan and to the region,” he said. Resolution 2593 noted the Taliban’s commitment not to allow the use of Afghan soil for terrorism, including terrorists and groups designated under UN Security Council resolution 1267, he added. “However, we need to see concrete progress in ensuring that such proscribed terrorist entities do not get any support, tacit or direct, either from Afghan soil or from the terrorist sanctuaries based in the region,” Tirumurti said in an apparent reference to Pakistan. Resolution 2593 also laid down the world community’s expectations regarding an inclusive and representative political settlement with meaningful participation of women and minorities and diverse political-ethnic groups in the country, the importance of upholding human rights, including those of women, children and minorities, and the need to provide humanitarian aid to the Afghan people. “Peace and security in Afghanistan is a critical imperative that all of us need to collectively strive for. The recent developments in Afghanistan will have a significant impact on the neighbouring countries and the wider region with global implications,” Tirumurti said.“India calls for an inclusive dispensation in Afghanistan which represents all sections of Afghan society. A broad based, inclusive and representative formation is necessary for internal legitimacy,” he added. India has committed to provide 50,000 tonnes of wheat, lifesaving medicines and one million doses of Covid-19 vaccines to the Afghan people. “We have already dispatched three shipments of humanitarian assistance consisting of medicines and Covid medicines,” Tirumurti said. Tirumurti also briefed the same meeting as the current chair of the 1988 sanctions committee, which monitors UN sanctions on Taliban leaders and entities linked to the group. He noted that the committee on December 22 extended the three-month travel ban exemption for 14 listed Taliban members to continue attending talks. He said that while the committee fully supports the travel ban exemption so that the UN-sanctioned Taliban leaders can attend talks aimed at promoting peace and stability in Afghanistan, UN member states should remember that the exemption is only for this purpose. Tirumurti said more than 30 UN-sanctioned Taliban members are occupying senior cabinet positions and humanitarian aid providers should use reasonable efforts to minimise the accrual of benefits to these designated individuals. He further noted that ties “between the Taliban, largely through the Haqqani Network, and the Al-Qaida and foreign terrorist fighters remain close and are based on ideological alignment and relationships forged through common struggle and intermarriage”. The continued presence of the Islamic state and its activities in Afghanistan remain a matter of concern, and the group was using terror attacks to “demonstrate its power and influence in the country and abroad”, he said.

27-01-2022||India||India-Central Asia Summit: Trade, Afghanistan in focus at key talks today||Connectivity, trade, forging an institutionalised framework for cooperation and the situation in Afghanistan will be on the agenda when India hosts the first summit with the five Central Asian states on January 27 as part of New Delhi’s engagement with the extended neighbourhood. The virtual summit is being held after the leaders of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan were unable to attend India’s Republic Day celebrations on Wednesday because of a surge in Covid-19 infections. The five leaders were invited to be chief guests at the event, though no formal announcement was made by any of the countries. The summit is expected to discuss several proposals that focus on trade and connectivity, development partnerships, institutionalised frameworks for cooperation, culture and people-to-people contacts, people familiar with the matter said. Among these proposals are suggestions for making the India-Central Asia Summit a regular event, the creation of a permanent secretariat to drive cooperation and coordination, and greater engagement at the ministerial level in fields such as trade, connectivity, defence, security and tourism, the people said. Currently, the six countries have a mechanism at the level of foreign ministers called the India-Central Asia Dialogue and its third meeting was hosted by New Delhi in December. India has sharpened it focus on the Central Asian states both to counter China’s growing presence in the region and to strengthen cooperation on Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover of that country. Top national security officials of all five Central Asian states participated in the Delhi Regional Security Dialogue on Afghanistan hosted by India in November. Three of the states , Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, share borders with Afghanistan. The summit will be the first engagement of its kind between Indian and Central Asian leaders, and the external affairs ministry has said the meet indicates the importance attached by all six countries to a comprehensive and enduring partnership. India also has strong bilateral ties with all the five Central Asian states. Kazakhstan is a key supplier of uranium to India and also the country’s largest trade partner in the region. Two-way trade, mostly comprising oil, was worth $1.9 billion during 2020-21. As part of a unique experiment in UN peacekeeping, Kazakh troops are part of an Indian battalion in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and the sixth rotation is currently underway. The two sides also have a regular joint military exercise called Kazind, and Kazakhstan is home to around 8,000 Indians, including 5,000 medical students. India has a strategic partnership with Kyrgyzstan, where it has established five telemedicine centres. India provided the country a line of credit of $200 million in 2019 and the two countries have an annual joint military exercise called Khanjar. Kyrgyzstan also is home to more than 15,000 Indian students. The India-Tajik Friendship Hospital is a symbol of India’s strong cooperation in defence with its strategic partner Tajikistan, and the two countries have a very similar position on Afghanistan. Uzbekistan, also a strategic partner of India, is part of a trilateral working group for the development of Chabahar port. It has been provided a line of credit of $1 billion in 2018, and four projects worth $450 million have already been approved. Several Indian universities and pharmaceutical companies have established a presence in Uzbekistan. 
27-01-2022||India||Over one-third of ward member candidates elected uncontested in Odisha||BHUBANESWAR: Candidates in little more than one-third of the 91890 posts of ward members in the forthcoming panchayat polls in Odisha were declared elected uncontested by State Election Commission on Wednesday, repeating a trend that was seen in 2017 panchayat polls. The Commission in a notification on Wednesday said 36523 candidates for the post of ward members, the lowest-ranked functionaries of the three-tier panchayatiraj system, were declared winners as they were the only candidates. Similarly, of the total 6,793 posts of sarpanch in as many grampanchayats, 126 candidates were declared uncontested winners. In the case of panchayat samitis, 326 candidates out of the total 6,793 panchayat samiti posts have been elected without contest. However, only one candidate for the zilla parishad member’s post out of the total 853 posts was elected unopposed. The Biju Janata Dal (BJD) candidate Kalpana Pradhan from zone II of Ambabhona block of Bargarh district was declared the winner. Officials said the percentage of ward members declared winners without contesting will be higher as the Commission has called for fresh nomination in at least 4000 such posts where there were no nominations. The trend of large number of ward member candidates getting elected uncontested was seen in 2017 when 36222 candidates won the polls without a single vote being cast. Panchayatiraj department officials said the election of a large number of ward members without any contest may be happening as they are largely powerless. “Though every ward member of the Gramapanchayats have the right to access to the records of the Gramapanchayat and inspect all works undertaken by the panchayat as well as all the institutions, controlled, managed and directed by the Gramapanchayat, in reality they wield little control. So there is little interest,” said the official. BJP leader Sajjan Sharma alleged that not just the ward members, even Zilla Parishad chairpersons and panchayat samiti chairpersons don’t enjoy much freedom as the bureaucracy takes all the crucial decisions. “In Odisha the district collectors take major decisions for the zilla parishads and the BDOs for the panchayat samitis. In case of gram panchayats, the panchayat extension officer is the real authority,” alleged Sharma. When it comes to salaries, the ward members get paltry sum compared to other functionaries of the panchayatiraj system. While the sarpanchs in the state get monthly salary of ₹2,350, panchayat samiti members and their chairpersons get ₹3,530 while the Zilla parishad members and their chairpersons get ₹7,040 and ₹9,380 respectively. However, the ward members get no monthly salary and are paid just ₹240 per sitting of their respective panchayats towards allowance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-one-third-of-ward-member-candidates-elected-uncontested-in-odisha-101643222627881.html
27-01-2022||India||Rare on-board footage adds to flying display||NEW DELHI: A flying display by 75 military aircraft marked the grand finale of the 73rd Republic Day parade, with breathtaking aerial shots and cockpit footage treating the viewers of India’s biggest ceremonial event to a rarely-seen visual delight, the best in many years.Also Read | Grandeur marks 73rd R-DayFrom five Rafale fighter jets flying in the Vinash formation to three Sukhoi-30s roaring across the sky in the Trishul formation (both arrowhead patterns) to 17 Jaguars coming together to draw ‘75’ above Rajpath to commemorate India’s 75th year of Independence, the Indian Air Force lived up to its reputation --- it delivered the highlight of the parade despite cloudy conditions.“The fly-past coverage (aerial and cockpit footage) was the best it’s been in years, especially given the miserable weather,” said defence analyst Angad Singh.The aircraft which took part in the fly-past, that lasted around 15 minutes, took off from several airbases in north India, including Ambala, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer and Hindan. The rehearsals lasted two weeks. The logistics involved aircraft and aircrews arriving to bases in north India from different parts of the country to practice for the fly-past.It featured flying formations to commemorate some glorious moments of India’s decisive victory over Pakistan in the 1971 war, including the historic Tangail airdrop and the Meghna operation.While the Tangail formation involved a vintage Dakota aircraft flying in lead with two Dornier 228 planes, the Meghna formation featured a CH-47F Chinook helicopter and four Mi-171V choppers. The painstakingly restored Dakota, the only one in IAF now, was gifted to IAF in 2018 by Rajeev Chandrasekhar, MP and now the Union minister of state for IT, whose father served in the force.The Tangail airdrop north of Dhaka --- the biggest airborne operation mounted by Indian paratroopers --- set the stage for surrender by the rival army.The aim of the operation was to capture the Poongli bridge on Jamalpur-Tangail-Dhaka road and the ferry site on Louhajang river to intercept Pakistani army’s 93 Brigade that was retreating from the north to defend Dhaka. Around 750 men of the 2nd Battalion of the Parachute Regiment were involved in the successful mission.The paratroopers defeated a force that was three times numerically superior and shattered the will of the Pakistani army to defend Dhaka.The Meghna formation commemorated a critical heli-borne operation during the 1971 war. IAF helicopters played a critical role in moving troops across the Meghna river in erstwhile East Pakistan.Other flying formations included Baaz (consisting of one Rafale, two Jaguars, two upgraded MiG-29s and two Su-30s) and Varuna (one naval P8-I aircraft and and two MiG-29Ks).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rare-on-board-footage-adds-to-flying-display-101643222328869.html
27-01-2022||India||Iran’s foreign minister to visit India next week||Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian is set to visit India next week for discussions that are expected to focus on the situation in West Asia and Afghanistan and regional connectivity, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. A planned trip to India by Abdollahian last November was put off for various reasons and this will be his first visit to India since he assumed office last year. He is expected to hold talks with external affairs minister S Jaishankar on January 31 before travelling to Sri Lanka. Ahead of the visit, Abdollahian greeted Jaishankar and the people of India on India’s Republic Day and said in a tweet that Iran will “continue to work towards further expansion of all-out relations, bilaterally, regionally and at international fora”. Jaishankar responded by tweeting that he was looking forward to his Iranian counterpart’s visit. Two key issues that are expected to figure in Abdollahian’s interactions in New Delhi are the situation in Afghanistan, especially the urgent need for humanitarian assistance, and measures to boost the development and use of Iran’s Chabahar port, the people cited above said. The Indian side has been considering the option of using Chabahar to ship wheat and other essential items to Afghanistan in light of Pakistan’s reluctance to allow the use of land routes passing through its territory for transporting humanitarian aid. Though India proposed using the Wagah land border crossing to send 50,000 tonnes of wheat to Afghanistan in October last year, shipments via this route are yet to start. During a phone conversation with Jaishankar on January 8, Abdollahian said Iran will cooperate with India in shipping humanitarian aid, including wheat and medicines, to Afghanistan, and also stressed the need for an inclusive government in Kabul. Jaishankar also said in a tweet that he and Abdollahian had discussed the difficulties the challenges in Afghanistan and “prospects of Chabahar”. Iran’s top national security official participated in the Delhi Regional Security Dialogue on Afghanistan hosted by India last November, reflecting the growing convergence between the two countries on the situation in Afghanistan. Abdollahian is also expected to discuss the Iranian nuclear issue while in New Delhi. Iran and the US have held indirect talks on the issue for almost two months amid hopes of a breakthrough despite persisting differences. The US and European allies said last week there were just weeks to salvage the 2015 Iran nuclear deal or the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Iran is also engaged in direct talks on the nuclear issue with the “P4+1”, or Germany and permanent UN Security Council members France, China, the UK and Russia. India has consistently backed a negotiated settlement of the issue. India has been pressed to strike a balance between Iran and other key players in West Asia such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, especially in the wake of drone and missile attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels on Abu Dhabi. Two Indians were killed in a recent attack, which Jaishankar condemned as a terrorist incident. Seven Indian crew members of a merchant vessel seized by the rebels are currently in the custody of the Houthis. Several reports have suggested that the drones and missiles used by the Houthis were supplied by Iran. 
27-01-2022||India||Green clearance:Housing in forest areas could get nod||New Delhi: The Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC) has decided it will consider residential projects of up to 1 hectare (10,000 sq m), roughly an area larger than a football field, in forest areas under exceptional circumstances -- a significant change from its earlier position on such projects.In a note to all state governments dated January 24, the environment ministry’s forest conservation division said the issue of residential projects was considered by the Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) in its meeting held on September 17, 2021. Based on the recommendation of FAC, and consideration of the recommendations by the competent authority in the ministry, it added, clarification was being issued and changes were being made to guidelines issued under the Forest Conservation Act published in the Handbook of Forest Conservation Act and Guidelines 2019.Independent experts said the relaxation in guidelines for residential projects could be misused leading to large scale loss of forests.“This entire note is completely against the government’s own policy that forest land shouldn’t be diverted for residential, housing and agricultural purposes. One hectare is a very large area for any residential project. Under the Forest Rights Act, exemption is already given for certain activities related to forest dwelling communities. So, is this exemption for city dwellers? The note is dangerous in every way,” said environmental lawyer Ritwick Dutta.Another expert said such residential projects may be considered for rehabilitation of forest dwellers or tribals, who are displaced from forest land for various projects. “There are two points that require further enquiry. First, the requirement of forest land for rehabilitation of displaced persons continues to be understood as same way as disposal of fly ash or setting up of a manufacturing unit. This has implications when historical rights of communities living in forest areas are acquired or extinguished. The second is the need to justify why the residential colonies are limited to only 1 hectare. This is important because there is huge demand for deemed and recorded forest lands in peri urban areas, where high value residential colonies may be planned or be in existence. This change may have implications for such projects,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at Centre for Policy Research.The relevant part of the changed text in the handbook now reads: “Utilisation of forest area for establishing industries, construction of residential colonies, institutes, disposal of fly ash, rehabilitation of displaced persons, etc. are non-site-specific activities and cannot be considered on forest land as a rule. For that matter, no non-site specific proposal can be entertained for considering approval under the FCA 1980. In exceptional circumstances, residential projects up to one ha, can be considered for approval under FCA 1980 by the MoEFCC, subject to appropriate justification and recommendation by the concerned State Government and the Regional Officer of the IRO of MoEFCC.”IRO stands for Integrated Regional Offices, which comes under the MoEFCC, and deal with state-level infrastructure and development projects.The letter also added that Clause 11.1 of the guidelines is now deleted. Clause 11.1 stated that infrastructure projects requiring diversion of forest land under the forest conservation act 1980 fall under following categories (in addition to the General Approval granted by the Central government for the specified public utility services and critical/strategic defence infrastructure for the specified periods) -- road widening and construction, including widening in existing right of way; construction of railway lines including conversion of metre-gauge railway line; repair and maintenance of roads constructed on forest lands prior to October 25, 1980; residential projects in forest lands; construction of residential buildings in private forests; non-site-specific projects like industries, residential colonies, institutes, disposal of fly ash and rehabilitation of displaced persons; ecotourism in forest areas; ropeways etc.The ministry’s explanation is that the change actually ensures that fewer residential projects will be built in forest area, by clarifying a change that was made in 2019 in the handbook, which was not being followed because an earlier, 2004 edition of the handbook was ambiguous about locating residential projects in forests. “The reason we had to issue this clarification is because people were building in forest areas and saying these are residential facilities linked to the main project. The cumulative impact of such constructions is big. Now we have almost closed the window and kept it very narrow for exceptional cases with permission and scrutiny by the ministry. We are clarifying this misinterpretation,” said a senior environment ministry official who asked not to be named. Now, any construction will be allowed only in “exceptional cases which will be verified by both regional and central teams of MoEFCC”, this person added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/green-clearance-housing-in-forest-areas-could-get-nod-101643222268821.html
27-01-2022||India||Virat, the President’s star charger, rides into the sunset||New Delhi: One of India’s best-known military horses, Virat, on Wednesday rode into the sunset after nearly two decades of presidential service -- and he couldn’t have asked for a better sendoff.Also Read | Grandeur marks 73rd R-DayAfter the Republic Day parade ended, President Ram Nath Kovind, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and defence minister Rajnath Singh walked up to the charger and tenderly petted him -- the gesture an unmistakable acknowledgement of Virat’s military service, especially his role in India’s biggest ceremonial event over the years. It was Virat’s 13th and final appearance at the Republic Day parade as the horse of the commandant of the elite President’s Bodyguard, or PBG, raised in 1773 and one of the oldest regiments of the army.At the Republic Day parade, the President traditionally arrives at Rajpath from the Rashtrapati Bhawan escorted by PBG. On Wednesday, the horsemen escorting Kovind were led by PBG commandant Colonel Anup Tiwari, who was mounted on Virat.Virat, a Hanoverian horse, was issued to PBG in 2003 by the army’s Remount Training School and Depot at Hempur in Uttarakhand.“He was barely four years old then. He was among the five horses I chose for PBG. What struck me most about Virat was his height, elegance, and the way he moved. I knew he was born to serve PBG,” said Honorary Captain Sajjan Kumar (retd), who brought the charger to Rashtrapati Bhawan.Presidential horses have to be at least 157.5 cm tall -- Virat’s height is a little over 170 cm. A horse’s height is measured to the highest point of the withers on its back. PBG horses have to be tall to complement the men from the regiment who have to have a minimum height of six feet.Virat was honoured with the army chief’s commendation card for outstanding service on Army Day (January 15).“It was an emotional moment to see the President and the PM bid farewell to Virat at Rajpath. He served the country like any other soldier. Virat is still physically fit and will spend his retirement at some army paddock where he will be looked after,” said Colonel Rajesh Pattu (retd), a champion rider and former commandant of 61 Cavalry, one of the world’s last remaining horse-mounted regiments.Virat’s retirement has turned the spotlight on animals in military service in India. The army has at least 5,000 mules, 1,500 horses and 1,000 dogs.On the edges of London’s iconic Hyde Park is a monument that pays tribute to the thousands of animals that served alongside the British and Allied forces in 20th century wars. The memorial depicts horses, dogs, mules, elephants, camels and pigeons.India does not have an animal war memorial -- an earlier proposal to build one at the Remount and Veterinary Corps Centre and College in Meerut has not moved forward.Recognising the contribution of animals, the army in 2017 named an officer’s mess lounge in Delhi cantonment after the longest serving army mule, Pedongi, who carried military loads in forward areas for more than 30 years.The army’s animal transport units, equipped with mules, are assigned the responsibility of supporting some of its remotest outposts located at heights of up to 19,000 feet. Mules played a crucial role during the 1999 Kargil war with Pakistan.Dogs also play an important role in counterterrorism operations. One such dog, Mansi, was posthumously mentioned in dispatches (the highest honour that a dog can get in military service in India) six years ago for her role in a counter-infiltration operation in north Kashmir.Her handler, Bashir Ahmed War, was posthumously awarded the Sena Medal for gallantry. The highest award won by a dog handler is Shaurya Chakra, India’s third highest peacetime gallantry honour.Army dogs are trained for a variety of roles such as detecting mines and explosives, tracking, assault, and search and rescue.

27-01-2022||India||CVC again revises SOP for implementing Integrity Pact||The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) has revised, for the second time in eight months, the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for adopting and implementing the Integrity Pact, the first step in ensuring transparency in public procurements. The changes are expected to provide a larger pool of Independent External Monitors (IEMS) for examining government contracts. The change in rules says that the Independent External Monitors (IEMs), who are appointed by the apex vigilance body to look into issues relating to execution of contract(s) and any irregularities, will only be picked from a panel of eminent persons/officers who have held the post of additional secretary or equivalent or any other position at a higher pay scale in the government of India at the time of retirement. Existing rules, issued in June 2021, only considered officials at the rank of secretary to government of India, chief secretaries in the states or officials at equivalent pay scale at the time of retirement. This change, experts said, will provide a larger pool of officers retired from various government departments who can be appointed IEMs in case there is shortage of officers. The latest SOP, which CVC shared with all departments and ministries on Tuesday, has also removed retired director generals of police from the list of eminent persons to be considered for IEMs. Officials said all changes in eligibility criteria has been made after taking feedback from Chief Vigilance Officers (CVOs) and other officials.For retired officers of armed officers, too, only those officers equivalent to the ranks of additional secretaries or higher in the government of India will now be eligible to become IEMs. Earlier, this was allowed only for officers in apex pay scale. “The SOPs have been changed after receiving feedback and suggestions from the CVOs (chief vigilance officers) of various organisations and other individuals, regarding the eligibility criteria,” said a senior government official, requesting anonymity. Persons who have held the post of CMD/MD or CEO of public sector banks, insurance companies, and other state-owned financial institutions at the time of retirement will continue to be included in the list of IEMs, an advisory role considered important to examine the process of integrity in award of government contracts. The Integrity Pact (IP), which is mandatory for all government organisations, public sector enterprises, public sector banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions and autonomous bodies etc, essentially envisages an agreement between the prospective vendors/bidders and the buyer, with both sides pledging not to resort to any corrupt practices. After a contract is given in a government organisation, CVC rules say, IEMs will have access to all the documents/records pertaining to the contract for which a complaint or issue is raised before them, except the documents having national security implications. IEMs will examine all complaints received and give their recommendations to the chief executive of the organisation. In case of suspicion of serious irregularities requiring legal or administrative action, IEMs are supposed to send a report to the Chief Vigilance Officers (CVOs). CVC in its revised SOPs has also stated that the proposal for nomination of IEMs in respective organisations should be sent by the concerned department responsible for ensuring implementation of Integrity Pact in the organisation, after taking approval of the competent authority. It said the proposal should be sent within three months of completion of tenure of existing IEMs, failing which CVC itself would nominate IEM (s) on its own from its panel. Former Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) chairman RS Sharma said including additional secretary rank officers must have been done to create a larger pool of officers as IEMs. “IEMs play a key role in resolving issues raised by any party regarding any aspect of the tender. They are one step before anyone wants to take legal route.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cvc-again-revises-sop-for-implementing-integrity-pact-101643222208669.html

Babu Ram’s wife, Reema Rani, and son, Manik, received the award. The police officer killed three terrorists during an operation in Srinagar on August 29, 2020.Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the country in paying tribute to India’s fallen braves at the National War Memorial (NWM), a monument dedicated to soldiers killed in post-Independence wars and operations.“On Republic Day, we recall the great women and men who worked towards the making of our Constitution. We also reiterate our commitment to fulfil their dreams for our nation,” the PM tweeted.
27-01-2022||India||Two protesters arrested in UP, six cops suspended for assault on students||Two people were arrested by police in connection with the alleged rioting and blocking of the railway track at Prayag Junction by some job aspirants, police said on Wednesday, adding that a case was lodged against around 1,000 unidentified persons. Six policemen were also suspended with immediate effect for using unnecessary force during the incident, which took place on Tuesday.Also Read | Railways pauses exam as protests turn violentAccording to the police, job aspirants in large numbers tried to stop a train at the local railway station here on Tuesday, alleging anomalies in the results of non-technical popular category (NTPC) exam conducted by the Railway Recruitment Board last year.Also Read | Aspirants allege anomalies in RRB exam results, protest in PrayagrajA senior police official, however, told reporters that it appears that the arrested accused had taken “money from some political parties” to create unrest. A police team has been constituted to probe the incident from this angle. Police said the two arrested people have been identified as Pradeep Yadav and Mukesh Yadav while the search for the third suspect, Rajesh Sachin, is on. They had made inflammatory remarks on social media, police added.Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Ajay Kumar said a video of the incident surfaced on social media late on Tuesday night, in which some policemen were seen using unnecessary force. The policemen, identified as Rakesh Bharti, SI Shailendra Yadav, SI Kapil Kumar Chahal and constables Mohammad Arif, Achhe Lal and Durvesh Kumar, have been suspended with immediate effect and departmental action is being taken against them, the SSP said.The SSP said there is no quarrel between police and students and those who play with students’ future won’t be spared. He said in connection with the Tuesday’s incident, they have registered a case against 1,000 unidentified miscreants under 13 serious sections. The SSP said it appears that the miscreants “took money from some political parties to create unrest”.“A team of 11 policemen along with local intelligence officials is identifying elements who were involved in creating ruckus and violence and inciting youths. Primary investigations have revealed that Rajesh Sachan played an important role in inciting youths through social media platforms. Rajesh has affiliation with some political organisations and it is suspected that the protest was funded. Protests were organised as a conspiracy for political gains during upcoming polls,” the SSP added.On late Tuesday night, police launched search in Salori and Baghada areas where students stay in rented lodge. The widely circulated videos are purportedly of the police action in these areas, in which cops can be seen breaking doors of lodges and assaulting students with sticks.A large number of students had gathered on the railway track but were chased down by police. The SSP said some of them pelted policemen with stones and hid in their hostel nearby. Police were trying to catch the culprits and some of the personnel used unnecessary force, which is visible in the video, he said.“Police will not take action against innocent students but the trouble makers who in disguise of students caused violence will not be spared. They will be identified through available video footages and more of them will be arrested in coming days,” SSP said.On Wednesday, former Uttar Pradesh chief minister and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav slammed the state government over alleged mishandling of protesting students by police in Prayagraj. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Tuesday accused the state police of assaulting students and vandalising their hostels. Sharing a purported video of the incident on Twitter, she said, “It is highly condemnable that police in Prayagraj are thrashing students and vandalising their lodges and hostels.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-protesters-arrested-in-up-six-cops-suspended-for-assault-on-students-101643222087653.html

27-01-2022||India||Rahul blames Twitter for restricting followers ‘under govt pressure’||New Delhi: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has written to Twitter, saying that his reach appeared to have been limited on the social media company’s platform amid unsaid restrictions on the number of his followers after “pressure by the government to silence my voice”, people aware of the matter said on Wednesday.One of Gandhi’s tweets was recently banned for violating Twitter’s content guidelines.“I want to bring your attention to what I believe is Twitter’s unwitting complicity in curbing free and fair speech in India… I have been reliably, albeit discreetly, informed by people at Twitter India that they are under immense pressure by the government to silence my voice,” Gandhi wrote in his letter to Twitter CEO Parag Aggarwal in December. HT has seen a copy of the letter.A spokesperson of the ministry of electronics and information technology did not respond to a request for a comment on the matter.“The ideological battle between liberal democracy and authoritarianism across the world is being shaped on social media platforms. This places a huge responsibility on those that are at the helm of companies such as Twitter,” Gandhi added.The development was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Gandhi added that it was perplexing that the growth in Twitter followers had suddenly been “suppressed”. “With nearly 20 million followers, my Twitter account has been active, adding an average of nearly eight to ten thousand new followers every day. This had been the case for every year until July 2021.”In August, Gandhi shared a photograph and a video with the parents of a nine-year-old Dalit girl who was allegedly raped and murdered, with the Bharatiya Janata Party launching an attack against him for being “insensitive” and attempting to “gain political mileage”. Gandhi was temporarily suspended from accessing his account. Twitter subsequently blocked the post in India, though it remains accessible outside the country, and his access to his account was restored. Gandhi later revealed that he had permission from the girl’s parents to post their picture.In his letter, Gandhi said that, since August, his average monthly followers fell to zero. “There is an inflection point after which my Twitter account seems to have been paralysed,” he said. “Perhaps not so coincidentally, it was in these same months that I raised the plight of a rape victim in Delhi. I have been reliably, albeit discreetly informed, by people at Twitter that they have been under immense pressure by the government to silence my voice.” He added that many other accounts, including government accounts, tweeted the same photograph but no action was taken against them. In its response to HT, Twitter said: “As part of our ongoing and global efforts to encourage healthy conversation on Twitter, every part of the service matters. Follower counts are a visible feature, and we want everyone to have confidence that the numbers are meaningful and accurate. Twitter has a zero-tolerance approach to platform manipulation and spam. We fight spam and malicious automation strategically and at scale with machine learning tools, and as part of those consistent and ongoing efforts to ensure a healthy service and credible accounts, follower counts can and do fluctuate.”It added: “We remove millions of accounts each week for violating our policies on platform manipulation and spam. You can take a look at our latest Twitter Transparency Center update for more context. While some accounts notice a minor difference, in certain cases the number could be higher.”“This is neither a fully explanatory nor a satisfactory response,” said Srivatsa YB, incharge of digital communication for Gandhi’s office.According to associate litigation counsel at Internet Freedom Foundation, Krishnesh, the allegations posed a grave concern. “If Twitter is engaging in shadow-banning, it is acting contrary to Rule 4(8) of IT Rules, 2021, which mandates Twitter to inform the user prior to removing/disabling the account of that user. It is also worth noting that Twitter in 2018 had stated that they do not shadow-ban. Thus, Twitter ought to explain why there was a sudden reduction in the average monthly followers of Mr Gandhi,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-blames-twitter-for-restricting-followers-under-govt-pressure-101643221967613.html

27-01-2022||Today's||The AAP is still a work in progress||If there were an award for the most successful political start-up of the last decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) would be the apparent frontrunner. No other political party has made such a dramatic impact in such a short period as the Arvind Kejriwal-led outfit, which undoubtedly benefitted partly from the disproportionate media exposure in the Capital. Now, the nagging question is whether the AAP can scale up and become a pan-India “unicorn”, which is why the 2022 assembly elections could be a critical moment in the AAP’s journey.
27-01-2022||Today's||There are signs of unease in China’s domestic politics||In recent years, political uncertainty has marked the period prior to a national congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Ever since the death of Deng Xiaoping, no transfer of power between the general secretaries of the CCP has been without incident.
