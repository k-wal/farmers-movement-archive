Representatives of various residential societies and elected members met PMC officials and demanded tanker water supply from civic administration. Additional municipal commissioner Ravindra Binwade called a meeting with Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA), PMC and district planning officials to address the issue. Vivek Kharwadkar, chief engineer, PMRDA; Aniruddha Pawaskar, head, PMC water department and others attended the meet. Recently, Amol Balwadkar, BJP corporator from Baner-Balewadi, used ward development fund of Rs1 crore to provide water tanker supply in Balewadi, Bavdhan and other areas. “PMRDA had cleared these projects in villages before its merger with PMC last year. While submitting the construction plans, builders gave written assurance to provide water supply. PMC is yet to lay water pipelines in these areas and cannot afford to provide tanker supply,” a civic official said on condition of anonymity. Pawaskar said, “Earlier these areas were getting water supply from local grampanchayats. With rise in population in these villages, grampanchayats were unable to provide water to residents and the responsibility fell on builders. Now, PMC has appointed a consultant to lay water pipelines in these 23 villages. Till PMC is able to provide piped water supply to residents living in these villages, they have to make their own arrangement.” Binwade has instructed PMRDA to issue notices to builders who are yet to handover the housing project to residents to provide water supply. Kunal Joshi, resident of a housing society in Bavdhan, said, “We bought flat here as the rate was low than in PMC areas. However, we face lack of basic services like water, roads and other amenties. Though we were happy after merger with PMC, we need to wait for long period for civic water supply.” Another resident, staying at Ambegaon, said, “It is not possible to purchase water through private tankers daily as it is costly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/as-pmc-denies-tanker-water-to-23-villages-citizens-wait-for-piped-supply-101642876186381.html
22-01-2022||Lucknow||UP’s R-Day tableau themed on KV Corridor, ODOP||Lucknow/Varanasi: Uttar Pradesh’s tableau at the Republic Day parade in Delhi on January 26 will primarily be based on the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor in Varanasi. The tableau will showcase the “cultural revitalisation of Kashi Vishwanath Corridor” and UP’s ODOP (one district, one product) scheme. Last year, UP’s tableau was on the Ram Temple coming up in Ayodhya. A senior state government official, preferring not to be quoted, said: “The UP tableau’s theme was approved by the tableau committee in New Delhi. This time it’s a dual theme-- Kashi Vishwanath Corridor and ODOP. The tableau is being made in Delhi ahead of the R-Day parade.” ODOP is the state government’s flagship scheme to promote--nationally and internationally--the traditional, signature crafts and products specific to particular districts such as brass work of Moradabad, woodcraft of Saharanpur and carpets of Bhadohi. The Kashi Vishwanath Corridor was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 13. It has been built in around a 5.5 lakh square feet area. The construction cost of the project is ₹339 crore, while the entire project is worth over ₹700 crore. It has 24 buildings, including Kashi Vishwanath Temple Complex, tourist facility centre, auditorium, cafeteria, virtual gallery, Vedic library, Kashi museum, Bhogshala (sacred kitchen), security hall, a mega meditation platform and seven grand gates. Also, 70 per cent of it will have a green cover. The devotees may also reach KV Corridor by boats. After reaching the KV Corridor gate facing the Ganga, they may reach the KV Temple while walking through the KV Corridor. Last year, the UP tableau’s theme was the grandeur of the Ram temple being built in Ayodhya, the temple town’s culture and Ayodhya as a symbol of social-religious harmony. Last year, the tableau had evoked a standing ovation in reverence from many in the audience. The tableau had showcased Ayodhya as a major religious tourism destination in India and it featured a grand model of the temple, scenes from Ramayan and the new tradition of annual Deepotsav in Ayodhya. Its title was ‘Uttar Pradesh ki sanskritik dharohar: Ayodhya (Ayodhya: Cultural heritage of Uttar Pradesh)’.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ups-r-day-tableau-themed-on-kv-corridor-odop-101642876184916.html

22-01-2022||Chandigarh||Weather update: No respite from chill in Chandigarh||With intermittent rain throughout the day, maximum temperature once again fell from Friday’s 19.5°C to 16°C on Saturday, 4.3°C below normal, in Chandigarh. After trace rainfall in the morning, the city received 17.6 mm showers in short spells till late at night, highest in about 10 days. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), more rain is likely on Sunday.After it started raining, the mercury dipped at the IMD observatory in Sector 39 from 15.2°C at 11:30 am to 12.8°C at 2:30 pm, and remained around 12.5°C till the evening. With fresh snowfall in Himachal Pradesh, chilly winds — with speeds up to 37 kilometre/hour, according to the Air Force observatory — also continued to blow in the city during the day. “An active western disturbance (WD) is affecting the region, which brought the rain. It is the third active WD that we have received this month, after the first two WDs led to over 100 mm rain in Chandigarh,” said IMD, Chandigarh, director Manmohan Singh. Singh said the present WD system peaked on Saturday, though some rain is expected on Sunday as well. “But it will stop after that, and a drop in minimum temperature by four to five degrees can be expected,” he said.Fog, cold days to persistCloud cover is once again expected to give way to moderate to dense fog from Monday morning, said the IMD director, adding: “Like last week, there is a chance that fog will persist during the day, leading to cold day conditions with below average maximum temperature. It will continue for a few days, before clearing up.”According to the IMD, for a cold day to be declared in the plains, minimum temperature must go below 10°C and maximum temperature should remain 4.5-6.4°C below normal. If maximum temperature drops more than 6.5°C below normal, then a severe cold day is declared. A spell of five severe cold days was recorded between January 15 and January 19, when maximum temperature dropped to 11°C on January 16 and 18, making them the coldest January days in six years. In fact, days remained colder in Chandigarh than in Shimla and Manali during this period.442% surplus rain in JanAs far as rain in concerned, 118.7 mm has been recorded in January so far, which is 442% above normal for this time period, according to the IMD. This January is already the wettest in five years. Before this, 132 mm rain was recorded in January 2017. However, after Sunday, more rain remains unlikely, and dry weather can be expected till the end of this month, said Singh.Meanwhile, due to cloudy weather at night, minimum temperature shot up from Friday’s 6.3°C to 9.8°C on Saturday, 4.2°C above normal. In the next three days, it will remain around 9-10°C, while maximum temperature will settle somewhere between 13°C and 16°C, said the weatherman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/weather-update-no-respite-from-chill-in-chandigarh-101642876010261.html

But this time, the virus is only affecting the upper respiratory track. As the infection is less in the lungs, the fatality rate too has dropped.”According to Dr Suman Singh, director, health services, Chandigarh, most fatalities are being reported among the elderly or those with severe comorbidities, such as diabetes, hypertension, kidney diseases or cardiac-related issues. “A few were also found unvaccinated, and thus low on immunity,” she said.Those who succumbed in Chandigarh included a 65-year-old woman from Sector 26 and a 67-year-old man from Sector 19. Both were fully vaccinated but comorbid. Meanwhile, a 54-year-old man, who resided in Sector 43, tested positive after being brought dead to hospital.

22-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Decision to close gyms challenged in HC||The Punjab and Haryana high court has sought response from the Chandigarh administration by February 25 on a plea challenging its decision to close gyms due to the surge in Covid cases earlier this month. The plea has been filed by Pankaj Kasrija and three others, who are running gyms in different parts of the city. It was on January 6, the administration decided to close gyms, but permitted bars, cinema halls, restaurants and spas to operate at 50% of their capacity. The petitioners’ counsel, Jaspreet Singh Brar, told court that there is no rationale behind restraining gyms from operating. Earlier, two lockdowns have ruined business of petitioners and affected families of staff and owners, it was stated, adding that the petitioners are giving employment to 20 persons per gym.Gyms were first closed during the first lockdown Fon March 16, 2020. They were allowed to open on August 2020, but were shut again during the second wave in 2021. On January 1, 2020, even Haryana imposed restrictions on gyms, but permitted them to operate at 50% capacity. However, in Chandigarh, no such relaxation was allowed, the court was told.“There is no science or logic behind the decision of the government which says that gyms are any way different from other activities like saloons, spas, cinemas halls, restaurants or bars. The petitioners are also taxpayers and have not got any government support or subsidy, and had to face the brunt of the orders passed by the respondents (in view of Covid),” the court was informed, demanding that the UT administration’s decision be quashed. The Punjab government’s decision to close gyms has also been challenged in high court. The plea was taken up on January 18 and stands adjourned for February 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-decision-to-close-gyms-challenged-in-hc-101642876006293.html

Police said the suspect earlier worked as an ATM security guard, but has been unemployed since April 2020.According to police, the suspect, Guddu Kumar Choudhary, knew how to disrupt cash flow by powering down the ATM when withdrawal was made by any customer and later used to take the same money away. On Friday evening, Choudhary was hiding inside the server room behind the ATM to steal cash when a private firm’s cash van reached the spot and its occupants spotted him, police said.An FIR was registered under sections 380 (theft in dwelling house), 454 (lurking house) and 511 (attempt to commit offences) of Indian Penal Code at Sector 14 police station on the basis of a complaint filed by the company that deposits money in the ATMs. Choudhary, a native of Bihar, was living in a rented accommodation at Chakkarpur village in Gurugram’s Sector 28, police said. As per the FIR, Choudhary had worked in the same firm as an ATM security guard and was identified at the spot by one of the employees, the FIR read.Police said the suspect knew how to disconnect an ATM from its server to disrupt cash flow. “Money withdrawn by a customer is not disbursed in such a situation. The suspect used to switch on the power when the customer left while hiding inside the server rooms. Soon after, the ATM disbursed money which he used to steal,” a police officer privy to the case said.Satender Singh, station house officer (SHO) of Sector 14 police station, said that a duplicate key of the server room lock was also recovered from Choudhary’s possession.“Just before being caught, the suspect had successfully disrupted the cash flow of a customer’s withdrawal and was about to steal that money but got caught,” the SHO said, adding that his Chakkarpur accommodation was searched but nothing was found. “Further investigation is on in the case,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugram-man-arrested-for-stealing-money-from-atm-101642876005170.html

22-01-2022||Chandigarh||Tricity buzz: Airport Road hot spot for election offices||With the Punjab assembly elections less than a month away, political parties are pulling out all stops to woo voters. The three main contenders — Congress, Aam Aadmi Party and Shiromani Akali Dal — have set up their election offices in the showrooms, barely 100 metres apart, in Sector 79, Mohali, on Airport Road. The area has become a poll hotspot and the air of festivity is difficult to miss. Outside all three offices, one can find vehicles of supporters parked with tents put up. Tea and snacks are available the whole day long as campaign strategies are chalked out. UT administration, MC staff battling Covid The third Covid wave has taken a toll on the UT administration and the Municipal Corporation of Chandigarh. With several employees, including the UT adviser among senior officials, testing positive over the past fortnight, the functioning of both offices has been hit. Thirty-six employees in the Registration and Licensing Authority alone tested positive. Similarly, several staffers in the departments of UT urban planning, estate office, Chandigarh Housing Board and UT Guest House are recuperating after contracting coronavirus infection. Reality check for Chandigarh cops A Chandigarh Police officer was in for a reality check the other day when a worker sought permission to stay back for the night as it was not safe going home after 5pm. “Sham ko ghar nahi ja sakta, loot hoti hai (I can’t go home now due to snatching),” the worker, a resident of Ram Darbar, said. With three serious crimes against women within a week and now incidents of theft in the evening have raised concerns about the deteriorating law and order in Chandigarh. Do away with inaugural functions in pandemic Even in the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, the UT administration is keen about inaugural functions and media coverage. On January 17, for instance, a media invite was shared by the administration, requesting presence at the inauguration of the Mini Covid Centre managed by Sri Sathya Sai Gramin Jagriti. UT adviser Dharam Pal was to do the honours at the Police Hospital in Sector 26, Chandigarh. Why can’t they do away with the fanfare during a raging pandemic? Covid+ prisoner breaks out of Sector 16 hospital A woman prisoner was admitted to the Government Multi Specialty Hospital, Sector 16, on Friday, after she tested positive for Covid-19. Since the hospital’s prisoner room was already occupied by another infected inmate, the authorities admitted her to normal room. After a few hours, the woman broke open the window and escaped from the hospital. It was a challenge for the police and health department officials to trace her but they finally managed to catch her after three hours. “She was again admitted to the hospital but now we are keeping a strict watch,” said Dr Suman Singh, the director, health services.

The e-Raahgiri Day will be conducted between 10am and 12noon with online yoga sessions, webinars on road safety and air pollution, slogan writing competitions, and live and pre-recorded musical performances, among other such activities. The MCG officials said that due to ongoing Covid-19 restrictions and guidelines, they decided to hold the Raahgiri Day online for the interim.“Due to the spread of Covid-19 and imposition of restrictions related to it, the Raahgiri Day is unlikely to be hosted physically in the near future. Hence, e-Raahgiri is now being organised this Sunday instead of the conventional Raahgiri so that matters such as road safety and air pollution continue to remain an important topic of conversation. People can participate by clicking on the online link https://forms.gle/QtL5dLUcG9Ab9VbT9 to join the e-Raahgiri event,” said SS Rohilla, public relations officer, MCG.Besides the link circulated by the civic body through its twitter handle and social media platforms, residents can also email at info@raahgirifoundation.org or send a message at WhatsApp number 8595064020 for the link.Inspired by the ciclovia movement in Bogota, Colombia, the first Raahgiri Day in Gurugram was held in November 2013 near the Galleria market in DLF Phase 4. Aimed at reclaiming streets from vehicles, in a conventional Raahgiri event, entry of automobiles is completely forbidden for several hours on a particular stretch. Instead, cycling, walking, and skating are promoted along with activities such as yoga, street plays, pottery, flash mob, and painting competitions.“To promote physical and mental health during these tough times, we are organising activities similar to the conventional Raahgiri via an online platform so that residents can participate from their respective households. Besides providing physical activities, awareness on key issues such as road safety, air pollution as well as entertainment activities have been planned for the pilot online event,” said Shubhra Puri, trustee, Raahgiri Foundation.The last Raahgiri Day was held on November 28 last year at Tulip Chowk located on the sectors 69-70 dividing road.
22-01-2022||Noida||Four persons arrested after exchange of fire in Noida’s Sector 62||Noida police on Saturday afternoon arrested four persons after an exchange of fire in Sector 62 and recovered stolen valuables, weapons, and a car from their possession.Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP) Noida, said that the Sector 58 police on Saturday received information about the movement of some suspects in a white Maruti Suzuki SX4 car near Jaipuria Crossing in Noida’s Sector 62. “A police team signalled them to stop for checking but they opened fire and tried to escape. The team chased the suspects and forced them to stop. In the exchange of fire, two suspects – Arjun Kumar, 25, from Pratapgarh and Mithlesh Kumar, 26, from Madhya Pradesh – received bullet injuries and were arrested,” he said. Two other suspects – Zubair Ahmad, 24, from Daryaganj in Delhi, and Sunil Kumar, 26, from Siwan in Bihar – managed to escape. However, they were later arrested during a combing exercise, police said. Rajneesh Verma, assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Noida, said that the police recovered four countrymade guns, eight live cartridges, three used cartridges, ₹4,600 in cash, a stolen smartphone, and a bag from their possession. The four suspects lived in a room in New Friends Colony in Delhi, he added. Verma said that on Saturday morning, one Satyajeet Kumar, 35, a resident of Vijay Nagar in Ghaziabad, filed a complaint at Sector 58 police station saying that on Friday evening he was waiting in Noida’s Sector 62 for a bus bound for Anand Vihar when the four suspects offered him a lift in their car. “Satyajeet was on his way to Bihar and was carrying some goods for his family. The suspects snatched his valuables, mobile phone and purse, and dumped him on the way,” the ACP said. The police registered a complaint against the suspects under Section 392 (robbery) of the Indian Penal Code.The police team scanned CCTV footage in nearby areas and identified the car used in the crime. “On Saturday, the suspects were in Noida when they were arrested,” Verma said.

22-01-2022||Noida||Noida traffic police develop integrated mechanism to check accidents, improve road safety||The Noida traffic police released a new integrated mechanism to check accidents and improve road safety in the district on Saturday. Ganesh Prasad Saha, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Gautam Budh Nagar, said this new initiative integrates several police services. “When there is an accident, locals or the victim first dial 112 to inform the police. The Dial 112 vehicles, which swiftly reach accident spots, will now inform ambulances and fire tenders, whenever needed. The victims can also dial 108 for ambulances and 102 for fire services. The police team will also inform the traffic department and a team will reach the spot and photograph or videograph the spot and try to find the reason that led to the accident,” he said. The traffic police will feed the data in the Integrated Road Accident Database (iRAD) mobile app for analysis and possible solutions to the problems. The iRAD mobile application is an initiative of the ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH), which aims to improve road safety across the country. The DCP said that sometimes locals spot accidents and are the first responders. “But some people still hesitate to help accident victims fearing questioning by the police. We want to assure people that they will not be unnecessarily questioned,” he said.Earlier, the government would reward good samaritans ₹2,000 for helping the victims during “golden hour”--the one hour following a traumatic injury during which there is the highest likelihood of preventing death. Saha said that in October last year, the ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) revised this amount to ₹5,000.The police officer said the traffic department is also pasting reflective tapes at accident-prone areas for safety reasons. “This is important as fog reduces visibility during winter,” the DCP said. Gautam Budh Nagar’s Dial 112 service comprises a fleet of 66 four-wheel police response vehicles (PRVs) and 60 two-wheelers to attend emergency calls. On average, PRVs reach the accident/crime spots in 6.09 minutes in urban areas and 7.58 minutes in rural areas in Gautam Budh Nagar. The district police department recorded 368 deaths due to 798 accidents last year as compared to 2020, when 380 people died in 740 accidents in the district. In 2021, 504 people were injured in these accidents while in 2020, 528 people were injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-traffic-police-develop-integrated-mechanism-to-check-accidents-improve-road-safety-101642875583869.html
22-01-2022||Other||Gurugram: Cold wave conditions may continue for two days||The city residents woke up to a wet morning on Saturday with most parts receiving light rainfall throughout the day. The overcast sky and a wind speed of around 35 to 40km per hour added to the chill, with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicting that the cold wave conditions are likely to continue for the next two days. The IMD’s Chandigarh centre also predicted thunderstorm and lightning over south Haryana, including Gurugram and Faridabad. According to IMD, Gurugram recorded 7.4mm of rainfall over the past 24 hours. Manmohan Singh, director at Met centre, Chandigarh, said that there are chances of rains on Sunday as well in Gurugram due to the western disturbance. “Temperature is going to dip for the next two days before it moves towards normal. All precautions should be taken against cold weather and fog,” he said. On Saturday, Gurugram recorded the maximum temperature at 16.5°C, which was five degrees less than normal, said the IMD. The minimum temperature was recorded at 10.8°C, five degrees above normal. Meanwhile, many residents preferred to stay indoors as the rain lashed the city even in the late evening. “The chilly weather has made life difficult. We preferred to postpone our visit to a mall for shopping this weekend,” said Shalu Thakur, a resident of Palam Vihar. However, the rains failed to improve the air quality of Gurugram. According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s 4pm bulletin, the air quality in the city remained in the ‘very poor’ category, with an air quality index of 304, a slight rise from Friday’s AQI reading of 302. “Due to the strong thermal inversion and low temperatures, particles are concentrated in lower atmosphere. Moisture is also holding up in lower atmosphere. All these factors are not good enough to improve AQI to poor category or moderate category,” said Sachin Panwar, a city-based air quality expert.

22-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi Police bust illegal firearms manufacturing unit in UP’s Aligarh||An illegal firearms manufacturing unit, which produced four to five illicit pistols every day and supplied nearly 1,000 to criminals in Delhi and adjoining states in a year, was busted in a residential colony in Uttar Pradesh’s Aligarh by the Delhi Police, senior city police officers aware of the development said on Saturday. One of the alleged manufacturers of the illicit firearms was arrested from the factory along with 19 prepared and semi-finished pistols, apart from raw materials and tools used in manufacturing of such weapons, they said.The illegal firearms factory was busted following interrogation of a notorious gunrunner, Shakil alias Sherni, who was arrested on Monday evening following a gunfight with a team of the special staff of outer-north district police in Delhi’s Rohini. Police seized 14 pistols and 38 cartridges from Shakil. The seized consignment of arms and ammunition was to be delivered to the members of a gang led by fugitive gangster Kapil Sangwan alias Nandu and another gang named “Sisodia gang”, said deputy commissioner of police (outer-north) Brijendra Kumar Yadav.DCP Yadav said that the special staff team interrogated Shakil to ascertain the source from where he had procured the illegal weapons. Shakil revealed that he had purchased the pistols from an illegal manufacturing unit in Aligarh. The police team obtained Shakil’s police remand and accompanied him to a shop in a residential neighbourhood in SaraiMan Singh near Maya Chowk in Aligarh. The shop was raided and Ravi Mahor was caught manufacturing illegal firearms. Another manufacturer managed to flee.“Several raw materials used in the manufacturing of firearms were recovered such as barrels, triggers, body of firearms along with lathe machine, bits used in the machine and other equipments were recovered. Also, 9 unfinished firearms and 10 finished country made pistols were also recovered,” said DCP Yadav.A police officer who was part of the operation said that the firearm manufacturing unit was running in the residential colony for the past some years. The illegal activity was done in a covert manner as the shop was actually given the design of a scrap and lathe machine-related workshop.“The arrested man Ravi Mahor is also involved in a rape case. His uncle Mukesh was also present at the shop at the time of the raid. But he managed to escape. Mahor disclosed that four to five pistols were manufactured daily. On an average, they produced 1000 illicit firearms and sold them to criminals in Delhi and other states through gunrunners like Shakil,” said an investigator.Police said they were trying to identify the person who ran the manufacturing unit. They were also trying to establish if killed arms manufacturers from Bihar’s Munger and West Bengal were employed there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-bust-illegal-firearms-manufacturing-unit-in-up-s-aligarh-101642875223701.html
22-01-2022||Lucknow||23 Muslims, 13 OBCs on BSP’s new list of 51 candidates in Uttar Pradesh||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati on Saturday released the party’s list of 51 more candidates for the Uttar Pradesh (UP) assembly elections. These candidates have been named for the state’s Rohilkhand region where polling will be held on 55 seats in nine districts on February 14.Twenty-three of these candidates are Muslims, 13 belong to the other backward classes (OBCs), 10 are Dalits and five upper castes. There are three women on the list.The names of the candidates for the remaining four seats (of the second phase) will be announced later, said a BSP leader. The prominent candidates fielded by the BSP include Noman Masood from Gangoh in Saharanpur district, Ruchi Vira from Bijnor and Mamta Shakya from Bilsi seat in Badaun district. So far, the BSP has named 109 candidates — 58 for the first phase of polling and 51 for the second.Mayawati also unveiled her party’s slogan for the 2022 UP assembly election — “Har polling booth ko jitana hain, BSP ko satta mein lana hain (The party must win on all booths to come back to power).”The BSP had earlier released the first list of candidates on January 15, party chief Mayawati’s birthday.For the first phase, the party has named four women and there are three for the second phase, taking the total to seven women candidates overall.For the 58 first-phase seats, the BSP named 16 Muslim candidates, 18 OBCs, nine Dalits and 15 upper castes.Overall, the BSP has named 39 Muslims, 31 OBCs, 19 Dalits and 20 upper castes.By giving tickets to a large number of Muslim candidates, Mayawati has intensified the fight for Muslim votes among the Samajwadi Party (SP), the BSP the Congress and the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul- Muslimeen (AIMIM) led by Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi, said SK Srivastava, a political observer.In the 2017 assembly election, the BSP failed to open its account in the Rohilkhand region while the SP bagged 15 seats. The Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) won 38 seats and the Congress two seats in the region. The SP was the runner-up on 21 assembly seats and the BSP was second on 11 seats. There is a large concentration of Muslim voters in these nine districts of the Rohilkhand region namely Saharanpur, Bijnor, Amroha, Sambhal, Moradabad, Rampur, Bareilly, Badaun and Shahjahanpur.Riding on the Muslim-Dalit formula, the BSP bagged a majority of the region’s seats in the 2007 assembly election when it also won power in the state.In the 2012 assembly elections, the SP won a majority of the seats on the strength of its Muslim-backward alliance. It also formed the government in UP with a majority of its own that year. In the 2017 assembly elections, the BJP made a dent in the backward and Dalit vote base of the SP and the BSP to capture 38 assembly seats, Srivastava said. The BJP alone won 312 seats in the 403-member assembly five years ago.The Muslim votes will be decisive for the SP, BSP, Congress and AIMIM candidates in the 2022 assembly election, he said. Fifty-eight seats in 11 districts of western UP will go to polls in the first phase on February 10. The filing of nominations for the first phase seats concluded on January 21, the same date on which the nomination process commenced for the second phase seats.The 11 districts that will go to polls in the first phase are: Shamli, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Baghpat, Ghaziabad, Hapur, Gautam Buddha Nagar (Noida), Bulandshahr, Aligarh, Mathura and Agra. Uttar Pradesh goes to polls in seven phases between February 10 and March 7 to elect 403 lawmakers. The results will be announced on March 10.

The arrested man befriended the women through various matrimonial websites and collected their objectionable videos and images after promising to marry them. A mobile phone containing many such videos and photographs was recovered from him, they said.Deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram said that the suspect, Sahil Sachdeva, was arrested on Friday from south Delhi’s Neb Sarai, following investigation into a case filed by a woman from whom he had extorted ₹2 lakh using the same modus operandi. The woman in her complaint said that in October last year, she met him through a matrimonial site. He introduced himself to her as Sahil Sachdeva having B.Tech and MBA degrees and employed.“Sachdeva made false promises to marry her. On his assurance, they started building their relationship.

22-01-2022||Delhi||85% in the 15-18 age group in Delhi’s govt schools have received Covid vaccine: Govt||Around 85% students of Delhi government schools in the age group of 15-18 years had received the first dose of the vaccine till January 21, the government said on Saturday. While appreciating the speed at which inoculation was being conducted in government schools, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Saturday said that 100% vaccination of students will help the government in making the shift from ongoing online education to offline classes. He said that a proposal for the reopening of schools could be placed before the DDMA.“In 12 out of the 15 education districts, 85% students of Delhi government schools have been vaccinated and there are about 300 schools where 90% eligible students have got the jab,” said Sisodia, who holds the education portfolio. He said that vaccination was key for combatting covid and called for all eligible students to be vaccinated at the earliest. “Now that the covid cases are declining considerably and most of the students in higher classes have been inoculated, a proposal may be placed before DDMA for reopening of schools,” he added.In a written statement issued on Saturday, the government also said that vaccination in private schools was taking place slowly with only 42% of eligible students have received the vaccine till January 21. “Except East Delhi district, private schools have failed to achieve even 50% vaccination coverage. Private schools have about 3.5 lakh eligible students for COVID vaccination, but not even 2 lakhs have been vaccinated till date. Even aided schools haven’t fared well. So far only 57% of students have been vaccinated in aided schools,” the government said. The Directorate of Education (DoE) has set a target of 100% vaccination till January 30. In a circular issued to schools on Saturday, DoE said that out of 8,07, 738 eligible students of government schools, 6, 80, 210, had been already vaccinated which was roughly 84.21%. The DoE added that 1,27, 528 students of government schools in the eligible category were yet to be vaccinated. The department also underlined that vaccination of the entire eligible student population was vital to any proposal of reopening of schools. It directed officials to persuade private schools to amp their vaccination efforts for achieving the 100% vaccination goal since they were lagging behind, the DoE said. “Heads of these schools may be contacted personally and through the zonal DDEs and authentic data may be obtained from them so that we have accurate numbers of the vaccinated and the remaining students of these schools to work on,” the DoE stated in its circular. Sudha Acharya, chairperson of the National Progressive School’s Conference, which has over 120 private Delhi schools as its members, admitted that private schools needed to accelerate their vaccination efforts. “While our school and some others have achieved around 80% vaccination, there are other schools that need to amplify their efforts to increase their vaccination numbers. Various reasons could be behind the lag in vaccinations. Some parents are hesitant while other schools are not able to put their full efforts due to school closure. Collectively we all are trying to vaccinate our student population so that schools can be reopened at the earliest,” said Acharya, principal of ITL Public School, Dwarka. Bharat Arora, general secretary, Action Committee of Unaided Private Schools, a consortium of schools, said that more than 60% of eligible students in private schools had been vaccinated and sough that schools are reopened. “Private schools in Delhi have been very proactive in organising vaccination camps and awareness sessions to achieve maximum vaccination of eligible students. The entire school fraternity is working tirelessly to support the government in achieving 100% vaccination target. Some schools have already achieved 85-90% vaccination target. The government should reopen schools since students have been facing major learning losses for around two years now,” said Arora.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/85-in-the-15-18-age-group-in-delhi-s-govt-schools-have-received-covid-vaccine-govt-101642874803700.html

22-01-2022||Lucknow||Amit Shah raises exodus issue in Kairana||Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday launched a door-to-door campaign from the teachers’ colony in Kairana in western Uttar Pradesh (UP) and raised the issue of “palayan (Hindu exodus)” during the Samajwadi Party (SP) rule. He stated that those who were forced to leave earlier have now started returning under the BJP rule. Amit Shah was seen distributing pamphlets carrying information about various welfare schemes that were launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Yogi Adityanath. He also visited a 70-year-old sweet shop in the Gumbad locality of Kairana where he met those who had to migrate with family. “This is my first visit to Kairana since January 2014. I see a sea change. All welfare schemes by Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji have been implemented by CM Yogi Adityanath till the grass roots level. It’s the same Kairana from where people were migrating earlier. Today, I interacted with many of those who had migrated earlier. I met all the 11 family members of the Mittal family. All of them said that CM Yogi improved the law and order situation and they have no fear. That’s why I say that those who made the people migrate have now migrated themselves,” Amit Shah said. The BJP had won 312 seats in 2017 UP polls. The party has fielded Mriganka Singh, daughter of BJP veteran the late Hukum Singh, from Kairana. “If we have to maintain this law-and-order situation, end appeasement and the practice of governments to work for one caste and we have to develop the state under the leadership of PM Modi, then we have to once again help set up a majority BJP government under CM Yogi Adityanath,” Amit Shah said. “In west UP, elections begin on February 10. With folded hands, I want to appeal to all the voters of west UP that if due to Covid-19, our cadres are unable to reach you, all of you should go out to vote early to help set up a BJP government with a massive majority for the next five years,” Amit Shah said. He said this was necessary for all the hard work done by UP BJP government over the past five years and the efforts put in by PM Modi to better the lives of the people over the past seven years. “In all of west UP, whether they are sugarcane farmers, labourers, the poor, traders or the middle class or those residing in Noida, all of them are saying one thing — “iss baar bhajapa phir 300 paar (this time BJP will again cross 300 seats).” Amit Shah said a new wave of development was witnessed since the BJP came to power.“Many roads, airports, medical colleges. The poor got toilets, electricity and cooking gas, too, along with PM’s free medical insurance scheme. During the corona period, free vaccines and free ration were provided to the poor,” Amit Shah said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/amit-shah-raises-exodus-issue-in-kairana-101642874263841.html
22-01-2022||Lucknow||Magh Mela: Intermittent rise in Ganga a challenge for Kalpavasis, seers||After showing an increasing trend for the past three days, the level of the Ganga became stable on Saturday thereby providing some relief to a sizable number of seers and Kalpavasis staying in their Magh Mela camps and devotees coming to the annual religious fair. Mela administration is constantly monitoring the situation and providing all help to the affected devotees. The volume of river water, which in previous years has been quite shallow and in fact prompted the Allahabad high court to intervene and ask the authorities concerned to release extra water in the Ganga, is this time flowing 107 cm more than last year as on Friday due to which water has entered a number of Magh Mela camps and thereby creating problems to camping Kalpavasis and seers.Although, on Saturday, the level of water came down a bit but is expected to again start rising following release of more water from Ganga barrage of Kanpur. The increased level of water has caused erosion of river banks and water from Ganga is entering into the camps of sector 2 and 3 of the tent city. While people were shifted to safer places, authorities are also putting up sand bags to check the erosion of the banks by the strong currents of the Ganga. Divisional commissioner Sanjay Goyal along with officiating mela adhikari Arvind Kumar Chauhan and others took stock of the situation and instructed the authorities to provide solution to the problems arising out of the rise in the Ganga.The irrigation department has been ordered to check the water entering the mela area at Gangdweep, Sector 2, Sector 3 and other affected sites of the tent city. The divisional commissioner has also asked for an increase in the number of manpower, tractors and pumps to remove the water from the affected area. During the inspection, Goyal also expressed his displeasure over the slow action being taken by the officials of the Jal Nigam. He has directed all the officers concerned to pour more sand in the affected areas and to drain out the water continuously by installing more pumps.“Due to the rise in water level, the process of shifting all the affected 44 institutions and Prayagwals of Gangadweep to Sector 5 and to provide all the basic facilities has already started. But as many devotees do not want to shift to Sector 5, we are taking a written consent from those who do not want to move despite being provided with all the basic facilities”, said the Mela Adhikari.Commenting on the rising Ganga water, head of the geography department, Allahabad University, and weather expert prof AR Siddiqui said, “It is because of the heavy rainfall in the Himalayan region and as farmers do not use much water in their fields owing to rains along with low usage of water for irrigation during Rabi crops, the volume of water in Ganga is fairly more this time around.” Executive engineer at flood control department, Brijesh Kumar Verma said, “We are keeping a constant watch on the level of water in both the Ganga and the Yamuna and fortunately the water level is stable for the moment”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/magh-mela-intermittent-rise-in-ganga-a-challenge-for-kalpavasis-seers-101642873004055.html

22-01-2022||Lucknow||Cong to launch ‘speak up’ drive for youths on Bose’s birth anniv||The Congress will on Sunday (January 23) launch its “speak up” campaign for the youth to register themselves for a job in accordance with the party’s youth manifesto “Bharti Vidhan” that senior leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra released in New Delhi on Friday.Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) media department chairman Naseemuddin Siddiqui, while speaking to media persons, said the campaign to register the youth would be launched on the occasion of birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose on Sunday. He said the youth would also express their views on the party’s youth manifesto and their experiences during the previous regimes.Siddiqui said Congress and National Students’ Union of India’s (NSUI) workers would set up stalls at different places to get the registration forms filled by the eligible youth and give them an employment registration number. He said the Congress’ youth manifesto was a document of hopes and aspirations for seven crore youths of Uttar Pradesh.Siddiqui used the occasion to target the BJP government for “plight of youths” following paper leaks and claimed that the examination papers had been leaked for 12 times so far. He said the youth camped in big cities like Prayagraj, Lucknow, Kanpur, Meerut and Jhansi to study and prepare for competitive examinations. He said after taking the exams, they realise that the examination question paper was leaked. He said the students have to wait for results of examination papers too for long time if examination is conducted.Meanwhile, UPCC president Ajay Kumar Lallu targeted chief minister Yogi Adityanath for the latter’s claims that the Mafia was fleeing the state due to actions of police. He alleged that in reality the criminals were having a field day in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/cong-to-launch-speak-up-drive-for-youths-on-bose-s-birth-anniv-101642872163565.html
22-01-2022||Lucknow||UP polls: AIMIM bets on Prayagraj’s past of favouring ‘women in trouble’||Hyderabad Lok Sabha MP Asaduddin Owaisi-led All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM)’s decision to field Mafioso-turned-politician Atiq Ahmad’s wife Shaista Parveen from Allahabad west seat in 2022 UP assembly polls is a well thought out move as Prayagraj district has a history of electing women facing personal challenges as their representatives, say poll analysts.They point out if Prayagraj has many second and third generation politicians taking forward their families’ political legacies, there are also many women leaders too who have jumped into the poll fray amidst tough personal circumstances and emerged victorious from different assembly seats. Some of such women leaders include Samajwadi Party’s former MLAs Vijma Yadav and Pooja Pal, both of whom entered politics after the murder of their husbands, besides Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Neelam Karwaria, who contested and won the polls from Meja seat after her husband Udhaybhan Karwaria had to go to jail as an accused in the murder case of former MLA Jawahar Yadav aka Pandit, husband of Vijma Yadav, they say.“The name of Vijma Yadav comes at the top in terms of such examples. After the murder of her husband Jawahar Yadav aka Pandit on August 13, 1996, Vijma Yadav was fielded from her husband’s seat of Jhunsi assembly seat by the Samajwadi Party and emerged victorious. After that, she again represented Jhunsi in 2002 and then Pratappur seat in 2012. However, in 2017 she lost the Pratappur seat,” says prof MP Dube, political scientist and former vice chancellor of Uttar Pradesh Rajarshi Tandon Open University (UPRTOU), Prayagraj.“Similar is the story of Pooja Pal. After the murder of Raju Pal, the then sitting MLA from Allahabad west seat on January 25, 2005, his wife Pooja Pal entered politics and fought from the seat in 2005 by-polls but lost. However, in 2007 elections as a BSP candidate at the age of 27 she bagged the seat. After that, in the 2012 elections too, she defeated Mafioso-turned-politician Atiq Ahmed to get elected from her husband’s seat. But, in 2017 she lost the elections from Allahabad west polling third. Recently she shifted to the SP,” prof Dube added.Prof Dube said a similar case was seen in the 2017 elections when Neelam Karwaria, the wife of jailed former MLA Udaybhan Karwaria, contested and reached the state assembly after being elected from her husband’s Meja seat. “Presently, Neelam Karwaria is the only woman MLA out of 12 assembly constituencies in the district,” he added.So at a time when ex-MP Atiq Ahmad and his brother Khalid Azim aka Ashraf are in jail and Ahmad’s two sons are on the run, AIMIM fielding a woman claiming that the state government is targeting her family may strike a chord with the voters, especially from Allahabad west seat having a sizable number of Muslim voters and from where both Atiq and Ashraf between them have won six assembly polls, poll analysts opine.
22-01-2022||Lucknow||Amit Shah back to set the poll narrative from western UP||After targeting the opposition camp with the “NIZAM” jibe during his first-round electioneering in western Uttar Pradesh (UP) in December, Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday launched the second phase of the poll campaign from Kairana. Kairana is a western UP town from where BJP had first flagged the “palayan” (Hindu exodus issue). More recently, amid growing criticism from the BJP, the Samajwadi Party was forced to replace its Kairana candidate Nahid Hasan with his sister Iqra. The step was taken after Hasan was arrested under the Gangsters Act, a development that provided fresh ammunition to the ruling party to target the SP.All top BJP leaders have trained their guns on the SP for fielding “tainted candidates”. The BJP leaders who have led the attack include chief minister Yogi Adityanath, deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya, Union minister Anurag Thakur, state BJP chief Swatantra Dev and former UP DGP Brij Lal, now the BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP.“The first candidate on the SP list was Nahid Hasan, who is now in jail. While they field such candidates, we have fielded honest officers like IPS Asim Arun and that’s why we say farq saaf hai (the difference is clear),” said Thakur. “The SP list shows its character. After their first list, the SP has now developed cold feet,” Yogi Adityanath has been stating. Deputy CM Maurya has said that replacing a tainted candidate with a family member was unacceptable too.Back in 2017, with AMit Shah as BJP chief, the party had gone into the elections targeting the SP with the slogan “na goondaraj, na bhrastachar bhajapa layegi aisi sarkaar (no hooliganism, no corruption, such will be BJP government).” Now, after five years in power, Amit Shah is back again to set the narrative, targeting the SP to strike down its campaign to unseat the BJP. In December, Amit Shah while campaigning for the BJP, pitched the Yogi Adityanath government as one that had ended the rule of “bahubalis (strongmen)”. He had made this point during his “Jan Vishwas” rallies in Aligarh and Moradabad.“Now, there are no bahubalis in UP. There is only Bajrangbali now,” Amit Shah had said. Bajrangbali is a Hindu god. Amit Shah had also set the poll pitch with his NIZAM jibe at his opponents. “Nizam means rule. So, during the pre-BJP days, NIZAM, especially that of the SP, meant N for Naseemuddin, I for Imran Masood, AZ for Azam Khan and M for Mukhtar Ansari,” he had said. Shah, who is widely credited for tapping the Modi wave to script BJP’s spectacular success in UP in 2017 (when he was the party’s UP in-charge), had also coined triple P – “parivarwad (dynastic rule), pakhshpat (favoritism) and palayan (exodus)” – to target the Samajwadi Party. He had pitched the BJP as a party with triple Vs – “vikas (development), vyapar (trade) and virasat (cultural heritage),” Amit Shah had said. “Amit Shah does his homework before undertaking any task. Naturally, this choice of Kairana wasn’t coincidental,” a senior BJP leader said. This BJP leader also recalled how Shah had spent months in UP fine-tuning the party’s strategy.“Passion and commitment are synonymous with Shah. As the UP in-charge, he kept a strong grip on the narrative, toured extensively, stayed in the state for months and operated from a rented accommodation. This time, too, despite his pressing responsibilities as the Union home minister, he has held nearly 15 rallies and road shows in phase 1 of the UP campaign. He is now back again to work for the party’s cause,” the leader said. In his previous campaigns in the 2014 Lok Sabha election, Amit Shah had also flagged the issue of appeasement with a cleverly crafted line. “Amit ka haq Anwar ko kyon (why should Anwar grab what is Amit’s due),” he had said. Now, in the 2022 UP polls, Shah’s selection of Kairana to launch phase two of the campaign has its own meaning, political experts say.It’s from Kairana that the BJP veteran the late Hukum Singh had flagged the “palayan” (Hindu exodus) issue. It became a key BJP plank in the 2017 UP elections. Five years later, the issue is still being raised in the 2022 UP polls but with a difference. “I am coming here for the first time since 2014 January and today, I can say that palayan karane wale hi palayan kar gaye (those behind the exodus have run away now),” Amit Shah said during his door-to-door campaign in this constituency from where BJP has fielded Hukum Singh’s daughter Mriganka.She was present with Amit Shah during the door-to-door contact. The seven-phase UP polls begin from western UP with Kairana among those constituencies where the first phase of polling will be held on February 10.Nearly all the UP BJP leaders prominently flagged the “palayan” issue on Saturday. The Yogi Adityanath government has said that families who had fled Kairana have started to return. The chief minister, while campaigning in Bulandshahr, roughly two hours’ drive from the place where Shah interacted with families that had returned, said that his government had poured cold water on the plans of those who were dreaming of turning “Kairana into a Kashmir.” Since Saturday morning, hours before Amit Shah landed in Kairana, BJP leaders, including Adityanath, deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya and UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev, both OBC leaders, had begun raising the issue of “palayan”. Some political experts believe the issue also played a part in Hindus voting as one rather than on caste lines in 2017.

As schools had reopened offline for these students in the past two months, they attended at least one practicals practice in campus. Harishchandra Gaikwad, president, Pune District Headmaster Association, said, “Even though the offline practice has not been continuous, students got the opportunity to attend practice in schools for a while. It is difficult to teach all subject practicals offline in a month when they are expected to be completed in a year. However, students could practice at least a little bit when schools were briefly reopened.” Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) has decided to conduct final examination offline from March 15 onwards. For practicals, schools can schedule Class 10 exams post January 25 and Class 12 exams post February 4. Sneha Waghmare, a Class 10 student, said that she would need one more practice session offline. “We have covered all important practicals offline. But one more session would be helpful before the final exam,” said Waghmare. “Many schools have conducted revision, updated notebooks and projects by students offline. However, practical material from the Board has not reached schools. Also, external faculty that conduct practicals and oral exams are also not appointed yet. In the next few days, external teachers may be appointed,” said Gaikwad. Medha Sinnarkar, principal, Laxmanrao Apte Prashala, said, “Like every year, we will conduct practical exams and oral exams of language on the same day for students. This way, we can call 15 to 20 children to school and follow Covid-appropriate norms. Students of Class 10 and Class 12 are eager to practice and clarify their doubts in school.” She said that students would be able to practice for practicals if offline classes resume as students need one more round of practice. “We had scheduled school practicals on February 2 and February 3. We are hopeful that there won’t be any need to postpone the dates. We can start making batches for the exam as soon as we receive material and numbers from the board,” said Sinnarkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/state-board-schools-and-students-gear-up-for-offline-practical-exams-101642868563427.html
22-01-2022||Lucknow||UP teachers association demand life cover of ₹1 cr for govt school staff engaged in poll duty||The Uttar Pradesh Primary Teachers association has demanded life insurance cover of ₹1 crore for every government school staff who will be engaged in election duty during upcoming UP assembly polls.In a letter dated January 22 to Chief Election Commissioner (CEC), president of the association Dinesh Chandra Sharma said, “Life insurance of ₹ 1 cr should be provided to every school staff involved in poll duty. In case of any eventuality from Covid-19 infection within 30 days of poll duty, compensation can be given to the kin of government school staff along with a job.”In panchayat poll held last year, the state government had given compensation to 2200 government staff, including 1100 from primary schools.To ensure that school staff get a chance to exercise their voting rights, appropriate arrangement should be made at block or tehsil levels, Sharma said and demanded that in case both husband and wife were in government job only one should be deployed in poll duty.The association also suggested that a week-long quarantine leave be provided to every school staff soon after they return from election duty. Sharma suggested that pregnant women, physically challenged, staff battling terminal diseases must not be deployed in election duty. During the panchayat poll in UP last year, at least two pregnant government school teachers died of Covid 19.To ensure teachers safety, the association suggested that all Covid-19 protocols should be strictly adhered to during training, transit and at polling stations. Scared after hundreds of government school staff succumbed during panchayat election duty after getting infected with Covid-19, he said, “The EC should take measures to ensure safety of government school staff from getting the viral infection during election period. Masks, sanitizers and gloves should be provided to every school staff on polling duty.”

22-01-2022||Mumbai||Mumbai’s temperature to drop after unseasonal showers||Mumbai Following light and unseasonal rains in parts of the city on Saturday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that temperatures will dip steeply over the next few days. Between January 23 and 25, the daytime maximum temperature is expected to drop to around 25 degrees Celsius on Sunday, and the nighttime minimum temperature is expected to hover around 14 degrees Celsius.Isolated drizzles across the city on Saturday marked the second instance of unseasonal rain this month. The showers were attributed to the passage of a western disturbance, and an induced cyclonic circulation over Rajasthan.Officials in IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai said that these weather systems will draw moisture from the Arabian Sea and cause widespread, though mild, showers across parts of North and Central India and over parts of the Konkan and Northern Madhya Maharashtra.As per official forecasts, the next three days in Mumbai, Palghar, Raigad, Ratnagiri, Nashik, Dhule, Jalgaon and Pune are likely to be marked by cool, strong winds and cloudy skies with a chance of thunderstorms. “But the chances of rain will remain extremely low on Sunday and Monday. Temperatures will also remain low for at least two-three days after the influence of the Western disturbance subsides, because of moisture. Warm conditions will return closer to next weekend,” said an official from IMD Mumbai.On Saturday, Mumbai recorded a maximum temperature of 29.7 degrees Celsius (one degree below normal) and a minimum of 19.8 degrees Celsius (three degrees above normal), as per IMD’s weather station in Santacruz.

22-01-2022||Patna||Bihar offers 200 acres for Vikramshila central university, awaits Centre’s nod||Seven years on, the proposed central university near the ancient seat of learning in Vikramshila (Bhagalpur), announced as part of the ₹1,25,000-crore special package for Bihar by Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of the 2015 assembly elections, awaits land acquisition to get closer to reality. The Bihar government had offered three sites for the proposed university and the a committee headed by the then Vice-Chancellor of Central University of South Bihar, HCS Rathore, had visited the sites last year and submitted a preliminary report in March 2021 itself regarding one of them. However, there has been no forward movement since then. Bihar’s education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary said the government has identified around 200 acres of land and sent a proposal to the Centre. “For central university, the demand was for 500 acres, which is difficult to find. We have sent a proposal of over 200 acres and await Centre’s response. Once the Centre’s nod comes, we will initiate the process for acquisition,” he said.The matter was also raised in the Rajya Sabha during the winter session by Sushil Kumar Modi, Bihar’s former deputy chief minister, who sought to know when the Centre would take a decision on the committee’s report and convey the same to the State Government.In a written reply, the Centre said that the action in such matters are taken as per established procedure of the government. Once land is made available, the Centre will take up infrastructure development for starting academic activities. “The PM package for Bihar, 2015, provides for establishment of a new central university near Bhagalpur at the historic site of Vikramshila University. The government of Bihar has offered the site for the proposed university and a preliminary report has been submitted,” said Union minister of state for education Dr Subhas Sarkar had said.Rathore had earlier said that he had given a positive interim report to the Centre pertaining to suitability of land shown to the committee. “The 282-acre plot identified by the Bihar government should be sufficient to start with, but land acquisition has to be completed. It is four kilometres from the ancient site. The decision has to be taken by the Centre,” he said.Bhagalpur district magistrate Subrat Kumar Sen said that three plots close to the ancient site of Vikramshila had been shown to the committee, which visited the place. “Once we get any communication from the Bihar government and the required funds, the acquisition process will be started,” he said.Bihar’s glorious history in the sphere of education is marked by two great institutions, Nalanda and Vikramshila universities, both of which predate Oxford and Cambridge. Though the revival of Nalanda has been on and the campus is being developed close to the ancient site, the ruins of Vikramshila located near Antichak village in the Kahalgaon subdivision of Bhagalpur have remained neglected for decades.Land has been a major problem for central universities in Bihar. The Central University of South Bihar (CUSB) was provided land by the defence ministry from its abandoned airfield in Panchanpur (Gaya), while for the Mahatma Gandhi Central University (Motihari), the wait for its own permanent campus is getting longer and it is still operating from a makeshift campus.“We have got just 135 acres of land, but that is in two parts, while another 165 acres is yet to be handed over. As a result, the detailed project report cannot be made. Out of the 135 acres also, one part is around 35 acres and another of 100 acres, while the land between them is yet to acquired and handed over. The university, started six years ago, has around 1,400 students and it will only increase if there is required infrastructure. Any work can start only after land is cleared,” said a senior official of the Mahatma Gandhi Central University.

Home secretary K Senthil Kumar, additional director general (ADG) of police (law and order) Sanjay Singh and inspector general of police (prohibition) Amrit Raj visited Chapra on Saturday and took stock of the situation.ADG Singh said the deaths prima facie were because of hooch. “However, some deaths have also been reported due to cold,” he said.Saran’s superintendent of police (SP) Santosh Kumar said a special investigation team (SIT) has been formed to probe the deaths. “In areas under Amanuar and Maker police stations, where most of the alleged hooch deaths took place, we have constituted separate teams,” he said.Kumar said 158 people have been arrested so far.Meanwhile, Lok Janshakti Party (Ramvilas) chief Chirag Paswan visited Amnaur and met with the victims’ families. Talking to reporters, Chirag said his party has written to Bihar Governor Phagu Chauhan, urging him to recommend President’s Rule in Bihar to prevent such tragedies.

The list of seats announced on Saturday by the party’s national president Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh included Rohaniya, which falls in the Varanasi Lok Sabha seat represented by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. JD (U), however, did not name the candidates for the seats announced on Saturday. “Names would be announced by JD(U)’s Uttar Pradesh unit president Anoop Patel as there are multiple claimants. The party has also authorized him to announce more seats from where the party would contest,” Singh told reporters in New Delhi. JD(U) and BJP are part of the ruling alliance both in Bihar and at the Centre.The JD(U) president minced no words in showing his frustration after being cold-shouldered by BJP on their demand. “We would have fought the Uttar Pradesh polls with more strength and on more seats had we not waited so long after Union minister R C P Singh conveyed that BJP was agreeable to an alliance,” he said in an oblique attack on union minister who also belongs to JD(U). Lalan Singh repeatedly mentioned that it was R C P Singh who was authorised by the JD(U) leadership to speak to BJP leaders and that any other person was not part of negotiations.“We waited for so long at the instance of the union minister. Now we are going ahead with the decision to fight the polls independently after BJP president J P Nadda said publicly that his party’s allies in Uttar Pradesh are Apna Dal and Nishad Party and made no mention of JD(U),” said Lalan Singh, who represents Munger parliamentary constituency. He, however, clarified that his party’s decision to fight UP polls independently will have no impact on its ties with the BJP in Bihar. “The JD(U) has fought separately in several state polls,” he said. JD(U)’s national principal general secretary KC Tyagi said list of seats will be released phase-wise . According to Tyagi, who is also party’s UP in-charge, nothing worked out in talks R C P Singh had with several top BJP leaders, including Amit Shah, JP Nadda, Rajnath Singh and Dharmendra Pradhan. Experts say the chasm between BJP and JD (U) and within the JD (U) would increase further after this development. “More than the BJP, the divide within JD (U) is increasing and R C P Singh and party national president are not on the same page simply because Lalan Singh was also eyeing the union cabinet berth,” said professor Gyanendra Yadav of department of sociology at College of Commerce in Patna.

The court observed the allegations that the accused had physical relations with the complainant and got her pregnant on the pretext of marriage were serious.“He forced her for abortion and thereafter refused to marry her. From the First Information Report (FIR) and prosecution’s claims, it reveals that the offence is serious,” said additional sessions judge, l M I Lokwani.The court further observed that the investigation is still in progress and if the applicant is released on bail then it is a possibility that he will pressurise the informant and prosecution witnesses.The FIR said that both the accused and the complainant were working as social media influencers and met in October 2019. Their friendship developed into a relationship and they decided to marry each other.The duo also started living together and the woman alleged that on the pretext of marriage, the accused allegedly had physical relationship with her. The FIR further states that after the complainant became pregnant, the accused compelled her to get an abortion and never spoke about marriage.Therefore, the woman lodged a complaint with the Oshiwara police station.Farooqui’s lawyer RJ Baddam argued that it was a consensual relationship and there was nothing to be recovered from the applicant. “Applicant is ready to cooperate with the police investigations therefore custodial investigation is not required,” he added.Opposing the bail plea, Assistant Public Prosecutor, YD Ambekar contended that the offence was serious. The investigation is still in progress and the medical examination of the applicant was not done, he said.Advocate Ali Kashif Khan Deshmukh, who appeared for the informant woman, objected to the grant of anticipatory bail and argued that custodial interrogation is necessary for a detailed investigation. He also submitted video footage to the court wherein the informant was allegedly beaten by the applicant. “Post FIR, she was threatened by the accused,” the court was told.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/court-refuses-pre-arrest-bail-to-tiktoker-booked-for-raping-girlfriend-101642864427300.html

Disale had applied for six months’ leave to study in the US on a Fulbright DAI scholarship.  A teacher at a Zilla Parshad school in Solapur’s Paritewadi, Disale is the first teacher from India to win the prestigious $1-million Global Teacher Prize for innovation in teaching. After a delay in Disale’s leave approval came to light, the school education minister directed Dilip Swami, the chief executive officer (CEO) of Solapur Zilla Parishad, to approve his application. “Had a chat with Dr. Dilip Swami, CEO Solapur on Global Teacher Prize winner @ranjitdisale leave application for further studies. Have directed that it be approved. The department believes in continued education for not just students but also teachers,” Gaikwad tweeted on Saturday.Disale later thanked the minister for her intervention. Speaking to ABP Majha, Disale said, “I had applied for six months leave on December 14 but it is yet to be approved by the senior officials. The last day to submit the approval for Fulbright DAI is January 25.” He was among the 12,000 educators from 140 countries who were nominated for the prize. The Global Teacher Prize was set up to recognise teachers making outstanding contributions to the profession as well as to shine a spotlight on the important role teachers play in society. In 2015, the Maharashtra government had adopted Disale’s idea and made QR codes available in Balbharti textbooks. Subsequently in 2018, the then Union Human Resource Development minister Prakash Javadekar had announced that all National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) textbooks will have embedded QR codes.Post the win, Disale appeared in Kaun Banega Crorepati’s (KBC) Karamveer episode in December 2020.

Officials said that they had entered the firing range to swim in the water-filled pits.“For obvious reasons, the firing range is situated in a low-lying area, due to which water collects in several deep pits in the ground. The entire area is off limits to civilians, despite which people keep entering. This is the third such case we have seen at the same spot. Earlier, a man had entered the area under the influence of alcohol and drowned in one of the pits, and before that, two minors had drowned while swimming,” Kadam said.The bodies have been handed over to the Vartak Nagar police, who are in the process of registering Accidental Death Reports (ADRs) in connection with the deaths, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/2-teenagers-drown-in-upvan-police-firing-range-in-thane-101642861844000.html

This comes in view of the Punjab assembly polls, and the Republic Day. In Pathankot, Punjab Police’s Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams, an elite commando force specialised for counter terrorism, is carrying out search operations in the border villages. On Saturday, Tarn Taran SSP Gulneet Singh Khurana, along with other senior police officials, took stock of locations on the border, which are considered vulnerable for smuggling of arms, ammunition and drugs, especially with drones emerging as the new threat. In Gurdaspur, Punjab Police teams have been deployed to search fields along the barbed-wire fence and other vulnerable spots. On Friday, Gurdaspur police had recovered a 40mm under barrel grenade launcher with two 40mm compatible grenades, 3.79-kg RDX, nine electrical detonators and two sets of timer devices from improvised explosive device (IED). The consignment is believed to have smuggled from across the border by Pakistan-based International Sikh Youth Federation chief, Lakhbir Singh Rode. “Strengthening security at vulnerable spots on the border is our top priority. A meeting with the Border Security Force (BSF) officials will also be conducted,” said SSP Khurana who visited border villages on Saturday. Pathankot SSP Surendra Lamba said, “To provide a sense of security among people during ongoing state assembly polls and ahead of the Republic Day, our forces, including the SWAT teams, are regularly visiting border villages. We have also increased our presence in the city area due to its proximity to the international border.”A senior police official, who didn’t wish to be named, said, “Punjab is already on high alert. We are regularly meeting BSF officials. The major threat is to tackle the movement of drones being used by the anti-national elements in Pakistan to air-drop arms, ammunition and drugs into the Indian territory.”On January 14, the special task force (STF) wing of Punjab Police had recovered an improvised explosive device (IED) weighing 5kg and ₹1 lakh in the outskirts of Dhanoa village in Ajnala sub-division, near the international border. The police had said the IED was to be used, ostensibly, during the ongoing assembly polls.A BSF official said, “We are in regular touch with Punjab Police officials and other sister agencies. We have asked border villages to inform us, when they hear buzzing sound of drones coming from Pakistan. We are trying new technologies, including illuminating bombs, to tackle the threat.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ahead-of-r-day-security-beefed-up-along-border-swat-teams-launch-search-ops-101642861603501.html

22-01-2022||Mumbai||Thane district has most population in State with 10.99L not vaccinated against Covid at all||Around 1.17 lakh people in the rural areas of Thane district are due for their second dose. This means merely 35.73% have taken both the doses in rural parts of the district.Though the Zilla Parishad has taken various efforts, the number of individuals taking the second dose of vaccine continues to be lower in the rural areas.“The response to vaccination here was slow and delayed as initially there was a shortage of vaccine. Still, there are very few who willingly approach for the second dose. Now that the Covid cases have gone down drastically in rural areas, we have to again convince villagers to take the second shot of vaccine,” said Anjali Chaudhari, vaccination officer, Thane district.According to the data released by the State Health Department recently, Thane district, overall, has vaccinated 85.49% with the first dose and 66.30% with the second dose. However, the district continues to have around 10.99 lakh people who have not been vaccinated at all. While a spike in the daily vaccination has been noted across Thane district since the last two months, it has not been able to reach out to certain pockets.Within urban areas of the district, Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has completed the second dose vaccination of 54.90%, Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation has fully vaccinated 93.37% and Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation has 68.43% who are fully vaccinated. Overall in the State, Thane district has the most unvaccinated population.Thane district’s rural areas comprise five talukas – Ambernath, Kalyan, Bhiwandi, Shahapur and Murbad. There are around 431 villages in these talukas and most of them are in Bhiwandi.In rural areas, from the target population of 15 lakh, till now 14 lakh doses have been administered including the first and second vaccines. Till now, around 9 lakh have received the first dose and 5.37 lakh, the second dose in the rural areas.“Time and again, various efforts are being taken to ensure that more people are vaccinated. While we assumed that after the first shot many shall willingly step forward for the second dose, reluctance continues in people’s minds. We are, hence, making special provisions all over again and trying our best to reach out to villagers who are sceptical about getting vaccinated,” said Dr Manish Renge, health officer, Zilla Parishad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-district-has-most-population-in-state-with-10-99l-not-vaccinated-against-covid-at-all-101642860766354.html
22-01-2022||Pune||Parents relieved as schools to remain shut for another week in Pune||PUNE Even as schools in Maharashtra will be allowed to conduct physical classes starting Monday, the schools in Pune will continue to conduct classes online for at least another week, a decision most parents have welcomed. With Covid cases rising and the daily case load touching a new high, many parents said they are relieved. “The Covid cases are very high in Pune and it’s increasing every day,” said Anagha Jangale, a mother of an 8-year-old and 14-year-old. Although children between the age of 15 and 18 are being vaccinated in schools, children under 15-years are still unvaccinated and that is worrying the parents. “None of my two children are vaccinated, so, I do not intend to send them to school even if the schools had opened this week,” said Jangale. Some parents who had previously advocated the reopening of schools are now more inclined to keep the schools closed in Pune. Krutika Hosur, who has a son studying at Bal Shikshan Mandir, Kothrud, said, “The authorities have taken the right decision. The online classes are going fine. Keeping the schools closed for one more week wouldn’t do much harm.” Pune district guardian minister, Ajit Pawar during Covid review meeting on Saturday decided to keep schools closed in Pune district. Anuradha Kulkarni, a a geography teacher at MES Boys High School, and a mother of a 13-year-old said,“The authorities have decided in favour of the parents and also the teachers. Asking the children to come to school when Pune is recording the highest Covid cases in the state, would be putting them in danger.” Another parent, however, was of the opinion that although Covid cases are high in Pune, one must take into consideration the severity of the cases as well. “High school and junior college students who are vaccinated should be called back for physical classes in schools because Omicron cases are not very severe,” said Ketki Kashikar, mother of a student studying in Class 8. Younger students, however, should continue online classes, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/parents-relieved-as-schools-to-remain-shut-for-another-week-in-pune-101642860709764.html

22-01-2022||Chandigarh||Experts highlight PM Modi’s integrated approach to security in anthology of essays||India is no bull in a china shop. It is not an aggressive state but is committed to safeguarding its territorial integrity. Alert to the changing threat landscape in the subcontinent, experts say the country’s approach to national security under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has seen pre-emptive, proactive and graded responses. Only the third country after the United States and Israel to carry out cross-border strikes, such as the 2016 Uri surgical strikes and 2019 Balakot air attack, India has shown resolve, read political will, in its response and it has been effective. “Compare this to our delayed response to the Mumbai terror attacks in 2008. Under Modi, there is an element of self-control. His ‘think thoroughly through’ approach is aimed at long-term strategic planning. Ad hocism has been done away with. Since 2018, the emphasis is on creating an integrated national security system,” says Uttam Kumar Sinha, a leading scholar at the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, New Delhi. He is one of the editors of ‘Modi 2.0 — A Resolve to Secure India’, a volume of essays by experts on national security released in New Delhi recently. The book, which brings out the important aspects of national security under the ‘Modi 2.0’ government, comprises 17 chapters by experts from fields of diplomacy, military, academics, politics to media. “When we were dealing with the Covid pandemic within and our armed forces were safeguarding our borders, particularly with China, we realised how critical security is for the nation’s prosperity. People’s confidence in Modi on national security is high and his emphasis has been on an integrated approach and honour,” says Sinha, when asked on the significance and timing of the book. The book, released by BJP national general secretary KL Santhosh, includes an essay by Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee Research Foundation’s honorary director Anirban Ganguly on ‘Modi’s Quest and Action for Securing India’; Union minister Sarbananda Sonowal’s writeup on ‘Strategies to Countering Insurgency in Assam’; the PM’s economic council chairman Bibek Debroy’s ‘Need for Police Reforms’; former NDRF chief Ranjit K Pachnanda’s writeup on ‘India’s Disaster Preparedness’; former diplomat Sujan R Chinoy’s ‘The Return of India’s Stolen Heritage’; former navy chief RK Dhowan’s ‘Securing India’s Maritime Interests and Harnessing Blue Economy’; former high commissioner TCA Raghavan’s ‘Reflections on India’s Policy towards Pakistan’; and National Commission for Women former chief Lalitha Kumaramanagalam’s ‘Women in the Time of Modi’. Former army chief and Union minister VK Singh has shared his viewpoint in the book, too. The writers speak of how the era under Modi has transformed India into a secure nation whether it’s countering terrorism in Kashmir, building infrastructure along the China border, initiating multi-pronged measures to counter insurgency in the North-East or resorting to community policing in Naxal-infested areas or empowering border forces to bring down narco-terrorism. Safeguarding infrastructure development, including expressways, bridges and metro lines, when our subcontinent is vulnerable to hydro-meteorological challenges is also highlighted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/experts-highlight-pm-modi-s-integrated-approach-to-security-in-anthology-of-essays-101642856863056.html
22-01-2022||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: SUV occupants speed away after leaving cash bag at checkpoint||Two men in an SUV sped away after dropping a bag containing ₹17.9 lakh cash at Bharat Nagar Chowk after cops stopped them for checking on Friday evening. Police suspect that the accused may be involved in hawala money transactions or drug peddling. They are also exploring the possibility of the cash being spent on election by some contestant. Assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Gursharanjit Singh, in-charge of the Bus Stand police post, said police had set up a naka at Bharat Nagar Chowk. When they stopped a Mahindra Scorpio SUV for checking, one of the occupants got off the vehicle with a bag in his hand. When the cops told him to open the bag for checking, the accused jumped back into the car and sped away, leaving the bag on the road.On checking, cops found ₹17.90 lakh in the bag. Police have seized the cash and registered a case against the duo under Sections 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions) of the Indian Penal Code, for fleeing the checkpoint. On tracing the registration number, police found that the vehicle belongs to Hoshiar Singh of Dolewal village of Moga. When a team raided his house, Hoshiar Singh was not present there. Notably, police have formed special teams to keep tabs on illegal money transactions ahead of Punjab assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-suv-occupants-speed-away-after-leaving-cash-bag-at-checkpoint-101642855482885.html
22-01-2022||Mumbai||Response for booster dose in Navi Mumbai less: civic body||Despite the Urban Primary Health Centres (UPHC) and the general hospitals of Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) offering booster doses for the eligible 60-years and above population, the response for the same has been very less, claimed the civic body.Till now, only 4,824 beneficiaries have taken the booster dose.Hence, the corporation has planned to take up Information Education and Communication (IEC) activities to get maximum response from the eligible citizens for the booster dose.Citing the reasons for the poor response, municipal commissioner, Abhijit Bangar, said, “One of the reasons is that most of the people are down with flu. Hence, they are not stepping out to take the vaccine. Another reason is that with the third wave being very mild, the fear among the people has gone. People have become fearless about the infection and believe that they would not be affected. The two doses of vaccine are the reason why the third wave was so mild. People need to understand that and all those eligible need to get their booster shot.”The NMMC has started making announcements in all areas asking those eligible to come forward and take the booster shot.“We are also planning to write to the local representatives and housing societies to give details about the 60-years and above eligible candidates in their areas. The call centre would be given the task of calling up the eligible beneficiaries. The teams would also visit the homes individually. It would be a tedious process but to protect all of them, it is necessary. We also plan to hand out cards to every individual with their names, requesting to get the booster dose. Instead of a generic card, each one will get a card with their respective names to make them feel that getting the booster dose is important,” Bangar added.Till now, 99,372 people above the age of 60 years have got their first dose while 94,800 have got their second dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/response-for-booster-dose-in-navi-mumbai-less-civic-body-101642854942715.html
22-01-2022||Mumbai||Garbage dumping ground in mangroves area of Uran to be beautified||The nearly four-hectare garbage dumping ground in the mangroves area of Uran across Mumbai harbour would soon be beautified following a Bombay High Court order and then handed over to the forest department.Uran Municipal Council (UMC), which was at the receiving end of the greens for allegedly dumping garbage on mangroves and wetland at Bori Pakhadi, has initiated the process of scientific closure of the dumping ground through bio-mining and bio-remediation process.Following a tender, a private firm has been entrusted with the contract for separating wet garbage for compost and the rest for scientific disposal. The work costing ₹10.50 lakh started on January 21 and is expected to be completed in three months.Santosh Mali, chief executive officer of UMC, said, “The dumping ground plot at Bori Pakhadi had been given to UMC in 2007 by Raigad Collector. In 2011, there were litigations and objections by local residents on the stench. Meanwhile, mangroves that were not there earlier, too, came up nearby due to the presence of the creek. A PIL was then filed by Hanuman Koliwada Machchimar Vikas Sanstha Maryadit in 2018.”During the hearings, the Court asked the State Government to provide an alternate dumping site. The government has facilitated the use of CIDCO dumping ground at Chal village in Panvel taluka.Mali added, “We have signed an agreement with CIDCO accordingly. Thirteen tons of garbage is generated in Uran daily, which is now dumped at Chal as we stopped using our dumping ground at Bori Pakhadi since December 10. In fact, on receiving information that some illegal dumping was taking place at night, we started 24 hours vigilance by setting up a chowki there with personnel and also installed CCTV cameras. The approach road too has been closed.”UMC decided to remove the almost 15-year-old garbage dumps and hand over the area to the forest department. The scientific closure process has begun. The entire area will be properly levelled and handed over to the forest department for conserving the mangroves.Hanuman Koliwada, a resettlement of a displaced fishing community from Sheva, is in the vicinity of the garbage dump at Bori Pakhadi, which also has been posing health hazards. Bori Pakhadi residents, who had to brave the suffocating smoke from frequent fires at the dump apart from the stink and insect menace, now heaved a sigh of relief.“It is like the end of a 14-year-long life-term fight for justice,” said Samir Ashrit, who, along with Yuva Uran platform, spearheaded the campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/garbage-dumping-ground-in-mangroves-area-of-uran-to-be-beautified-101642853862652.html

The Centre said this in its affidavit filed in response to a plea by NGO Evara Foundation seeking door-to-door, priority Covid-19 vaccination for persons with disabilities.Speaking on this, Pawar on Saturday said in Pune that, the Centre has submitted what it felt right though state the state government has certain rights, which it is exercising.“Our intention is not to make it as a precondition. One can take risks by not taking both doses, but he or she doesn’t have the right to pose threat to others and this has been our stand. Having said everyone has the freedom to decide. We are not denying them basic facilities or their rights. The same vaccination rule was even in place for MLAs during assembly session,” said Pawar.His response was to the question about the rule pertaining to allowing only those with both doses at the swimming pools and open grounds.In Pune, the local administration recently made it mandatory for those commuting through Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) bus to carry certification for double vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-vaccine-not-mandatory-but-state-has-right-to-offer-certain-services-for-fully-vaxxed-ajit-pawar-101642853142767.html
22-01-2022||Pune||After growing demand from citizens, gardens to reopen in Pune||PUNE Gardens along with swimming pools, open grounds, tourist places and religious places will once again reopen in the district from Monday after Pune district guardian minister Ajit Pawar made an announcement to reopen gardens for morning walks after growing demand from citizens.After attending a meeting to review the Covid-19 situation in the district,Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Saturday said swimming pools and grounds will be open to sportspersons and people who have taken both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine.Apart from this, tourist places such as Lonavla and Sinhgad will be thrown open to limited number of visitors in order to sustain small business operating at these locations, said Pawar. Pawar said, “It was demanded by many to allow the gardens to be opened again for morning walks. The elected members too demanded to reopen gardens. Considering this, we have asked both Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporations to reopen gardens for citizens.” During the meeting BJP legislator from Shivajinagar Siddharth Shirole had demanded to allow players to carry out practice sessions in swimming pools, stating that they are facing various issues. “As tourist places were shut, the local vendors have been facing the problem of livelihood. They cooperated for past few months. Considering this, we have allowed to reopen tourist places like Sinhgad, and places like Lonavla in Pune district but citizens need to follow Covid appropriate behaviour. At these tourists places, small traders and eateries will be allowed to reopen,” said Pawar. Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “As the guardian minister has allowed the reopening of swimming pools and gardens, we will issue the detailed orders accordingly.”Meanwhile, those above 60-years can get precautionary dose even on Saturday and Sundays, said officials.According to Pawar, there were complaints from family members that it was difficult for them to take seniors for vaccination on weekdays . “Considering this, we have allowed precautionary dose for those above 60-years on Saturdays and Sundays,” he stated. BOX: The district collector plans to hold a meeting next week with industries to make sure that these firms have ensured double vaccination of all workers. The information in this regard was shared by Ajit Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/after-growing-demand-from-citizens-gardens-to-reopen-in-pune-101642853083238.html

The experts too asked for restraining, following which the decision to defer school reopening was taken.“The cases in Mumbai are coming down though, in Pune, the current situation is opposite. We have not yet hit the peak and every day the cases are inching up. Experts in this field have said at least this trend will continue for next few days and later the trend will start to bring down the cases,” said Pawar.The state government has decided to start offline classes between Classes 1 to 10 from January 24, though local administration will take a final call on this depending on the ground situation in various parts.Mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “We presented the current Covid figures before the guardian minister and requested to not reopen schools.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/schools-in-pune-district-to-remain-shut-till-next-week-ajit-pawar-101642852782893.html

22-01-2022||Pune||Startup Mantra: Company flies high on faujis’ trust, good feeling and economical facilities||udChalo is a consumer-tech startup that exclusively serves travel needs of India’s defence forces and their dependents. Ravi Kumar, son of a 1971-war-veteran, founded this startup in 2015 with a mission to ‘make life simpler for soldiers’. This startup has clocked US $110 million+ turnover last year – its sixth year – and is now looking for its first fundraise of US $100 million for expansion into new verticals like housing, ecommerce and financial services. On National Start-up Day celebrated recently, udChalo was awarded as the most innovative and socially impactful startup in the travel planning and discovery segment. In the beginning… Ravi Kumar is a native of Patna, born in Kolkata and stayed in Jhansi, Delhi, Bengaluru cities because of the Army family background. Son of a 1971 war veteran, Ravi did his Mechanical Engineering from Pune’s Army Institute of Technology (AIT) in 2009. Although Ravi was placed with the Tata AutoComp Systems (TACO) company, the joining came after a delay of nine months because of ‘The Great Recession’. Says Ravi, “Since my first job was with a Tata company, we have built udChalo culturally the Tata way. Trust, good feeling is a part of culture. While working at Tata, I decided to get into teaching. I needed to have a PhD and for that I had to do Master’s degree first. So, I left the job at TACO and joined an engineering college in Mumbai. I taught there for seven months and then I cleared my Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) examination. I got a call from IIT Bombay and decided to join, but before I took admission, this idea of udChalo came to my mind.” After engineering, Ravi Kumar also pursued one-year offline course from Stanford Graduate School of Business called the Stanford Seed. Kingfisher debacle Ravi Kumar’s idea of startup came at a time when the Kingfisher airlines debacle happened. When he analysed the reasons behind the airlines failure, Ravi Kumar realised that there are three primary reasons for such a failure – high taxes, high aviation fuel rates and low passenger-load factor. Says Ravi Kumar, “While we can’t do much about high taxes or high aviation fuel rates, what we can address is the passenger-load factor. We were taken aback due to Kingfisher’s failure, but then we realised that we can actually convince other airlines of offering a completely new customer segment – the AC Tier 2 and Tier 3 passengers of railways who can be converted to airline passengers.” But it was easier said than done. Ravi says, “In 2012 we started working on the idea. At any point of time in those days, around 48,000 seats (in all airlines together) were going vacant and on the other side, three lakh people in wait-lists were being rejected. So, clearly there was a mismatch. We met a lot of executives from various airlines. Everybody liked the idea; however, airline officials were sceptical about this customer segment. The officials believed that leisure and business travellers are their main customers and they never thought of any other class of customer.” Network is networth Ravi Kumar and his team had to do a lot of convincing from 2012 to 2015. Recalling his early struggle to ‘network’ with right set of people, Ravi says, “I was fresh graduate from college and had no ‘network’ then. We were facing a huge challenge of how to reach the airline executives just to tell them that this idea can really do wonders. We visited airline websites and noted down names of the persons concerned. We used to guess and randomly send emails using combination of domain and names. One fine day, one of the chief commercial officer of an airline responded to us and he called us to Mumbai. He liked the idea and introduced us to a few more people. That’s how we started building reputation with the airline industry. After three years of perseverance, udChalo managed to bag our first customer. It was Jet Airways who agreed to offer us discounted fares.” “In the three years, we had also evolved. We told Jet Airways that we will bring only those passengers who are entitled to travel by railways. All the defence personnel (Army, Navy, Airforce and Paramilitary), except officers (who are 2 to 3 per cent of the entire force), was our target customer. We were the first to launch defence discount concept in aviation sector in the country,” he added. Bengaluru first When udChalo started with the defence market in 2015, they realised that leaves of defence personnel are approved at the last moment and hence they barely manage to get a confirmed railway ticket. Recalls Ravi, “In September 2014, I had also thought of doing job. I had gone for an interview to SSB Bengaluru where I realised that candidates coming to SSB Bengaluru knew their arrival date and time, but departure was not fixed because a candidate could be rejected on the very first day or fifth day. So, nobody could book return tickets. That prompted me to start from Bengaluru first. I decided to start an offline booking office in Bengaluru.” “We asked Jet Airways to provide tickets from Bengaluru to any other destination. We were offered tickets at about 50 per cent discounted rate by Jet Airways. If any candidate wanted a ticket from Bengaluru, he could get one to Delhi and Chandigarh. It was a win-win situation for both – the airlines and customers. Business started picking up from Bengaluru and then we decided to start pan-India services instead of restricting ourselves ‘from Bengaluru’ only,” said Ravi. “After Jet airways, Go Air and other airlines came on board. In the first financial year we could book 1,600 flight tickets. Today we book about 20 lakh flight tickets annually,” Ravi Kumar proudly claims. ‘Sarhad Se Ghar Tak’ Changing the mindset of ‘faujis’ was also a challenge. Ravi Kumar said, “Most of the ‘faujis’ were shy about how to behave in the flight, what items they can carry in their luggage, what could be prohibited and screened, etc. To address all their concerns, we did offline presentations on a massive scale. Now we have our representatives in areas like Kargil, Baramulla, Kupwara and Uri. We have our own offices there.” “Even today there many challenges to be resolved. For example, a flight won’t take any soldier directly to their native place like Satara, Solapur, etc. We had started a scheme called ‘Sarhad Se Ghar Tak’ to address this issue. In this scheme, for example, a soldier would travel from Srinagar airport to Pune airport and a car would pick-up passengers and drop them to Karad, Satara, Kolhapur, Sangli villages. We had tied up with some travel companies and it was doing very well, but due to coronavirus outbreak we had to stop it temporarily,” he said. “If you look at the idea, the core value is to make life simpler for soldiers. Anything which makes life simpler for soldiers we do it,” adds Ravi. Million dollar take off In its second financial year of operations, udChalo sold two lakh tickets. It was recognised as the fastest growing MSME with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) growth of 495 per cent for the period of 2015 to 2020. When asked whether he expected such growth and what clicked with the customers, Ravi said, “Our model was well understood by the customers as they would reach home early by paying a bit of extra money as compared to railway fare. We would help them in documentation and claim settlement as the reimbursed railway-fare amount would get deposited in their bank accounts. We made our website more robust and spent some money on infrastructure. My co-founder Varun Jain, who used to run a travel technology company, helped me in making the app, website and infrastructure.” “There were two advantages of offline booking offices. First is that we got closer to our customers and hence we could convince and explain them how to fill the documents and reimbursement form. Second advantage was that we got visibility in the Cantts (Cantonment areas). We also created employment opportunity for one ex-service person per office. Presently, we have 70 such offices and at each location, including Sub Area Canteen, BEG Center at Khadki in Pune, and other locations at Jammu and Kashmir and North East, one ex-service personnel or war widow or their dependents have been employed,” Ravi stated. Diversifying Says Ravi Kumar, “In April 2021, Samsung India joined hands with us. We have over 20 lakh members on our website and hence they asked us to offer their mobile phones to our members. It was a huge success and today we are selling mobiles worth ₹25 lakh and above every month. That’s why we thought, let’s not restrict ourselves to travel. We started exploring other verticals like housing, ecommerce, financial services. There is an initiative like Army Welfare Housing Organisation (AWHO) but it is not available in all cities. Recently, we tied up with a Pune-based developer and within two months we sold 26 units. We will tie-up with one developer and builder in every city. We will give them exclusive customers in return of exclusive rates for us.” Financial services udChalo holds ERI License from department of income tax. “We have pivoted ourselves, after we realised that we can do many things. This year we have filed income tax of more than 2,000 members and next year we are aiming to file IT for all personnel of armed forces. With this information, we can also offer instant low-interest loans to our members. At present, many soldiers end up paying high interest rates to their village money-lenders. Banks ask for heavy documentation. We will offer the ‘faujis’ best interest rates in the slab of 12 to 13 per cent as against 18 per cent of other NBFCs,” says Ravi Kumar. “When we pivoted from a travel to a consumer-tech company, we wanted to leverage the consumer base using technology. We had two options – build an internal team of data analysts and infrastructure or to acquire a data analytics company. We got to know about Dimentrix company which was already into data analytics domain. With its acquisition, we fastened the process of our entire consumer-technology part to push more products,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/startup-mantra-company-flies-high-on-faujis-trust-good-feeling-and-economical-facilities-101642848583575.html
22-01-2022||Mumbai||3 including minor arrested for activating SIM cards using forged documents in Bhiwandi||The Bhoiwada police in Bhiwandi have busted a racket where three SIM card vendors were activating SIM cards using forged documents based on details submitted by bonafide customers.According to the Bhoiwada police, the three accused – Irfan Ansari (23), Saeed Sheikh (24) and a 17-year-old – were arrested on Thursday on the basis of a tip off received by senior police inspector SA Indalkar.Acting on a tip-off, police conducted raids at multiple locations in Dhamankar Naka and Gayatri Nagar in Bhiwandi, and arrested the trio, who worked as SIM card vendors for leading cellular service providers.“Whenever a customer bought a SIM card from the accused, they’d take photographs of their Aadhaar cards as part of the purchase process. These Aadhaar cards would be edited using computer software with pictures, names and addresses on them being changed to generate a completely new identity. The forged Aadhaar cards would then be used to activate new SIM cards,” Indalkar said.The accused had also found a way to beat the electronic thumb impressions.“While collecting electronic thumb impressions of genuine customers, the accused would claim that there was some problem with their machine and get the customers to record their impressions multiple times. These extra impressions, stored separately, would then be paired with the bogus identities created by the accused while activating new SIM cards,” Indalkar said.The police recovered a total of 361 activated SIM cards as well as 250 photocopies of Aadhaar cards, all bearing the same person’s photograph but different names and addresses, along with a colour printer and a SIM card activation machine, from the accused.The trio was charged with cheating and forgery under the Indian Penal Code, and the two adult accused were placed under arrest, while the minor accused was sent to a juvenile detention facility.“We are interrogating the accused to identify all the persons to whom they have sold the activated SIM cards so far,” Indalkar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/3-including-minor-arrested-for-activating-sim-cards-using-forged-documents-in-bhiwandi-101642848522613.html

Schools will remain online in Pune for at least the next one week, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said. Covid numbers are not likely to come down in Pune, not for at least the next eight days, the minister said.Pune on Friday reported 16,618 fresh infections in the highest single-day spike since the beginning of the pandemic.The Maharashtra government has decided to allow physical classes in schools starting from coming Monday as the daily caseload in the state has somewhat stabilised. However, the decision to reopen schools at a time when the threat of the third wave is not yet over rests with the local administrations, the government said.Following the go-ahead from the government to resume physical classes, Maharashtra social justice and special assistance minister Dhananjay Munde has directed officials to reopen hostels and residential schools under his department.The decision was taken after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray agreed to the proposal of the school education ministry to resume physical classes from classes 1 to 12 in view of the daily Covid cases stabilising. Districts where daily cases are low have been allowed to resume physical classes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-schools-won-t-resume-physical-classes-from-monday-covid-cases-high-101642846243577.html
22-01-2022||Mumbai||Kamla building’s firefighting system wasn’t working: Mumbai Fire Brigade||MUMBAI: The internal firefighting system of the Tardeo’s Kamla building, also known as Sachinam Heights building where a massive fire killed 6 people and injured 23 on Saturday morning was not operational at the time of the fire, according to Mumbai’s fire department officials.Residents of the building said they did not hear the fire alarm of the building go off after the fire.The massive fire gutted an apartment in Kamla building at Nana Chowk on Saturday. The first information abouot the fire was received at 7.28am. It was classified as a level 3 (massive) fire at 7.42 am, and took the fire brigade 2.5 hours to bring the fire under control, and almost five hours to douse the fire.This is the fourth high-rise fire in three months in the city to have resulted in casualties.On October 23, one person was killed in a fire on the 19th floor of a 61-storey building One Avighna Park at Currey Road in Mumbai. Two people were killed in another fire on the 14th floor of 15 storey Hansa Heritage in Kandivali on November 7; one woman was killed as a fire erupted in Notan Villa in Khan on September 23. In each of these cases, the fire fighting system of the building was not operational at the time of the fire.HT reported in November last year, that of the 324 fires reported in the city’s high-rise buildings between January 2020 and October 2021, 127 buildings, or 39.2%, did not have an operational firefighting system.In case of the Kamla building fire of Saturday too, Chief Fire Officer of the Mumbai fire brigade, Hemant Parab said, “The internal firefighting system of the building was not working, and the building has not even submitted it -bi-annual fire safety audit to the fire brigade.”The entire building was smoke logged, even though the fire completely gutted only flat number 1904 and the common passageway of the floor. Smoke spread through the building due to a duct running along the length of the building. Parab said, “The building has two refuge areas, but none of the residents were found in the refuge area. The fire brigade rescued about 28-29 residents using the staircase of the building.”A total of 29 people were rushed to three hospitals: Nair, Kasturba, and Bhatia hospital. Three patients among these were later shifted to Masina, Reliance, and Wockhardt hospitals for treatment. 7 out of these patients were discharged after treatment, while 16 others are undergoing treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kamla-building-s-firefighting-system-wasn-t-working-mumbai-fire-brigade-101642844262205.html

22-01-2022||Delhi||Delhiwale: The changing Shahjahanabad||It is as if these patches of sky could no longer hold together. As if they had given up, falling down here and there over the city. This is one of the ways of looking at the blue tarpaulin sheets that shroud parts of the Walled City of Shahjahanabad these days.On this cold afternoon, the main market street between Tiraha Behram Khan and Chitli Qabar Chowk is filled beyond capacity with shoppers (mostly maskless). The shop windows are filled with distractions—laces, dupattas, sheets and lehengas. Nobody bothers to look up, and yet, the tarpaulins hanging on several facades are quite a sight. Apart from their intense colors (often in blue), they are evidence of ongoing constructions, and have been wrapped about the upcoming structures to prevent the dust from spreading around, as one shopkeeper says.The tarpaulins tell it most starkly — Purani Dilli is changing furiously fast. Old buildings are being replaced by new ones. Take this draped edifice-in-progress on the market road, for instance. It is standing next to a time-worn building with arched doors, wooden windows and intricately carved balconies. If one wonders how long this faded edifice will be allowed to stand, one does not really wonder about the look of the adjoining veiled building coming up. Its shiny cousins are already springing up in the historic quarter, and they all look similar — monolithic blocks of residential apartments. The turning towards Gali Kala Mahal, at Kamra Bangash, is landmarked by such a multi-storey tower of flats, which would not look out of place in a Ghaziabad suburb.Some distance away, the cramped alley at Kucha Tara Chand is resounding with the twak-twak of labourers hammering with their miscellaneous tools. There, one construction site is barricaded by an elaborate blue and yellow tarpaulin. Right next to it stands a beautiful, old building with a most arresting doorway. A spectator might be haunted by the mystery of what old beautiful building used to stand behind the tarpaulin.A devotee of old architecture might feel helpless walking around here, and experience a sense of profound loss. This sentiment might not necessarily be shared by those who live in the Walled City. This reporter personally knows scores of households that had to leave the Walled City for modern and spacious apartments, so as to accommodate their expanding families. They might see the new multi-stories as a necessary convenience.One of the most poignant illustrations of this ongoing change lies on a lane near Kalan Masjid, where a construction site is partly covered with a giant sheet of tarpaulin. The building appears to be complete, though it is still scaffolded with wooden beams. The finished wall is paved with what looks to be stone tiles. Just beside it stands a Mughal structure adorned with a vaulted arch of red sandstone, its surface sculpted with patterns of flowers. Both buildings are fused into each other, except for a thin vertical line of slim lakhori bricks of yesteryear. The bricks seem to be squeezed between the old and new. This sight (see photo) is today emerging as the most defining symbol of contemporary Old Delhi — yesterday and tomorrow, flirting with each other. Be a witness of this shift in time, before Shahjahanabad changes forever.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-changing-shahjahanabad-101642802994638.html
22-01-2022||Delhi||HC marital rape hearing: Role of husband’s expectations in focus||Continuing her arguments before the Delhi high court on Friday for criminalising marital rape, amicus curiae Rebecca John said the expectation of sexual relations by a husband cannot result in him having forcible sex with the wife.John told the bench of justices Rajiv Shakdher and C Hari Shankar that while there is no doubt that there was an expectation of sexual relations in a marital relationship, consent can only be achieved through dialogue, and if the wife is also willing and ready to have conjugal relations.“Expectation is not wrong. Both sides can have expectations. However, that expectation cannot result in the husband having forcible sex with the wife. The issue is not about expectation; it is about the man exercising his dominant right over the wife, despite the wife saying I cannot and will not have sexual relations with you,” John said, after Shankar asked her about the expectations that a husband may have in a marital relationship.Justice Shankar reiterated that there is a qualitative difference between the sexual equation that exists between parties who are married and those who are not. He said while the parties who are married may have a right to expect sexual relations, there is no such right between couples who are unmarried.Exception 2 in Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) decriminalises marital rape and mandates that sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under 15 years of age, is not rape.Justice Shankar asked John that if the country’s legislature considered as different the situations of a married and unmarried couple, was it possible for the court to do otherwise.Earlier, Shankar said when a man is married, there is a social, moral and legal right for each partner to expect meaningful conjugal relations with the other. Correcting his earlier stance, the judge said, “Let us not call it a right. Let’s call it an expectation.”The bench is hearing PILs by NGOs RIT Foundation, All India Democratic Women’s Association, and two individuals seeking to strike down the exception granted to husbands.During the proceedings, senior counsel John also submitted that if the exception in the rape law was gender neutral, it would create a false equivalence to suggest that husbands and wives are equal, disregarding the lived experiences of women as wives.She also gave examples of various provisions in different statutes which specifically focussed on the victim being a woman, including the Domestic Violence Act, Section 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), Section 113B of Indian Evidence Act (presumption as to dowry death) and Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act.She submitted that the scheme of IPC, Criminal Procedure Code and the Indian Evidence Act has been amended by the legislature, putting the woman at the centre of the provision and keeping in mind the procedural and evidentiary safeguards that must be given when a complaint is filed by a woman.Arguments will continue on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hc-marital-rape-hearing-role-of-husband-s-expectations-in-focus-101642802708738.html
22-01-2022||Noida||Two arrested for cheating people in Noida on pretext of jobs in airline company||Police arrested two men on Friday for allegedly duping many people on the pretext of facilitating jobs in a private airline, said officials.The suspects used to buy data of job seekers from job portals (data not available) and call them to extract money on pretext of registration, offer letter, security deposit and other procedures, according to police.The suspects were identified as Rahul Kumar, 30, and Kamal Kumar, 28, said police.Abhishek (goes by first name), deputy commissioner of police (crime), Gautam Budh Nagar, said they received a tip on Friday on suspicious activities being carried out by some people inside a building in Noida Sector 6. “A police team reached the spot and conducted a search there. Police arrested the duo and recovered 11 cellphones, two laptops, 29 calling data-sheets and a fake stamp of an airline from their possession,” he said.The suspects revealed during interrogation that they operated a fake company to cheat people on pretext of facilitating jobs in a private airline. The duo used fake stamp in offer letters issued to the people to make the documents look genuine, said Abhishek, adding, “The police team also attended to an incoming call on one of the cellphones recovered from the possession of the suspects, where the caller identified himself as Vipin Chand Singh, a resident of Himachal Pradesh. Singh revealed that he had received several calls from the suspects, who cheated him of ₹7 lakh on pretext of a job in the airline company.”Police said the suspects have been cheating nearly 100 people in Noida in the past six months.

This was the lowest positivity rate since January 7, when the Capital reported a positivity rate of 17.7%, state government data showed.The city also added 38 deaths of the infection on Friday.Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said infections in the city were showing a declining trend and that hospitalisation numbers have stabilised over the last week.“The number of patients admitted to the hospital is stable at present. The Delhi government is prepared to bolster health services on all fronts. Delhi government has been the first in the country to take the most stringent steps in view of the threat of new variants, due to which the situation of coronavirus in Delhi is under control and there is a decline in cases,” Jain said.Government data also showed that out of the total 15,557 beds in dedicated Covid hospitals, 2,656 (17.07%) were vacant as on Friday, leaving the larger share of 12,901 beds (82.93%) vacant. The number of people recovering in home isolation went down on Friday.At no point since cases of Covid-19 began surging in the Capital this year has the hospital bed occupancy rate been beyond 20% of capacity, data released by the Delhi government every day showsOn Friday 48,356 Covid-19 positive patients were on home isolation as opposed to 53,593 on Thursday.“In 2021, the rise in cases was very drastic, but in 2020 also we saw a similar trend in Covid numbers. We are also seeing now that there are very few young and healthy adults infected with severe infections. The severely impacted are still senior citizens and those with comorbid conditions,” said Dr Vikas Maurya, a senior pulmonologist at Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh.The health minister on Friday also reiterated the need for people to wear masks and follow Covid protocol strictly.“I appeal to people again to not lower your guard, we are seeing a decline but it is still very important to follow social distancing norms and also to wear masks,” Jain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-in-delhi-cases-fall-to-10-7k-positivity-now-18-101642801477311.html
22-01-2022||Chandigarh||Mohali: Man shoots himself in female acquaintance’s car||A 33-year-old man was critically injured after he shot himself in the temple with his licensed pistol in the car of a woman whom he had been allegedly harassing, at the Phase-5 market on Friday. A resident of Janta Nagar, Kharar, the injured man works as a private personal security officer. He was rushed to Cheema Hospital in Phase 4, from where he was referred to PGIMER, Chandigarh. Till the filing of this report, doctors were still operating on him to remove the bullet lodged in his head.According to the woman in whose car the incident took place, she knew the man was the past five months and lately he had been harassing her. She and her husband had even filed a police complaint regarding this, but later a compromise was reached.On Friday, when she reached the rear parking lot of the Phase 5 market to visit a salon, the man was already present there and threatened her at gunpoint to get back in her car, she told the police.He also sat inside the car, adjacent to her, and suddenly shot himself in the temple after threatening to shoot her. Meanwhile, the man’s father filed a complaint against the woman and her husband, alleging that he and his son were previously assaulted at the couple’s house when they had visited them to address the woman’s harassment complaint. He claimed that his son had befriended the woman over Instagram and they often used to talk on the phone.Phase 1 SHO Shivdeep Brar said the complaint by the injured man’s father was being verified. “The woman and the man were known to each other.

22-01-2022||Noida||High-rises in Greater Noida West step up testing for coronavirus infection||Noida: As Gautam Budh Nagar continues to report over 1,000 Covid-19 cases daily, the Apartment Owners’ Associations (AOAs) in the district are on their toes to ensure residents get tested in order to ensure the early detection of the virus. On the request of AOAs in the Greater Noida west region, which houses over 70 high-rise societies with a population of over one lakh residents, the district health department has stepped up testing by holding doorstep camps. “Almost all high-rise societies in the Greater Noida west area have seen a spurt in cases this month. The population in many of these societies is more than 1,000 and poses a risk of spread if testing is not carried out on a war-footing. There is an urgent need to hold more testing camps for the residents at their doorsteps,” said Rahul Garg, a member of Noida Extension Flat Owners’ Welfare Association (NEFOWA). A five-day mass testing camp is being organised between January 24 and 29 with one camp at one housing society a day. “Each AOA is informed beforehand about the camp and a medical team is provided from the district health department that carries out the testing. The AOAs also assist the team with manpower to carry out registration of the residents,” said Abhishek Kumar, the president of NEFOWA. According to the district health department, the Bisrakh Community Health Centre (CHC) caters to the population of Greater Noida west region. “Testing facility is available at Bisrakh CHC daily between 10am and 2pm. However, we are carrying out testing camps at high-rise societies because testing and tracing is vital to contain the spread of the virus. An average of 100 tests per day are being carried out at each camp,” said Dr Shirish Jain, additional chief medical officer in-charge of Covid sampling in Gautam Budh Nagar. Since January 5, the health department has also organised five-day testing camps for other high-rise societies of the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/highrises-in-greater-noida-west-step-up-testing-for-coronavirus-infection-101642801239259.html
22-01-2022||Delhi||Few admissions during 5th wave question need for ongoing curbs||At no point since cases of Covid-19 began surging in the Capital this year has the hospital bed occupancy rate been beyond 20% of capacity, data released by the Delhi government every day shows. At its peak, the city recorded 43 deaths in a day on Thursday – of these, only three could be directly linked to Covid-19 alone, the city’s health minister Satyendar Jain said on Friday.Another other way to look at Delhi’s current outbreak is to consider diagnosis and the predicted spike in admissions, which typically take place a week later. In Delhi, the peak of recorded cases came on January 12, and that of the test positivity on January 14. Since then, the number of people in the hospital have remained in the 2,600-2,700 range, even in fact dipping slightly in the last three days. And cases too have fallen sharply to 10,765 on Friday, from this wave’s peak of 28,867.Whichever way the data is sliced, the import is clear: Delhi’s health care infrastructure has been far from a crisis. And this prompts questions on the Delhi Disaster Management Authority’s (DDMA) response, including a decision by Anil Baijal, who as the Union territory’s lieutenant governor heads the body, to not lift the weekend curfew or allow shops in markets to return to business as usual (instead of opening on alternate days).There’s also no talk of reopening schools, which Maharashtra (and Mumbai) have already indicated that they will do as early as next week.Looking at Delhi’s restrictions from the perspective of guidance by World Health Organization (WHO) and conversations among experts from the fields of epidemiology, public health and economics, it is clear that it is following a paradigm set in 2020, when the world faced an unknown threat. That is out of place in 2022, when there is high vaccination coverage, effective treatment protocols, and wider understanding of early clinical risks.If restrictions and lockdowns were meant to “flatten the curve” of cases to under a level that the health care infrastructure could manage, Delhi, with over 80% of its beds still vacant in the third week of its outbreak, may have actually flattened it too much.“The availability of effective vaccines provides an additional, potent tool to exit the pandemic, allowing the progressive reduction of non-pharmaceutical interventions while maintaining low incidence…” jointly wrote a group of experts in medical sciences, public health and economics in the Lancet Global Health’s January, 2022 issue.Among themselves, they came to several conclusions. “First, strict public health interventions such as school closures, curfews, or lockdowns might no longer be justified as the risk attached to contracting Covid-19 has been starkly reduced by vaccines”.“Second, countries’ persistent efforts to control the virus have led to an increasing fatigue among the population…”And, most of all, if there is no wide-reaching coordination on what the correct strategies should be, “we might face years of increased morbidity and mortality due to not only Sars-CoV-2 itself, but also the resulting economic instability and increased inequalities”.In other words, eliminating the virus – essentially what curbs like those in Delhi are meant to do – has no place at a time when vaccination has largely eliminated the risk of death.In the Capital, 80% of the adult population has been fully vaccinated.The administration needs to merely look back at WHO’s guidance on approaching public health measures during Covid: “Any decision to introduce, adapt or lift” them should be based “primarily on a situational assessment of the intensity of transmission and the capacity of the health system to respond”, but, crucially, “must also be considered in light of the effects these measures may have on the general welfare of society and individuals”.On this yardstick, as the numbers demonstrate, Delhi’s restrictions are an overkill, prolonging not just deep economic losses, but also posing little epidemiological benefit.“Since this variant is so transmissible, restrictions are only delaying the decline in infections,” Dr Jugal Kishore, head of department of community medicine at the Safdarjung Hospital, told HT on Thursday.Kishore pointed out that prolonging the epidemic also poses another risk: “The longer we allow the virus to stay in the community, the greater are its chances of mutating.”

22-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab assembly elections: Sanjeev Khanna is BJP’s pick for Dera Bassi||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has declared Sanjeev Khanna as its candidate from the Dera Bassi constituency for the Punjab Assembly elections scheduled on February 20. His name figured in the first list of 36 candidates declared by the party in Delhi on Friday.A realtor based in Dera Bassi, Khanna, 57, has been a state executive committee member of BJP’s Punjab unit since December 2020, apart from being an RSS activist. He has also been involved in social work for the past three decades.Khanna has been pitted against Shiromani Akali Dal’s two-time MLA NK Sharma and Aam Aadmi Party’s Kuljeet Singh Randhawa.Congress has not nominated its candidate yet, though Deepinder Singh Dhillon, who finished second in the 2017 elections, and Amit Bawa Saini are the frontrunners.“As the BJP has put a huge responsibility on me, I will ensure all-around development of the constituency, with special focus on Zirakpur, which is home to a large number of people, even from other states. The constituency has seen huge growth in terms of commerce, but it still lacks basic amenities due to the Congress-led government’s apathy,” Khanna said.The Dera Bassi assembly constituency has always remained a stronghold of the SAD under former minister late Captain Kanwaljit Singh, with the party triumphing consistently for the past three decades.NK Sharma won the elections in 2012 and 2017, beating Congress’ Deepinder Singh Dhillon on both occasions.But in the civic body elections held in February last year, the Congress routed out the SAD from all three civic bodies in the constituency – Dera Bassi, Lalru and Zirakpur.

Heavy police force was deployed to avert any law and order situation.Dr Munish Singla, a forensic expert on the board, said as per preliminary report, 20 bullets passed through the body, leading to 40 wounds, mostly on the chest, abdomen and thighs. “We were able to extract four bullets from the chest, head and shoulder. These were handed over to the police. The final report will be ready in a few days, after which a ballistic report will be prepared to determine the weapons used in the crime,” he said. Inspector Suresh Kumar, station in-charge, Mahesh Nagar police station, said after the autopsy, the body was handed over to the family for last rites.The other victim of the attack, Vishal, alias Bhola, a private employee and a resident of Ambala Cantonment, remains critical at PGIMER, Chandigarh.Police uncertain of assailants’ identity 24 hours laterMeanwhile, the police failed to establish the identity of the assailants 24 hours after the gang war took place in broad daylight near DAV Public School on the Ambala-Jagadhari road on Thursday.Soon after the incident, a Facebook post by Goldy Brar had claimed responsibility for the murder with his “brother” Kala Rana. Police said Brar was affiliated with the Lawrence Bishnoi and Kala Rana gangs, and operated from abroad.Both Kala Rana and Monu Rana operate in association with the Bishnoi gang against a common enemy – the Bhupi Rana gang. A number of clashes and executions have been reported between the gangs in several north Haryana districts like Ambala, Panchkula, Yamunanagar and Kurukshetra.Ambala superintendent of police Jashandeep Singh Randhawa said his teams were working on several initial tips, adding that the murder was a fallout of the enmity between the gangs over the 2014 murder of a Bhupi Rana aide, Mohammad Mushtaq, in Barara.A senior cop said they were looking into the role of gangster Virender Pratap, alias Kala Rana, who was also a co-accused in the 2014 murder case.He had gone missing soon after the murder in which gangster Shamsher Singh, alias Monu Rana, was sentenced to life imprisonment.“Kala is a native of Karnal and later shifted to Yamunanagar. Other than the 2014 case, he was recently named in the murder of a Yamunanagar businessman, Raghunath Prajapati, in which Sandeep, alias Kala Jatheri, confessed to his involvement. Kala is also facing cases for threatening the Yamunanagar CIA-2 in-charge last month and seeking extortion money from mining contractors in Yamunanagar in August 2020, among others. He currently operates from a foreign country,” the police official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ambala-gang-war-20-bullets-crossed-gangster-s-body-four-found-inside-autopsy-reveals-101642798599011.html
22-01-2022||Noida||2022 UP assembly elections: 73 file nominations for five seats in Ghaziabad||When the time for filing nominations under first phase of the assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh ended on Friday, there were at least 73 candidates in the fray for the five assembly seats in Ghaziabad district, the provisional figures from the district election office indicated. The assembly constituencies of Loni, Muradnagar, Sahibabad, Ghaziabad and Modinagar together have 2,899,484 eligible voters, as per the latest electoral rolls. While many candidates filed a single set of the prescribed nomination form, a few candidates -- Sunil Kumar Sharma of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Chhavi Yadav of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Sachin Sharma of the AAP, Nand Kishor Gurjar of the BJP, Atul Garg of the BJP, Madan Bhaiya of Rashtriya Lok Dal, Yameen Malik of the Congress, Sushant Goyal of the Congress and Sudesh Sharma of the RLD -- filed multiple forms.“Many candidates file multiple forms as a fail-safe against one of their forms getting rejected during scrutiny. They can file a maximum of four set of forms and parties also field substitute candidates (as per Form B) in order to remain in the fray even if the candidature of the main candidate gets rejected,” said Vivek Srivastava, additional district election officer According to district election officer RK Singh, 13 nominations were filed till Friday from Loni, 18 each from Sahibabad and Ghaziabad while 16 were from Muradnagar and eight from Modinagar assembly segments. According to district records, 42 nominations were filed till Thursday while 31 were filed on the last day on Friday. In all, 73 nominations were filed for the five assembly seats.During the 2017 elections, 88 candidates had filed their nomination papers while 53 contested the elections from the five seats in Ghaziabad,after scrutiny and withdrawal of nominations. As per the schedule announced by the Election Commission of India, January 24 has been fixed for scrutiny of nominations while the selected candidates may withdraw their names till January 27. Thereafter, the list of final candidates will be rolled out for the polls on February 10. Political experts said the practice of filing more than one set of forms and substitute candidates during the nomination is an old one. “It is generally due to fear or to safeguard against rejection of candidature, on one account or the other during the scrutiny stage, that people file multiple sets of forms. Since the forms require a lot of personal details in prescribed formats, some people generally file more than one. The replacement candidates also file nominations as a fail-safe, in case the main candidate of a party gets rejected, the other steps up,” said Dr Virendra Singh, associate professor (political science), MMH Degree College, Ghaziabad. There were other reasons too, said Vikrant Sharma, a criminal lawyer at Ghaziabad court. “Since each form has a different proposer, some candidates try to portray that they have a proposer who may belong to a particular caste or religion. Although no party or candidate would admit it, but caste equations play a vital role in elections. In the past, when incidents of violence were rampant during elections, people also fielded their relatives or family members as substitute candidates so that they may contest if the primary candidate suffered any harm,” said Sharma. “Despite the Election Commission of India issuing detailed guidelines, many still find it difficult to fill up forms and attach the required documents. They take the help of lawyers for that. There is a need for awareness sessions for candidates and help desks may be set up to assist them,” Sharma said.

22-01-2022||Chandigarh||Panthers Party protests outside Nirvachan Bhawan, seeks publication of delimitation report||Seeking immediate publication of the delimitation report followed by early assembly elections in J&K, former minister and chairman of the Panthers Party Harsh Dev Singh along with party activists held a protest demonstration outside Nirvachan Bhawan here on Friday. The infuriated protesters raised slogans accusing the BJP government of colluding with the delimitation commission in delaying and denying the assembly elections to satiate its vested political interests. The party leaders questioned the credibility of the delimitation commission for inexplicable procrastination of publication of its much-trumpeted draft report in the public domain despite a lapse of 22 months since its constitution. Alleging subversion of democracy in J&K post Article 370 abrogation, Harsh Dev Singh claimed that the BJP-led government appeared to be averse to the idea of holding assembly elections in the new setup. “Where is Delimitation Commission? Has it gone missing? Why its draft report has not been put in the public domain as of now? While the BJP regime was drum beating over the ‘fudged narrative’ of increase of seats for Jammu, the fact remained that it had failed to initiate any concrete action except the constitution of the Delimitation Commission on March 6, 2020. The rumours were agog that the commission was dancing to the tunes of the BJP government,” he said. Harsh further said, “It has been intentionally delaying the process to deny elections in J&K to allow the saffron party to run its proxy rule in the erstwhile Dogra state through its chosen ones.” He further added that while delimitation of DDC constituencies in J&K was effected within one week by the present dispensation in 2020, the draft report of the Delimitation Commission which was supposed to be put in the public domain had failed to see the light of the day despite the term of commission nearing its completion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panthers-party-protests-outside-nirvachan-bhawan-seeks-publication-of-delimitation-report-101642797880286.html

22-01-2022||Chandigarh||Readers’ Take: Reclaim the night, curb crime||Sensitisation at grassroots requiredThough the importance of policing cannot be denied, making tricity safe for women needs to be addressed at other levels too. The fear and insecurities created by the pandemic are a major trigger, leading to venting of anger and frustration. Despite societal changes, we are still predominantly in a patriarchal setup. To counter this, we need sensitisation and awareness drives at the grassroots level, for which the police and the civil society needs to work in tandem. Renu Mathur, PanchkulaPublic spaces & transport should be made saferAccording to World Health Organisation (WHO), one in three women has experienced some kind of physical or sexual violence. To eliminate this problem, simple measures like shifting a bus stop, installing streetlights or constructing public toilets can greatly improve women’s safety in tricity. Public transport is crucial for economic development and should be made safer at night. Raising awareness is the first step to building support and mobilising key stakeholders to work to reduce and prevent violence and the threat of violence against women and girls in public spaces. Art is one powerful way to bring attention to harassment. Technology is having a profound impact on women’s ability to raise awareness against sexual harassment, report assault and unsafe areas, share personal stories, and mobilise across tricity. It helps to empower women to stand up for their right to safe public spaces. Vineet Gandhi, ChandigarhTrack criminals hiding in plain sightFirstly, the major reason for crimes against women is the presence of criminals and inimical elements who hide in plain sight in the civilised society. Other reasons are many, but not nearly as significant as this, the most overarching one. Consequently, targeting them and bringing down them to book should be the society’s highest priority. We have technology and means to do so, but lack the single point, undistracted focus that is at the heart of any strategy to counter this looming menace. A highly planned city as Chandigarh tricity has only so many places a criminal can breed and slink away to after perpetrating a crime. Such areas have been identified and sanitised previously too, what’s needed is a will to completely eliminate criminals once it’s clear there’s even a shadow of doubt something may have been done that can be termed as crime adjacent. Any delay or half-hearted measure can only delay the inevitable showdown that civilised society needs to eventually have with criminals. Ajay Dogra, PanchkulaVirus not the only enemyImposing night curfew to control the spread of Covid-19 infection has created more problems than it was meant to solve. Rape of a female passenger by an autorikshaw driver in a place like Sector 17 during curfew hours, is the crime that could not possibly occur if there was no curfew. Murder of two women in Maloya and Mauli Jagran last week, can also be somewhere attributed to the fact that criminals could easily get away with the crime without the possibility of any witness around. UT administration will do to review the decision or else ensure additional police patrolling and proper illumination at all the secluded places in the city.SC Luthra, Chandigarh Promote gender equityViolence against women is the manifestation of historically unequal power relations between man and woman. Successful prevention requires political commitment and leadership for implementing laws and policies efficiently to promote gender equity. Police and the judicial system are unfortunately not as active and prompt as desired for the delivery of justice to the victims. Most of the crimes in Chandigarh, in the recent past, were committed by three-wheeler drivers and persons from other states. Police should do well to get a fresh verification of three-wheeler drivers, tents and PGs done. All religious and educational institutions should promote respect for women and girl children. Parents should also educate their children against crime and criminals.Kidar Nath Sharma, via emailSelf defence classes for allSelf defence is a means by which we can protect ourselves from those who would do us harm. It entails simple things like using our body parts, things in our possession like keyrings etc as a means of defending ourselves. Self-defence is for everybody. Today almost everyone from teenagers to grannies, to office executives and retired couples, need at least a basic knowledge of simple self-protection measures. Learning martial arts can be very rewarding at a personal level, but for most people. People who have little physical skill can easily absorb and use the basic forms of self-defence. B S Handa, via emailBetter infrastructureIncidents of violence against women and girls are increasing and continue to plague roads, public transport facilities and places of recreation too. To make tricity roads safer for women, the administration needs to improve the streetlight cover in the city, introduce women-friendly transportation facilities, bring more CCTV cameras, equip all public transport with GPS-tracking and increasing policing. Sessions on prevention of sexual harassment should be held for both men and women. Also, we need to make girls and women self-sufficient to protect themselves in case of any eventuality. Prabhjot NagpalInstill fear of law in criminalsThe society must stop viewing women as the weaker sex. Self-defence classes will go a long way in helping women protect themselves. Besides, the age-old patriarchy must go and women and girls must be encouraged to speak up against form of harassment. Policing must be strengthened and law enforcement agencies must also play an active role in bringing to book the perpetrators so that women and girls feel more confident about speaking out about such harassment. Stricter punishment can help instill the fear of law in the criminals. Abhishek Kumar, Chandigarh Keep tabs on cab, auto driversChandigarh administration has failed to curb the menace of crime rate against women in the city. Dense forest areas, with no streetlights and no cop deployment, give ample opportunities to the criminals to commit crime. Security should be beefed up at secluded places and special light arrangements should be made to avoid such incidents. During winters, night patrolling should be beefed up and cops should be deployed at every one kilometre. Illegal occupants, migrants, and squatters should be checked. ID cards with their background written on it should be made mandatory for auto and cab drivers. All public transports should be connected to a centralised system to keep track of the drivers to safeguard women against crime in the city.Abhilasha Gupta, MohaliPolicies for women’s safetyIt is unfortunate that women are considered to be objects of desire as a result of which heinous crimes of murders and rapes are committed by the unscrupulous elements. Policy rejig is needed to dent this menace. Efficient police patrolling at night must coupled with police and law enforcement agencies working together.Raj Kumar Kapoor, RoparWomen safety is a basic necessity Chandigarh has a woman MP and a woman mayor, yet still women’s safety becomes an agenda only after some untoward incidents occur. Women safety should be a priority for the lawmakers. Better street lighting, better CCTV coverage, panic buttons at public places etc should be created. Police too needs to up the ante in this matter.Kampreet Gill, ChandigarhNight patrolling needs to be strengthenedCrime graph is vertically rising in the tricity. Rape, murder, carjacking, snatchings are happening daily. Not only women but children, elderly and individuals are victims. Senior police officials and administration officers should supervise night patrolling. Forest guards should be deployed 24 hours in forest area as most crimes are committed there. Navjot Singh Chhabra, MohaliHarsher punishment for crimes against womenWomen have been suffering atrocities from partners, strangers etc. It is high time that we find ways to protect women from heinous crimes like rape and murder. We need more cops on the ground, especially women cops, to make women feel safer. Also, we need harsher punishments for those perpetuate crimes against women. Kundan Lal Sharma, MohaliHold cops accountableThe three recent crimes against women that took place in the city must enrage us all. A city that cannot ensure safety for its women is of no good. There must be exemplary punishment for the perpetrators of crime. Law and order seems to have gone out of order in the city. The in-charge of the police station concerned in the area must be held accountable for crimes on streets. Dark spots in the city also need urgent police verification and the drivers of all autos and cabs must be given strict orders to ensure the safety of their passengers. Time to time workshops for them can prove handy. P Mehta, via email No lessons learnt from the pastThe recent cases of crimes against women, are not the first case. In the past too, many such crimes, involving auto drivers, have taken place. But nothing was done to check such criminals. Why don’t autos have GPS systems like cabs. Most autos are run by migrants, who feel that they can flee to their hometown easily after the crime. Introducing women-only buses for educational institutions, deployment of more women constables in plain clothes at public places etc will also help. Also, registering of complaints must be made easier for women. Advocate Vijay Malia, ChandigarhIntensify night patrolUT is facing a rise in crimes against women. To check it, police should intensify night patrol on bicycle or on foot in civilian clothes. As the three cities are clinging to each other with multiple entry points, their police should also work in tandem. All dark areas should be illuminated properly. Police and citizens through Residents Welfare Association should work together to eliminate the crime.Sqn Ldr Manjit Singh Johar (retd.), ChandigarhPolitical, administrative will to bring change missingPolice and administration make many policies to tackle women’s safety issues but sadly, are able to achieve precious little as the problems at the grassroots levels has not been addressed. Every few months, we come across cases of rapes and murders. When such a crime takes place, initially, there is a lot of hue and cry but slowly, it dies down. Unless there is political and administrative will, nothing much will change. Aarti Verma, PanchkulaPolicing needs to improveTo make city safer for women, police should keep patrolling external as well as internal roads all the time. Hidden CCTV cameras with audio should be installed on the city roads. Secret nakas should be conducted. Police helpline should be made operational. Only vigilant cops should be recruited by experienced recruiters. There should be security in markets, hotels and restaurants. Cops should not be lazy and should remain alert all the time. Cops should investigate the crimes properly. Saikrit Gulati, ChandigarhPlug loopholes in systemThe recent rise of various forms of crimes against women in the tricity area has raised many questions regarding the safety of women especially during night. The primary reason of course is the poor policing but we cannot overlook other reasons also behind all such crimes. The criminals are aware of the gaping loopholes in all the existing laws towards protection of women. There is no fear of police and other law enforcement agencies in the minds of the criminals. At the family level, we need to inculcate values in boys regarding extending respect to all females in the society. Moral education in schools can also help towards drilling values in our society. All women should also be taught skills to defend themselves in case of assault. Anil Kumar Yadav, ChandigarhKeep safety tools like pepper spray handyPolice is not alone to blame in this issue. Well-lit roads and CCTV cameras on every road can help curb crimes against women. Girls should also carry some kind of safety tool, for example a pepper spray, a small knife or something with which they can attack their attackers. Women also need to equip themselves with self-defence techniques. While venturing out at night, it is good idea to share your location with a trusted confidante so that help can arrive quickly in case of some trouble. Ishita Nara, PanchkulaRound the clock surveillanceCrime against women has increased in tricity. It is high time that separate women police cells be opened in each police station for speedy trial of women-related crimes NGOs and social organisations should also be involved in carrying out night patrolling. Lastly, high definition CCTV cameras be installed and round-the-clock surveillance for early detection of crime in tricity must be imposed. Col TBS Bedi (retd), MohaliField staff must be increasedCrimes against women are a matter of concern not only for the Chandigarh administration, but all of India. Crimes against women like rape, eve-teasing and domestic violence are increasing every year. Each time, the administration demands strict against the accused, but in maximum cases, they are unable to punish all those guilty. More field staff has to be deployed and CCTV cameras must be installed in every sector and village. Avinash Goyal, Chandigarh Admns must put plan in placeThe three incidents of horrific crimes against women reported from tricity in the past week are truly horrifying. It seems that police and administrations of tricity are not taking any lessons from the past and if proper action plans were in place, these crimes could have been avoided. The security of citizens of tricity, especially women, should be the top priority of the police and to ensure that, there has to be 24X7 vigilance on all the roads through patrolling vans and CCTV cameras must be installed in every place.Sanjay Chopra, Mohali Patrolling must be intensifiedThe rising graph of heinous crimes against women has put the nation and society to shame. It is obligatory to make public spaces safe for women at all times. The forest areas in Mauili Jagran and Maloya are especially unsafe, as the streets are poorly-lit. Police patrolling must be intensified and the municipal corporation(MC) should install streetlights at the earliest. Registering autorickshaw drivers should also be made mandatory. While the strictest action should be taken against the culprits, it is imperative to change the patriarchal mindset of the society at large. Usha Verma, Chandigarh Auto drivers must carry id cardsThe police department is totally failing to control crime, even during curfew .The authorities of tricity must form a sub-committee to control crime and the police must be instructed to perform their duties properly. Auto drivers must carry their identity cards and display the owner’s details on the vehicle. Vehicles should be impounded if the driver does not provide documents Police patrolling needs to be increased in the winter nights and they should conduct inspections at vacant plots and forest area. Sumesh Kumar Badhwar, Mohali Women must be cautiousApart from police patrolling being increased, women must also be cautious. They must not wait at secluded dark places and avoid taking lift from unknown people. If they take a lift in case of an emergency, they should take a photo of the vehicle and forward to any friend immediately. Inderjit Singh Sidhu, MohaliAdmn needs to wake up to women safety It has once again come to the fore that the city is far from safe for women. What is more shocking that no arrests have been made for the cold-blooded murders. If the administration is serious about making the city safer for women, it needs to go for a complete overhaul of the police force. Patrolling needs to be stepped up in and around the vulnerable spots across the city. The authorities concerned need to identify the dark spots and order installation of streetlights around forested areas. Ramesh K Dhiman, Chandigarh Reader of the weekSelf-defence is the best weapon The three crimes – two murders and a rape – that took place in the city in the last few weeks bring out the loopholes in the system. Cops need to be stationed, not just at crowded spots, but also in secluded areas where such crimes are most likely to take place. Women should arm themselves with pepper spray etc while venturing out at night. Knowledge of self-defence techniques will be an added benefit. Such lessons must be compulsorily imparted in schools and colleges. Police should also promote women safety apps, with which help can be called for with the click of a button. Omika Sachdeva, via emailExpertsSafer streets We have identified dark spots in the city and written to authorities to install streetlights there. Night patrolling has also been increased and all calls to police control room, especially reporting crimes against women are immediately attended. A night-drop facility is also available with Chandigarh police. Shruti Arora, ASP, (South), ChandigarhAwareness Women safety apps, installation of CCTV cameras, awareness regarding the safest routes to travel at night, and self-defense techniques can help ensure women’s safety.Harjeet Singh, Mohali senior superintendent of policeAction Police have taken every precaution to ensure that there is a check on crime rate. We have installed CCTV cameras, lights at dark spots, have made women aware. But still if any such heinous crime happens, then it is dealt at priority by police force. Any crime against woman is taken very seriously and immediate action is taken. Mamta Sodha, ACP, PanchkulaCommunity policing Community policing is needed and each neighbourhood must hire at least a chowkidaar at night so that women feel safe. RWA members must also contribute more as the police and authorities are already doing a lot. CCTV cameras can help make neighborhoods safer.Manoj Kumar, associate professor of sociology at PGGCG- Sector 11, ChandigarhMindset change Authorities must increase patrolling in suburban parts, where most crimes take place. However, this is a short-term fix. To tackle this problem, awareness needs to be imparted at school-level to change the mindset of people. The employers must also arrange safe transportation for women who work the night shift so that such incidents can be avoided.

22-01-2022||Chandigarh||57,862 illegal buildings constructed in Ludhiana between 2016-20: Inquiry||A whopping 57,862 illegal buildings were erected in the city between 2016 and 2020, an inquiry has found, sparking a blame game among municipal corporation councillors. The report, which was submitted by municipal corporation additional commissioner Rishipal Singh, was prepared by comparing power connections issued by the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) against the building plans approved during the period. As per the report, the PSPCL had issued 76,770 connections in areas falling under the civic body’s jurisdiction. However, the civic body has only issued approved plans for 7,471 buildings. “Biased report”: Councillors Though a section of the Opposition is claiming that the report is “biased” and many of these buildings may not have been constructed in the last five years, others have been taking potshots at the ruling Congress saying that widespread corruption, and rampant illegal construction had been prevalent during its regime. Bhartiya Janata Party district president Pushpinder Singal alleged that the Congress MLAs and Cabinet ministers have provided patronage to violators. “Leaders of the ruling party, stop officials from acting against violations. They have caused losses to the tune of hundreds of crores to the public exchequer. An independent inquiry should be carried out against Congress MLAs,” said Singal, while promising to conduct an inquiry, should the MC be voted to power. Meanwhile, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) trained its guns against the Congress , SAD and BJP and alleged that the three mainstream parties were collectively responsible for shortage of parking space on city roads, and traffic chaos. AAP spokesperson Ahbaab Grewal said, “Both the Congress and the previous SAD-BJP governments are responsible for the issue. With construction of illegal commercial buildings being allowed in residential area, traffic chaos is seen across the city.” While maintaining that the report was biased, SAD district president Shiromani Akali Dal Harabhajan Singh Dang placed the blame squarely on the shoulders of the ruling party. He said, “Many building owners got a sub-metre installed in the same building, and many complexes were constructed with a number of power connections. The additional number of power connections has also been added to the list. Labour quarters and vehras have also been constructed with different power connections in the same building.” Notably, in June 2021, BJP leaders led by state vice-president Parveen Bansal had also objected to thousands of ‘absurd’ notices issued by the civic body for illegal constructions, and the MC had to stop issuing notices after receiving flak from the Opposition and public.No action taken over last 2 monthsThough additional commissioner submitted the report with municipal corporation commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal, no action has yet been taken. Singh has recommended forensic audit of the building branch in his report, and has held all officials of building branch, including assistant town planners, and building inspectors responsible for the illegal constructions. Claiming that the failure of the municipal corporation has caused a loss of ₹300-500 crore to the public exchequer, an activist has also written to the chief secretary seeking a vigilance probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/57862-illegal-buildings-constructed-in-ludhiana-between-201620inquiry-101642797039307.html
22-01-2022||Noida||Despite campaigning curbs and Covid, 52 nominations filed in Gautam Budh Nagar||By the end of Friday -- the last day of filing nominations for the three assembly seats of Noida, Dadri and Jewar in Gautam Budh Nagar -- 52 candidates across political parties filed 97 nominations for the Uttar Pradesh assembly election to be held from February 10 to March 7 in seven phases.Gautam Budh Nagar goes to polls in the first phase on February 10. Under phase 1 of the election, candidates began filing their nominations on January 14. The last date to file nominations was January 21; nominations will be scrutinised on January 24, and the last date of withdrawal of nominations is January 27, according to the Election Commission of India.Twenty-three candidates in Noida filed 34 nominations, 16 candidates in Dadri filed 36 nominations and 13 candidates in Jewar filed 27 nominations by Friday. All candidates from major parties, including those from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Congress, have filed their nominations, according to party workers. Many have also filed multiple nominations for fear of being rejected, they said. While it is a common practice for candidates to file multiple nominations, candidates in the district have also learned their lessons from experience.In the Lok Sabha election of 2019, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) candidate Shweta Sharma’s candidature from Gautam Budh Nagar was rejected as she failed to get the mandatory 10 proposers required for a candidate who is not from a recognised national or regional party in the state.All three sitting MLAs in the district have also filed multiple nominations. While Tejpal Nagar of Dadri has filed two nominations, Pankaj Singh of Noida has filed three nominations and Dhirendra Singh of Jewar has filed four nominations -- the maximum number allowed in an election.According to Anubha Vashishth, School of Humanities and Social Science, Sharda University, “people wait five years to prepare for elections, the festival of democracy. Especially for serious contenders, the elections are what they have spent the last few years of their lives on. They don’t want to take any risk while filing a nomination that can be rejected based on a technicality. Filling up the forms can be a complicated process. So, it is common practice for candidates to file multiple nominations.”While political experts expected that the total number of nominations would be lesser than those during previous elections because of restrictions in place due to the pandemic, the difference is minimal.During the 2017 assembly elections, 31 nominations were filed and 13 were rejected in Noida. Of these, 14 candidates had finally contested for the Noida seat, while 12 had to forfeit their deposits. Similarly, for the Dadri assembly seat, 18 candidates had filed their nominations, of whom four were rejected and one withdrew his candidature. Eventually, 13 candidates filed their nominations, of whom 11 had to forfeit their deposits. For the Jewar seat, 13 candidates filed their nominations, of whom six were rejected and seven contested the elections. Five had to forfeit their deposits.The candidates who contest elections need to forfeit their deposits if they fail to get one-sixth of the total valid votes cast.Experts say that it is encouraging that the number of candidates is not very less as compared to the previous elections, despite the pandemic as it shows growing political participation.“The age group of the candidates is to be taken into consideration. If relatively younger people are filing nominations then it shows growing political vigour and initiative in the region. The fact that nominations, and especially rallies, are being conducted online also attracts more people since this provides those individuals who do not have a very strong financial background an opportunity to fight an election, and allows them to pose a challenge to the centuries-old tradition, which has nurtured the money-power nexus,” said Shalini Saxena, associate professor (political science), Amity Institute of Social Sciences, Amity University.The four election observers for the district also reached Gautam Budh Nagar on Friday. District magistrate Suhas LY informed that IAS officer L Franklin has been deputed as the observer for Noida and Dadri constituencies. Similarly, IAS officer Rajesh Dhiman has been appointed as the observer for the Jewar assembly segment, while IPS officer Rajendra Kumar Meena has been appointed as the police observer. IRS officer N Ashok Babu has been deputed as the expenditure observer. The DM said that residents can register election-related complaints with the observers concerned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/despite-campaigning-curbs-and-covid-52-nominations-filed-in-gautam-budh-nagar-101642796919458.html
22-01-2022||Chandigarh||Grenade launcher, 3.79kg RDX recovered in Gurdaspur, 1 held||The Punjab Police on Friday claimed to have thwarted a possible terror attack around Republic Day by recovering a 40mm Under Barrel Grenade Launcher (UBGL) with two compatible grenades, 3.79kg RDX, nine electrical detonators and two sets of timer devices for IEDs from Gurdaspur. Inspector general of police (IGP, Border Range) Mohinish Chawla, said, “As per the information, UBGL is a short-range grenade launching area weapon with an effective range of 150 meters and It could be detrimental to the VVIP security as well.” “The recovery was made on the disclosure of Malkeet Singh, a resident of Gazikot village in Gurdaspur, who was arrested on Thursday, based on secret information. The police have also booked Malkeet’s aides, identified as Sukhpreet Singh alias Sukh Ghuman, Tharanjot Singh alias Thanna, and Sukhmeetpal Singh alias Sukh Bikhariwal; all residents of Gurdaspur, besides, Pakistan-based International Sikh Youth Federation (ISYF) chief Lakhbir Singh Rode and fugitive gangster Arshdeep Singh alias Arsh Dalla,” he said in a press release issued here. Chawla said investigations revealed that Malkeet was in contact with Sukh Ghuman, a conduit of Rode, a designated terrorist, and fugitive gangster Arsh Dalla of Moga, now based in Canada. The consignment of explosives was sent by Rode from Pakistan, he added. Meanwhile, Gurdaspur SSP Nanak Singh said the role of Malkeet Singh in retrieving the consignments of firearms/explosives was revealed during the investigations into the recent ISYF terror module busted by the SBS Nagar Police. An FIR under sections 17 and 18 of UAPA, sections 4 and 5 of Explosive Substances Act, Section 120B of the IPC, and sections 25, 27, 54 and 59 of Arms Act has been registered at Dinanagar police station. “Investigations are on to identify remaining members of the module,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/grenade-launcher-3-79kg-rdx-recovered-in-gurdaspur-1-held-101642796860908.html
22-01-2022||Chandigarh||Will file defamation case against Kejriwal: Channi||Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Friday said he will file a defamation case against Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejrwal for maligning his image using morphed pictures and dubbing him a “dishonest man” after the recent cash recovery by the ED during raids at multiple locations in Punjab. “I have sought permission from the Congress high command to file a defamation case against Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal for posting my morphed picture with cash on his official social media accounts and terming me a dishonest person. It is highly condemnable and unacceptable,” Channi said, while addressing mediapersons in his constituency, Chamkaur Sahib. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had on Wednesday said that it seized cash amounting to over ₹10 crore, including about ₹8 crore from the house of Channi’s nephew during raids conducted in connection with an anti-money laundering investigation against illegal sand-mining operations in the poll-bound state. Channi said Kejriwal was in the habit of making uncorroborated allegations and then apologising for the same. “He had tendered apologies to Akali leader Bikram Majithia, Union minister Nitin Gadkari, Congress leader Kapil Sibal and former Union finance minister late Arun Jaitley after making accusations against them,” the Punjab CM said. The chief minister said it can be his mistake that he did not keep an eye on his relatives but why is Kejriwal connecting things to him. “What money came to me, what is my fault in this? Why are you dragging me into this? Someone else’s money has been seized... there was a raid at ten places in Punjab, why are you linking me with it? Had the money been seized from me, the ED would have conducted raids at my house, arrested me, questioned me,” Channi said. He also asked if a person’s son gets into a drug habit, will his father be punished for it? “My sons are here, my wife is here. Hang me if my family has any ill-gotten money but why am I being dragged into this issue,” he said. Channi said he does not even have money to erect his hoardings for polls in his constituency or to run a TV ad campaign, “whereas the AAP has installed hoardings worth ₹200 crore in Punjab, besides running election campaign advertisements on television”. He questioned where the party had got the funds from? “They are defaming a person who does not even have funds to fight his own election,” he said. To another question, he said it was his party’s prerogative to announce a chief ministerial face ahead of the February 20 polls.

22-01-2022||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | AAP ups the ante, fields KNS Kang from Dakha||In the run up to the Punjab assembly polls, the political scenario in the district is an ever-changing tapestry. In an unforeseen development, AAP has upped the ante by fielding KNS Kang, a distinguished businessman, who heads the PCTE Group Of Institutes from Dakha constituency.Before Kang’s entry, the odds of Congress candidate Sandeep Sandhu and sitting SAD MLA Manpreet Singh Ayali winning seemed even. However, Kang’s entry has intensified the contest. Kang, who is former Ludhiana Management Association (LMA) president, and former Smart City Project director, enjoys considerable clout among the intelligentsia and the business community. A long-time loyalist of AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal, Kang had hosted the Delhi chief minister at his house during the previous assembly elections and had even campaigned for party candidate HS Phoolka. Notably, AAP had won the seat in 2017 assembly elections, with Phoolka securing 58,923 votes. However, it had to bite dust during the byelection, with their candidate Amandeep Singh Mohie securing just 2,804 votes. SAD MLA Manpreet Singh Ayali had secured 66,297 votes in the 2019 by-election, while Sandeep Singh Sandhu had been the runner-up with 51,625 votes.In 2017 assembly elections, AAP had fielded Phoolka from Dakha constituency and he was elected the MLA with 58,923 votes, defeating his nearest candidate Manpreet Singh Ayali by a margin of 4,169 votes.All three candidates have a strong base in the constituency. While Ayali has homeground advantage and has been credited with developing parks and facilities in the villages, Sandhu has remained halka in-charge of the constituency and enjoys immense support in Dakha Mandi and the rural belt of the constituency. Meanwhile, Kang has set up his educational institutes in Baddowal, which falls in Dakha constituency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-aap-ups-the-ante-fields-kns-kang-from-dakha-101642796678889.html

22-01-2022||Chandigarh||Sukhpal Khaira’s son points out ‘chinks’ in ED charge sheet against his father||Punjab Congress leader Sukhpal Singh Khaira’s son Mehtab Singh on Friday issued a statement saying the Enforcement Directorate’s challan (referring to charge sheet) “exposes the deep-rooted conspiracy to malign, intimidate and harass my father”, besides a mischievous attempt to keep him out of the election frame. As reported by HT on Friday, the central agency has filed a charge sheet against Khaira under the money-laundering charges for allegedly having links with drug smugglers. The agency has said Khaira’s expenses were in excess of his income. Mehtab said, “The ED while raiding our premises on March 9, 2021, had led loose a plethora of allegations, targeting my father as an international drug kingpin, having fake passports, having illegal foreign currency/donations, amassing ill-gotten wealth through drug money etc., but in its challan, it has miserably failed to prove any of the charges and has assumed the role of a mere income tax inspector.” He said the charge sheet contains no mention of illegal foreign funds to the tune of $ (US) 1.19 lakh collected by my father as alleged at the time of his arrest on November 11 last year. “The web of concocted lies built by the ED in its 80-page challan only revolves around ₹3.82-crore difference between our income and expenditure from April 2014 to March 2020. The ED which claims to be the premier agency of India to prevent money laundering stooped to a low to investigate the marriage expenses of my sister’s and my marriage in 2016 and 2019, respectively, and small renovation of our Chandigarh house. Surprisingly, while indicating a difference of ₹3.82 crore in our income and expenditure for a period of six years (2014 to 2020), the ED has wilfully and purposely ignored to include our two agricultural loan limit accounts of Union Bank of India and the regional Capital Bank, Kapurthala, to the tune of ₹2 crore raised by my father for the purpose of said marriages,” Mehtab Singh said. “Similarly the ED did not take into account approximately ₹60 lakh received during the said weddings, or loans raised from closed friends and relatives; and most importantly, our family agricultural income of ₹1.5 crore (approx) during these six years, which sufficiently explains the said difference between our income and expenditure,” he added. The ED, without providing any proof or evidence, has verbally attributed the ₹3.82 crore as the proceeds of crime (drug money) received from Gurdev Singh (mastermind of 2015 Fazilka drug smuggling racket), he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sukhpal-khaira-s-son-points-out-chinks-in-ed-charge-sheet-against-his-father-101642796500790.html
22-01-2022||Gurugram||Gurugram: State Rera to reduce average time for plea resolution to 15 days||The Haryana Real Estate Regulatory Authority (H-Rera) plans to reduce the average time taken to resolve a petition--from three months to 15 days-- this year onwards. To achieve this objective, the authority will hold summary trials and set up a digital judicial court to help reduce arbitration time and adjudicate disputes between homebuyers and developers, according to officials in the know.Dr KK Khandelwal, chairman, H-Rera, Gurugram, said that currently the authority takes around three months to resolve a petition, and reducing this time would greatly benefit homebuyers, who are already suffering due to project delays.Another reason for the authority to embrace the idea of digital courts and summary trials is that the resolution of complaints has slowed down over the past couple of years due to repeated disruptions because of the pandemic. According to data shared by H-Rera, the authority received 5,733 complaints from homebuyers in 2021 and was able to resolve only 1,669 cases--a disposal rate of around 30%. However, in 2020, the authority received 4,830 complaints and managed to resolve 3,832 cases, a disposal rate of around 79%.A comparison of the data in the last two years revealed that while the disposal of cases reduced by almost 50% in 2021, the number of complaints rose by around 20% last year.Pointing to the frequent lockdowns as the reason, Dr Khandelwal said that disruptions caused by Covid-19 last year impacted the work, but the authority had now decided to adopt the digital court system and summary trials, to accelerate the resolution of complaints. “The digital court will allow a person to lodge a petition from anywhere without being physically present. The decisions will be faster and based on quick facts. The summary trials will also enable quick resolution of complaints,” he said.According to legal experts, in summary trials, procedures are simplified, cases are decided speedily and recording is done summarily. Mostly minor cases and small offences are tried using this method. The objective of these trials is to reduce the high caseload in a judicial system.“We learnt a lot over the last three years and faced teething troubles, which have been resolved. We will use a mix of technology and human resources to optimise results for homebuyers. Rera Act also faced legal challenges but these are now over as the apex court has decided the matter and we are poised for better implementation and enforcement,” he said.Khandelwal added that of the 82,000 petitions disposed of by H-Rera courts across the country, the bench in Gurugram had disposed of almost 18% of the petitions filed across the country.“Since the inception of the Gurugram bench, we received 19,136 petitions, of which 14,801 were disposed of, he said. The authority said that it had managed a disposal rate of 75% since its inception in 2017.

22-01-2022||Delhi||R-Day parade: Young dancers to showcase myriad moves||New Delhi Among the many firsts this year, Republic Day 2022 will not see participation of school children in the usual awe-inspiring annual parade at Rajpath. Instead, as you stay glued to your TV sets to view the spectacle on the ceremonial boulevard, get set to witness around 500 young dancers, from across the country, who will get together to showcase a gamut of dance forms — including Giddha (Punjab), Maharashtra’s martial arts, Manipuri from the Northeast, Kathakali (Kerala), and Bharatanatyam (Tamil Nadu). To be performed in a synchronised choreography, this recital will mark the 75 glorious years of India’s independence as part of Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav celebrations. Rehearsing as part of 36 teams that won the pan India Vande Bharatam dance competition, these enthusiastic troupes comprising students and young professionals are presently practising at Indira Gandhi Stadium. “We are rehearsing to perform semi-classical. I’m learning Kathak since six years, and so happy that while being a student I’ve got a chance to travel to Delhi to perform at such a platform. Everyone here speaks a different language and comes from a different culture. There’s lots to learn, and as an artiste I’m so grateful to be able perform for my country,” says Kathak dancer Heta Patil, a student of MBA (Finance) from Surat, Gujarat. Kolhapur (Maharashtra) based BSc student Prathmesh Patil, spins a martial pash (chakra), quite effortlessly, as part of the folk segment of the 12-minute choreography. “Back home, we practice for two hours daily. We have struggled a lot and it’s great to be at the national stage today. No other group in Kolhapur has reached this level, and we feel humne Kolhapur ko aur apni mitti ko proud kiya hai,” says Patil. And 26-year-old Abhinav Mangure, who works in a Pune-based company, adds, “Humare group mein sab students ya young working professionals hain. Dance is our passion and I’m happy to bring the native martial art form of Mardani Khel Yuddh Kala to a parade that we have all been watching since our childhood.”“We watched the parade on television, and it’s wonderful that we are going to perform in the Republic Day parade. It’s a big boost to our confidence as budding artistes,” says Chennai-based Bharatanatyam dancer and college student Smriti Venkatesh. Kathak exponent Rani Khanam, who is one of the four choreographers appointed to curate the recital, says, “The opening segment will involve big props and elephants. Our theme concept is Unity in Diversity and Naya Bharat. We are trying to connect all regions from north to south, and trying to showcase the spirituality of Buddhism with Hinduism. We are showing colours, customs, and culture of India through our dance. The expressions and rituals of each group are different, yet so vibrant.”“In the end, we will create a formation in which the dancers will resemble the feathers of the peacock, our national bird,” says Maitreyee Pahari, Kathak and Manipuri exponent. And Santosh Nair, who has formal training in Kathakali and Chhau and choreographs contemporary dance as well, shares, “The idea is to show our diverse culture, so it’s a beautiful idea to have a mix and match of each group. We are showcasing our progressive and modern India and the theme of Atmanirbhar Bharat. The buzzword now is youth, and this is a good way to bring forth the young artistic talent on the national stage.”Author tweets @siddhijainnFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rday-parade-young-dancers-to-showcase-myriad-moves-101642796204900.html
22-01-2022||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | BJP finally releases first list of candidates||The saffron party released the first list of candidates who will contest the Punjab assembly polls from the district on Friday. The list features two former bureaucrats, an advocate, a turncoat leader and a businessman. Former IAS officer SR Laddhar, who had merged his political outfit, the Kirti Kisan Sher-e-Punjab Party,with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in December, will contest from Gill constituency, which is at present represented by another former bureaucrat – Congress’ Kuldip Singh Vaid.Former tehsildar Kanwar Narinder Singh, will slug it out in Jagraon against sitting AAP MLA Sarvjit Kaur Manuke and former SAD MLA and ex- bureaucrat SR Kaler.AAP turncoat Gurpreet Singh Bhatti, who had formed the People’s Party of Punjab (PPP) with state finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal (Congress), will be contesting on a BJP ticket from the Khanna assembly constituency. Bhatti had defected from the AAP in November in favour of the BJP.The party has fielded advocate Bikram Singh Sidhu from the Ludhiana West constituency, which is being represented by Congress heavyweight Bharat Bhushan Ashu. Political pundits had already predicted that Sidhu was the probable BJP candidate from the West constituency as he had been vigorously canvassing in the area and had been posturing himself as the BJP candidate for around a year. From Ludhiana Central, Gurdev Sharma Debi has clinched the party ticket for the second time, edging out the BJP’s state vice-president, Parvin Bansal, who had also been eying the ticket. Debi, who is the state treasurer of the saffron party, had lost the 2017 election to Congress leader Surinder Dawar. Those in the know say Bansal wants to fight the poll from Ludhiana North, but party spokesperson Anil Sareen is also vying for a ticket from the constituency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-bjp-finally-releases-first-list-of-candidates-101642796141332.html
22-01-2022||Gurugram||Gurugram dist court rejects bail plea of prime suspect in multi-crore heist case||The district sessions court on Friday rejected the bail application of Dr Sachinder Jain Nawal, one of the prime suspects in the multi-crore heist at a residential society in Sector 84 on August 4 last year. The bail plea was listed twice last month, but was withdrawn by Nawal’s counsel. On January 10, the bail application of Dr Gurpartap Singh alias Dr GP Singh, another suspect in the case, was rejected. He was a visiting doctor in the society and allegedly passed on the information about the cash bags to Dr Nawal, said police. Around ₹40 crore was stolen from the maintenance office of the residential society in Sector 84 on August 4. On August 20, when an employee of the maintenance company went to collect the cash to deposit it in the bank, he realised that it was missing. After scanning the CCTV camera footage, the company discovered that the money had been stolenNawal’s lawyer Rahul Chauhan said his client had no role to play in the case and despite his remand by the Special Task Force (STF), they were not able to recover any money from Nawal.“Nawal has been framed in the case and he has no link with the people who were involved in the robbery. We will now approach the high court,” he said. During arguments, the counsel argued that the main co-accused--former deputy commissioner of police, Gurugram, Dheeraj Setia and gangster Vikas Lagarpuria--are yet to be arrested and the supplementary charge sheet has not been filed yet. Police said the evidence, such as call detail records and location of mobile phones, were matched with the co-accused to corroborate the facts in the case. Chauhan sought Nawal’s bail stating that the case is still in the initial stages of investigation. The court dismissed the plea stating that since the case was still in the initial stages of investigation, Nawal may tamper with evidence. So far, 16 people, including seven henchmen of the gangster, three doctors, two employees of the housing complex developer, two financers and an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) of the Delhi Police have been arrested. On November 10, the STF arrested Nawal, a leading pediatrician who owns two hospitals in Gurugram, and Singh, who was the visiting doctor at Gurgaon One residential society in Sector 84. Satheesh Balan, deputy inspector general of STF, said Nawal and gangster Vikas Lagarpuria planned the robbery and were involved in each and every step. “Nawal’s driver Joginder has also been arrested. He is the maternal uncle of Lagarpuria, with the help of whom Nawal got in touch with the gangster,” he said. Balan said now their prime focus is to arrest Lagarpuria and that they have formed teams to arrest the gangster. “We have enough evidence against Nawal and Lagarpuria to prove their involvement in the multi-crore heist,” he said adding that statements of the other arrested suspects have been recorded. According to police, the robbery plan was allegedly hatched after Dr Nawal got information about the money from Singh, who is currently lodged in Bhondsi jail, and passed on the information to the gangster. The theft was allegedly committed by Lagarpuria’s henchmen. To cover up the matter, Nawal allegedly involved then Gurugram DCP Dheeraj Setia. Setia has been suspended by the Haryana government and an arrest warrant has been issued against him by the court, said police. Setia has filed an anticipatory bail application in Gurugram sessions court, the hearing for which has been fixed for January 24. He has also filed a petition in the high court to squash the FIR registered against him, which will be heard on the same date. According to STF officials, Nawal is a native of Hisar, who also tried to get a ticket for the assembly elections held in 2019 from Barwala. Officials said Nawal had opened a multi-specialty hospital in Bhiwadi and allegedly suffered losses to the tune of ₹6.5 crore and was under pressure to return that money to the investors. Balan said the had kept more than ₹40 crore in the two apartments -- one on fourth floor and the other on 11th floor -- of GurgaonOne society in Sector 84. Surprisingly, the money was kept in the open without any security guards deployed outside the apartments, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-dist-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-prime-suspect-in-multi-crore-heist-case-101642796139896.html

22-01-2022||Gurugram||Gurugram: Over 14k locals register on job reservation portal in first week||After the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act was implemented on January 15, 14,687 local candidates and eight companies have registered on the labour department portal so far, said Haryana additional chief secretary of the labour department, Raja Sekhar Vundru on Friday.He added companies will take some time to register as they have to share detailed data pertaining to employees who earn upto ₹30,000 per month.“Till Friday 3.30pm, 14,687 applicants and eight firms registered on the portal created by the labour department from the date when the portal was opened on January 15. We have made it easy for firms to upload data and basic details of employees, their qualifications and background information. Still, it will take some time for updation as the domicile of employees is also to be uploaded,” said Vundru, adding that a transparent digital framework for implementing the job reservation has been created and will be finetuned further.The Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act, 2020 was passed by the state assembly on March 2, 2021 and was approved by the governor. On November 6, it was notified by the state labour department and came into force from January 15, 2022.The Act mandates 75% reservation to job seekers from Haryana in the private sector.Vundru said that the Act was transparent and that the government and labour department plan to work hand in hand with the industry and businesses to create an environment wherein both local and outside talents are valued equally.As far as the apprehension of companies pertaining to the lack of skilled manpower is concerned, Vundru said that while the database is being updated, the labour department will conduct a statewide skill gap analysis, and ensure that the local youth is trained, has employable skills and there is no shortage of manpower.“In case local manpower with adequate skills is not available, companies can always seek exemptions online. All efforts are being made to ensure that this framework has minimal human interface and decisions are taken quickly and without any interference,” he said.Haryana has a large number of ITIs and a Skill Development University, whose services will be utilised to study the data and create skill-based courses, said Vundru.“We are also aware of the apprehensions of the license permit raj plaguing the system. But we would like to assure stakeholders that this system will be very flexible and concerns of all stakeholders will be considered,” said Vundru.The additional chief secretary said a notification pertaining to exemptions was issued within two days after the Act came into force and this showed the flexibility of the mindset of the department and government. “We are taking feedback from all stakeholders continuously, and it is because of this reason new IT companies and startups have been exempted for two years. An exemption has also been given to work related to the sowing of crops, embroidery, primary works related to fruits, vegetables, tea leaves, coffee, fish, animals. Exemptions have also been given to domestic servants and those industries for which skilled workers are not available,” he said.Vundru, however, said that though collaboration with industries will be key to implementing job reservation, the Act provides for review of employment by companies every three months and there are penal provisions for violating norms. “The review of employment too will be online and permission has to be taken from the labour commissioner, Haryana, for inspection with a notice of three days,” he said.The Act has been challenged in the Punjab and Haryana high court by the Gurgaon Industrial Association and other associations in the state--the next date of hearing is February 2.On Tuesday, Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, the driving force behind the local reservation, had said that the government will hold discussions with industry associations, who have opposed the reservation in a court of law and find a solution to their issues as well.JN Mangla, president, Gurgaon Industrial Association, said that it will become clear in the next three months how the Act is implemented. “If the government and the labour department are saying that they will work in close coordination with industries and adopt a flexible approach, then it is a welcome decision. However, they have to ensure that the law is not misused to perpetuate the stranglehold of government functionaries,” he said. 
22-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi’s good Samaritans rain-proof winters for the underprivileged||New Delhi It’s going to be yet another rainy weekend, according to the meteorological department. And if the cold wave wasn’t enough to leave Delhiites shivering then brace yourselves for the upcoming rain spell will add more misery, especially to the woes of the homeless on the streets. It is to help the needy brave such harsh weather conditions that some good Samaritans are coming forward. “Every winter season we organise drives to distribute blankets and sleeping bags to the homeless and the underprivileged. This year, we’ve so far managed to reach out to more than 250 individuals including street vendors and labourers in areas of Old Delhi and Kashmere Gate alongside night shelters at Safdarjung and AIIMS,” says Yusra Khan, from an NGO Yellow Streets, adding, “Winter potentially lasts for two or three months, so the underprivileged don’t invest much in warm clothing or blankets as they don’t have a fixed place to store them, and it gets difficult for them to take care of their belongings while they are constantly moving. So we are distributing them blankets that are lined with waterproof tarpaulin on one side. And alongside we are also giving them woollens, to keep themselves warm.” Also distributing tarpaulin-lined blankets is the NGO Lakshya Jeevan Jagriti. Rahul Goswami, from this NGO, informs, “The rainproof blankets have a reflective surface, so it helps the drivers on the road know that someone is sleeping by the roadside. This helps avoid them from accidentally ramming into the homeless. We are also distributing winter kits, grocery, and sanitary pads for women, and cooked meals.” Considering rains breed infections, some kind souls have also been catering to the demand of medicines. “A sound immune system is necessary to fight adverse situations that come to our body on a bad day. And rain brings along a multitude of health problems and virals like cold and cough, which common issues among those who live on the streets,” says Arushi Jain, a pharma professional, adding, “Especially at a time when we need to give a tough fight to Covid, it becomes important to help the homeless get access to medicines that can help keep cough and cold away. Health is a priority for all, and that’s why we recently distributed health benefiting kits to the children at Nirbhed Foundation, which looks after their education, clothing, nutrition, medical facilities, and skill development. This kit has medicines and supplements to avoid infections and sickness that usually fosters in the rainy season.”Author tweets @siddhijainnFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-good-samaritans-rain-proof-winters-for-the-underprivileged-101642795239660.html
22-01-2022||Gurugram||Gurugram: Spa owner thrashed for asking customer to wear face mask||A 42-year-old spa owner was allegedly assaulted and threatened more than a week ago after she asked one of her customers to wear a face mask and show his vaccination certificate before entering the establishment. The incident occurred in a commercial plaza in Palam Vihar around 3pm on January 13 when the owner of the spa centre Suman Pandey was standing near the entrance and a man without a face mask tried to enter the premises. Pandey alleged the same man had been visiting her spa for three days and she was turning him away as he was not following Covid-19 protocols. “The man was under the influence of alcohol when he visited on January 13. I politely asked him to wear his face mask and show his vaccination certificate, which irritated him and he started abusing me. When I said he cannot enter without showing the certificate, he started assaulting me and punched my right eye and stomach,” she said. Pandey said she vomited on the spot and could not get up. The injury she sustained on her eye was such that she was not able to see. “I called the police control room, following which a team from the Palam Vihar police station arrived and took me to a private hospital. I was not in a state to lodge a complaint. After getting discharged on Thursday, I submitted the registration number of the suspect’s vehicle and also showed police CCTV footage,” she said. Deepak Saharan, deputy commissioner of police, said the suspect called the victim on Thursday and threatened her. “We have identified the suspect through his vehicle number and mobile number but we are yet to arrest him,” he said. A case under sections 323 (assault) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC was registered against the man at Palam Vihar police station on Thursday, said police. At least 10 people have been assaulted and threatened in the last one month for asking customers to wear a face mask before entering any shop or market, said police adding that such cases have mostly been reported from Sadar market, Vyapar Kendra, Sector 56 market, Sector 10 and Pataudi. The victims mostly include grocery store owners, vegetable vendors and store managers. Last week, a 27-year-old grocery store owner in Pataudi was assaulted after he asked two men to wear face masks. The victim was taken to a private hospital where he had to get six stitches for his injuries, said police.On January 1, the state government had announced the “no mask, no service” policy, barring the entry of persons without masks to public offices. The guidelines also bar those who have not taken both doses of vaccine from entering any public place, including sabzi mandi, grain market, liquor and wine stores, local markets and shopping complexes. Saharan said shopkeepers are not allowing anyone without a face mask to enter their stores as they have been warned of strict action for violating the norm. “Since January 1, we have asked the members of market associations, mall associations and resident welfare associations to ensure no one roams around without a face mask. Teams have been formed to randomly check vaccination status of people in markets and malls. If anyone is found without having taken both vaccine doses, then the market or mall association concerned will be penalised for ₹5,000,” he said. On January 3, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar asked the police and the district administration to ensure strict enforcement of Covid-19 protocols and said penalties should be imposed on individuals and institutions found violating the norms. Police said nearly 500 people are fined every day for not wearing a face mask, the violation of which attracts a penalty of ₹500. They have deployed more than 2,000 personnel across the city to check violations of Covid-19 protocols.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-spa-owner-thrashed-for-asking-customer-to-wear-face-mask-101642794880372.html
22-01-2022||Other||Kerala high court to hear actor Dileep’s anticipatory bail plea today||Kochi The Kerala high court will hear on Saturday the anticipatory bail plea filed by actor Dileep in a case registered against him and five others for allegedly threatening investigation officers probing the sexual assault of an actress back in 2017.Justice Gopinath P on Friday said a special sitting will be held in the high court on January 22 for the detailed hearing of the anticipatory bail plea filed by the actor.The Crime Branch wing of the Kerala police had on Thursday filed a statement in the high court opposing the anticipatory bail plea and said it was for the first time in the state’s history that a person accused of a serious offence hatched a criminal conspiracy to harm the life of investigating officers.Meanwhile, the Crime Branch had recently submitted a report before the Judicial First Class Magistrate court at Aluva, which is the trial court in the threatening case.The Crime Branch report said it had added Section 302 (murder) along with Section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code since the accused had conspired to murder the probe officers as per the first information statement.Besides Dileep, his younger brother — P Sivakumar — and brother-in-law — T N Suraj — have also moved the high court seeking the same relief.The Crime Branch had said that the allegations against Dileep and other petitioners are “very serious” and said custodial interrogation of the accused is required to unearth the criminal conspiracy hatched by them.The Crime Branch had on January 9 registered the case on a complaint filed by an investigating officer based on a purported audio clip of Dileep, which was released by a TV channel in which the actor was allegedly heard conspiring to attack the official.The actor and five others were booked under various provisions of the IPC, including Sections 116 (abetment), 118 (concealing design to commit offense), 120B (criminal conspiracy), 506 (criminal intimidation), and 34 (criminal act done by several people).The joint plea moved by all three has claimed that the complaint lodged against them by the officer — Deputy SP (Crime Branch) Baiju Paulose — was “false”.They have contended that the allegations in the FIR, registered on the base of the complaint, are “wholly false and baseless”.The actor and his relatives have alleged, in the petition filed through advocate Philip T Varghese, that the intention behind registration of the case was to take them into custody and humiliate them before the public.This apprehension is borne out of the past conduct of the complainant officer who right from the start has been trying to falsely implicate the actor in the sexual assault case, the petition has alleged.The victim — an actress who has worked in Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam films — was abducted and allegedly molested inside her car for two hours by some of the accused, who had forced their way into the vehicle on the night of February 17, 2017 and later escaped in a busy area. The entire act was filmed by some of the accused to blackmail the actress.There are 10 accused in the case and initially, police arrested seven people. Dileep was arrested subsequently and released on bail later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kerala-high-court-to-hear-actor-dileep-s-anticipatory-bail-plea-today-101642794878812.html

It appears the techie first killed his wife and daughter by administering them poison and after their death, he hanged himself,” Ameenpur inspector of police Srinivas Reddy told the reporters.The police suspect that the family might have performed some rituals in their puja room before resorting to the extreme step. “All the three were sporting long streaks of vermillion on their foreheads and the portraits of gods were scattered in the room,” he said.The police suspect that the family might have died by suicide a couple of days ago, as the techie and his wife were not taking the calls made by their family members for the last two days. “The servant maid also revealed that she was asked not to come to work two days ago,” the inspector said.On Thursday afternoon, the father-in-law of the techie came to his residence only to find the house bolted from inside. When there was no response from inside to the calling bell sound, he peeped into the house through the window and noticed the son-in-law hanging from the ceiling fan.He immediately alerted the police, who rushed to the spot and broke open the doors only to find the bodies of the family. The police did not find any suicide note.The techie’s parents, who belong to Pothaipalli village of Shamirpet area on the city outskirts, told the police that there were no financial problems for the family. “Theirs was a love marriage 10 years ago and it was a happy family without any family disputes. We don’t know what exactly is the cause for their death,” his father told the reporters.The police have registered a case of suspicious death under section 174 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and are investigating.

Haryana was number one in per capita income and per capita investment during the Congress regime,” the two-time CM said during his visit to Kurukshetra on Friday.“The BJP-JJP government has made Haryana number one in unemployment, inflation, corruption, crime, atrocities on farmers, mis-governance and fiscal mismanagement,” Hooda added.He said the ‘Vipaksh Aapke Samaksh’ programme scheduled for Kurukshetra on January 21 was postponed due to Covid-19 restrictions and the schedule for the programme will be announced after the restrictions are lifted.Hooda slammed the Haryana government for not taking action against the mafia involved in illegal mining in Yamuna to the hills of Dadam and Nangal Choudhary.“Many people have died due to illegal mining but police did not registered murder cases against the accused. The government is only setting up committees in the name of investigation,” he said, adding that a dozen scams including those of liquor, land registries, paddy procurement, and recruitment, the government had formed committees but no action has been taken against anyone.He demanded investigation by the CBI under the supervision of a sitting judge of the high court in the scams to punish the guilty.“Farmers have been facing the wrath of the weather. Compensation for farmers was repeatedly demanded by the Opposition, but till now, the government has not even compensated for the losses caused last season,” he added.The leader of Opposition said every section of society, including farmers, labourers, employees, and anganwadi workers, is on the roads but the government is not concerned about them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wrong-policies-of-bjp-jjp-govt-ruined-haryana-s-economy-claims-hooda-101642793979153.html
22-01-2022||Gurugram||Gurugram to chalk out water plan by March to reduce stress on groundwater||The district administration has decided to prepare a water plan by March this year keeping in view the declining groundwater levels in the district and the estimated population growth by 2041, said officials on Friday. Deputy commissioner of Gurugram Yash Garg, while chairing a meeting in this regard on Friday, appointed nodal officers from different departments and asked them to submit a detailed report of the current demand and supply of water and other resources from the entire district to the GuruJal Society by January 31. GuruJal society is an integrated water management initiative of the district administration. “The depleting groundwater level in Gurugram is a matter of concern. Double the amount of water is being wasted in the district, than what gets recharged. In such a situation, the district water plan needs to be made considering the population standards for the next 20 years,” said Garg. The deputy commissioner said that the data received from different departments will be assessed by mid-February and a draft will be prepared. This draft will be shared on a public domain for taking citizen feedback from February 25 till March 1, and thereafter, the final district water plan will be shared with the Haryana Water Resources Authority (HWRA) in the first week of March. Officials said that in industrial areas, there is a need to encourage the use of treated waste water and reducing the dependence on ground water sources. In the meeting, Garg said 53% of the ground water in Gurugram district is used for agriculture purposes. “In such a situation, farmers in the district will have to be made aware and encouraged to adopt micro and drip irrigation. There is also a need to increase the supply line of treated waste water in the district,” said the deputy commissioner. On Tuesday, the HWRA directed the Gurugram administration to come up with an action plan for increasing the groundwater level in the district. Asserting that the district needs to focus on the use of treated waste water, the authority also asked the district administration to form a sub-committee, under the district water harvesting committee, which will submit daily reports which can be used to make a water action plan for Gurugram. Gurugram has been a dark zone district and has seena reduction in the groundwater levels for the past few years. A dark zone refers to an area where the groundwater level has dipped beyond the acceptable parameter in a block. An area is first identified as critical before it is declared a dark zone. According to HWRA, 98 out of 200 villages in Gurugram are under the severely stressed category due to over-extraction of groundwater.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-to-chalk-out-water-plan-by-march-to-reduce-stress-on-groundwater-101642793859939.html

Based on the complaint lodged by the landlord, police have registered an FIR against the man under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the IP C and relevant sections of the Arms Act at City Nuh police station on Friday. “We have initiated an inquiry into the allegations made by the woman’s family members,” said Singla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/former-home-guard-shoots-at-his-second-wife-kills-self-in-nuh-101642793558736.html

These coins are believed to be about 2,800 years old and made of pure silver. The coins were widely in use all over the peninsula in ancient times, however, there are questions regarding their issuer, origin and supply, which still require deeper and comprehensive study. Upadhyaya received an incentive grant under the Institution of Eminence Initiative project in BHU, for a proposal on Punchmark coins. He further developed the idea to study the coins in the whole state of Uttar Pradesh and applied for the project, which got INSA approval. “Once my study in Uttar Pradesh is over, I plan to take this study to other states and all over the country,” said Upadhyaya. The study will aim to answer three primary questions, including who was the issuing authority of these coins, where the coins minted; will this help understand where the coins originated, in India or elsewhere; and what was the economic condition of that time? According to Upadhyaya, the project is going to be a collaborative one and experts from the departments of geology, metallurgy and physics of the university would also be involved in this study. “The study will serve another greater purpose of checking the modern forgery of Punch-marked coins as after historic scientific analysis of these coins we would be able to know the exact process and composition of the coins. This is important because when coins, that carry historic value, are forged, analysing historical facts become impossible,” said Upadhyaya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bhu-numismatist-bags-project-to-study-punch-marked-coins-101642793498921.html

On Thursday, a two-judge bench comprising justice Pritinker Diwakar and justice Ashutosh Srivastava allowed a writ petition filed by one Anoop Kumar Mishra of Prayagraj, alleging that certain land in his area was encroached by locals. The petition was treated as public interest litigation by the bench.In the petition, it was stated that the land belonging to the Indian Railways had been encroached upon by certain people, which was known to the officials of Indian Railways, and yet no action was taken by officials to remove the said encroachment.The court directed railways authorities to immediately issue notice to the encroachers of railways’ land, asking them to vacate the land within three weeks of the notice being served on them.“If the occupants/encroachers fail to vacate the land despite notice being served, it shall be open to the railways authorities to initiate appropriate action to forcibly dispossess such occupants/encroachers and demolish or remove the unauthorized structures raised by them by taking assistance of the local police force,” added the court. The court had asked the superintendent/commissioner of police of the area to ensure that adequate force is deployed on the site and surrounding areas including protection to the officials/staff engaged in the demolition of the illegal structures and eviction process.The court observed, “The railways administration is expected to initiate civil/criminal action against the encroachers/unauthorized occupants on the railways properties at the earliest, once it is brought to the notice of the officials of railways.”The railways administration as also the local administration and the state government are expected to initiate appropriate action against the erring persons, including officials of the establishment concerned for allowing and tolerating such encroachment and for not taking corrective action for removal of encroachment at the right time,” added the court in its seven-page order.The writ petition was disposed of by the court by observing: “We hope and trust that the above directions would go a long way in ensuring that no similar case is instituted and the menace of railway land being encroached is finally put to rest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/remove-encroachment-from-your-land-hc-tells-rlys-admn-101642793078856.html

The former CM alleged that the incumbent government has been exposed as a ‘suitcase di sarkar’ after the recent Enforcement Directorate (ED) raids that had unearthed crores of rupees from Channi’s kin. “The ED seizure is a follow-up on the case that the agency had registered after I had ordered an inquiry, while heading the government,” he said in a social media interaction. Capt added that, unfortunately, he had been unable to take any serious action against the Congress MLAs who were involved in illegal mining in the state as that would have damaged the party’s interests and Sonia Gandhi had failed to respond to his query on which minister or MLA she wanted him to sack over the issue. He also regretted having helped Channi resolve the #metoo complaint against him, saying the then minister had fallen on his feet and pledged loyalty to him for life. “Now, he has changed colours and is claiming he had been trying to get rid of me for the past two years!” the PLC leader remarked. The PLC chief said the new CM had done nothing, except indulge in postings and transfers since taking over. “Three DGPs have been changed, his home minister has been openly accused in a cabinet meeting by his colleague that money was being taken for posting of SSP, there was a tug of war on the AG’s post…This is not ‘lokaan di sarkar’ but ‘transfer posting di sarkar’,” he added. He also accused the Channi government of ‘stage-managing’ the blockade that had led to the serious security lapse on the Prime Minister’s route. “Clearly, the Channi government had instructed the police to not remove the farmers who were stopping BJP buses from reaching the spot,” he said. On why no sitting Congress MLA was joining the PLC, Capt Amarinder said they were only waiting for their party to announce the tickets, which was being deliberately delayed as the Congress is scared of defections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ed-raids-have-exposed-channi-s-suitcase-di-sarkar-capt-101642792960266.html

She will be arriving in Kaushambi on Wednesday. Kusum, who endured an abusive marriage, psychiatric ailment and living on the streets of Chennai before being rescued in 1996, was nurtured back to her good health through medicines, counselling and personal care by volunteers of the NGO during the past years. They constantly tried to extract information from the woman about her family and the effort finally led to her being reunited with her siblings in Bangalore on January 19, 2022. The woman, who has seven siblings including six brothers and one sister, was married to a local man in her early 20’s but unfortunately her husband died a couple of months after their marriage. Kusum had second marriage with Bhailal, a worker in a steel factory at Pune. However, the happiness of the married life was short lived as Kusum was often thrashed by her drunkard husband. Offended by the repeated torture, she came back to her parents but under depression, she developed psychiatric problems and finally ran-off from her home at the age of 28 from her Basethi village in Kaushambi. “She was later identified by a well-wisher of Udavum Karangal at Tambaram, a suburban city located in south of Chennai, who found Kusum lying on the streets and people teasing her. She was handed over to us in January 1996 and she was nurtured, given psychiatric treatment and is now in normal condition,” shared Pappa S Vidyaakar, founder of the NGO. He further informed that Kusum responded well to the psychiatric treatment. After recovery, she started getting involved in various activities in the rehabilitation home at Thiruverkadu, a Western suburb of Chennai. However, she was always reluctant to divulge the details of her native place and said that she did not want to go back. “After repeated counselling, she started giving vague details like her village name and name of her brothers. With these small details, a social worker, Y Srinivasa Rao, through Google found a school called Balamandir School, and spoke to one Mallick Chand who knew her family. Soon, we were able to contact Ramchand Yadav and Prakash Yadav, the two brothers of Kusum,” informed Vidyaakar. The NGO arranged a WhatsApp video call between Kusum and her family and she was overjoyed. Later, Phoolchand Yadav, her other brother, was contacted in Bengaluru who came to Chennai to take her sister home to Kaushambi. “On meeting, the duo hugged each other and were in tears,” said the chairman of the NGO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/prayagraj-kaushambi-woman-reunited-with-siblings-after-25-years-101642792779139.html
22-01-2022||Other||Kerala CPI(M) suffers jolt as HC bans public events for week||The ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) suffered a setback on Friday after the Kerala High Court banned all the programmes exceeding presence of 50 people, putting a question mark on the ongoing party district committee meetings in Thrissur and Kasaragod. Hearing a public interest litigation questioning big participation in party meetings during pandemic times, a division bench of the court said, “If participation in Republic Day parade can be limited to 50 persons, it can be applicable to party meetings also.” It also said the government’s explanation in this regard was not satisfactory and banned all programmes that exceed more than 50 people for a week. Petitioner Arun Raj contended that earlier the Kasaragod district collector had issued a directive banning all public functions but later he was forced to issue a fresh circular to facilitate the party district conference. He said Covid -19 restrictions were compromised to facilitate party district meet and he also cited the so-called “super spreader party event” in Thiruvananthapuram last week. The court questioned the logic behind organising major party programme when less than 50 persons were permitted for Republic Day events in the state. The court also said in Kasaragod district test positivity rate was over 36%. The court later gave an interim order banning all programmes that exceed 50 people. Meanwhile, Opposition Congress has welcomed the court decision. “The party should realise its blunder at least for now and suspend the ongoing meetings,” said Opposition leader V D Satheesan. CPI(M) leader A N Shamseer said the party state leadership will take an appropriate decision after going through the court directive. Both district meetings were inaugurated on Friday morning. Despite heavy virus caseload and subsequent restrictions the CPI(M)’s decision to go ahead with two district committee meetings invited widespread criticism. Opposition Congress and BJP alleged that the pandemic restrictions were tweaked by the government for the smooth functioning of the meets and the party was repeating its mistakes. After Thiruvananthapuram district conference last week, about 100 delegates, including education minister V Sivankutty and two legislators had tested Covid positive. The mega ‘Thiruvathira’ dance programme during the conference where more than 500 women artists participated drew enough flak and later the party had to admit that it was wrong to conduct such a mass dance programme amid the pandemic. “The government manipulated restrictions to conduct party meets. In both districts test positivity rate is more than 35%. The party thinks that it can do anything and get away easily. How can the government insist common man to follow restrictions? asked Satheesan. Instead of postponing these meets the party was posing a challenge to others and reduce itself to a laughing stock, he said. He said Congress has postponed all its programmes due to spike in cases and the ruling party should have been more considerate and responsible. Meanwhile BJP leader S Suresh said, “Blind with power, the party has lost its balance and semblance. When cases mount it is in a race to organise mega meets. The party’s Thiruvananthapuram meet has turned into a super-spreader event and it is yet to learn a lesson from its mistakes.”  But party politburo member M A Baby refuted criticisms. “These meets are conducted in a scientific and Covid-appropriate manner. Our political rivals are cooking up stories to take the spirit out of the meets,” he said. Meanwhile, the state on Friday reported another spike with 41,668 cases after 95,218 samples were tested with a TPR of 43% . According to the data released by the state health ministry, active cases rose to 2,23,548 and 33 deaths took the death toll to 51,607.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kerala-cpi-m-suffers-jolt-as-hc-bans-public-events-for-week-101642792658669.html
22-01-2022||Delhi||Expectation of conjugal relations can’t be reason to force wife, Delhi HC told||Continuing her arguments before the Delhi high court on Friday for criminalising marital rape, amicus curiae Rebecca John said expectation of sexual relations by a husband cannot result in him having forcible sex with the wife.John told the bench of justices Rajiv Shakdher and C Hari Shankar that no doubt, there was an expectation of sexual relations in a marital relationship and that is not wrong, but it can only be achieved through dialogue or if a wife is also willing and ready to have conjugal relations.“Expectation is not wrong. Both sides can have expectations. However, that expectation cannot result in the husband having forcible sex with the wife. The issue is not about expectation; it is about the man exercising his dominant right over the wife, despite the wife saying I cannot and will not have sexual relations with you,” John said, after Shankar asked her about the expectations that a husband may have in a marital relationship.Justice Shankar reiterated there is a qualitative difference between the sexual equation that exists between parties who are married and those who are not. He also said while the parties who are married may have a right to expect sexual relations, there is no such right between couples who are unmarried.Posing a query to senior advocate John, Shankar said given such a right, if the legislature decided not to equate the two situations, owing to the difference within which the parties were placed, can the court examining the constitutionality of exception in the rape law -- it decriminalises marital rape -- say that there is no such difference in the situations?Exception 2 in Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code decriminalises marital rape and mandates that sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under 115 years of age, is not rape.On an earlier occasion, Shankar had said that when a man is married, there is a social, moral and legal right for each partner to expect meaningful conjugal relations with the other. Correcting his earlier stance, the judge said, “Let us not call it a right. Let’s call it an expectation.”The bench is hearing PILs by NGOs RIT Foundation, All India Democratic Women’s Association, and two individuals seeking to strike down the exception granted to husbands in the Indian rape law.During the proceedings, senior counsel John also submitted that if the exception in the rape law was gender neutral, it would create a false equivalence to suggest that husbands and wives are equal, disregarding the lived experiences of women as wives.She also gave examples of various provisions in different statutes which specifically focussed on the victim being a woman, including the Domestic Violence Act, Section 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), Section 113B of Indian Evidence Act (presumption as to dowry death) and Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act.She submitted that the scheme of Indian Penal Code (IPC), Criminal Procedure Code and the Indian Evidence Act has been amended by the legislature, putting the woman at the centre of the provision and keeping in mind the procedural and evidentiary safeguards that must be given when a complaint is filed by a woman.Clarifying that it was not her case that other sexual minorities must not be given adequate protection, John said that in order to do so, other special provisions will have to be introduced which specifically protected their rights.The arguments will continue on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/expectation-of-conjugal-relations-can-t-be-reason-to-force-wife-delhi-hc-told-101642792598678.html

They were promised ₹10 lakh each for killing the activist, they said. The special cell had registered a case and later arrested three more alleged conspirators – Tuti, Jagdeep alias Kaka and Rohit Chaudhary.Their interrogation revealed that Chaudhary’s brother Rahul, who was a constable in the Indian Army and an expert in drone handling, was arrested by the Punjab Police for his alleged role in smuggling narcotic drugs into India from Pakistan using drones. When Rahul was in jail, Chaudhary was contacted by some persons from Pakistan (who involved him in drug trafficking) through one Randeep alias Romi, a member of banned terrorist outfit Khalistan Zindabad Force, said deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Pramod Singh Kushwah.“A resident of Punjab, Romi also runs an international drug syndicate. He has been on the run since 2014 and is hiding abroad. Romi assigned the task of killing the Kashmiri social activist to Chaudhary, who asked his associate Jagdeep alias Kaka to arrange someone to do so, and offered him ₹50 lakh. Kaka had already murdered someone in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, on Chaudhary’s instructions,” said DCP Kushwah.According to the DCP, Kaka wanted to complete the job but Chaudhary suggested that the murder should be committed by someone else so that they are not linked to the killing. Kaka took the help of Tuti, who hired Sukhvinder and Rajput. The two came to Delhi and were provided with firearms and ammunition and a photo of the target. However, the two were arrested before they could finish the job, the police said.“Our probe revealed that the weapons and bullets were supplied by Hazi Shamim. He attempted anticipatory bail after learning about the arrest of Chaudhary, but it was rejected. Shamim went on the run and a non-bailable warrant was issued against him. He was arrested on January 19,” added the DCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/gunrunner-wanted-for-involvement-in-plan-to-kill-kashmiri-activist-held-101642792358602.html
22-01-2022||Gurugram||Police arrest three for hacking daily wage labourer to death in Pataudi||Police arrested three people for allegedly killing a daily-wage worker at Jaitpur village in Pataudi on Sunday night after he demanded his pending wage of ₹8,000. Police said that the arrested persons--Mangal Singh, Ravi alias Ravinder and Kanwar Singh--were neighbours in Jaitpur. While Mangal and Ravinder are cousins, Kanwar is Ravinder’s maternal uncle. Police said they were arrested on the intervening night of Thursday and Friday after searches were carried out in their village. The deceased, Mahesh Kumar (30), also a resident of Jaitpur, was allegedly thrashed and then hacked to death using an axe in the village late on Sunday night. Police said Mahesh was accused in at least seven criminal cases, including of attempt to robbery and assault.According to the FIR registered on Monday, Mahesh’s father Ranvir Singh alleged that the suspects killed his son when he had gone to Mangal’s residence asking to clear his dues of ₹8,000.Police said on the basis of the statements given by the suspects, an axe, a steel rod used in construction works and an iron pipe used in the crime were recovered from a well in the fields owned by Mangal. Police have sent the weapons for forensic analysis to study the blood samples on them.A police officer privy to the investigation said that Ravinder allegedly used the steel rod while Mangal used the pipe to assault Mahesh. “It was Kanwar who used the axe to hit Mahesh, which fatally injured him. Mahesh worked in Mangal’s fields in November last year and was due to receive his pending wages,” said the officer quoting the statements of the arrested trio.He said Mahesh reached Mangal’s residence on Sunday night and demanded his pending wage.“Mahesh was in a highly inebriated state and was hurling abuses. Mangal lost his cool and started assaulting Mahesh. Later Ravinder and Kanwar also assaulted Mahesh, resulting in his death,” said the officer. Rakesh Kumar, station house officer of Pataudi police station, said all three suspects were sent to judicial custody and further investigation is going on in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/police-arrest-three-for-hacking-daily-wage-labourer-to-death-in-pataudi-101642792301511.html

In the review meeting, the chief minister consulted with officials from the department of cooperatives, food and consumer protection and the finance department. The chief minister has instructed the officials to take ‘strict action,’ including blacklisting of companies. The DMK government distributed Pongal gifts consisting of a total of 21 grocery items, including 100-gram ghee produced by the state-owned Aavin, different varieties of lentils, and a full sugarcane to more than two-crore ration card holders ahead of the three day-festival earlier this month. Following the distribution, complaints were received from a few regions about the jaggery melting and pepper and turmeric being of poor quality. The scheme was full of irregularities, alleged former chief minister and AIADMK’s joint coordinator Edapaddi Palaniswami on Thursday while he was speaking to reporters in Salem. Stalin took strong note of the issue after the AIADMK and the BJP accused the DMK-led government of covering up irregularities in the scheme by shifting focus on other issues. Palaniswami said that the DMK raided AIADMK’s former higher education minister on Thursday to divert people’s attention while BJP’s Tamil Nadu president K Annamalai tweeted, “To hide the pathetic failure and gross mismanagement in Pongal kit distribution, the DMK government is resorting to a Republic Day tool kit now” referring to Tamil Nadu’s tableau being rejected by the Union government. As per the official information, about 2.15 crore beneficiaries received the Pongal gift which cost the government ₹1,297 crore. “During the last regime, six items were procured and this year we procured 21 items and not just that, even the weight of these items was significantly additional,” said the statement. “While the distribution was going on well, the government received complaints from some parts of the state that there were some deficiencies in the products provided by certain companies. And they were investigated,” the statement added. “Only quality products of all kinds should be provided to the public and any attempt to tarnish the reputation of the state should not be allowed,” Stalin reportedly said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pongal-gift-hamper-row-stalin-orders-to-black-list-erring-firms-101642792180257.html

22-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi budget to focus on bringing economy back on track: Sisodia||The Delhi Budget 2022-23 will focus on bringing the Covid-19 hit economy back on track and also on developing Delhi as a hub for business and services so that more job opportunities are created, said deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds the finance portfolio, on Friday. The Kejriwal-led Delhi government is conducting surveys to ascertain ways to boost the capital’s economy and increase job opportunities amid the pandemic. Marking the beginning of the budget preparations, Sisodia on Friday also conducted a high-level review meeting with officials. The minister said Delhi Budget 2022- 23 will be “special” and will foster the economic growth of the national capital. “The budget will be prepared by keeping the needs of Delhi residents in mind. Along with that, based on the findings of various studies conducted by the planning department, we are trying to understand what innovations can be introduced to boost the capital’s economy and increase job opportunities,” said Sisodia in a statement. “The economy has suffered great losses in the past two years due to the Covid pandemic. We will give special attention to bringing the capital’s economy back on track. Delhi Budget 2022-23 will also focus on industrial development. The Kejriwal government will focus on developing Delhi as a hub for business and services,” Sisodia said. The government will pay special attention to various public welfare schemes, including those in the fields of education, health, electricity, and clean drinking water, among others. “The necessities of all Delhi residents will be kept in mind while preparing this year’s budget and it will help them recover from the pandemic-induced economic crisis,” said Sisodia. Last year, Sisodia had presented ₹69,000 crore budget for fiscal 2021-22, which had an emphasis on ”deshbhakti” as the AAP government planned to inspire patriotism among the people in the run-up to the 75th Independence Day celebrations this year.

However, the police have denied the charge. Cops are carrying out raids at different places in search of Atiq’s son Ali, who is named in a case of assault on a property dealer, on December 31. Shaista alleged that on Wednesday night at around 1 am, policemen entered their house after scaling the boundary wall. “There were no males in the house at that time. Cops make them awake and carried out a search of the house during which they ransacked the rooms and misbehaved with family members,” Shaista claimed adding that many cops were in an inebriated state. Shaista and lawyers of AIMIM’s legal cell have made complaint to senior police officials in this connection. AIMIM leader advocate Arif Iqbal said that an online complaint had been made to senior officials and this case would also be presented before the court. Meanwhile, SHO of Kareli police station Anurag Sharma said that women constables accompanied the police team during the raid and all allegations of harassment, including consumption of liquor by cops, were baseless.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/prayagraj-former-mp-atiq-s-wife-alleges-harassment-by-cops-101642791641351.html
22-01-2022||Delhi||Rainy weekend in store for Delhi, Met predicts in weather update||New Delhi: After a sunny Friday, Delhi is expected to witness a wet and windy Saturday with light to moderate showers expected to hit the Capital during the day, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast.The rain will be accompanied by gusty winds with speeds of upto 30-40 km/hr, making for another cold day, with the maximum temperature expected to hover around 15-16 degrees Celsius (°C) on Saturday, IMD said.When the maximum temperature is 4.5 degrees or lower than normal, while the minimum is below 10°C, the IMD classifies it as a ‘cold day’.Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 19.6°C on Friday – two degrees below normal for this time of year, while the minimum temperature was recorded at 7.6°C, which is normal for this time of the year. Delhi also reported shallow to moderate fog in the early hours of Friday, with the visibility dropping to 200 metres at Safdarjung, and 700 metres at Palam.RK Jenamani, a scientist at IMD, said the spell of rain over the weekend is due to a western disturbance, which will lead to drizzle towards Friday night and in the early hours of Saturday as well.“While there may be some drizzle at night, light to moderate spell of rain will be seen on Saturday during the day, with wind speeds touching 40km/hr. The maximum temperature will remain quite low,” he said, adding Sunday and Monday could be cold days.A western disturbance refers to an area of “disturbed” or reduced air pressure, moving from the west to the east, carrying with it moisture associated with rainfall, snowfall and fog in northern India.“A drizzle is expected on Sunday with the impact of this western disturbance expected to be over by Sunday night. The maximum temperature could hover around 17°C by Monday as well,” Jenamani added.Delhi’s air quality has also remained in the “very poor” category in the last 24 hours, with an Air Quality Index (AQI) reading of 365 according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily 4pm bulletin. The AQI reading was 387 (very poor) on Friday.According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar), a forecasting body, Delhi’s air quality will improve in the next 24 hours following the rain. “It is likely to rain on January 22 and 23, with gusty winds leading to wet deposition and strong dispersion, which will result in significant improvement of AQI,” said Safar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rainy-weekend-in-store-for-delhi-met-predicts-in-weather-update-101642791458599.html
22-01-2022||Delhi||DU releases draft four-year UG curriculum framework, seeks suggestions||The Delhi University (DU) on Friday released the draft curriculum framework -- a structure for four-year undergraduate programmes in different disciplines with multiple entry/exit options -- for admissions under its revised admission policy starting this academic calendar. The draft is in the public domain on the DU website and stakeholders, including teachers, academicians, students, parents and recruiters, may share their suggestions online, in the prescribed form, till January 30, 11.59pm.Aligned with the National Education Policy (NEP), the Undergraduate Curriculum Framework 2022 (UGCF) outlines 176 credits for a four-year honours degree and 132 credits for a three-year honours degree. Last December, the university shared two proposed NEP frameworks with colleges for deliberations, apart from a skeletal framework that was discussed by the academic council (AC) and the executive council (EC) last August when the FYUP (four-year undergraduate programme) agenda was approved. However, the draft UGCF that was put in the public domain on Friday was different from these three earlier versions, council members said. While the DU AC in August approved 196 credits for a four-year honours degree and 148 credits for a three-year honours degree, the credits were reduced to 184 and 140, respectively, in the second proposed course structure and 164 and 124, respectively, in the third proposed course structure. The fourth and latest framework outlines 176 credits for a four-year honours degree and 132 credits for a three-year honours degree.Delhi University vice-chancellor Yogesh Singh said the framework had been formulated with a student-centric approach. “The framework provides flexibility in terms of choice of discipline (s) of study, developing academic pathway having creative combinations of disciplines for study with multiple entry and exit options, and determining semester-wise academic load and the ease to learn at his/her own pace,” Singh said in the draft. He also said the increase in the number of choices and courses will also increase the need for more educators. Under the framework, a certificate will be awarded to students who exit at the end of the first year after securing 44 credits. A diploma shall be awarded to students who exit at the end of the second year with 88 credits. Students will secure a bachelors degree with honours if they exit at the end of the third year with 132 credits in a single core discipline course. In the fourth year of the programme, students can either choose to pursue an Honours degree in a particular discipline or an Honours degree with research with 176 credits. They will be required to work on a dissertation or an academic project. The minimum credit to be earned by a student per semester is 18 and the maximum is 26, according to the draft framework. Several DU teachers said the latest framework has reduced the course credits, which would lead to loss of jobs along with dilution of course content. Abha Dev Habib, associate professor, Miranda House, and former EC member, said the framework put in the public domain has reduced the number of hours (of study) and hence the credits. “The latest model reduces weightage in terms of number of hours and, hence, the credits for discipline specific core (DSC), discipline specific electives (DSE) and generic elective (GE) have been reduced from six to four. This dilution is not acceptable,” said Habib. Rudrashish Chakraborty, associate professor, Kirori Mal College, said the draft framework demonstrated a major dilution of academic rigour and quality owing to the reduced number of credits. “Each core paper gets four credits instead of six at present and the ability enhancement courses (AEC) and skill enhancement courses (SEC) get two credits instead of the present four. Moreover, the students get 132 credits after six semesters in the proposed programme instead of 148 in the present structure,” said Chakraborty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dureleases-draft-four-year-ug-curriculum-framework-seeks-suggestions-101642791278413.html
22-01-2022||Delhi||HT Code-a-Thon ends on a high note: Six crowned winners of Olympiad||Over five months after the second edition of one of the country’s biggest coding Olympiads -- HT Code-a-thon -- was launched, six students from across the country were crowned winners and 12 others were declared runners-up as the results of the grand finale held on January 15 was declared on Thursday.The winners were awarded a laptop, the first runner-ups received a tablet and a smartwatch each, and the second runner-ups were given a tablet.The grand finale, held virtually on Thursday, was attended by Union minister of state for electronics and information technology Rajeev Chandrasekhar; Rajeev Beotra, executive director, HT Media; Vivek Varshney, founder, SpeEdLabs; Manoj Balachandran, head - CSR, IBM India and South Asia; and Deepali Naair, chief marketing officer, IBM India and South Asia, among others.The experts noted that the new National Education Policy (NEP) also laid emphasis on holistic skill-based learning, and said that the skillsets acquired by students through coding would prepare them for jobs of the future.While outlining the role played by technology during the pandemic, Chandrasekhar said that it was crucial to develop skills that would prepare the country for an increasingly digital future.“The deeply disruptive Covid pandemic has taught the world and India that the future will see an increasingly accelerated digitisation of governments, businesses, and consumer lives. The accelerated digitisation presents a tremendous opportunity to India. We are at an intersection where both the opportunities and solutions to pursue those opportunities are present,” said Chandrasekhar.He added that vocational training and vocational skilling had been integrated into the curriculum under the NEP and the need of the hour was to develop abilities needed for addressing emerging opportunities. “Among our younger generation and student communities, we need to create capabilities to address these emerging opportunities. The world and the globe are increasingly digitising, therefore, our youngsters can play a big role if offering the skill and talent base that the world requires. Coding skills are a very important part of the basket of abilities and capabilities that our youngsters need to have to go ahead,” said Chandrasekhar.Varshney said that coding was a skill of the future and jobs across a wide spectrum would require computing skills going forward. “Coding is going to be the language of the future. Around 90% of jobs after five years will require some kind of computing skills. A basic understanding of coding will be important for individuals to perform and innovate,” said Varshney.Balachandran said that by learning to code, youngsters will be able to excel in their respective fields. “Apart from being consumers of technology, we should also know how to create technology. That’s why programs such as the Code-a-thon make a huge difference. Such programmes and interventions to address the skill gap go a long way in shaping Digital India and Skill India mission,” said Balachandran.During the five-month-long coding programme initiated by HT on August 31, 2021, students were trained through various modules, followed by a qualifier round and a final competition.Mihika Ghai from Somerville School, Noida, was declared the winner in the north zone app development category, with Aanya Singh (Little Flowers Public School, East Delhi ) and Sanjeev Mehta (Delhi Public School, Noida) emerging as first and second runners-up respectively. In the south zone, Ajaay Akaash from KC High International School, Chennai, won the app development award, with Rajath Sukreeti (Harvest International School, Bengaluru) and Trisha Chauhan (Suyog Sunderji Wisdom School, Pune) as first and second runners-up respectively.In the web development category, Springdales School student Saion Gupta won the first prize while Veeranjay Singh (Ryan International School, Gurugram) and Akshat Gupta (Rukmini Devi Public School, North Delhi) were the first and second runners-up respectively in the north zone. In the south zone web development category, Mumbai-resident Saurish V Bihani (R N Podar School) won the event, with Anshveer Singh (Oberoi International School, Mumbai) and Param Dipak Vasoya (MKVV International Vidyalaya, Mumbai) emerging as first and second runners-up respectively.In the game development category, Sahil Gupta from Somerville School, Greater Noida, won the first prize while Amogh Gupta (PIET Sanskriti Sr. Sec. School, Panipat) and Ashmeet Singh (Delhi Public School, Greater Faridabad) were the first and second runners-up respectively from the north zone. The south zone winner in the game development category is Mumbai-resident Shashwat Singhal (Reliance Foundation School, Navi Mumbai), with Tejas (Eggheads Education Pvt. Ltd., Bengaluru ) and Ameeth Kulkarni (D.A.V. Public School, Thane) coming up as the first and second runners-up respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/htcodeathon-ends-on-a-high-note-six-crowned-winners-of-olympiad-101642791038494.html
22-01-2022||Delhi||Business at Nehru Place hit as buyers turn online||Despite a high demand for computers and related items as firms switch to work from home, traders in Nehru Place market, the biggest computer and electronics marketplace in the Capital, claim that restrictions on marketplaces in the Capital have resulted in a decline in business as more people turn to online marketplaces to buy electronic goods.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has ordered for shops to open on odd-even basis from January 1 and imposed weekend curfew from January 7. In its order on January 21, the DDMA said that weekend curfew will continue.JK Gupta, chairman of Nehru Place Market Welfare Association, said, “During our discussion with district authority, we have requested them to bring the market under ‘essential services’ as people are totally dependent on computers for work. People come from various parts of Delhi and neighbouring cities to buy computers and related items. But due to the present restrictions, the business has been badly hit,” said Gupta.Anil Taneja, president of the association, said, “There is no relief from the government on taxes, but we are not allowed to do business. There are so many shops on rent that runs into over a lakh per month. How will traders pay rent and continue the work? The government should relax the norms.”Manoj Makkar, who runs a computer hardware shop in the market, said he has opened his shop for just eight days so far this month. “Shops open just twice-thrice a week ever since the weekend curfew was imposed along with odd-even. The business has declined considerably despite huge demand for computers and related items,” he said.Referring to the drop in sales, Aman, a store manager of a premium laptop brand, said, “We used to sell 15-18 laptops daily. But now the number has dropped to just 5-6 from this store. We have one more store in Nehru Place and two in Laxmi Nagar. We are somehow managing to meet the demand. The demand is there. But with markets closed and people ordering online, the business has been badly affected.”Upesh Kumar, another store manager, agreed: “People still prefer to come to the market and buy the product, especially laptops and desktops. Nehru Place is a preferred destination for any computer related item, as customers know that they will get the best prices. But sales have seen a sharp decline.”With schools closed and work from home becoming the norm in offices, the demand for second-hand computers, especially laptops, has increased, said people associated with the business. “Due the pandemic, many people bought second-hand laptops, available for ₹8,000- ₹15,000, depending on the condition. Now, we get a lot of calls for repair and maintenance. But we can do it only on days when we are allowed to open. So we tell the customers to come on the day when we open the shop,” said Iqbal Ahmed, who runs a laptop repair store in the market.The premium market for computers and mobile phones is also home to many service centres, second hand computers, data recovery centres, which also have been hit.Kabir Yadav, in-charge of one of the laptop service centres in Nehru Place, said, “The building in which our centre is located has banned the entry of customers. This has made it difficult for us to carry out work. At Nehru Place, we don’t take service requests as of now. We have other centres from where we are carrying out the work.”AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj blamed the Centre for the traders’ plight.“The LG (lieutenant governor) has rejected the proposal (for discontinuing weekend curfew) of the Delhi government despite the fact that Covid cases are reducing at a very fast pace. When all the markets of Gurugram and Noida are open, why should the business community of Delhi be made to suffer by BJP’s Central Government... The LG is a representative of the BJP’s Central government and has deliberately forced Delhi to impose the weekend curfew and odd-even arrangement of shops. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority is chaired by the LG, in which the elected Delhi government can only present a proposal, and the final decision belongs to the LG.”The Delhi BJP said AAP is trying to mislead people. “...everyone knows that the Delhi’s LG and Chief Minister constitute the DDMA which decides on curbs and relaxation. There is no BJP representation in DDMA hence it will be better if CM Kejriwal calls for DDMA meeting and gets traders relief,” said Delhi BJP Spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor, adding that Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta and leader of opposition in Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri have already urged authorities to withdraw weekend curfew and the odd-even rule in markets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/business-at-nehru-place-delhi-s-biggest-computer-market-hit-as-buyers-turn-online-101642790740760.html
22-01-2022||Delhi||Over 8,000 held in north-west Delhi after new police combing drive kicked in||The northwest district police has arrested over 8,000 criminals and anti-social elements, including 126 robbers, 168 snatchers, 49 burglars, 141 vehicle thieves, 306 thieves and 367 habitual offenders, in over three months since it launched ‘Operation Sajag’ -- a special combing and area dominance exercise, said senior police officers from the district on Friday.Officials said the district also witnessed a 24% decline in calls to the police control room and 33% decline in street crimes since the project was launched 108 days ago.Deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Usha Rangnani said that the operation was started on October 4, in line with the city police chief Rakesh Asthana’s directions for police domination of streets to curb street crimes such as snatching, robbery and vehicle thefts.“The objective was to keep a vigil on criminals and other anti-social elements, apart from establishing confidence among the public through higher visibility of police personnel on streets and residential colonies in the northwest district. The operation was carried out in the form of a special combing and area dominance exercise during which personnel between the ranks of constables and DCP remained in the field for 24 hours,” said DCP Rangnani.The DCP said that the northwest district is a densely populated area, with many slum clusters, like that in Wazirpur Industrial Area, Shakurpur, Haiderpur and Lal Bagh, and sensitive areas such as Sangam Park, Shah Alam Bandh Road, B&C block and Jahangirpuri. The district also has industrial areas at Wazirpur, GTK Road, Lawrence Road, Udyog Nagar and Mahindra Park. The largest fruit and vegetable market of Asia, Azadpur Mandi, also lies in its jurisdiction.“Such diverse socio-economic populace, dwelling units and institutions give rise to a number of challenges with respect to crime. Therefore, Operation Sajag was started and under it, strengthening of daily static pickets was done by equipping the personnel with wireless sets and weapons. Patrolling was also enhanced by adding more patrol bikes in the area for controlling street crimes and apprehending criminals,” she said.Police said they adopted comprehensive patrolling strategies with focus on specific areas, and outcome oriented tasking of pickets and patrolling staff. Officials said there was a 47% increase in preventive action against listed and budding criminals, apart from surveillance over criminals released from jails.Another focus area was the detection of sources of illicit firearms, drugs, illicit liquor and receivers of stolen property, and the force also carried out surprise raids and combing operations based on intelligence inputs in the district along the railways lines, in association with the railway police and personnel of the paramilitary forces.“As a result, 8,006 people were arrested in the last 108 days. These included 126 robbers, 168 snatchers, 141 vehicle thieves, 306 thieves and 49 burglars. A total of 5,269 unclaimed vehicles were seized while 23 firearms and 91 knives were recovered from 114 arrested people. We also arrested 244 people for gambling and recovered over ₹33.55 lakh. Our teams recovered 288 stolen mobile phones,” said DCP Rangnani, adding that the operation is continuing in the district.
22-01-2022||Lucknow||Former top cop Asim Arun says he will try to work more effectively for people after donning khadi||Former Kanpur police commissioner Asim Arun, who opted for voluntary retirement from the Indian Police Service (IPS) earlier this month to take the political plunge, said in an interview that his decision to join politics was an immediate one and despite transition from khaki to khadi, he would continue working for the people, doing so more effectively now.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has now fielded him from Kannauj, a reserved seat.Born on October 3, 1970, Asim Arun joined the Indian Police Service (IPS) in 1994 and served for about 28 years. His father, the late Sri Ram Arun, was a 1963-batch IPS officer, who served as the Uttar Pradesh director general of police (DGP) twice between 1997 and 2000.Asked what his immediate reaction was to the thought that he was going to don khadi immediately after leaving khaki, Asim Arun said, “Even earlier, I worked for people when I wore khaki. I will try to work more effectively for the welfare of the people after donning khadi. There is no change in integrity, transparency and inclusiveness but the canvas will be large now.” On whether he decided to quit the IPS before, Asim Arun replied, “No, it was an immediate decision. I received a suggestion to join the BJP between January 1 and 8. I talked to my family, but their response was negative. I was confused, but decided to quit the Indian Police Service and join politics after meeting chief minister Yogi Adityanath.” On what made him join the BJP, he said, “It was only after meeting the CM that I decided to join politics. It was surprising for everyone, even (those) very close to me. Particularly, I am comfortable with the BJP because the basic values that I have inherited from my father for working for all the segments of the society are the basic values of this party.”Asked how he would approach people to vote in his favour, Asim Arun said, “I will approach people (by) only stating that I prefer the rule of law and no lawlessness, as well as a corruption- free model of development and extending help to everyone, especially the Dalits.”On why he preferred Kannauj, the former Kanpur police commissioner said, “It has been my motherland and (I) have been trying to help people there. My father was very active in the social field in the vicinity. My family and I became active after his demise around three-and-a-half years ago. I want to contribute to my motherland in a much larger way.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/former-top-cop-asim-arun-says-he-will-try-to-work-more-effectively-for-people-after-donning-khadi-101642790440520.html

22-01-2022||Patna||Saran hooch tragedy: Toll climbs to 15, SHO suspended||With the death of nine more persons since Thursday night, the toll in alleged hooch tragedies in two villages of Bihar’s Saran district climbed to 15 on Friday, locals and police sources said.Bihar, where total liquor ban has been in force since April 2016, has seen a number of hooch tragedies in quick succession over the last few months alone.“Late Thursday night, a police team raided liquor manufacturing unit and arrested its owner Birendra alias Maina Mahto, his associates Banarsi Rai and two others,” Saran superintendent of police (SP) Santosh Kumar said. Birendra was facing at least four cases of liquor smuggling and was released from jail on December 23 last year, he said.Following the seizure of ingredients used to make spurious liquor, the SP suspended the station house officer of Maker police station, Rajesh Prasad, and chowkidar of Jagdishpur village for dereliction of duty. “The chowkidar was later arrested and sent to judicial custody. His role has come under scanner on suspicions that the illegal liquor manufacturing unit ran with his connivance,” the SP said.The raids were conducted after Saran district magistrate Rajesh Meena and SP Kumar, along with excise officials, visited one of the affected villages. “Urmila Devi, wife of one of the deceased, Birendra Thakur, showed them a plastic container with alleged liquor which her husband brought from Jagdishpur-Janta Bazar and consumed,” said a family member. Meanwhile, there were heart-rending scenes in the affected villages. In Parmanandpur-Chhapra falling under Amnaur police station area, Gunjan Singh, father of one of the hooch victims, Mithilesh Singh, told HT that his son had consumed liquor and died on way to the hospital on Friday morning after vomiting blood.Another man, Suraj Kumar Rajak of Tarapur village, who was admitted to a Patna hospital after he lost his vision, died Friday morning. “My son was tired after hard physical labour and consumed liquor at Janata Bazar before coming home on Wednesday,” said Meera Devi, fighting tears. These deaths, which occurred in a group of villages under the jurisdiction of Amnour, Maker, Bheldi and Marhaura police stations, come close on the heels of 13 hooch deaths in chief minister’s native Nalanda district last week.As per the data provided by the state police headquarters, from January till November 2021, a total of 13,439 vehicles were caught carrying liquor in Bihar. During the same period, 4,198,523 litres of liquor were seized in the state. Officials, however, continue to dispute hooch deaths. Saran district magistrate Rajesh Meena said that deaths caused by spurious liquor could be proved either by investigation or medical examination. He, however, said the last rites of many of the deceased have been performed, which was proving to be an obstacle in determining the exact cause of deaths.Earlier, Marhaura subdivisional police officer Indrajit Baitha, who visited the villages, had emphatically rejected spurious liquor as the cause behind deaths. “They might have died due to severe cold. Someone may have spread rumours over the deaths,” he had said.Meanwhile, Satyadeo Ram, CPI (Marxist-Leninist) MLA from Darauli, the local assembly constituency where the latest hooch deaths took place, said he had visited the victims’ families and they confirmed that their kin had consumed hooch and developed complications. “Facts cannot change just because the administration as usual remains in denial mode,” he said.

The matter has been posted for hearing on February 4.The foundation for the mega project was laid by then chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in June 2018. The APNRT had raised ₹34 crore from the NRIs, mostly from the US, through the initial investments.With the change of government in May 2019 and chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy dumping Amaravati capital project, the NRIs began mounting pressure on the APNRT to refund their money, as they realized that the tower would be of no value if the capital city doesn’t come up at Amaravati.“Even if Amaravati is continued as the legislative capital, it will not get the same grandeur as envisaged by the previous government. So, the NRT Icon tower can never come up,” the NRIs said in their petition.APNRTS president Venkat S Medapati, however, allayed their apprehensions. “We have not shelved the project and the chief minister also has given consent for the construction of NRT Icon tower. But 90% of the NRIs are not convinced and want their money back,” Medapati said.He said out of ₹34 crore mobilized from the NRIs for booking in the complex, ₹21 crore has already been spent on purchase of land, securing approvals, processing fees, payments made to consultants like KPMG and architects and advance payment to world-class builders. “We are ready to reimburse the remaining amount to the investors, but they want their entire money. How is it possible?” Medapati asked.Senior advocate Jandhyala Ravishankar, who is arguing the case on behalf of the NRIs, pointed out that the APNRTS had sent notices to the NRI investors saying that they would forfeit their money, if they won’t pump in more money to complete the project. “We have challenged it in the court,” he said.Medapati said the NRIs have to pay money for the projects in instalments to ensure its completion. “The construction agreement clearly says if they don’t release their dues, their initial booking money would be forfeited,” he said. He added that since the issue is in the court, the APNRTS would abide by whatever decision the court will take.In 2018, over 100 NRIs had invested in the ₹500 crore 158-metre high 33-floor mega iconic tower, NRT Icon, proposed to be built on a 5.4 acres on the banks of Krishna River at Rayapudi village of Amaravati, which was then being developed as the greenfield capital city of AP.The tower was expected to house several multinational companies, mostly software firms, providing employment to over 5,000 people.According to the project report made by the APNRT, the tower was designed with a shape “A” representing Amaravati. It was to have a total space of nine lakh square feet and every floor was planned to have an office space of 20,000 sq feet. A mega convention centre accommodating 5,000 persons and a revolving restaurant at the top were also conceived.Other facilities to include were an international standard shopping complex,world-class auditorium, high-end classrooms with state-of-the-art audio-visual equipment, sustainability features with water and energy conservation etc.As many as 110 units, each comprising around 5,000 square feet, were offered for sale in the NRT Icon, of which 102 were booked. The NRIs had paid booking amounts ranging from ₹10 lakh up to ₹2 crore.

No group has so far claimed the attack.Security in Afghanistan has vastly improved since a two-decade long insurgency by the Taliban ended with the hardline Islamist group's capture of the capital Kabul in August.However, several attacks are reported each week throughout the country, including some claimed by the regional chapter of the Islamic State group.IS has regularly targeted the country's Shiite Hazara community with deadly attacks, and the area where Saturday's blast occurred near a bus station is also inhabited by the community.Herat is the country's third-biggest city, close to the border with Iran, but had remained relatively peaceful in recent months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bomb-on-bus-kills-7-in-afghanistan-s-herat-city-officials-101642871529272.html

Indian authorities are working with their Canadian counterparts to investigate the death of the Indian nationals during an apparent human smuggling operation to take people from the Canadian side to the US. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) found the bodies of the four Indians – an infant, a male teenager, an adult male and an adult female – on Wednesday, shortly after the US Customs and Border Protection (USBP) apprehended a group of Indians who allegedly crossed into the US from Canada near the town of Emerson in Manitoba. People familiar with the matter said on Saturday that US authorities had detained a US citizen and seven other people without proper documentation for allegedly being involved in human smuggling activity. Two of these eight people were hospitalised with cold-related injuries, they said. Earlier reports had identified the US citizen detained by authorities as Steve Shand, a 47-year-old resident of Florida. The people cited above said the four dead people and the others detained without proper documentation in the US appeared to be Indian nationals. “However, further efforts are underway to identify them and confirm their nationalities. Post-mortem of the victims is likely to be carried out on January 24,” one of the people said. A team sent by the Indian consulate in Toronto to Manitoba is liaising with Canadian authorities to render consular help regarding the four dead people. The consulate and the high commission in Ottawa are in touch with Canada’s provincial and federal authorities to ascertain more details about the incident. In the US, the Indian consulate in Chicago has sent a team to Minneapolis to coordinate with local authorities and to provide consular assistance. This team has sought consular access to the detained people. The consulate and the embassy in Washington are also in touch with the US department of justice and USBP. External affairs minister S Jaishankar had on Friday directed the Indian envoys to the US and Canada to respond to the situation. Ajay Bisaria, India’s high commissioner to Canada, described the incident as a “grave tragedy” and said Indian authorities will work with their Canadian counterparts to investigate the disturbing event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eight-detained-in-us-following-death-of-4-indians-in-human-smuggling-operation-101642862923715.html

Grateful to the men and women of the White House Military Office for taking me in and teaching me about service and sacrifice," he said.An Obama administration alum, Varghese joined the Biden White House after leading the president's inauguration efforts and serving as a senior adviser and chief operating officer for Biden's 2020 presidential campaign, the CNN reported on Friday.Varghese "is departing his post Friday after several years working in President Joe Biden's orbit," it said.The White House declined to say whether a replacement has been selected."One thing I learned during two tours here is it's a demanding place to work and it's because the work is really important, and we throw all of ourselves into this...Right now, it's best for me and my family that I kind of just try to strike a little bit more of a balance," Varghese, who is in his early forties, was quoted as saying to CNN.He, however, did not detail his next endeavours.As head of the military office, Varghese used to coordinate with the military branches responsible for supporting presidential operations at the White House and on the road domestically and abroad, including Air Force One missions, secure communications via the White House Communications Agency, food services, the medical unit and Camp David, the presidential retreat frequented often by the Biden family, the report said.A lawyer by training, Varghese was born in the US to parents who immigrated from Thiruvalla, Kerala.

22-01-2022||World||Canada’s Omicron wave may have peaked||Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam on Friday struck a cautiously optimistic note that the surge of Covid-19 cases, driven by the more transmissible Omicron variant, may have peaked.Tam, in a statement released on Friday, said that a modelling update from last week had suggested that the Omicron surge would peak in January and recede by February, but the latest data has “early indications that infections may have peaked at the national level, including daily case counts, test positivity, Rt (or effective reproduction number), and wastewater surveillance trends”.Despite this, hospitals and intensive care units continue to be under strain given the large number of cases in Canada.Multiple Canadian provinces, including Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia, have started easing restrictions that were imposed as the Omicron-driven fifth wave mounted.However, there could still be “some difficult weeks ahead and potential for more bumps along the way”, Dr. Tam said, adding that vaccinations and several effective treatments have led to health authorities to “remain hopeful” these would change the nature of the pandemic to “reduce severity going forward”.In the latest seven-day period between January 14 - 20, an average of 25,821 new cases were reported across Canada daily. While this is a 28% decrease compared to the week prior, “infection rates remain elevated and are increasing in some jurisdictions”, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC).Laboratory test positivity rate remains elevated at 23% “indicating continued widespread community transmission”, it said.An average of 10,041 people were being treated for Covid in hospitals each day during that period, which was 38% higher than last week and exceeds all previous peaks.Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 2,868,862 cases of Covid-19 and 32,220 deaths reported in Canada.
22-01-2022||World||1 New York City police officer killed, 1 severely injured in Harlem shooting||A New York City police officer was killed and another critically wounded Friday night while answering a call about an argument between a woman and her adult son, officials said, making four officers shot in the city in as many days.Just three weeks into their jobs, Mayor Eric Adams — a former police captain himself — and Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell stood before the media at a Harlem hospital, denouncing the spate of violence against the New York Police Department.“Countless officers lined this hallway after carrying him in and grieve for their brother while praying with everything they have for the other” officer, Sewell said. “I am struggling to find the words to express the tragedy we are enduring. We’re mourning, and we’re angry.”Adams said, “This was just not an attack on these brave officers. This was an attack on the city of New York.”Adams called for federal authorities to do more to round up stolen guns like the one used in Friday’s shooting inside a Harlem apartment.“There are no gun manufacturers in New York City,” he said. “We don’t make guns here. How are we removing thousands of guns off the street and they still find their way into New York City, in the hands of people who are killers?”Authorities said the officers, along with a third officer, went to the apartment on 135th Street after a call came in from a woman needing help with her son, identified by police as Lashawn J. McNeil, 47.Authorities said the officers spoke with the woman and another son, but there was no mention of a weapon. Then two of them walked from the front of the apartment down a narrow, 30-foot (9-meter) hallway.NYPD Chief of Detectives James Essig said McNeil swung open a bedroom door and opened fire at the officers, striking them.The officer who was killed was identified as 22-year-old Jason Rivera, who joined the force in November 2020, and the wounded officer as Wilbert Mora, 27, who's been with the NYPD for four years.As McNeil tried to flee, a third officer who’d stayed with McNeil’s mother in the front of the apartment shot at McNeil and wounded him in the head and arm, Essig said.McNeil is alive and hospitalized in critical condition, NYPD spokesperson Lt. John Grimpel said, correcting earlier reports that he had been killed. Sewell and Adams did not take questions at the hospital press conference.McNeil's last known address is in Allentown, Pennsylvania, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) west of New York City.McNeil was on probation for a 2003 drug conviction in New York City. He also had several out of state arrests. In 1998, he was arrested in South Carolina for unlawfully carrying a pistol, but records show the matter was later dismissed. In 2002, he was arrested in Pennsylvania for assaulting a police officer, Essig said.Police said the gun used in Friday night's shooting, a .45-caliber Glock with a high-capacity magazine capable of holding up to 40 extra rounds, had been stolen in Baltimore in 2017.Friday night's shooting happened in a street-level apartment in a six-story apartment building on a block between two iconic Harlem avenues: Malcolm X Boulevard and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard.It came three nights after an officer was wounded in the leg in the Bronx during a struggle with a teenager who also shot himself. On Thursday, a narcotics detective was shot in the leg on Staten Island.Under Adams, the NYPD has reinstated a plainclothes anti-crime unit aimed at getting guns off the streets. The unit had been disbanded in 2020 over concerns it accounted for a disproportionate number of shootings and complaints.The NYPD has also partnered with prosecutors, city and federal agencies in recent months on a task force that meets daily and works to track gun violence, accelerate gun tracing and build cases against shooters and gun traffickers.Before Friday, the last NYPD officer killed in the line of duty was Anastasios Tsakos, who was struck by a suspected drunken driver in May 2021 while assisting officers at the scene of an earlier crash on a Queens highway.The last NYPD officer fatally shot in the line of duty, Brian Mulkeen, was hit by friendly fire while struggling with an armed man after chasing and shooting at him in the Bronx in September 2019.Mulkeen’s death came about seven months after Det. Brian Simonsen was killed by friendly fire while he and other officers were confronting a robbery suspect at a cell phone store in Queens.In 2017, Officer Miosotis Familia was ambushed by a gunman as she wrote in a notebook in a mobile command post. In 2016, Sgt. Paul Tuozzolo was killed in a gunfight with a man who’d broken into his estranged wife’s home.In 2015, Officer Randolph Holder was shot and killed by a man riding a stolen bicycle in Manhattan and Officer Brian Moore died after he was shot by a man in Queens.The year before, Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were fatally shot by a man who ambushed them as they sat in their patrol car in Brooklyn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1-new-york-city-police-officer-killed-1-severely-injured-in-harlem-shooting-101642838894342.html

22-01-2022||World||Trump told Pentagon to seize voting machines after poll defeat: Report||A draft executive order written by Donald Trump's White House in the weeks after his defeat in the 2020 election directed the nation's top military leader to seize voting machines, a report said Friday.The explosive document, released by the National Archives and obtained by Politico, highlights the extreme measures Trump may have been willing to take to cling to power against the will of voters who picked Joe Biden to be their next president.Dated December 16 2020, the order sought to appoint a special counsel to bring charges on any fraud allegations that arose from the seizures. But it was never signed.It is among 750-plus records turned over to the House of Representatives select committee investigating the 2021 Capitol assault after the Supreme Court rejected Trump's appeal to block their release."Effective immediately, the Secretary of Defense shall seize, collect, retain and analyze all machines, equipment, electronically stored information, and material records required for retention," says the three-page draft.The document reprises many of the debunked conspiracy theories about hacked voting machines that were pushed by figures in Trump's orbit now being targeted by congressional investigators, including right-wing attorney Sidney Powell.She falsely told reporters the election had been targeted by "communist money through Venezuela, Cuba, and likely China."Powell and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani led unsuccessful efforts to have courts throw out election results in key swing states in the weeks after Trump's defeat.The ex-president and his allies spent months pressing false claims of widespread fraud, despite experts in his own government affirming that it was the most secure vote in US history.The claims were also rejected by Trump-appointed attorney general Bill Barr, and Trump was eventually impeached for inciting the attack on the Capitol by a mob of his supporters.The draft order bears similarities with a plot outlined in a Powerpoint presentation to keep Trump in office that former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows turned over to the select committee last year.That document envisaged US Marshals seizing ballots for a 50-state hand recount.The draft executive order that emerged Friday focuses specifically on touchscreen ballot-marking devices made by Dominion that were used in Georgia, where a hand recount and machine recount affirmed Biden's win.It repeats false allegations about Dominion being "owned or heavily controlled and influenced by foreign agents, countries, and interests" and alleging that its machines are deliberately designed to create "systemic fraud."Powell and Giuliani are fighting billion-dollar defamation lawsuits from Dominion and Smartmatic, another voting machine company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-told-pentagon-to-seize-voting-machines-after-poll-defeat-report-101642820564884.html
22-01-2022||World||US lawmakers urge Biden to release frozen Afghan funds 'to prevent humanitarian disaster'||Three US lawmakers have urged US President Joe Biden to release Afghanistan's assets worth billions of dollars to prevent a humanitarian disaster that is unfolding. The South Asian country is on the verge of an economic collapse months after the United States with its NATO allies withdrew forces and the Taliban took over the reins.The lawmakers from the US House of Representatives made the recommendation in a letter to the US President. In the letter, they suggested a focused release of humanitarian funds to help the Afghan residents. They also underlined that the US has a moral obligation to Afghanistan who partnered with them in their war against terrorism."When the last American troops left Afghanistan, the United States promised that we would not abandon Afghanistan," the lawmakers stated in the letter, as cited by news agency ANI. "That is a mistake we made once before with grave consequences for our own security, as well as for the Afghan people. We must uphold our promise and do what is necessary to ensure that the progress made over the last 20 years is not lost," the lawmakers added.They also stressed that the US cannot allow Afghanistan to "once again become a breeding ground for terrorist organisations intent on killing Americans and attacking our nation."In December last year as well, 40 lawmakers had written to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen to release humanitarian aid to Afghans as the United Nations warned about a major humanitarian crisis prevailing in the war-torn nation.In August last year, the Taliban completed the capture of power in Afghanistan by seizing the presidential palace in Kabul in a rapid military offensive as foreign troops were leaving. The chaotic exit caused a major crisis for Afghans, with many security experts claiming it brought the country back to 1991 when the Taliban were ousted by the US troops.Following the Taliban takeover, the US froze nearly $10 billion in assets belonging to the Afghan central bank.Last week, Antonio Guterres warned about a "nightmare unfolding in Afghanistan" and said that the world is in a race against time to help the Afghan people. "Babies being sold to feed their siblings. Freezing health facilities overflowing with malnourished children. People burning their possessions to keep warm. Livelihoods across the country have been lost," the UN chief also said, while asking the global community to come together to help Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-lawmakers-urge-biden-to-release-frozen-afghan-funds-to-prevent-humanitarian-disaster-101642821921543.html

Thousands of travellers were being tested for Covid-19 at the airport, according to reports, reported the news channel.The Islamabad airport is also crowded with people these days, because of a complete restoration of airline operations, which has become worrisome for airport officials.Notably, Pakistan registered 7,678 Covid-19  cases, the highest daily figure since the start of the pandemic in 2020, official data showed on Friday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nearly-100-employees-at-islamabad-airport-infected-with-covid19-101642824618592.html

22-01-2022||World||‘Stealth Omicron’: All you need to know about fast-spreading sub-strain||A new sub-variant of Omicron has raised fears that more transmissible strains of the coronavirus could spark larger Covid-19 waves globally.The health authorities in the UK have designated the sub-variant, called BA.2, as ‘variant under investigation’. It is the initial step of investigation before being designated a ‘variant of concern’ (VOC), which the original Omicron BA.1 currently is.The sub-lineage, dubbed ‘stealth Omicron’, was designated in early December last year and as of January 10 this year, 53 sequences of BA.2 had been identified in the UK.How many sub-strains dose the Omicron variant have?According to World Health Organization (WHO), the Omicron variant has three sub-strains: BA.1, BA.2 and BA.3. It further said that as many as 99 per cent of the cases sequenced were found to be containing the BA.1 sub-strain.The WHO further said that the knowledge about B.1.1.529 is still developing, but this lineage is more diverse.But now, more sub-variants have been emerging, especially in one of the worst-affected regions by the spread of Covid-19, Europe.Where have the cases of the BA.2 sub-variant been detected?Apart from the UK, the BA.2 has been found in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Scientists in France and India have also warned about the quick spread of the BA.2 sub-variant, which is expected to outpace other Omicron strains.The situation is particularly bad in Denmark where BA.2 has gone from accounting 20 per cent of the cases to 45 per cent between late December and mid-January.Denmark has been reporting over 30,000 cases this week, 10 times more than the peak in previous Covid-19 wave.BA.2 vs BA.1 vs BA.3Researchers have pointed to the probable reason why the new sub-strain is expected to become the dominant cause of Covid-19 in months to come.Vipin M Vashishtha, Member of WHO’s Vaccine Safety Net, said on Twitter that BA.2 shares 32 mutations with BA.1 but also has 28 unique mutations of its own.What do we know about BA.2-sub-lineage of Omicron? Is BA.2 different? BA.2 shares 32 mutations w/ BA.1, but it also has 28 unique mutations. Some diff in S1. E is the same, N & M are diff in 1 mutation between the two variants.And...quite a difference when we go to ORF1ab. 1/ https://t.co/qMjHUsV4J4 pic.twitter.com/sn0TB8avx3The BA.3 sub-strain is probably antigenically similar to BA.1 as it shares mutations at 417, 446, 484 and other key sites, added Vashishtha.However, Denmark has said that it is too early to tell what the mutations of BA.2 mean. “So far there is no information as to whether BA.1 and BA.2 have different properties," said the Statens Serum Institut, a government-run infectious disease research centre.Denmark’s government also said that their initial analysis shows there is no difference in hospitalisations for BA.2 compared to BA.1. The government announced that it is easing restrictions as the number of people needing intensive care is decreasing.Why is it called ‘stealth Omicron’?When the scientists discovered the Omicron variant, they noted that its original strain - the BA.1 - has a mutation in the form of a deletion in the “S” or spike gene which was detected by the PCR tests. The BA.2 sub-strain, however, does not have the same mutation, due to which it was called ‘stealth Omicron’.But in recent weeks, many experts have claimed that the sub-strain does show up on PCR tests. “BA.2 _is_ detectable by PCR, these news reports are totally wrong. Depending on the PCR test used it may not look like BA.1 (the other Omicron). But it will still give a positive result. Frustrating to see falsehood about non-detectability still around,” Cornelius Roemer, a computational biologist at Switzerland's University of Basel, said on Twitter.BA.2 _is_ detectable by PCR, these news reports are totally wrong.Depending on the PCR test used it may not look like BA.1 (the other Omicron). But it will still give a positive result.Frustrating to see falsehood about non-detectability still around.https://t.co/yeFzgIi84jBut BA.2 is currently in the news, according to virologist from the Imperial College of London Tom Peacock, because it has shown growth across multiple countries, which is the evidence that BA.2 may be some degree more transmissible than BA.1||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stealth-omicron-all-you-need-to-know-about-fast-spreading-substrain-101642820301884.html
22-01-2022||World||Can you get infected with Omicron twice? White House medical adviser answers||Top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci on Friday said it is extremely unlikely for people to get re-infected with the Omicron variant of coronavirus for at least several months. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was asked during a press briefing whether vaccinated people who got infected with Omicron are protected against reinfection from the new variant of concern.“Sure, there are reinfections. But it is unlikely that if you mount a good immune response, at least over a period of several months, it is extremely unlikely that you will be re-infected with the same variant,” the top immunologist said.Fauci stressed that the unpredictable nature of the variants of concerns has prompted authorities to chalk out the best-case and the worst-case scenarios. He said cases of reinfections have occurred mostly in people who fell ill with one variant and then later contracted a different variant, calling it the best-case scenario.“The worst-case scenario is something we have to be prepared for, and that is: We do get down to a level that we would say would be “adequate control,” but we’re faced with another surprise with a variant that’s so different that it eludes the accumulation of the immune protection that we’ve gotten from vaccinations and from prior infections,” he added.Omicron-driven Covid cases dip in US, some areas may still see rise: CDCRochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, informed that the seven-day daily average of Covid-19 cases is about 744,600 per day, a 5% decline over the previous week. The hospital admissions, however, with an increase of about 1% over the previous week, remain near all time-highs.“As we have seen during other phases of this pandemic, the surge in cases started at different times in different regions, and may continue to see high case counts in some areas of the country in the days and weeks ahead,” Walensky said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-you-get-infected-with-omicron-twice-white-house-medical-adviser-answers-101642816717127.html
22-01-2022||World||Crypto crash erases more than $1 trillion in market value||For Bitcoin, there’s only been one constant recently: decline after decline after decline. And the superlatives have piled up really quickly.With the Federal Reserve intending to withdraw stimulus from the market, riskier assets the world over have suffered. Bitcoin, the largest digital asset, lost more than 12% Friday and dropped below $36,000 to its lowest level since July. Since its peak in November, it has lost over 45% of its value. Other digital currencies have suffered just as much, if not more, with Ether and meme coins mired in similar drawdowns. Bitcoin’s decline since that November high has wiped out more than $600 billion in market value, and over $1 trillion has been lost from the aggregate crypto market. While there have been much larger percentage drawdowns for both Bitcoin and the aggregate market, this marks the second-largest ever decline in dollar terms for both, according to Bespoke Investment Group.“It gives an idea of the scale of value destruction that percentage declines can mask,” wrote Bespoke analysts in a note. “Crypto is, of course, vulnerable to these sorts of selloffs given its naturally higher volatility historically, but given how large market caps have gotten, the volatility is worth thinking about both in raw dollar terms as well as in percentage terms.”With the Fed’s intentions rocking both cryptocurrencies and stocks, a dominant theme has emerged in the digital-asset space: cryptos have twisted and turned in nearly exactly the same way as equities have. “Crypto is reacting to the same kind of dynamics that are weighing on risk-assets globally,” said Stephane Ouellette, chief executive and co-founder of institutional crypto-platform FRNT Financial. “Unfortunately for some of the mature projects like BTC, there is so much cross-correlation within the crypto asset class it’s almost a certainty that it falls, at least temporarily in a broader alt-coin valuation contraction.”Crypto-centric stocks also dropped on Friday, with Coinbase Global Inc. at one point losing nearly 16% and falling to its lowest level since its public debut in the spring of 2021, Bloomberg data show.MicroStrategy Inc. tumbled 18% while the Securities and Exchange Commission said the company can’t strip out Bitcoin’s wild swings from the unofficial accounting measures it touts to investors. The enterprise software company’s pile of Bitcoin has effectively made its shares a proxy for the digital asset.   Meanwhile, the Biden administration is preparing to release an initial government-wide strategy for digital assets as soon as next month and task federal agencies with assessing the risks and opportunities that they pose, according to people familiar with the matter.Antoni Trenchev, Nexo co-founder and managing partner, cites Bitcoin’s correlation to the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, which right now is near the highest in a decade. “Bitcoin is being battered by a wave of risk-off sentiment. For further cues, keep an eye on traditional markets,” he said. “Fear and unease among investors is palpable.”Take also the correlation between Bitcoin and Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF (ticker ARKK), a pandemic poster-child of speculative risk-taking. That correlation stands at around 60% year-to-date, versus about 14% for the price of gold, according to Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, a research firm focused on technical analysis. It’s “reminding us to categorize Bitcoin and altcoins as risk assets rather than safe havens,” she said. Meanwhile, more than 239,000 traders had their positions closed over the past 24 hours, with liquidations totaling roughly $874 million, according to data from Coinglass, a cryptocurrency futures trading and information platform. Though liquidations have spiked, the numbers are relatively muted when compared to previous declines, according to Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at Genesis Global Trading. Acheson points out that Bitcoin’s one-week skew, which compares the cost of bearish options to bullish ones, spiked to almost 15% on Wednesday compared to an average of about 6% in the past seven days.“This flagged a jump in bearish sentiment, in line with overall market jitters given the current macro uncertainty,” she said. Kara Murphy, chief investment officer at Kestra Investment Management, said cryptocurrencies have a life of their own but that the recent slump is rational. “It makes sense as people start to retrench a little bit, look for something that’s a little bit more solid, they’re gonna move away from crypto,” she said. “On the margin, with folks becoming more risk averse, crypto will suffer from that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/crypto-crash-erases-more-than-1-trillion-in-market-value-101642815455334.html
22-01-2022||India||Will back out if BJP fields good candidate, says Parrikar’s son||PANAJI: A day after quitting the Bharaytia Janata Party (BJP) to contest next month’s Goa assembly elections from Panaji as an independent, Utpal Parrikar, son of late chief minister Manohar Parrikar, said on Saturday that he was ready to withdraw from the race if the party fields a “good candidate” from the constituency.Parrikar quit the BJP after he was denied a ticket from Panaji, a constituency that his father and party veteran had represented for more than two decades. After quitting the party on Friday, he said he will fight the February 14 elections from the Panaji seat as an independent.The BJP has nominated sitting legislator Atanasio “Babush” Monserrate, one of the 10 MLAs who joined the party in July 2019 after quitting Congress, as its candidate from Panaji. Monserrate is facing multiple criminal cases, including a case of rape of a minor.Parrikar said the decision to quit the party was a “most difficult decision”. If the party had given the ticket to any “good candidate who didn’t have a criminal background,” he would not have been forced to quit the BJP, he said.“It is not about me. Give us a good candidate for Panaji, one who is not a criminal, and I will back out and tell the voters to vote for this candidate,” Parrikar said.Manohar Parrikar represented the Panaji constituency since 1994 and until his death in 2019, apart from a brief two-year term when he was India’s defence minister and a Rajya Sabha member from Uttar Pradesh.However, the BJP has justified its decision to field Monserrate from Panaji, saying he can “best represent the aspirations of the people”.Issuing a public notice in a local daily, a practice made mandatory as per directions of the Supreme Court, the BJP said “he has been actively engaged in social service for the people of the constituency for the past many years.”“He was found to have a good understanding of the ground situation and shared a good rapport with the voters here,” the notice read.Though the party has claimed that Monserrate is a “senior politician who has represented the constituency multiple times before”, in truth it is Monserrate’s first term as Panaji MLA. He had previously represented Taleigao and Santa Cruz constituencies.Monserrate is among seven BJP candidates to have criminal cases registered against them. His wife Jennifer Monserrate, who is the BJP candidate from Taleigao, too, has criminal cases relating to assault on police registered against her. Others with criminal cases are Rohan Khaunte, Govind Gaude, Krishna Salkar, Mauvin Godinho and Chandrakant Kavlekar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-back-out-if-bjp-fields-good-candidate-says-parrikar-s-son-101642875645774.html

While 48 die in every 100 road accidents in Odisha, the national average is 36. There has been a steady increase in the number of fatalities from 2014 (3,931) to 2020 (4,738), an increase of about 21%.As per State Road Safety Council officials, over-speeding contributed to 69 per cent of the deaths followed by violation of helmet law (41 per cent) and hit and run cases (20 per cent). The SC has recently pulled up the Odisha government for not adopting a focused approach for preventing fatalities by enforcing stringent measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-odisha-s-sonepur-5-of-bridegroom-s-party-killed-in-head-on-collision-with-truck-101642873663920.html
22-01-2022||India||What Delhi's gradually rising Covid death toll says | 5 points||Delhi on Saturday reported 45 Covid-related deaths, the highest since June last year, though the positivity rate in the national capital is going down. On Thursday, the death toll was 43. The trend matches what experts have been warning across the world that the peak of cases in the third wave will be followed by the peak of fatalities, though the situation in the third wave will remain much better than the second wave, experts have predicted.Here are 5 points to know about Delhi and India's Covid-19 situation1. The Delhi government earlier said the fatalities are mostly in patients with comorbidities. A doctor at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences told PTI any patient who gets admitted after testing positive and with severe complications generally dies after a few days of treatment. Hence, the death tally is likely to peak later.2. In the first 22 days in January, the Covid death toll in Delhi stands at 479.3. A study released by Max Healthcare hospitals on patients admitted during the ongoing third wave, hospital occupancy and ICU bed requirement is much lower now in comparison with the earlier waves, a point which has been emphasised by the Centre as well.4. The study said the overall mortality in the first wave was at 7.2% which increased to 10.5% during the second wave. So far, the hospital which conducted the study saw 6% mortality. Deaths are being reported in the elderly population who had other complications like kidney disease, heart disease, diabetes, cancer etc.5. As on Saturday, a little over 2,500 patients in Delhi are being treated in hospitals and Covid care centres while 44,000 people are in home isolation. Over 90% of beds are vacant in Covid care centres and health centres. Over 80% of beds are vacant in Delhi's dedicated Covid hospitals.Maharashtra on Saturday reported 46,393 fresh cases and 48 deaths. Mumbai reported 3,568 fresh infections. Bengaluru reported 17,266 cases in a sharp decline from around 30,000 the previous day. Karnataka reported 42,470 fresh infections. Kerala reported 45,136 new infections and the government has asked the private hospitals to set aside 50% of beds for Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-delhi-s-gradually-rising-covid-death-toll-says-5-points-101642871756319.html
22-01-2022||India||Kerala High Court restrains police from arresting actor Dileep till Jan 27||The Kerala High Court on Saturday restrained the crime branch from arresting Malayalam actor Dileep and four others till January 27 in a fresh case related to an alleged conspiracy to kill the police officer who investigated the case of abduction and sexual assault involving an actress. In the interim order the single judge bench of Justice P Gopinath allowed the crime branch to question him and others till Tuesday and warned the accused that their bail will be cancelled if they tried to influence witnesses in the case. Though the prosecution insisted on custodial interrogation the court said a final decision will be taken on January 27. The court issued an interim order after a day-long hearing. The crime branch had filed a fresh case against them two weeks back alleging a plot to kill the police officer who investigated the actor’s abduction and sexual assault case of 2017. The Malayalam actor, who is the seventh accused in the case, and others, moved the court after a fresh case was registered against them following the disclosure of film director Balachandra Kumar. The court witnessed fierce arguments and at one point the court observed that charges against the accused that they conspired to finish off the police officer were difficult to stand the test of law if they were merely based on the statement of the director. The court also directed the prosecution to file a detailed report on questioning in a sealed cover before Thursday. The defence lawyer argued that a conspiracy charge was foisted on the accused without any proof after the investigation team found that its contentions in the main case were weak. But the prosecution insisted that custodial interrogation was needed to unravel the case and the accused may try to influence witnesses using money and muscle power. At this point the court said conspiracy and inducements were two different things and a mere statement that someone would be killed cannot be taken as an inducement. The sensational case took a fresh turn after director Balachandra Kumar’s disclosure and he also released some audio tapes. The crime branch later registered a fresh case against Dileep and four others for allegedly plotting a conspiracy to eliminate the police officer Baiju Paulose. The conversation allegedly took place in November 2017 at the actor’s house in Aluva in Ernakulam district, crime branch said in its first information report. The new FIR was filed against six Dileep, his brother Anoop, another relative Suraj, and two others (Appu and Babu) and they were charged under the Indian Penal Code sections 116 (abetment of offence), 118 (concealing design to commit an offence), 120 B (criminal conspiracy) and 506 (criminal intimidation). After Kumar’s revelations the Kerala government approached the Supreme Court two weeks back with a plea to extend the trial for six more months. Kumar, a former friend of actor Dileep, claimed last month that the actor was in possession of the video of the assault on a woman actor and that he tried to influence many witnesses in the case. He also alleged that he had met the main accused in the case, Pulsar Suni, at the residence of actor Dileep in 2016 when he had gone there to discuss a film project. Later the prosecution recorded his statement under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. A leading woman actor was waylaid, kidnapped and sexually assaulted by a criminal gang in Kochi while she was returning home after a shooting assignment in 2017. Six months after the incident, Dileep was arrested and made an accused in the case. Prosecution alleged that the attack was planned at the behest of Dileep to settle an old score with the woman actor. In four years, the high-profile case has witnessed many twists and turns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-high-court-restrains-police-from-arresting-actor-dileep-till-jan-27-101642869883689.html

The three-term MLA and former state BJP president, who has represented the Mandrem constituency in North Goa since 2002 until his defeat in 2017 has said that he was taken for granted by the party and ignored in favour of a non-performing MLA. “The people are disappointed in the present MLA. I was waiting for the ticket. I didn’t publicly make known my disappointment. I am a disciplined soldier of the party so I didn’t go to town with my grievances. But they took me for granted. Thinking that I will not resign. Even now there are people who think that I will not be able to bring myself to resign from the party. But it is high time. I am resigning from the BJP,” Parsekar said. “On January 20, it was announced that I was not getting the ticket. My supporters were intensely disappointed, but it soon became a demand that I should resign and contest as an independent. If I am concerned about this constituency then I should run for elections, was what they told me,” Parsekar said. The former chief minister said that he sensed that there was popular anger in the constituency over the non-performance of the current MLA over a stalled project and the lack of new projects. Explaining the reasons why he lost, Parsekar said that during his tenure as chief minister he got caught up in administrative work which “widened the gap” between him and his voters resulting in his defeat. “At the time I didn’t campaign at all. I was the Chief Minister and the gap between me and the people had widened. I was staying in Panjim since I had to focus on administration at the time. I didn’t lose focus on the development of the constituency,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-goa-cm-laxmikant-parsekar-quits-bjp-to-contest-as-independent-101642868743551.html
22-01-2022||India||HT This Day: Jan 23, 1986 - Sawant, two others sentenced to death||NEW DELHI- Special Judge Mahesh Chandra today convicted Satwant Singh, Kehar Singh and Balbir Singh on the charges of murder and conspiracy to murder late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, and sentenced them to death. With this, Mr Mahesh Chandra, District and Sessions Judge, delivered the first death sentence of his career and brought the historic trial to an end. The judgment follows 113 sittings over eight months in the makeshift courtroom inside the Central Jail, Tihar. The trial began on May 13 last year after it was committed to the Sessions by Addl Chief Metropolitan Magistrate S. L Khanna, on May 6. The arguments concluded on Jan 15 this year after approximately 250 hours of court time. The three accused in the case-Satwant Singh, alleged surviving assassin and conspirators Balbir and Kehar Sing were chargesheeted under Sections 302. 307 and 120(D) of the Indian Penal Code on Feb 11 last year by the special investigating team led by Ms Anand Ram, IPS. The other alleged assassin, Beant Singh was killed in a shoot-out following the assassinated. Reading the operative portion of his 259-page judgment, Mr Chandra said the prosecution had established, beyond all reasonable doubt, that deceased Beant Singh and accused Kehar Singh. Balbir Singh and Satwant Singh had on and before October 31. 1984, entered at New Delhi into a criminal conspiracy to commit the murder of Smt. Indira Gandhi, the then Prime Minister of India, and they had in furtherance of the said conspiracy and their common objective committed, both jointly and individually, illegal acts. The judgment says that "finally on 31-10-1984 at 9.10 a.m. deceased Beant Singh and accused Satwant Singh in pursuance of the said criminal conspiracy and in furtherance of their common intention, while posted on security duty at TMC gate on No. I Saidarjung Road, New Delhi, had fired fire-arms bullet shots upon Mrs Indira Gandhi," the then Prime Minister of India, from their service arms namely revolver (Ex.P.L) and SAF carbine (Ex.P.4), respectively". As a consequence of this firing, the judgment reads. Mrs Gandhi "sustained grievous and dangerous injuries which resulted subsequently in her death and in the process accused Satwant Singh further also caused grevious bullet injuries to P.W. Rameshwar Dayal." Mr Chandra said, "I have come to the conclusion that accused Satwant Singh had used his service SAF carbine (Ex.P.4) for an illegal and unlawful purpose, i.e. to commit the murder of Smt. Indira Gandhi." Mr Chandra said he therefore held that accused Satwant Singh, Kehar Singh and Balbir Singh had been proved to have committed criminal offences punishable under Sections 12()-B read with Section 302 I P.C. He further held that Satwant Singh was proved to have committed criminal offences punishable under Section 302 I.P.C. read with Section 120-B/34 1.P.C. and under Section 307 I.P.C. and also under Section 27 of the Arms Act, 1959, and convicted them of the same. Mr Mahesh Chandra, who was very tense while reading out the judgement from behind a bullet-proof glass partition, delivered it at 11 a.m. in the presence of the special public prosecutor and the accused. Counsel for Satwant Singh, Kehar Singh and Balbir Singh was absent. After asking the accused if they wished to say anything on the judgement - all three declared their innocence - Mr Chandra retired to his chamber to write the order of sentence. I le returned to the court at 11.51 a.m. In a separate three-page Order of sentence, Mr Chandra said he had called upon the accused to make their submissions on the question of sentence in accordance with Section 235 Cr.P.C. He said the accused had only submitted that they were innocent and had not said anything else. The judge said he had given his considered thought to the question of sentence. Briefly outlining the facts of the case, Mr Chandra said he had kept in view both the nature of the offence and the fact "that deceased Beant Singh and accused Satwant Singh were detailed for the security of the late Prime Minister Smt. Indira Gandhi and the service arms Ex.P.1 revolver and Ex.P.4 SAF carbine had been issued to deceased Beant Singh and accused Satwant Singh for her security and they committed her murder after entering into criminal conspiracy with other persons". There was pin-drop silence in the courtroom as the Special Judge said he was of the opinion that the present case was one of "rarest of rare nature in which extreme penalty of death is called for". Mr Chandra said, "I sentence accused Satwant Singh, Kehar Singh and Balbir Singh under Section 120-8 read with Section 302 I.P.C. to the sentence of death." He said, "I further sentence accused Satwant Singh under Section 302 read with Secton 120-B/34 I.P.C. to the sentence of death and further sentence him to undergo R.I. for seven years under Section 307 I.P.C. and to undergo R.I. k>r three years under Section 27 of the Arms Act and all the sentences shall run concurrently. The 259-page judgment took note of Mr Pran Nath Lekhi's contention that the conspiracy lay somewhere else. But, it stated, the limited question before the court was whether deceased Beant Singh along with accused Satwant Singh. Kehar Singh and Balbir Singh had on or before Oct. 31. 1984, entered into a criminal conspiracy to murder Mrs Indira Gandhi, and whether in furtherance of such conspiracy Beant Singh and Satwant Singh did in fact murder her on Oct. 31, 1984. The judgement said that "any other question would he irrelevant as far as this court is concerned and, therefore, cannot be gone into and any reference to it would be even uncalled for here". It concluded that the prosecution had established the guilt of the accused persons beyond reasonable doubt. Another aspect of the case considered in the judgment was the confessional statement made by accused Satwant Singh which was retracted later. The judgment noted that Mr S. L. Khanna, Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, had warned Satwant Singh that be was not ix>und to make a statement and that if he made one it could be used against him during the trial. Mr Khanna had given Satwant two days to consider his decision, allowed him to consult a lawyer, Mr I. U. Khan, and only then sent him to Mr Bharat Bhushan Mr recording his statement. Satwant had also been medically examined by Dr Vijay Kumar, Medical Officer of Tihat Jail, and was declared fit to make a statement. Satwant had signed each page of the confession document. The judgment dismissed defence counsels contention that there were irregularities in the appointment of Mr S. L. Khanna and Mr Bharat Bhusban. It said that the mere fact that the orders of appointment of Mr Bharat Bhusban had not reached him on Dec 1. 84 when he recorded the confessional statement did not materially affect his competence in this regard as the orders became effective from the moment they were passed. Further, the Supreme Court had ruled that a retracted confession could be used for conviction of the accused "if it receives some general corroboration from other independent sources", and can also be used against co-accused. The judgment held that such corroboration had been received. Regarding the issue of conspiracy, the judgment held that the prosecution had established its case that Kehar Singh and Balbir Singh were associated with deceased Beant Singh, it had further established that on specific dates each conspirator was "doing something or the other at some place or the other", and that on those dates Kehar Singh had invariably been away from his job. The association of Balbir Singh with Beant and Satwant had also been proved. the main link between them being deceased Beant Singh. The judgment said that under Section 10 of the Indian Evidence Act, the acts of each one could be used against the other and could be attributed to all of them. Though the prosecutioil had not produced direct evidence of conspiracy, it had produced sufficient circumstantial evidence to raise an inference of conspiracy, the judgment said. These included the recovery of a book entitled "Bhindranwale Sant' from the house of Beant and Balbir, the 'baaz' (falcon) incident and the exhortation of Kehar to Beant in a gurdwara. Even Bimla Khalsa's testimony corroborated the charge of conspiracy, the judgment said. The 259-page judgment went through the entire evidence and arguments presented by both the prosecution and the defence counsel through its 113 sittings. It said that the statements of Head Constable Narain Singh and Assistant Sub-Inspector Rameshwar Dayal and Nathu Ram--the eye-witnesses to the occurrence--established that deceased Beant Singh and accused Satwant Singh had fired the shots at Mrs Gandhi. It had also established that they had deliberately manoeuvred their duty roster to do so. The judgment took note of the testimony of prosecution witness Inderbir Singh regarding the gurdwara incident and Kehar Singh's exhortation to Beant Singh, "Ro mat badla le". It noted that Kehar was very close to Beant and even took him to Amritsar. The confession of Satwant Singh also affected Balbir and Kehar Singh, the judgment read. After the judgment and the order of sentence were read in the open court, Mr Mahesh Chandra gave copies of the same to the three accused. He informed all three of them that they were entitled to file appeals against the judgment and sentence to the High Court within 30 days of the order. Mr Mahesh Chandra was then escorted out of the courtroom under heavy security and did not come to his office in Patiala House in the afternoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-this-day-jan-23-1986-sawant-two-others-sentenced-to-death-101642867019314.html

He hires contract killer to murder her||A man allegedly hired a contract killer to murder his wife after she purchased a smart phone without his permission. The woman, however, survived the attack. She had to undergo around seven stitches in her throat as the killer managed to injure her with a sharp weapon. The incident took place late on Thursday night at Narendrapur in the southern fringes of Kolkata. Police have arrested two persons including the man and the contract killer. Cops are looking for another man who was roped in by the contract killer. “According to the woman she had asked her husband, a few months ago, to buy her a smart phone which he refused. The woman who has been earning some money by giving tuition classes bought a smart phone on January 1. When the husband got to know about it he was furious and threatened to kill her,” said an officer of the local police station. On Thursday night before going to sleep the man went to lock the main door of the house. But as he didn’t come back even after some time, the woman went looking for him and was attacked by two unidentified men. The injured woman, bleeding profusely, managed to rush out of the house and raise an alarm. On hearing the screams of the woman, a group of locals who were feasting nearby rushed to her aid. One of the assailants and the husband was caught. The second assailant managed to flee. “We have arrested the woman’s husband Rajesh Jha, 40 and one of the assailants who identified himself as Surajit. We are looking for the second assailant.

The writer slammed the process of surrogacy and questioned the feelings of mothers who attain motherhood via surrogacy. Social media users criticised the writer's comment."How do those mothers feel when they get their readymade babies through surrogacy? Do they have the same feelings for the babies like the mothers who give birth to the babies?" the writer tweeted. Surrogacy is possible because there are poor women. Rich people always want the existence of poverty in the society for their own interests. If you badly need to raise a child, adopt a homeless one. Children must inherit your traits---it is just a selfish narcissistic ego.How do those mothers feel when they get their readymade babies through surrogacy?

22-01-2022||India||EC ban on physical rallies, roadshows to continue, relaxation for public meetings||As the country continues to grapple with a rise in Covid-19 cases, the Election Commission on Saturday extended its ban on political rallies and roadshows in the five election-bound states till January 31, while making exceptions for candidates contesting in the first and second phase of polls with a limit of 500 people being imposed on public meetings. After speaking to the secretary, ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India and Chief Secretaries, Chief Electoral Officers and Health Secretaries of Goa, Manipur, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, the Commission has, however, decided to relax some of the guidelines for candidates who will be contesting in the first phase on February 10 and second phase to be held on February 14. Now, candidates in Uttar Pradesh, which will vote in the first phase, will be allowed physical meetings in designated open spaces with a maximum of 500 people or 50% of the capacity of the ground, but only from January 28 to February 8. “Since contesting candidates for Phase 1 elections will be finalised on January 27, 2022, the Commission has decided to allow physical public meetings of political parties or contesting candidates in designated open spaces with a maximum of 500 people or 50% of the capacity of the ground or the prescribed limit set by SDMA, whichever number is lesser, from January 28, 2022 till February 8 2022 (excluding the silence period),” the statement said. Similar relaxations have also been issued for the second phase of the polls, which will be held in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Goa on February 14. The revised guidelines will be applicable for the second phase candidates from February 1, 2022 till February 12, 2022. The election watchdog last week relaxed the norms a little and allowed indoor meetings of a maximum of 300 people or 50% capacity of the meeting hall or limits prescribed by the state disaster management authorities. The Commission has also enhanced the limit for door-to-door campaign. Instead of 5 persons, now 10 persons, excluding security personnel, will be allowed for door-to-door campaign. “Commission has also allowed video vans for publicity with usual Covid-19 restrictions at designated open spaces with a maximum of 500 viewers or 50% of the capacity or the limit prescribed by SDMA, whichever is lesser, in the poll going states subject to public convenience and no hindrance to smooth flow of traffic,” the statement added. The decision grant leeway for public gatherings has been taken after the Commission consulted the health departments and other officials across the Centre and the states. “Chief Election Commissioner Sushil Chandra along with election commissioners Rajiv Kumar and Anup Chandra Pandey accompanied by Secretary General and concerned Deputy Election Commissioners held a comprehensive review of the present situation with respect to status and projected trends of Covid-19 pandemic in the five poll going states,” EC said in a press statement.“The Commission also reviewed vaccination status and action plan for expeditiously completing vaccination for 1st, 2nd and booster dose for eligible people amongst polling personnel. The Commission deliberated on relaxing restrictions for physical rallies in the wake of prevailing situation.”It said fresh instructions on campaigning will be issued after a review once the extended ban ends. Political parties, meanwhile, have been focusing on ramping up digital campaigns and events in keeping with the Commission’s guidelines. Home minister Amit Shah on Saturday held a door to door campaign in Uttar Pradesh, even as Congress’ candidates for Goa took a pledge and visited several temples in the state. The government also increased the expenditure limit for candidates last month to provide room to spend on virtual campaigns during the pandemic. The limit was raised by the Law Ministry to ₹40 lakh in large states, up from the earlier ₹30.8 lakhs, in keeping with EC’s recommendations. The elections for five assemblies will be held in seven phases from February 10. The results will be declared on March 10, the commission announced last week. It earlier placed restrictions of meetings till January 22.Other containment measures include curbs on the number of vehicles accompanying a candidate for the submission of nomination, which will be restricted to two instead of five.The Commission has allowed only 1,250 voters in each polling station instead of the usual 1,500. The number was capped at 1,000 for the previous two rounds of state elections. There will be mandatory sanitisation of polling stations and thermal checking of all those casting their vote. The commission is also running a pilot project to live-track overcrowding of voters at various poll booths to ensure safety norms are followed.Covid-19 patients and those who are quarantined will be allowed to cast their vote in the last hour of polling under the supervision of health authorities, the commission said. Sector magistrates will coordinate this in their allocated polling stations and record of such electors shall be maintained by the presiding officer, it said.All electoral offences will be brought to the fore and not just Covid-19-related offences. All violations will be dealt with by the chief secretary or the chief of the state disaster management authority of the concerned state, he added.Last year, the commission courted controversy throughout the eight-phase West Bengal election, beginning with the prolonged duration of polls to not conceding to the Opposition’s demands to club the last three phases in view of the alarming rise in Covid-19 cases. A police complaint was filed against the watchdog for culpable homicide by the wife of a Trinamool Congress candidate who died of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-ban-on-physical-rallies-roadshows-to-continue-relaxation-for-public-meetings-101642859983612.html
22-01-2022||India||Abide With Me missing from Beating Retreat line-up||Abide With Me, a decades-old staple tune at Beating Retreat and said to be Mahatma Gandhi’s favourite, does not figure in the line-up announced by the government on Saturday for the January 29 musical extravaganza that will feature a raft of military bands and marks the end of the Republic Day celebrations. The Christian hymn, composed by Henry Francis Lyte in 1847, finds no mention in an Indian Army handout released on Saturday with details of the ceremony, staged on the eve of Gandhi’s death anniversary.“Soldiers relate to Abide With Me as it has been a part of our military culture. The tradition should continue,” said former director general of military operations Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd).A defence ministry spokesperson did not comment on why the composition has been omitted in the 75th year of India’s Independence, a move that could trigger a fresh political row on the back of the eternal flame controversy.The eternal flame, Amar Jawan Jyoti, at India Gate was on Friday extinguished after 50 years and merged with the flame at the adjacent National War Memorial (NWM), amid political finger pointing over the move aimed at creating a single site for paying homage to India’s fallen heroes and conducting all ceremonial functions.Beating Retreat has traditionally ended with the hymn, Abide With Me. This year military buglers will play the iconic patriotic song Sare Jahan Se Acha in the end. The other popular tunes that will be played at the ceremony include Kadam Kadam Badhaye Ja, Ae Mere Watan Ke Logon and Hind Ki Sena.Beating Retreat will feature bands from the Indian Army, Indian Air Force, Indian Navy and Central Armed Police Forces, apart from buglers and pipes and drums bands. The ceremony involves the lowering the flags against the backdrop of the setting sun and a simultaneous lighting up of the Rashtrapati Bhawan, South Block, North Block and Parliament House.A new show with 1,000 drones is expected to add sparkle to Beating Retreat. It is being organised by a startup, Botlab Dynamics, supported by Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi and the department of science and technology. Only the US, Russia and China have the capability for a show with 1,000 drones, officials have said.The government on Saturday also released the schedule of the 73rd Republic Day Parade, India’s biggest ceremonial event that is being conducted in the shadow of the third Covid-19 wave and will be witnessed by fewer spectators at Rajpath.The Indian Army’s participation in the 90-minute parade will include a mounted column of 61 Cavalry (one of the world’s last remaining horse-mounted cavalry regiments), 14 mechanised columns and six marching contingents, apart from Param Vir Chakra and Ashoka Chakra awardees.The parade will begin at 10.30 am, instead of the traditional timing of 10 am, for better visibility to the parade and the fly past. The fly past, consisting of 75 aircraft in India’s 75th year of Independence, will feature flying formations to commemorate some glorious moments of India’s decisive victory over Pakistan in the 1971 war, including the historic Tangail airdrop and the Meghna heli-borne operation.Vintage army equipment to be showcased during the parade includes the Centurion tank that took part in the 1971 India-Pakistan war, OT-62 Topas armoured personnel carrier and the 75/24 Indian field gun, alongside modern tanks, infantry combat vehicles and artillery guns.The blend of old and new equipment seeks to demonstrate the army’s evolution over the years, as was done during the Army Day parade on January 15. The Republic Day parade will feature a total of 16 marching contingents, including those from the IAF, navy and para-military forces, and 25 tableaus of various states, government departments and the armed forces.The Indian Navy’s tableaux will depict the naval uprising of 1946, which contributed to India’s struggle for independence, said Lieutenant Mayank Bhagour. It will also feature models of the indigenous aircraft carrier Vikrant, the light combat aircraft and some warships.Before the parade starts, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will lead the country in paying homage to India’s fallen braves at NWM, a monument dedicated to soldiers who fell in post-Independence wars and operations and inaugurated by the PM almost three years ago, on February 25 2019. As on date, the names of 26,466 brave warriors are inscribed on the memorial, including the ones who fell in the 1971 war.The spectator count at the parade will be massively curtailed this year due to Covid-related restrictions with only 5,000 to 8,000 people to be allowed entry to Rajpath to witness the display of the country’s military might and cultural heritage.Only double vaccinated adults and single vaccinated children of age 15 and above will be allowed entry.The January 26 parade was attended by around 25,000 spectators amid the ebbing first wave last year, compared to around 125,000 people who would usually show up at Rajpath to watch the event in the pre-pandemic era.
22-01-2022||India||Ban on rallies in poll-bound states to continue till Jan 31, with few exceptions||The Election Commission on Saturday extended the ban on physical rallies and roadshows in five poll-bound states till January 31 amid the third wave of the Covid pandemic in the country. The decision was taken by the Election Commission following a meeting with the Union health secretary and the chief health secretaries of the five states.The commission has, however, granted relaxation for physical public meetings of political parties/contesting candidates for Phase 1 from January 28, for Phase 2 from February 1. The upper limit of five people permitted for the door-to-door campaign has been enhanced to 10. Video vans for publicity have been permitted at designated open spaces with Covid restrictions.Full coverage of Assembly elections 2022Initially, the ban was on January 15 which was then extended by a week till January 22. The ban was imposed on January 8 when the Election Commission announced the election schedule for these five states following which the model code of conduct came into effect. The case trajectory of the five states and the vaccination coverage are key factors in allowing relaxations.As far as vaccination is concerned, Uttar Pradesh which currently has 98,238 active Covid cases has inoculated 96% of its population with the first dose in the 18 plus category. Uttarakhand has vaccinated 99% of its population with the first dose and 84% with the second dose. Goa has vaccinated 98% of its population above 18 years of age with a second dose of the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ban-on-roadshows-rallies-in-5-poll-bound-states-to-continue-till-jan-31-ec-101642855965410.html

The victims have been identified as Mamun Ali, 11, Ashik Sheikh, 14 and Jewel Sheikh, 12. The injured were rushed to the Murshidabad Medical College and Hospital. Doctors said that Mamum could be referred to a hospital in Kolkata as his condition was critical. Villagers said that the three boys were playing cricket in a field. One of them had hit the cricket ball which landed in an adjacent farmland full of sunflower plants. All three went to look for the ball and found a ball-like object lying in the farm. When they picked it up assuming it to be a ball and threw it, the explosion took place. The three sustained splinter injuries. Asif’s father Mirjuwan Mondal said, “My son was playing in the field with some other boys. I rushed to the field after getting the sound of the explosion. I have no idea who left the bomb in the field.” Elections to at least seven civic bodies in Murshidabad, including Berhampur municipal body are pending and are likely to be held in February. Locals said that goons backed by political parties may be hoarding crude bombs ahead of the polls.

22-01-2022||India||Juhi Chawla didn't pay ₹20 lakh cost for 5G case yet, plea filed||The Delhi State Legal Services Authority has moved the Delhi high court seeking the payment of ₹2o lakh which was imposed on actor Juhi Chawla and others in connection to their petition on the rollout of the 5G technology. The case has been listed for February 3, reports said. The lawyer who appeared for Juhi Chawla said he was not served with the petition copy and that the actor has recently moved a division bench of the high court regarding the case. A division bench will hear the case on January 25.On June 4, 2021, Justice JR Midha dismissed Juhi Chawla's civil suit against the roll-out o the 5G technology in India and imposed a cost of ₹20 lakh on plaintiffs. It appears the suit was for publicity, the court had noted last year.The actor has recently challenged the verdict and appealed that the single bench order dismissing the suit is bad in law as a suit can only be dismissed once it has been allowed to be registered as a suit by the Court.The actor also said the single bench said that her plea was only to gain publicity just because she had circulated the video-conferencing link of the High Court on her social media accounts which had resulted in the repeated disruption of the Court proceedings held on June 4, 2021.The plea against 5G in India was moved in May last year and the Bollywood actor was one of the petitioners. Court proceedings were held virtually at that time because of the second wave of the covid pandemic. Juhi Chawla joined the court proceeding through video conferencing and as she had shared the video link on her social media accounts, the hearing faced disruptions.Following the dismissal of the plea, Juhi Chawla had released a video saying she is not against 5G technology. The petition was only to seek the government's clarification on 5G that the technology is safe, the actor said at that time.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/juhi-chawla-didn-t-pay-rs-20-lakh-cost-for-5g-case-yet-plea-filed-101642851137823.html

22-01-2022||India||Most policies being implemented by environment ministry driven by TSR Subramaniam report||The Supreme Court on Friday issued a notice on a plea seeking the creation of an Indian Environment Service on the lines of the Indian Forest Service. The plea seeks effective implementation of the 2014 TSR Subramaniam committee report. Several new policies being introduced by the Union environment ministry recently are based on recommendations of the Committee report including accelerating the time to grant environmental clearances; creating a single-window environment, forest and coastal regulation clearance system and drafting an umbrella environment management law that will subsume the air, water and environment protection acts. Environmental and legal experts have criticised many of these policies but the goal according to the Committee is to balance development and environmental needs. An explainer:What is the TSR Subramaniam report?In 2014, the Centre constituted a high-level committee headed by former cabinet secretary, TSR Subramaniam, to review the processes, laws and Acts of the Environment ministry. Following submission of the TSR Subramaniam committee report in November 2014, then environment minister, Prakash Javadekar, said it was an historic achievement that would “balance developmental commitments and environment protection.”How is an Indian Environment Service going to contribute?According to the report, the public sector, including the Central and State governments, and various other quasi-official bodies, such as corporations, municipal boards, enforcement agencies, as well as the industrial sectors will require reliable expertise of a high order in the management of environmental issues in recent times.“Current approval systems and monitoring mechanisms function in a quasi-amateurish manner, leading to sub-optimal management of environmental issues,” the report said, proposing that a new Indian Environment Service be created. To recruit staff in the service, an expert committee may examine the entry qualifications and other details, preferably for recruitment through open competition in consultation with the MoEFCC, the department of personnel and training and UPSC.What did the committee recommend?The committee said environmental and forest governance in the country needs to be re-aligned through a series of structural and process-oriented changes. It called for new forestation policy to attract investment in growing trees on private land; defining ‘forest’ to remove any ambiguity; the net present value of forests which is paid by project proponents in lieu of forest diversion be increased; creating inviolate or no-go areas in forests; single-window clearance system for projects requiring environmental clearance; proposed setting up of full time expert body National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA) at the Centre, and State Environmental Management Authority (SEMA) for project clearance; introduced a new concept of ‘utmost good faith’ to be brought in through a new legislation, to ensure that the applicant of environmental clearance is responsible legally for his statements; a new model ‘umbrella’ law that will subsume Air Act, the Water Act and the EP Act; creation of a new All India Service – Indian Environment Service among several other recommendations.What do environmental experts have to say about these recommendations?Most experts are extremely critical of the recent changes in policy being made following the recommendations. “The creation of dedicated environmental services or creating new legal frameworks like those suggested in the TSR report, may not be able to offer any solution to deeper problems surrounding environmental decision making. The legal standards to protect environment are being routinely lowered down and institutions are being required to focus on granting approvals rather than taking proactive measures to protect the environment. In an environment when committees like the TSR report recommended minimising environmental scrutiny by relying on utmost good faith, there is little new regulators or dedicated government departments can do. The protection of the environment can only be emboldened through clear intent and only by mainstreaming and upstreaming it into economic planning,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at Centre for Policy Research.“The timelines for granting environmental clearances is stipulated in the Environment Impact Assessment notification of 2006. We are only trying to meet those timelines and bring efficiency to all systems. I haven’t heard of any Indian Environment Service being created but it’s a very big ministry with different departments. These decisions will be taken at the government level,” said a senior environment ministry official.Is the environment ministry implementing TSR Subramaniam committee recommendations?The environment ministry has started implementing most of the TSR Subramaniam committee recommendations. For example, the ministry in March last year commissioned a private law firm to draft a new environmental management act which will act as an umbrella law covering Air, Water and Environmental Acts. In October, the ministry released a consultation paper on amending the Forest Conservation Act 1980 to bring significant changes to forest governance in India including facilitating private plantations for harvesting and exploration or extraction of oil and natural gas deep beneath forest land by drilling holes from outside the forest areas; the ministry in line with the Committee’s recommendations, is in the process of implementing a single window clearance process for all clearances pertaining to forest, environment, wildlife and coastal regulation zone. The average time to grant environmental clearances in all sectors has reduced significantly from over 150 days in 2019 to less than 90 days in 2021, the ministry had said in December. The ministry also plans to rank states on the speed with which they accord environmental clearances (EC) to development projects. The criteria for the ranking was detailed in an office memorandum sent by the ministry to all states on January 17 where they said they will do a star rating for states based on efficiency and timeliness in grant of EC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/most-policies-being-implemented-by-environment-ministry-driven-by-tsr-subramaniam-report-101642848222504.html
22-01-2022||India||CESL floats ₹5,500 crore tender for 5.5k electric buses||New Delhi: The state-run Convergence Energy Services Ltd (CESL) on Thursday launched a ₹5,500 crore tender to procure 5,580 electric buses. A PSU under the ministry of power, CESL has floated the single tender for 5,450 single-decker and 130 double-decker e-buses.The tender floated was the outcome of the “Grand Challenge” plan for e-buses which was initiated in June last year by the ministry of power and NITI Aayog. It was ideated after several state governments floated tenders with unstructured standards for e-buses and failed to get bidders. Gauging the lack of uniformity in the technical and financial specifications, the Centre decided to aggregate the demand of a few big cities as an experiment, which was then termed as the grand challenge. The grand challenge was open for nine cities with a population of more than 4 million, but ultimately five were able to meet the set requirements in terms of finances and paperwork.Now under the programme, Kolkata will get 2,000 pure electric buses, Delhi and Bengaluru will have 1,500 e-buses each, while Hyderabad will get 300 and Surat 150 such zero emission buses. The first set of buses will start coming from July this year and the buses will go to cities as per the depot infrastructure readied by them. All the buses will have to be deployed maximum by March 2024, a senior CESL official said on condition of anonymity. Documents seen by HT showed that out of the five cities, Delhi currently is in the most advanced stage of upgrading all its depots with electric charging infrastructure for the buses.“The real meaning of aggregation across cities under an OPEX model is actually homogenisation. This Grand Challenge Tender is the biggest ever scheme in the world – and is based on an innovative, asset-light model that make it possible for STUs to deploy affordably and at scale. The Grand Challenge will certainly encourage the faster transition to green mobility across the country while creating a synergy between private operators and state governments,” said Mahua Acharya, MD and CEO, CESL. This is significant because most buses used for public transport in all these cities run on diesel, with Delhi being the only exception where all buses are CNG propelled. Diesel run buses are heavily polluting. Acharya said this is one important step in the series of initiatives to fulfil the commitments made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for making India a net zero nation by 2050 and getting closer to achieving energy independence by 2047. The benefits of participating in the Grand Challenge include lower prices realised due to aggregated demand, high quality benchmarked technology, access to FAME-II incentives, access to state incentives, air quality improvement, and access to domestic and international sources of finances. “The subsidy amount is actually for 3,472 buses, but we got oversubscribed in the grand challenge. After discussions, the concerned state governments agreed that they would pay the balance amount for the remaining buses at the price discovered during the tender process without the subsidy,” said the official. Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog said, “Standardising tendering conditions in diverse cities is a big step towards the transformation of public transport in India. Participation in the Grand Challenge is a commendable effort from STUs, who I am sure will stand to gain from economies of scale through the aggregation of demand by CESL.”Kailash Gahlot, Delhi’s transport minister said, “Delhi has requested 1500 buses under the Grand Challenge. The national capital stands ready to offer state subsidies where they are required. We are aggressively pursuing electric mobility – and I commend CESL for its efforts to standardize the terms and conditions for how this is delivered.”

The residents said the fire probably began inside the wire duct that runs between the ground and the top floor of the 20-storey building. They also added that while the fire was confined between the 19th and 20th floor only, the entire building got engulfed in smoke and visibility became difficult for them. “I opened the door at 7 am to collect the milk that was delivered by the milkman. I saw the entire corridor of my floor filled with thick smoke that was coming out from the wire duct. We understood there must have been a fire outbreak, we woke up the remaining members and rushed out of the building,” said Nanda Chavan, a resident of the fourth floor. Chavan’s sister, Shubhangi Salkhar along with her husband Dilip and ten-year-old son, Dhaval is admitted at the Bhatia hospital at present. Chavan said that her sister and her family reside in the 13th floor of the building. “After we came down, I started to look for my sister and her family members but couldn’t find them. After half-an-hour, we saw fire brigade personnel bringing them down,” she said. Kamlakar Dalvi (64), a member of the managing committee of the building who stays on the fourth floor said that the fire broke out around 7 am in the morning and during this time most of the residents were fast asleep. “The morning water comes between 7-8 am regularly and I was going to check the water valve when I saw smoke and heard screams from our neighbours as well. We alerted the remaining flats on our floor and managed to get out of the building, the fire brigade arrived around 7:30 am and started the rescue operation. As most of the members were sleeping, rescue operation became haphazard as many of us had to go door to door and alert the people,” said Dalvi. A resident requesting anonymity said that the building was built in 2013 and between 2013-2016 there was an ongoing court case between the builder and some tenants that used to live on the plot earlier. The building is a redevelopment project and the plot on which it is built used to be a slum area once, where Dalvi used to live earlier. After the fire broke out, the residents took refuge inside the banquet hall of Matru Mandir society which is just adjacent to the Kamala building. Nearly 200 residents are staying inside the banquet hall at present and member of the Matru Mandir society have arranged basic civic amenities and food for the victims. Also, many residents shifted to their neighbours’ and relatives’ places that were nearby. “There were fire extinguishers in the building but most of the residents didn’t know how to operate it so we had to rush out. Also, the fire safety alarm wasn’t working and we couldn’t hear any warming bell,” said Dalvi. Another resident, Vijay Aperaj (61) said that after the fire broke out, inside the building it became dark as the electricity got cut off. “All the electrical appliances stopped working and we opened the doors to check. We saw smoke coming out of the ducts and also felt a burning smell. We rushed out from the building immediately with all our family members and the interiors became suffocating as well,” said Aperaj. There are two refuge floors inside the building, each on the eighth and the fourteenth floor. However, Dalvi said that the residents preferred to go downstairs instead of going to the refuge floor. There are 135 flats in the building and in each floor, there are eight flats. Four of which are 315 square feet and two flats of 225 and 250 square feet each. Considering there were eight flats in each floor, the entire building was quite cramped up and there was not much space between the flats. The building is located in a lane adjacent to the Tardeo Road. The fire fighting vehicles were parked at the entry point of the lane from where the pipelines were pulled inside and evacuation operation was carried out. A senior fire brigade official, present at the spot said that even though the exact cause of fire is yet to be ascertained, the preliminary findings suggest that there could be a short-circuit inside the wire duct of the building. “The fire system was defunct and two flats have been severely damaged and there have been some serious loss of properties as well. The fire system in the building was defunct. Had it been working then the proportion of loss occurred could have been lesser,” the official said. Meanwhile, the Gamdevi police has registered an accidental death report (ADR) in connection with the incident. We have registered an accidental death report (ADR) in the matter, as six people have died and several others have been injured. We will write to all concerned departments like fire-brigade and BEST (Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport) and depending on their reports decide further course of action,” said senior police inspector, Rampyare Rajbhar of Gamdevi Police station. “We are presently recording statements of the victims and eyewitnesses and also doing spot panchnama,” said the police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-rushed-out-corridors-were-filled-with-smoke-residents-of-tardeo-building-101642847682542.html

22-01-2022||India||Monserrate ‘best represents aspirations of people’: Goa BJP||PANAJI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has justified the party’s decision to give the Panaji ticket in the upcoming Goa assembly polls to Atanasio “Babush” Monserrate while ignoring former chief minister Manohar Parrikar’s son Utpal Parrikar, saying they chose the former as the party believes in fielding a candidate “who can best represent the aspirations of the people.” “He (Monserrate) has been actively engaged in social service for the people of the constituency for the past many years,” said the party in a notice issued by its general secretary in a local daily as is now mandatory as per directions of the Supreme Court. “He was found to have a good understanding of the ground situation and shared a good rapport with the voters here,” the notice said. Curiously, the party has claimed that Babush Monserrate is a “senior politician who has represented the constituency multiple times before” when in truth Monserrate’s current term as the legislator representing Panaji is his first as a representative of the state capital though he was selected from Taleigao and Santa Cruz constituencies before during his previous three terms as a legislator. The party for the other candidates said: “There was no other person who could represent the voices of the people of the area and thus the present candidate was chosen”. Interestingly, this sentence was missing in the column for Monserrate. On Friday, Parrikar’s son announced he was resigning from the BJP and will be contesting as an independent. “The candidate given by the party.... I feel even embarrassed to talk about him. In Panaji, where the party has grown over 30 years, to give a ticket to someone with such a rap sheet, who joined two years ago, I had no choice. I have to go to the people,” Utpal told a news conference where he announced his candidature. Manohar Parrikar represented the Panaji constituency since 1994 and until his death in 2019 barring a brief two-year period when he was union defence minister and a Rajya Sabha MP from Lucknow. Monserrate is facing charges under sections 376 (rape), 342 (wrongful confinement), 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) as well as section 4 (penetrative sexual assault of a minor) of the POCSO Act in one case. He is also facing charges under sections 143,147, 148, 149, 153, 323, 324, 325, 333, 427, 435, etc (sections related to armed rioting) for leading a mob that violently attacked the Panaji Police station in 2008 and a third case under 326, 354, 504, 506, 509 (assaulting a woman), as he has declared. The BJP has a total of seven candidates who have cases against them. Besides Monserrate, his wife Jennifer Monserrate, who is the BJP’s candidate from Taleigao constituency, too has criminal cases registered against her relating to assault on police station. Others with criminal cases include Rohan Khaunte, Govind Gaude, Krishna Salkar, Mauvin Godinho and Chandrakant Kavlekar. Besides Salkar, who is a new entrant into the BJP, Khaunte, Gaude, Godinho and Kavlekar have all been ministers for varying periods during the last five years of the BJP government. Godinho and Kavlekar are facing charges of corruption that were filed during the tenure of the BJP-run governments when the duo were members of the Congress party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monserrate-best-represents-aspirations-of-people-goa-bjp-101642842402298.html

22-01-2022||India||Direct, emotional connect between administration, public needed: PM to DMs||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday lauded ‘aspirational districts’ for removing the barriers in taking the country forward. Interacting with district magistrates from across the country on the implementation of key government schemes, PM Modi said that the teamwork of the Centre, states and local administration is yielding good results in aspirational districts."When the aspirations of others become our own aspirations, when fulfilling the dreams of others becomes a measure of our success, then that path of duty creates history. Today, we see this history being created in the aspirational districts of the country," the prime minister said.He called for a direct and emotional connect between the administration and the public to ensure 'top to bottom' as well as 'bottom to top' governance flow.“Convergence is a major reason for the success that the country is getting in aspirational districts. All resources are the same, government machinery is the same, officers are the same but the result is different,” PM Modi noted.Highlighting the importance of district administrations in good governance, the prime minister said it helps the government to implement the schemes in a better way. He suggested the officials chalk out detailed guidelines for field visits and inspections. He also called on the civil servants to work for the country with the same enthusiasm they had on the first day in the service.“I would like to remind one more thing to the colleagues from civil services who have joined in. You must remember the day when you had your first day in this service. How much you wanted to do for the country, how full of enthusiasm, how full of service you were. Today you have to move forward with the same spirit,” he said.PM Modi further stated that the ‘Jan Dhan’ accounts have increased by four to five times in almost every aspirations district in the last four years.“Almost every family has got a toilet, every village has been electrified. And electricity has not only reached the homes of the poor but has infused energy into the lives of the people,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/direct-emotional-connect-between-administration-public-needed-pm-modi-to-dms-101642836398878.html

The political drama began when the photos and videos of a meeting of Chouhan with MP Congress Committee president Kamal Nath at the state hangar in Bhopal went viral on social media. After meeting with the CM, Kamal Nath joined the protest with Digvijaya Singh. Nath also got angry on media persons for asking questions on the purpose of his meeting with the CM. Digvijaya Singh said he sought a time to meet the chief minister to discuss the matter of compensation against the displacement of villagers after five thousand hectares of land submerged due to the Tame irrigation project of Suthalia of Rajgarh, Bhopal and Vidisha districts. “More than 1500 families will be displaced but they are not getting enough compensation,” said Singh. Singh said the CM’s office gave him time at 11 .15 am on Friday for meeting but he was informed on Thursday that the meeting was cancelled. Singh said he will reach on time and will stage a protest because the CM has no time to listen to the issues of common people. However, the meeting was cancelled as the CM went to attend a function in Dewas. After the video of their meeting went viral on social media, Nath said, “We met accidentally as I was returning from the Chhindwara and the CM was leaving for Dewas. It was a courtesy meeting.” He further said, “After I came to join Dharna, Digvijaya Singh informed me that he was seeking time for the past one-and-a-half months but the CM has no time to listen to him. We will stage protest with villagers who are being displaced without proper compensation.” Later, the CM also said that we were crossing each other at state hangar and it was just a cordial meeting. “I told Digvijaya Singh to come and meet on January 23 but he is more interested in politicising the matter,” Chouhan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/political-drama-over-meeting-of-cm-and-former-cms-in-madhya-pradesh-101642836041721.html

22-01-2022||India||Orissa high court asks for status report on violence in Dhinkia steel plant site||BHUBANESWAR: The Orissa high court on Thursday asked the state’s home department to submit a status report on the ground situation in Dhinkia village, the proposed site of a 13.2 million tonne per annum integrated steel plant by Jindal Steel Works (JSW) in Jagatsinghpur district, where a face-off between villagers and police left more than two dozen persons injured six days ago. Justice RK Patnaik sought the home department’s status report on the issue while hearing a PIL filed by Kuni Mallick and four others seeking a probe by a committee comprising a retired Judge of the high court, social activists and members of the civil society into the “police atrocities” committed on the residents of Dhinkia. On Friday, police and villagers clashed at Dhinkia village when the former were marching to demolish the betel vines within the project area of the steel plant. Of the 2950 acres of land required for the project, 45.56 acres of forestland is in Dhinkia, where people are adamant not to allow the project to happen arguing that their livelihood depends on the betel vines. After the clash, which also left some policemen injured, six persons including former member of panchayat samiti Debendra Swain, who has been campaigning against the proposed plant, were arrested. Meanwhile, a delegation of over a dozen political parties submitted a memorandum to Odisha governor Ganeshi Lal, seeking his intervention to stop what they called “police atrocities” in Dhinkia. The parties alleged that the Odisha government was using police force to evict villagers and they have left the village out of fear. They demanded that the police should be withdrawn from Dhinkia and demolition of betel vines be stopped forthwith. In 2017, JSW Utkal Steel Limited, led by industrialist Sajjan Jindal, proposed to set up a 13.2 million tonnes per annum integrated steel plant at the same site that was initially allocated to Korean steel major Posco more than a decade ago. The Korean company, which signed a pact with the Odisha government, had to withdraw from it after protests by the people of Dhinkia. The new steel plant by JSW in Jagatsighpur will connect with the company’s proposed 30 MTPA iron-ore grinding plant in Keonjhar district via a 312 km-long slurry pipeline. A 52 MTPA captive jetty located near the Jatadhar river mouth will also cater to the import and export requirements of the company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/orissa-high-court-asks-for-status-report-on-violence-in-dhinkia-steel-plant-site-101642833881684.html

22-01-2022||India||Quad summit announced, to be held after Australian elections in May||With US President Joe Biden accepting Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio’s invitation to visit Tokyo in the first half of 2022 on Friday, the Quad summit is expected to take place in May with free and open Indo-Pacific, Covid-19 response, climate, clean energy, and infrastructure on the agenda. The last Quad summit was held on September 24, 2021, in Washington.According to officials in knowledge of the matter, the Quad summit has been announced but will take place only after the Australian general elections in May. Formal invites will be sent by Japan only after the dates convenient to all are finalised. A meeting of Quad foreign ministers and sherpas is also likely to set up the agenda for the summit.The meeting of Quad security grouping comes at a time when erstwhile Cold War powers US and Russia are locked on Ukraine, Shia Houthis in Yemen have targeted Sunni UAE with armed drones and China is eyeing Taiwan while building fortress Tibet and Sinkiang through massive Sinicization campaign.While US President Biden accepted Kishida’s invitation for attending the Quad summit, the big takeaways from the virtual summit was that Washington encouraged increase in Japanese defence spending, vowed to protect Senkaku Islands from Chinese aggression and agreed to work with other pacific partners like Australia, France and New Zealand for humanitarian disaster relief work.Both US and Japan have agreed on a economic dialogue in two plus two format with focus on building global supply chains not dependent on China. This decision to intensify economic cooperation in the Indo-Pacific also dovetails into the Quad's vision for alternate supply chains with both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison facing adverse trade relations with China on account of mounting trade deficit and high tariff sanctions respectively.While there will be no further admission into Quad grouping, all the participating countries recognise the centrality of ASEAN countries in tackling Indo-Pacific and intensification of engagement with Indonesia has already begun in a bid for an open Indo-Pacific. This is because all the ingress routes to South China Sea are under Indonesian jurisdiction - from Malacca Strait to Ombai-Wetar strait near Timor in far Pacific.The Modi government is already engaging Indonesia as it is in proximity to Andamans and Nicobar Islands and there is discussion on New Delhi supplying Jakarta with BrahMos supersonic land attack missiles after Manila.

This would be a symbol of India’s indebtedness to him,” PM Modi tweeted.He further said, “Till the grand statue of Netaji Bose is completed, a hologram statue of his would be present at the same place. I will unveil the hologram statue on 23rd January, Netaji’s birth anniversary.”The statue will be placed in the canopy and will replace the Amar Jawan Jyoti, which will be merged with the eternal flame of the National War Memorial Torch on Friday. The dimensions of the upcoming statue will be 28 feet*6 feet, people aware of the development said.Home Minister Amit Shah tweeted that the statue is a befitting tribute to Subhas Chandra Bose. “ Netaji is an epitome of India’s true strength and resolve. Congress has left no stone unturned to forget the immortal contributions of India’s brave son,” he tweeted.Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said that nothing that the Prime Minister does will undo the historical betrayal of Netaji by Hindu Mahasabha under Sawarkar.“When Netaji was organising the INA to liberate the North East from the British rule, Sawarkar exhorted recruitment of Hindu Mahasabha in the British army. That same army then indulged into large-scale killing of INA soldiers. If the PM were to read the shameful history of his ideological forefathers, he would first apologise to the nation.”Last week, a government official said that the Republic Day celebrations from this year will start on January 23 instead of January 24 to include the birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, in line with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi government’s “focus to commemorate important aspects of our history and culture.”Last year, the central government announced that January 23 will be celebrated as Parakram Diwas or day of valour.Ahead of Netaji’s 125th birth anniversary this year, Chandra Bose, who is a member of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking him to have the freedom fighter’s image on currency notes. He also suggested declaring January 23 a national holiday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-unveil-netaji-statue-at-india-gate-on-sunday-101642824761127.html

22-01-2022||India||Chirag's party writes to Bihar governor for president's rule to prevent hooch tragedy||Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) chief Chirag Paswan on Friday said the party has written to Bihar governor Phagu Chauhan to recommend the president’s rule in the state to prevent deaths due to consumption of spurious liquor. Bihar, a state with stringent prohibition law against the sale and consumption of alcohol, frequently witnesses deaths resulting from the consumption of illicit liquor. Bihar’s Saran district reported 15 deaths this week in alleged hooch tragedies.“We have written to the governor to recommend the president's rule in Bihar in order to stop more deaths due to consumption of spurious liquor,” news agency ANI quoted Chirag Paswan as saying.Pawar, a bitter critic of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, however, recently supported the prohibition drive even as some partners of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) demanded a review of the liquor ban. Former Bihar chief minister and HAM-S president Jitan Ram Manjhi questioned the alcohol ban in Bihar, requesting the chief minister to rethink the implementation of the prohibition laws."The chief minister should rethink the implementation of prohibition. Only poor people are being caught and harassed. Those who are involved in the illegal liquor trade racket are not being arrested. I have a difference of opinion with Nitish ji on this issue. 70 % of the people who are being caught are poor,” Manjhi had said.Saran hooch tragedy: Toll climbs to 15, SHO suspendedNitish Kumar banned the sale of liquor in the state and criminalised its consumption in 2016. The government has been facing criticism over the frequent hooch tragedies and mounting legal cases and huge pendency. HT reported that the government is now considering relaxing some of the stringent provisions to provide relief for first-time offenders.The excise and prohibition department has also initiated an exercise to conduct a social audit of the impact of the liquor ban on the lives of women and people in general. The survey will be undertaken by the panchayati raj chair at Chanakya Law University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chirags-party-writes-to-bihar-governor-for-president-s-rule-to-prevent-hooch-tragedy-101642812690161.html

The police, however, maintained that they haven’t reached any conclusion and were still carrying out an investigation.The 17-year-old died on Wednesday after hospitalisation.  According to the FIR, the warden allegedly forced the student to clean the hostel rooms. A purported video of the girl has gone viral in which she indicated that she might have been harassed by the hostel staff because her parents refused to convert her. HT could not independently verify the authenticity of the video.“As of now, we cannot consider that video as a dying declaration,” Thanjavur’s superintendent of police, Ravali Priya Gandhpueni, said, adding that the “the initial statement of the girl’s parents did not have any angle of conversion.”TN’s BJP chief K Annamalai, however, said the police are trying  to change the narrative. “There is a videographed confession statement of the girl.

22-01-2022||India||SC tells Supertech to refund Emerald Court homebuyers||The Supreme Court on Friday ordered real estate firm Supertech to refund the money collected from homebuyers for its 40-storey twin towers in Noida’s Emerald Court project by February 28. The towers were declared illegal and ordered to be demolished by the Supreme Court on August 28 last year.Close to 18 homebuyers filed contempt petitions in the Supreme Court alleging inaction by the real estate developer that had to refund the payments made by buyers, along with 12% interest.Earlier this month, the court took serious exception to the delay and threatened to send its directors to jail.In its order passed on Friday, a bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and Bela M Trivedi said, “In our view, the refund due and payable arises from the judgment of this Court. At this stage when the court is exercising contempt jurisdiction, the solution has to be consistent with the tenor of judgment to enable refund with interest.”To reconcile the difference in amounts of final payment, as calculated separately by Supertech and the homebuyers, the court took the assistance of advocate Gaurav Agrawal, who assisted it as amicus curiae and worked out the sum payable to each of the contempt petitioners after deducting the amount already paid.The bench accepted the calculations made by Agrawal for 12 contempt petitioners and disposed the matter with a direction asking Supertech to refund the said amount as per the computation made by Agrawal on or before February 28.Almost 252 homebuyers were awaiting refunds after the court ordered demolition of the towers last year.The demolition process has also been finalised and this issue is being separately monitored by the top court.Advocate Abraham C Mathews who appeared for some of the homebuyers urged the court that the sums payable by Supertech were in the average range of ₹30 to ₹60 lakh.The two towers facing demolition (Apex and Ceyane) have 915 flats of which 633 were booked. Of them, only 252 flat buyers had to be paid refunds as 133 homebuyers chose to re-invest in other Supertech projects and 248 took an early refund.The court told Supertech that deadline for refunds applied equally to those homebuyers who have not filed contempt petitions.The bench said, “Homebuyers entitled to receipt of compensatory payment should not be compelled to move contempt proceedings.” However, it clarified that payments towards refund, if already paid, shall be considered while making the balance amount to homebuyers.Senior advocate S Ganesh who appeared for Supertech assured the court that necessary steps will be taken within a week to ensure the refund as directed. He said that if bank details of buyers are known, the same could be electronically transferred.Some homebuyers complained to the court that tax was being deducted at source (TDS) by Supertech before releasing the money to homebuyers. Advocate Sumit Agrawal appearing for a group of homebuyers said, “The interest on the principal amount is in the nature of compensation (not income).” Ganesh informed the court that the company cannot afford to be in default during tax assessment and any exemption in this regard must come from the court.The bench refused to pass any order saying, “It is not a live issue before us. Even the income tax department is not part of these proceedings. At best we have said it is compensatory interest.”Ganesh informed the court that in the event of demolition of the towers, the court should nudge the Noida Authority to return the ₹25 crore that the company deposited while purchasing extra FAR (the floor area ratio) for constructing the towers. “We have given an application to the Noida authority seeking a refund as there is no usage of FAR. But they are sitting on our application,” he said.The court told Supertech that such a matter cannot be raised in a contempt plea.In a lighter vein, the bench remarked, “You need not to be protected from Noida (Authority). They were with you all along.” In its judgment, the Court noted the collusion between Supertech and Noida officials which led to the construction of the two towers in violation of the National Building Code 2005, which mandates a minimum distance of 16 metres between two residential towers.The order to demolish the two Supertech towers was first issued by the Allahabad high court in 2014 on a plea filed by the Emerald Court owners’ association who said that while purchasing their flats, what was shown as green area was now sought to be converted into residential towers, amounting to breach of trust by the developer. Supertech approached the apex court challenging the high court decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-tells-supertech-to-refund-emerald-court-homebuyers-101642802078141.html
22-01-2022||India||‘You are serving her cause’: Supreme Court’s advice on plea against Kangana Ranaut||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday refused to order clubbing of all criminal cases pending against actor Kangana Ranaut over her offensive social media posts against the Sikh community.Stating that “we respect the beliefs and sensitivities of the religious community”, a bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and Bela M Trivedi said, “For every criminal wrong, there is a remedy under criminal law. We should be circumspect in jumping in under Article 32 which gives us wide powers. The wider the power is, the greater the responsibility.”The court was hearing a petition filed by Mumbai-based lawyer Sardar Charanjit Singh Chanderpal who vented his anger over the tweets by Kangana which, he said, sought to portray Sikhs as “Khalistanis” for taking part in the stir against the now-repealed farm laws.“How can a person go on and on ranting against a community. Can a person be permitted to be so reckless that she says that we should adopt Indira Gandhi (former Prime Minister) as our guru as she crushed us like mosquitoes,” Charanjit said.The bench said, “The more you publicize, the more you cause damage to yourself. You are serving her cause by publicizing her statements….One way to deal with it is to ignore, that we are not advising you. You have a remedy under law.”The petitioner, who appeared in person, told the court that he has already instituted a complaint against the actor in a lower court and filed an application to oppose her petition in the Bombay high court for quashing one of the cases lodged against her. He informed the court that other cases have also been lodged against Kangana Ranaut in other states which he was seeking to transfer to Khar police station in Mumbai.The bench refrained from expressing any opinion on clubbing of FIRs as the petitioner chose to withdraw this prayer. However, the court observed, “Rest assured, we do not subscribe to these statements. You can withdraw this petition with permission to pursue your legal remedies…We have tread with great caution on the tweets (by Ranaut) as that is still a matter of investigation.”There is a case registered against Kangana Ranaut in Mumbai’s Khar police station accusing her of outraging religious feeling feelings of Sikhs punishable under section 295A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Separate FIRs have also been registered by Maninder Singh Sirsa, the president of Delhi Gurdwara Management Committee (DGMC), Amarjeet Singh Sandhu of Dadar’s Shri Guru Singh Sabha Gurudwara, and Jaspal Singh Siddhu, the president of the Supreme Council Navi Mumbai Gurudwara.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/you-are-serving-her-cause-supreme-court-s-advice-on-plea-against-kangana-ranaut-101642798419495.html
22-01-2022||India||9 Silger protesters on way to Raipur placed in isolation after 4 test +ve: Cops||RAIPUR: Nine tribals, part of a continuing protest in Silger village over an alleged fake encounter last year, were ‘detained’ in Chhattisgarh’s Kondagaon district on Thursday when they were on their way to Raipur to detail their grievances to the governor, rights activists said. The allegation has been rebutted by the police which insists they were only questioned for violating Covid-19 protocol and placed under isolation after four of them tested positive for Covid-19 infection.Police said that the nine were neither detained nor arrested.The Silger protest started around eight months back, on May 12, after the establishment of a camp in Mokur which comes under Silger village Panchayat (Sukma district), on May 10. Later, on May 17, security forces allegedly opened fire on protestors in which three protestors were killed. Later, one more protestor succumbed to injuries in the firing. “At few places in Bastar range for the last few months, protests and demonstrations are being conducted under various banners. Considering the spike in Covid-19 cases since the first week of January 2022, all these leaders and convenors of the protests have been asked to disperse as section 144 CrPC has been invoked. But they were ignoring all the safety protocols and going ahead with their activities which are highly detrimental to public health and lives of thousands of innocent villagers,” said Inspector General of Police, Bastar range, Sunderaj P. Police said that nine Silger protestors were brought to record their statements when four of them were found to be Covid-19 positive. “Based on the ground reports, notices were issued to the organisers of such rallies and protests to give an explanation in this regard. While nine people belonging to one such group were brought for recording their statement, four tested Covid positive. All those four Covid positive persons along with five other associates, who were in primary contacts, have been kept in an isolation centre as per the prescribed protocol,” Sunderaj said adding that they haven’t been arrested nor kept in detention.Their family members are being informed about the situation. Once they are out of the isolation period, their statements will be recorded with regard to violation of section 144 CrPC, he added.Rights activists raised questions over the police action against the tribals.“Why was the team of activists taken out of the bus at Kondagaon while all the other passengers in that bus, as well as other buses, were allowed to proceed to Raipur? Why was information about them not shared with others who were asking about their welfare on Thursday? All of us were frantically trying to find out how they were, who had stopped them and why but the district police chief and additional superintendent of police (ASP) Kondagaon were not receiving calls or replying to written queries over WhatsApp. Late at night on January 20, the Kondagaon collector too said he had no knowledge about the incident even though it was nearly 24 hours since they were picked up. If there was no malafide, why the secrecy?,” said Bela Bhatia, a human rights activist working in Bastar. “Such a paternalistic attitude is offensive and irresponsible. Does the state really think that it can stop citizens from exercising their democratic right to dissent in this manner? Covid is being used as a weapon even in the third wave in Bastar,” she added.
22-01-2022||India||‘One Modi cannot change a country, need more icons like him’: Himanta Biswa Sarma||SILCHAR: “Prime Minister Narendra Modi is trying to uplift our nation but he is an individual at the end of the day. One Modi cannot change the entire nation and we need to look for more icons like him to become the world’s best country,” said Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma in his address to students of Assam University in Silchar on Friday.Addressing the students at an event to mark the 29th foundation day of Assam University, Silchar, Himanta Biswa Sarma was sharply critical of India’s education policy in the decades after Independence, saying it was too influenced by Western culture and made students selfish.“We are the oldest living civilisation… But post-Independence, our country adopted policies influenced by western culture. Like the west, our society lost its soul and selfless children became selfish individuals after completing education.”Sarma continued. “India’s old Gurukul education system used to emphasise character-building of students and the children used to become better individuals after finishing education. We need that kind of education system and the present central government is making new education policy based on this idea,” he said.Himanta Biswa Sarma also appealed to students to become entrepreneurs and explore new ideas to increase the overall productiveness of Assam. “Assam is dependent on other states for basic requirements. Unless we export more than what we consume, Assam cannot become a powerful state such as Gujarat and Rajasthan. Students should adopt a mindset to become an employer rather than looking for job after finishing studies,” he said.Sarma announced a grant of ₹25 crore for the university and asked the institute to prepare a list of requirements and send it to him soon. Assam University vice-chancellor Professor Dilip Chandra Nath and MP Rajdeep Roy also said that the country’s new education policy will be influenced by India’s old Gurukul education system.Rajdeep Roy said, “Galileo was criticised when he claimed that earth revolves around the sun. But saints in India worshipped Nava Graha (nine planets) and the sun many thousands of years back. This shows how advanced they were. Our education system should carry the legacy of our glorious civilisation.”Himanta Biswa Sarma, accompanied by Silchar MP and other ministers, visited Silchar Medical College and Hospitals (SMCH) before going to Assam University. Sarma inaugurated a Cathlab in the cardiology department of the hospital, a first in Barak Valley part of Assam.A hostel for residential doctors was also inaugurated at the premises of SMCH where Himanta Biswa Sarma interacted with the media. On a question about BJP’s preparations for Manipur assembly elections, Sarma said that he is now chief minister of Assam and it won’t be easy for him to go there frequently.“It was different in past because I was more independent. Now I am the chief minister of Assam and I have to follow some protocol. Northeast Democratic Alliance (NEDA) is active and we have selected Assam minister Ashok Singhal to look after Manipur election on behalf of NEDA,” he said.Sarma also announced a greenfield airport in the Cachar district. It’ll be made at Dalu tea garden under Udharbond assembly constituency in Cachar. He also expressed concern about repeated firing incidents along the Assam-Manipur border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-modi-cannot-change-a-country-need-more-icons-like-him-himanta-biswa-sarma-101642796319014.html
22-01-2022||India||Farmland in Odisha’s Sambalpur contaminated by breach in slurry pond||Bhubaneswar: Several acres of farmland near an integrated steel plant in the western Odisha district of Sambalpur were submerged in iron ore slurry after the tailing pond wall was breached on Thursday evening, locals said.No loss of life has been reported so far but a security guard is missing. Officials said farmland at Banjhiberana village next to the 2.5 MTPA steel plant of JSW Bhushan Power and Steel Limited at Thelkoloi area of Sambalpur district came under several inches of sludge containing iron ore slurry due to the breach.Rengali tehsildar Damayanti Sahoo who visited the spot said she could see at least 20-30 acres of farmland submerged under the iron ore slurry while two ponds were contaminated.“In one of the ponds, I could see dead fishes floating. Tomorrow, we will do a thorough survey of the damage,” said Sahoo.A company official said the iron slurry generated from beneficiation plant is pumped to the pond from where further disposal and waste recovery is carried out.“But due to breach of the wall of the pond, thick low-grade Iron ore slurry spread into the compound of tailing pond and further to some adjacent land. As of now, the slurry discharged from the pond is under control and no more discharge of slurry is taking place. For better handling of slurry, a project is being carried out to install a paste thickener to reduce the volume of slurry,” the official said.Soon after the mishap, heavy machinery was pressed into service to remove the collapsed boundary wall of the company. Workers were trying to stop the flow of water and repair the wall.A resident of Banjhiberena village said the crop in his field was completely damaged. “The farmland has been totally contaminated. I don’t know how I can grow another crop,” the villager said.A JSW official who inspected the site said the company will hold discussions with villagers and compensate those who suffer losses.Officials at the regional office of the state pollution control board have not commented on the slurry pond breach.The breach in the slurry pond comes in the wake of a similar breach in the fly ash dyke of Reliance’s Sasan Ultra Mega Power Project in Singrauli, Madhya Pradesh in April 2020 that left two people dead.The Sambalpur-based steel plant, initially promoted by Sanjay Singal, was acquired by Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Steel Ltd in March last year after its principal lender, State Bank of India, filed a case of insolvency before National Company Law Tribunal. JSW, which paid Rs19,350 crore to BPSL’s lenders, has renamed the company JSW Bhushan Power and Steel Limited.In October last year, residents of Thelkoloi village staged a demonstration protesting the alleged dumping of fly ash in open areas by the company. The villagers complained that the ash was causing respiratory problems and irritation in the eye, forcing the villagers to stay indoors. Besides, drinking water sources are also getting contaminated due to fly ash.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmland-in-odisha-s-sambalpur-contaminated-by-breach-in-slurry-pond-101642794038816.html
22-01-2022||India||Pregnant rape victim dies by suicide in Tamil Nadu||A 16-year-old tribal girl, who was allegedly raped by her neighbour, died by suicide after she found that she was pregnant, Tamil Nadu Police said on Friday.While the accused was arrested, the principal of the school (established under the Union ministry of tribal affairs) where the girl studied, and the hostel warden were also held for failing to report the crime, they added. Providing details, police said the girl claimed that she was repeatedly raped by her neighbour in her village in Tiruvannamalai district last year when she was at home due to the Covid-induced restrictions. “After the government lifted the restrictions, the girl returned to the residential school and on December 22, she fainted in the campus. She was taken to a nearby hospital where she and the warden were informed about her pregnancy. The warden informed the headmaster who in return summoned the child’s parents. They asked them to take her home but did not reveal her condition,” a senior police officer in Tiruvannamalai said, preferring anonymity.After her parents brought her home, the child attempted suicide on January 7. Her parents rushed her to Tiruvannamalai government hospital where doctors informed them about her pregnancy, the officer said. “She was in the hospital for more than 10 days and was unconscious most of the time,” the officer said.When she regained consciousness, she revealed that she was repeatedly raped by her neighbour and sought to end her life after she became pregnant. The girl died during treatment on January 18, the officer said.On the basis of the girl’s statement, her neigbour, the school headmaster and the warden were arrested under sections 6 (punishment for aggravated penetrative sexual assault) of the POCSO Act, 2012, section 306 (abetment to suicide) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sections under the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act 1989 on January 17, police said. The accused were produced before a court and sent to judicial custody, they added.“The accused neighbour claimed he was in a relationship with the girl. We are yet to establish if the relationship was consensual,” another investigating officer said. “The girl was almost at the end of her second trimester... She also tested positive for Covid-19 and was on ventilator support,” the officer added. Thiruvannamalai superintendent of police Allatipalli Pavan Kumar Reddy said a report was sent to the Chengalpattu district tahsildar on January 18 in this regard. It is unclear whether the Union tribal ministry has been informed about the crime. (If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.)

22-01-2022||India||Goa elections: PWD minister steps down, to contest as independent||Goa minister Deepak Prabhu Pauskar on Friday resigned from the state cabinet and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after he was dropped from the party’s list of candidates for the upcoming assembly elections. Pauskar, who defected from the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party to the BJP in 2019, announced that he will contest as an independent from Sanvordem constituency after the ruling party decided to field Ganesh Gaonkar, a former BJP MLA, from the seat.“I have resigned as an MLA and a minister and as a member of the BJP. I have decided to contest as an independent. I had enrolled more than 16,000 members for the BJP from my constituency and more than 60% of them have now resigned along with me. I will work to be re-elected as an independent,” he said. The BJP on Thursday named 34 candidates for the upcoming assembly elections but dropped one sitting lawmaker and two ministers from the list. The party also left out the son of former chief minister Manohar Parrikar, Utpal Parrikar, and nominated nine of the 15 former Congress and MGP lawmakers who have defected to the ruling party since 2017. Pauskar, a one-time MLA, was made minister of public works department in 2019 after party leader Sudin Dhavalikar was evicted from the state cabinet. He was, however, accused by his own party MLAs of large-scale corruption and favouritism in selection of candidates during recruitment for the department in December last year. While the recruitment process was halted by the state government, a three-member committee of officers was also set up to probe the allegations.Besides Pauskar, former chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar also quit the party and announced he would contest as an independent from Mandrem constituency he represented between 1999 and 2017, after the BJP fielded Dayanand Sopte, who shifted from the Congress in 2018 in the constituency. “I will give up my responsibilities and roles in the party and contest as an independent. I have a feeling that I will be the people’s candidate this time. The current candidate has been able to achieve very little and is facing anti-incumbency,” Parsekar said. “Within the next two days, I will announce my candidature,” Parsekar added.The party is also facing dissent in Canacona where deputy speaker Isidore Fernandes, who defected from the Congress along with nine other MLAs in 2019, was denied a ticket as the BJP decided to field former MLA Ramesh Tawadkar from the seat. Fernandes on Friday evening announced he would contest as an independent. Likewise, Savitri Kavlekar, wife of deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavlekar, also quit the party against its decision to deny her a ticket fromSanguem constituency. She sought to know why she was denied a ticket when the same was given to health Minister Vishwajit Rane’s wife, Divya, andPanaji MLA Atanasio ‘Babush’ Monserrate’s wife and revenue minister, Jennifer, for the polls. “It is unfortunate that some are leaving the party after being denied the tickets,” party leader Narendra Sawaikar said. Reacting to the developments, Congress leader and Panaji candidate Elvis Gomes said: “It is a symptom of how the BJP has corrupted from within and is no longer the same party that it was once. Ideologues are quitting the party due to the toxic environment. It is an internal matter for the BJP and will have no bearing on the Congress prospects.” “The BJP has chosen candidates on the basis of winnability and in the bargain, several candidates, many of whom are long time members of the party, have been left out and sidelined by the party. They are being egged on by their supporters to contest as independents much of this advice is misguided,” a former MLA, who did not wished to be named, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-elections-pwd-minister-steps-down-to-contest-as-independent-101642793080156.html
22-01-2022||India||In letter to PM Modi on IAS cadre rule change, Ashok Gehlot quotes Sardar Patel||JAIPUR: Two Congress chief ministers, Rajasthan’s Ashok Gehlot and Chhattisgarh’s Bhupesh Baghel, on Friday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to scrap the proposed change to the cadre rules for the three All India Services, arguing that the proposed amendments will hurt the spirit of cooperative federalism, create uncertainties for officials and impact their ability to discharge their duties impartially, particularly during elections.The letters by chief ministers comes a day after West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee put out her second letter to PM Narendra Modi that described a new version of the proposed amendments even “more draconian” than the Centre’s initial proposal.First, West Bengal, and now Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, have argued that the proposed amendment will ensure that the Centre can unilaterally requisition services of Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers serving in the states without the concurrence of the officer concerned or the state government.हमारे देश के संविधान निर्माताओं ने अखिल भारतीय सेवाओं की संकल्पना जन कल्याण तथा संघवाद की भावना को ध्यान में रखकर की थी। इस संशोधन से लौहपुरूष सरदार वल्लभभाई पटेल द्वारा ‘स्टील फ्रेम ऑफ इंडिया’ बताई गई सेवाएं भविष्य में कमजोर होंगी।2/2Under existing rules, officers of the three All India Service (AIS) - the IAS, Indian Police Service (IPS) and Indian Forest Service officers - are attached to a state (or a group of smaller states) as a cadre where they serve unless they opt to serve in the union government. When they do exercise this option, the state concerned has to concur to their request before they can even be considered for a posting by the Centre.In his letter to PM Modi, Ashok Gehlot said the proposed amendments will violate the constitutional boundaries prescribed for central and state governments, impact the spirit of All India Service officers posted in the state working fearlessly and faithfully, and weaken the AIS, which were described by the country’s first home minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel as the “steel frame of India’.Gehlot went to quote from Sardar Patel’s speech during the debate on the All India Services in the Constituent Assembly on October 10, 1949, to underline the importance of shielding the officers from uncertainties and pressures. “If you want an efficient All India Service, I would advise you. I request you to give an opportunity to the services to express themselves freely. If you are a premier, it will be your duty to allow your secretary, or chief secretary, or other services under you to express their opinion without fear or favour… Without it, you will not have united India. A good All India Service would be one that has the freedom to speak their mind, which has a sense of security that you can stick to your word, and where their rights and privileges are protected”.माननीय @PMOIndia को पत्र लिखकर अवगत कराया है कि छत्तीसगढ़ सरकार अखिल भारतीय सेवाओं के काडर नियमों में संशोधन का पुरजोर विरोध करती है एवं मांग रखती है कि पूर्वानुसार काडर नियमों को यथावत रखा जाए। pic.twitter.com/Psw6K7IoKeGehlot said after this amendment, the central government will be able to call officers of the All India Service on deputation to the Centre without the consent of the officer concerned or the state government.Bhupesh Baghel, the second chief minister of a Congress-ruled state, echoed the Rajasthan chief minister.“They would be in dilemma while discharging their duties and due to political interference, it will not be possible for them to work impartially, particularly at the time of elections. It may lead to a collapse of the administrative system in states and a situation of instability could be created,” Baghel added, according to news agency Press Trust of India.Apprehending the possibility of misuse of the amended rules in the near future, Baghel said, “There were many instances in the past wherein officers of the All India Services were targeted unnecessarily. There are adequate provisions in the present rules for maintaining a balance and coordination between state governments and Centre.” The Chhattisgarh government strongly opposes any amendments in the existing rules, the CM said.

In his complaint, Chadha has claimed that Jain has made intentional and deliberate imputations against him on various social media platforms, leveling false and unsubstantiated allegations of corruption and deceit against him.“In view of the submissions made on behalf of the complainant coupled with the material available on record, this court while taking cognizance of the matter deems it appropriate to list the matter for examination of complainant and witnesses. Accordingly, put up for pre-summoning evidence on April 26,” the court said in its order.The complaint, filed through advocate Prashant Manchanda, further said that Jain, a resident of Patiala, “in a premeditated manner with the malevolent schemes to execute and further his vested political designs has deliberately and intentionally made both direct as well as implied false, conceited, frivolous and baseless defamatory imputations against the complainant with a view to tarnish his reputation and impeccable goodwill as well as of other leaders of Aam Aadmi Party”.The complaint also accused Jain of trying “to derail the positive work undertaken by” Chadha and the AAP in Delhi, Punjab and other states “for subserving the interests of the public and the citizenry at large”.It further claimed that the defamatory imputations/publications unleashed by the accused “warrants to be out rightly rejected with the contempt it deserves”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-court-takes-note-of-raghav-chadha-s-defamation-complaint-against-patiala-resident-101642792058606.html
22-01-2022||India||Karnataka lifts weekend restrictions based on low hospitalisation rate||The Karnataka government on Friday decided to lift the weekend curfew put in place to combat the rising Covid-19 cases but retained other restrictions -- night curfew and 50% occupancy in commercial establishments.“The weekend curfew imposed from Friday 10 pm to Monday 5 am in the state is herewith withdrawn. However, night curfew will continue to be imposed from 10 pm to 5 am in the entire state as per the existing guidelines on all days. This measure will be further reviewed based on number of cases and hospitalisation,” said a state government order released on Friday.State revenue minister R Ashok said the decision was taken based on the low hospitalisation and economic arguments against the curbs. “Weekend curfew has been removed. But if the hospitalisation rate increases above 5%, then these restrictions are likely to return,” he said.Home minister Araga Jnanendra said the government will be forced to bring back stricter restrictions if people do not behave responsibly.The order on weekend curfew came after Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai held a meeting on Friday with experts, cabinet ministers and other senior officials to review all existing restrictions that came into effect just after Christmas last year.“It is reiterated that Pubs/clubs/restaurants/bars/hotels/eating places in hotel etc, will function with 50% of the seating capacity, strictly adhering to COVID appropriate behaviour and entry to such places will be restricted to fully vaccinated persons. Cinema malls/multiplexes/theatres/rangamandiras/auditorium and similar places to operate with 50% of its seating capacity strictly adhering to COVID appropriate behaviour and entry to such places will be restricted to fully vaccinated persons,” the order added.According to Ashok, hospitalisation in the state remains well below 5% of the active caseload even as the case count breached 300,000.Karnataka reported 48,049 new infections in a 24-hour-period, taking the active caseload to over 3.23 lakh, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department.Bengaluru’s active caseload rose to 2.23 lakhs with nearly 30,000 cases for a second day in a row. The positivity rate was hovering around 20%, data shows.Though there were differing opinions on considering different restrictions for different parts of the state, depending on positivity rate, Ashok said that it was decided to consider Karnataka as a unit and the same rules would apply across the state.Ashok said that as on January 20, there were over 2.93 lakh active cases and around 2.86 lakh were in home isolation.Of the 5,333 people who needed hospitalisation, 340 were in the ICU and 127 needed oxygen, the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-lifts-weekend-restrictions-based-on-low-hospitalisation-rate-101642791759012.html
22-01-2022||India||Govt dismisses CoWIN data leak reports; will start probe||Union health ministry on Friday dismissed reports of a data leak from the CoWIN portal that is used to manage the Covid vaccination drive in the country. “There have been several media reports claiming that the data stored in Co-WIN portal has been leaked online. It is clarified that no data has leaked from Co-WIN portal and the entire data of residents is safe and secure on this digital platform,” read a ministry statement. “It is also clarified that while Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare will enquire into the substance of the news, prima facie the assertion is not correct, as Co-WIN collects neither the address of the person nor the RT-PCR test results for COVID-19 vaccination,” it added. The health ministry was responding to reports saying personal data of thousands of people in India was leaked from a government server that included their name, mobile number, address and Covid test result, and the information could be accessed through an online search.The leaked data reportedly was put on sale on a website called Raid Forums. A post claimed to have personal data of over 20,000 people. The data on that website shows name, age, gender, mobile number, address, date and result of Covid-19 report of accounts. Cyber Security researcher Rajshekhar Rajaharia also tweeted that personally identifiable information (PII) including name and Covid-19 results are made public through a content delivery network (CDN). He said that Google has indexed lakhs of data points from the affected system.“PII including Name, MOB, PAN, Address etc of #Covid19 #RTPCR results & #Cowin data getting public through a Govt CDN. #Google indexed almost 9 Lac public/private #GovtDocuments in search engines. Patient’s data is now listed on #DarkWeb. Need fast deindex,” Rajaharia said in his tweet.The sample document shared on Raid Forums shows that the leaked data was meant for upload on Co-WIN portal.

22-01-2022||India||NCP MP Amol Kolhe under fire for portraying Godse in movie||Mumbai Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and member of parliament (MP) Amol Kolhe is under fire for portraying Nathuram Godse in an upcoming Hindi movie called ‘Why I killed Gandhi’.Kolhe, the Lok Sabha lawmaker from Shirur, is a popular TV actor, who shot to fame after playing Chhatrapati Shivaji in a TV series, is facing criticism from his own party, as well as allies in the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. State housing minister and NCP leader Jitendra Awhad said that Kolhe should not have acted in a movie glorifying Godse.“The movie is all about the glorification of Godse…He should have avoided playing the role in the first place,” Awhad said.The Hindi movie is set to release on OTT platforms on January 30, the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. The controversy started after a 2.20-minute trailer of the movie was released on social media. In it, Kolhe can be seen making a statement in a court justifying his decision to assassinate Gandhi.NCP chief Sharad Pawar tried to draw a curtain on the entire controversy and said that playing Godse doesn’t make Kolhe anti-Gandhi. He also said that he doesn’t see it as an attempt to glorify Godse.“Playing a character doesn’t mean that he (Amol Kolhe) can be called anti-Gandhi. The entire country is unhappy, sad and agitated over whatever Godse did. I don’t see it as an attempt to glorify him,” Pawar said, adding that t when Kolhe played the role, he was not a part of NCP.Kolhe joined the party in 2019; the film was made in 2017 (and never had a theatrical release).Awhad wasn’t mollified, though: “Whoever tries to glorify the person who killed Gandhi is our ideological opponent…While playing a role, one has to immerse in the character and ultimately shoot Gandhiji. When you see Richard Attenborough’s Gandhi, then you see the actor living the life of Gandhi. Accepting the role of Godse was a wrong decision.”Clarifying his stand on social media, Kolhe on Thursday said that although the film is being released now, it was shot in 2017. He also urged people to differentiate between ‘reel life’ and ‘real life’.“Sometimes, one comes across roles where you do not agree with the ideology but they challenge you as an artist. Nathuram Godse’s role was one such. I am not a votary of Gandhi’s assassination and never ever tried to glorify Nathuram Godse. As an artist, one must respect the freedom of expression and as a person, the freedom of thought! I hope that people look at this work with an open mind,” Kolhe posted on his Facebook account on Thursday.He also told ABP Majha that in 2017, he was not active in politics. However, Kolhe drew criticism from MVA allies as well. Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole said that there is an attempt going on to glorify Godse and Kolhe must remember that he is a public representative now.“We won’t allow the movie to be released in Maharashtra,” he said on Friday.Opposition leaders sought to know whether Kolhe and NCP accept Godse’s ideology or not. State BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said, “Amol Kolhe is a good actor and has the right to freedom of expression and play any character. The point here is whether he accepts the ideology of Godse because his party chief opposes Godse’s ideology. Even I don’t accept his (Godse’s) ideology.”
22-01-2022||India||CISF wants airlines to enforce one handbag policy||New Delhi: Citing delays in security clearance and congestion at airports, the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) has sought instructions to airlines directing them to ensure passengers are only carrying one hand bag. In a letter to the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS), CISF inspector general Vijay Prakash has said carrying multiple bags is leading to increased time in security clearance at the airport, which in turn is leading to congestion. “As per BCAS AVSEC Circular Nos. 06/2000 & Lt12000, no passenger should be permitted to carry more than one hand bag other than those items already listed in the circular, including lady’s bag. However, it has been seen that passenger on an average carry 02-03 Nos of hand bags to the screening point. This has led to increased clearance time as well as delays, congestion in PESC [Pre-embarkation security check] point and inconvenience to passengers. It is therefore felt that enforcement of the aforesaid Circulars must be ensured by all stakeholders / airlines,” the letter stated.A senior CISF official who did not want to be named said, “Security clearance is delayed when passengers carry more than one hand bag. This results in congestion and also causes hindrance in security checks. Apart from the 11 items allowed to be carried besides one handbag by the BCAS, we have requested airlines to inform and restrict their passengers to rules.”Another CISF official familiar with the matter said, “Some of the passengers seem to have forgotten the concept of ‘one hand bag’ and this letter is reiteration of what is already the rule. The list of items allowed apart from one hand bag includes readings materials, umbrellas, laptops and other few items that may have an urgent requirement. Earlier, when bag tags were mandatory, passengers could not take more than what is allowed, however, hand bags are no more controlled items and hence passengers have started taking more than allowed.”The official added, “The moment you increase more than one hand bag, you increase the load of the screeners. Carrying more than the allowed number of hand bags puts pressure on the screening system and also causes trouble to passengers as it leads to delay.”CISF asked BCAS to inform airlines to depute staff to guide passengers and verify the number of hand bags before allowing them for security checks. “All airlines may be directed suitably to inform pax [passengers] and to display ’one hand bag rule’ on their tickets / boarding passes very conspicuously,” the letter stated.“Airport operators may be instructed to place hoarding / banner/ board / standees displaying the contents of the ‘One hand bag Rule’ near the the check-in counters, vantage locations before security hold area (SHA) at airports, so that passengers get sensitised and if required, have an option to switch their extra hand bags to registered baggage,” the letter concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cisfwants-airlines-to-enforce-one-handbag-policy-101642791398995.html
22-01-2022||India||Bal Puraskar winners to be awarded with digital certificates on January 24||In a first, winners of the Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar (PMRBP) will receive digital certificates using ‘blockchain technology’ during a virtual ceremony scheduled on Monday. The winners of last year’s Bal Puraskar, who could not get certificates after the ceremony was shifted to online mode due to Covid-19 pandemic, will also receive digital certificates this time.In an official communication sent to all secretaries on Thursday, secretary of Union women and child development (WCD) ministry, Indevar Pandey, said the award ceremony will be held virtually this year as well in view of the surging Covid-19 cases.“On the occasion of National Girl Child Day on 24th January and as a part of the Azadi ka Amrut Mahotsav, the Prime Minister would interact virtually with the winners of PMRBP 2022. The children along with their parents and respective district magistrates would join the event from their respective district headquarters,” the secretary said in the communication.He added that the government has roped in a blockchain-based system for the transfer of certificates. “During the function, the Prime Minister would give digital certificates to the winners of PMRBP using blockchain technology. The certificates would also be given to the winners of PMRBP 2021, who could not be given the certificates last year due to Covid-19 situation,” the communication added.Last year, 32 children were awarded.The blockchain is an emerging technology that works on the principle of decentralisation. This effectively means that the control is not in the hands of a central agency, but to a distributed network of nodes. This will help in keeping the data safe even if any specific node is compromised. The information in a blockchain is recorded and stored sequentially along with an exact timestamp. The technology is already being used in the financial sector and has been powering currencies like bitcoin.In September last year, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) had introduced the blockchain-based system in order to go completely paperless and deliver secure, transparent and tamper-proof result certificates to students. In December, the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Kanpur also launched a system to award blockchain-based educational degrees in digital form to students.Till 2020, the winners of the PMRBP, under which children in the age group five-18 years are honoured for their exceptional abilities and outstanding achievements, were receiving physical certificates during a ceremony at the Rashtrapati Bhawan. The award is given in six fields -- innovation, scholastic achievement, sports, arts and culture, social service, and bravery. Each awardee is conferred with a medal, a cash prize of ₹1 lakh and a certificate.
22-01-2022||India||Supreme Court asks Centre on plan to create Indian Environment Services||The Supreme Court on Friday asked the Centre whether it was planning a dedicated Indian Environment Service in the national bureaucratic set-up, as recommended by a committee headed by former Cabinet secretary TSR Subramanian in 2014.Issuing notice on a petition filed by a lawyer Samar Vijay Singh, a bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh said: “A prayer has been made in the petition for creation of an independent Indian Environment Service at the all-India level. The prayer arises from the recommendation of TSR Subramanian Committee. Prima facie it is doubtful if a mandamus (judicial command) can be issued but an enquiry can be made whether the government proposes to act as per the recommendation of the committee.”The petition was argued by senior advocate K Sultan Singh, who pointed out that matters of environment require some level of sensitivity and domain knowledge. “It has been noticed that while commissioning projects at the field level, matters of environment have not been adequate attention,” Singh said.The bench was initially not inclined to entertain the petition. “Should we now take over the governance?” it said when the petitioner opened arguments.But the top court passed the order issuing notices after brief consultation on going through the report and its recommendations.The high-level committee was constituted in August 2014under the chairmanship of Subramanian by the ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEF & CC) to review environmental laws in the country, and to bring them in line with the current requirements. The report, submitted on November 18, 2014, recorded the fact that India had a strong environmental policy and legislative framework but weak implementation has resulted in environmental governance being criticised by conservation experts and the judiciary.As a step for the future, the committee said, “An Indian Environment Service may be created, as an all-India Service, based on qualifications and other details prescribed by MoEF&CC/ DoPT/ UPSC.” The committee also proposed that necessary institutional framework be created for this purpose.Officers dealing with environment clearances and policies currently come from the all India civil services conducted by the UPSC.The report said, “Current approval systems and monitoring mechanism function in a quasiamateurish manner, leading to sub-optimal management of environmental issues. It is now proposed that a new Indian Environment Service be created, as an All India Service, which will act as an expert group to man positions in this field in the public and quasi-governmental sectors over the next decades.”A parliament standing committee, however, rejected the report as it noted that the three-month period given to the HLC for reviewing six environmental laws was “too short”, and recommended a new committee be constituted.Drawing strength from the Subramanian report, the petition said, “Looking at the current administrative set-up, it can be inferred that the government servants might not be able to spare special time for environmental causes…Seeing the scientific and technical nature of the environment sector, it can be assumed that officers with a background in environmental science can come up with better solutions for numerous issues.”The petition also sought directions from the court to set up an Indian Environmental Service Academy in order to train officers for enforcing environment laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-asks-centre-on-plan-to-create-indian-environment-services-101642791098604.html

In the ensuing violence, three more people — two of whom were Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers and one was the driver of the car — were killed.Police officers aware of developments said investigators found direct involvement of the three farmers in the killings of the driver and two BJP workers. The police submitted evidence in form of video footage, mobile phone locations and call detail records. “The charge sheet states that the farmers attacked the driver and BJP workers with sticks and intention to kill them and intentionally set the vehicle on fire,” said an officer, requesting anonymity.After the October 3 violence, two First information Reports (FIR) were filed. One was registered by a farmer, Jagjeet Singh, which named Ashish Mishra and other unidentified people. The second was filed by BJP worker Sumit Jaiswal and mentioned unidentified miscreants. Police identified and arrested seven farmers regarding the second FIR, who were arrested in October. Police said in the investigation, adequate proof was not found against three of them, and they will be released.On December 14, a court in Uttar Pradesh added stringent sections of the IPC and Arms Act, including attempt to murder, to the First Information Report (FIR) after a special investigation team (SIT) said that incident was “well planned” and “deliberate”.On January 3, the SIT filed a 5,000-page charge sheet against Ashish Mishra and 13 others, booking them under charges including murder (302 IPC), criminal conspiracy (120B IPC) and others. The investigators charged Ashish Mishra with attempt to murder and said that he was present at the spot when violence broke out. The minister and his son had maintained that they were not near the spot that day.Yadav said a final report was filed against three farmers -- Ranjeet Singh, Sonu alias Kanwarjeet and Avatar Singh – who were named in the FIR but against whom sufficient evidence was not found.“While the four farmers against whom charge sheet has been filed will remain in jail, release order of the other three has been sent to jail from the court,” informed Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-kheri-case-4-farmers-charged-over-killings-of-bjp-workers-driver-101642790920654.html
22-01-2022||India||Can’t reinstate judge who complained of harassment: Madhya Pradesh HC||The Madhya Pradesh high court has declined to reinstate a former woman judicial officer who quit in 2014 alleging sexual harassment by a high court judge in the state, and has told the Supreme Court that an “amicable solution of the matter is not possible”.Following an inquiry in 2017, the high court judge was given a clean chit in the sexual harassment case but the woman judicial officer’s sudden transfer was held to be unjustified, prompting her to seek her job back through a petition in the top court.Submitting its affidavit, the high court administration has maintained that the full court (comprising all judges of the high court on the administrative side) considered the possibility of her reinstatement four times since January 2018, and reached the same decision each time that she cannot be reinstated after resigning from her job voluntarily.The affidavit also said that the woman’s request for transferring her to Rajasthan or Haryana from Madhya Pradesh cannot be accepted since the high court is not agreeable to reinstating her at all.“The proposals and suggestions of the petitioner were not acceptable to the high court and amicable solution of the matter has not been possible. It is submitted that any amicable settlement or solution has not been in the writ petition, and it is prayed that the petition may kindly be finally heard/adjudicated,” stated the response from the high court administration.The reply was filed earlier this week, following the Supreme Court’s appeal last yearto the chief justice and other judges of the high court to consider reinstating the former woman judge on humanitarian grounds, and to also consider her plea to transfer her to Haryana or Rajasthan if it was not possible to give her job back with seniority in Madhya Pradesh.The Supreme Court’s February 2020order came on the former judicial officer’s petition filed in 2018. Her petition cited the report submitted by the inquiry panel constituted by the Rajya Sabha into her accusations of sexual harassment against a high court judge, who has since retired.The inquiry panel was set up in 2015 after 58 members of the Rajya Sabha gave a notice to move a motion to impeach the high court judge.The report by the committee, comprising Supreme Court judge justice R Banumathi (now retired), the then chief justice of the Bombay high court Manjula Chellur, and senior advocate KK Venugopal (now Attorney General), was tabled in the Rajya Sabha in December 2017.The report concluded that the allegations of sexual harassment could not be “proved beyond reasonable doubt”. The panel, however, added that the decision to transfer the woman judge “mid-session” was “not justified’.“Under these circumstances, the complainant probably had no option than to submit her resignation since her elder daughter was pursuing Board XII exam. In these circumstances, we find that the transfer of the complainant to Sidhi has become unbearable for her to continue in service, resulting in her resignation,” the report said.On two or three occasions in the past, the Supreme Court urged the Madhya Pradesh high court to consider her case on humanitarian ground, but all the judges in the high court decided unanimously against reinstating her through full court decisions.On Friday, advocate Arjun Garg appeared for the high court administration and informed a Supreme Court bench, headed by justice L Nageswara Rao, of the latest affidavit. He conveyed the final decision of the high court against reinstating her and pleaded that the bench should hear the case on merits.Senior advocate Indira Jaising represented the former woman judge before the bench, which also included justice BR Gavai.The court, after noting the high court’s stand, fixed the matter for final hearing on January 27.The Supreme Court does not have any administrative control over the high courts, which are also the constitutional courts with exclusive control over services of judicial officers in their respective jurisdiction.Given this limitation, the top court has been requesting the high court judges to consider her case on humanitarian ground. However, with the full court’s indisposition to reinstate the former woman judge, the Supreme Court will have to now examine the petition on its own merit, striking a balance between the limitations of a service matter with the peculiar circumstances that compelled the former woman judge to quit her job.
22-01-2022||India||Centre now allows 6 people to register on one number for Covid vaccination||Six members can now be registered using one mobile number on the CoWIN portal for Covid-19 vaccination up from the current cap of four family members, the government announced on Friday, as it tweaked the IT backbone of its vaccination drive to enable more people to register for vaccinations, and address issues. “In continuation of updates on various utility features of Co-WIN for the beneficiaries, the following features are added in the self-registration portal of CoWIN: a) registration on Co-WIN – Instead of the existing limit of 4 members, now 6 members can be registered using one mobile number on Co-WIN...” the Union health ministry said in a statement. With some registered beneficiaries receiving erroneous messages regarding their vaccination status, the government also has made a provision for revoking vaccination status in the CoWIN system.“A new utility feature has been introduced under ‘raise an issue’ in Co-WIN account through which a beneficiary can revoke the current vaccination status from fully vaccinated to partially vaccinated or unvaccinated and also partially vaccinated to unvaccinated status,” read the health ministry statement.The ministry clarified that the vaccination status can be corrected by the beneficiaries, where in occasional isolated cases, the vaccination certificates have been generated due to inadvertent data entry errors. The changes, however, may reflect only 3-7 days after submitting the online request through the ‘raise an issue’ utility on the portal. Such beneficiaries can get their due vaccine dose, as per the existing standard guidelines, once the new vaccination status is successfully updated in the system.The CoWIN platform was created by upgrading the earlier digital platform used for Universal Immunization Program (UIP) vaccine distribution based on Electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network (eVIN) system.The government has been making changes at regular intervals to the system to make it easier for the beneficiaries to avail of the facility.“From self-registration, to making changes in personal details, and to be able to download your digital vaccination certificate etc., the system has been modified over a period of time for the ease of beneficiaries; to make the process convenient for them. User feedback has also been important for us as it has helped in making the system better. Initially there were some issues but with time and improvement it is functioning very well,” said a senior government official who asked not to be named.
22-01-2022||India||Mumbai Police arrest three over Clubhouse hate chats||The cyber cell of Mumbai police on Friday arrested three men from Haryana for making objectionable and abusive comments against Muslim women on an audio chat application, Clubhouse, officials said.According to the police, two of the accused - Jaishnav Kakkar (21) and Yash Parashar (22) - were arrested from Faridabad, while the third one, identified as Akash Suyal (19), was nabbed from Karnal. All arrests were made on Thursday night. Parashar is a law student, Kakkar is studying BCom while Suyal has completed Class 12, police said, adding that all three were arrested from their native places in Haryana.Mumbai Police commissioner Hemant Nagrale confirmed the breakthrough in the Clubhouse case. Police said a complaint was lodged on January 19 by a woman at the Cyber police station, following which a first information report (FIR) was registered. A video of the Clubhouse group’s vulgar and objectionable conversations was shared on various social media platforms.“In her complaint, the woman claimed that the participants of the Clubhouse chats had used objectionable remarks against women. She also complained that her photographs as well as those of her friend were used in the chat room on October 27 and November 27 last year during a discussion about women,” Milind Bharambe, joint commissioner of police (crime) said.“The three accused are likely to be brought to Mumbai on Saturday on a transit remand. We will produce them before a local court and seek their remand for further investigation,” said Bharambe.A crime branch official said that two chat rooms were created in the Clubhouse app, where participants were making derogatory comments about women and using abusive language. “They also talked about auctioning female body parts,” the official added.Another senior crime branch official said on Friday that a Twitter user by the name of ‘Jaimine’ had published videos of Clubhouse app. Similarly, a video was shared from an Instagram account by the name ‘lotus watch’. These two videos of Clubhouse chat rooms went viral on January 16 and January 19. The moderator of these two groups was using an ID ‘Kira XD’, which was used by Suyal, the official said.Kakkar was known on Clubhouse by account name @jaishnav and Parashar was known as ‘Sher Singh ka Papa’, ‘Biker gang 5’, ‘pardhan@haryana_aala’, the official added.Based on the woman’s complaint, the Cyber police registered a case under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 153 (A) (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc), 195 (A) (threatening a person to give false evidence), 354 (A) (sexual harassment), 354 (D) (stalking), 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman), 500 (defamation) and section 67 of IT Act.The cyber police, through technical investigation, traced the locations of the persons involved in creating the objectionable chatrooms and arrested the accused on Friday. The cyber police said they are also analysing the online activities of the accused.The Delhi police are also looking into the case.Meanwhile, Shiv Sena leader and Rajya Sabha member Priyanka Chaturvedi on Friday said that after successfully making a breakthrough in the ‘Bulli Bai’ app case, Mumbai cyber police made another breakthrough and arrested accused in the Clubhouse case.“Kudos @MumbaiPolice, they have got cracking on the Clubhouse chats too and some arrests have been made. Say no to hate. #Clubhouse,” she tweeted.She told HT that people were discussing “how to rape and exploit women, especially Muslim women” on Clubhouse app.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-police-arrest-three-over-clubhouse-hate-chats-101642790618844.html
22-01-2022||India||Eternal flames merge amid political conflict||The eternal flame, Amar Jawan Jyoti at India Gate was on Friday extinguished after 50 years and merged with the flame at the adjacent National War Memorial (NWM) in an elaborate military ceremony attended by the top brass of the armed forces, amid political finger pointing over the move aimed at creating a single site for paying homage to India’s fallen heroes and conducting all ceremonial functions.The flame at the Amar Jawan Jyoti was lit at India Gate’s arch on January 26, 1972, by the Indira Gandhi government to honour the soldiers who fell in the 1971 war with Pakistan, which ended with the liberation of Bangladesh.India Gate, a British-era monument, was built in the memory of around 90,000 soldiers of the British Indian Army who fell in World War I and the Afghan war. However, only names of 13,218 soldiers, including British men and officers, are inscribed on it, officials said on the condition of anonymity.Air Marshal BR Krishna, the chief of integrated defence staff to the chairman, chiefs of staff committee (CISC), presided over the two ceremonies that involved a tri-service guard of honour and the shifting of the flame from Amar Jawan Jyoti to the sprawling NWM, a monument dedicated to soldiers who fell in post-Independence wars and operations.Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated NWM almost three years ago, on February 25, 2019, and since then, more than 3.1 million people have visited the memorial and paid homage to the country’s fallen heroes whose names are inscribed on its walls. As on date, the names of 26,466 brave warriors are inscribed on the memorial, including the ones who fell in the 1971 war.The decision to shift the eternal flame triggered a political slugfest with the Congress accusing the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government of erasing history and the Centre, in its counter offensive, blaming the Opposition party for spreading misinformation and questioning why it did not build a national war memorial despite being in power for decades.Former servicemen were divided on the matter, with some of them speaking out in favour of the move saying two eternal flames in the same venue did not make sense and it was a wise call to shift the flame to NWM, and some others criticising the decision and seeking its recall.“Some people cannot understand patriotism and sacrifice. It is a matter of great sadness that the immortal flame for our brave soldiers will be extinguished today,” Congress leader Rahul Gandhi wrote on Twitter, leading to a flurry of reactions.It is ironic that people who did not construct a national war memorial for seven decades are making a hue and cry when a permanent and fitting tribute is being given to India’s fallen heroes, said a senior official, one of the people cited above.“It was an odd thing to see that the flame at Amar Jawan Jyoti paid homage to the braves of the 1971 war but none of their names are engraved there,” the official added.The controversy surrounding the eternal flame has erupted at a time when the government has started work on an overarching plan to take NWM to the people through a large-scale communication exercise, a move that has been welcomed by former servicemen, as reported by Hindustan Times on Friday.The defence ministry has sought the help of the information and broadcasting ministry for the elaborate exercise.“NWM is the nation’s icon for paying tributes to our braves. It bears the name of every single soldier who has died in the service of independent India. It has a flame that represents each of those men. No flame is getting extinguished. Both flames are being merged,” defence secretary Ajay Kumar told a news channel.The need to construct a national war memorial was first highlighted in 1961 but the government approval came only in October 2015, said a second official.Congress leader Manish Tewari likened the extinguishing of the flame at Amar Jawan Jyoti to removing history. “Extinguishing Amar Jawan Jyoti tantamount to extinguishing history. For it commentates sacrifice of those 3,483 brave soldiers who cleaved Pakistan into two parts and redrew the map of South Asia post-partition,” he tweeted.Some people also asked why it wasn’t possible to have two eternal flames at India Gate in the memory of the country’s fallen braves.Former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd), was among the veterans who supported the move to merge the flames.“I don’t want to get into the politics, but with all ceremonies now happening at NWM, it’s appropriate that the flames be merged. Now that we have NWM, it is appropriate that the Amar Jawan Jyoti be there,” Hooda said.Lieutenant General Satish Dua (retd), a former CISC, also found nothing wrong with the development. “Now NWM will become the officially designated place to pay homage to the fallen brave hearts…This is not insulting or degrading to any war hero,” Dua added.Some veterans, however, asked the government to reconsider its decision.“Sir, the eternal flame at #IndiaGate is part of India’s psyche. You, I & r generation grew up saluting our brave jawans there. While #NationalWarMemorial is great, the memories of #AmarJawanJyoti are indelible. Request rescind decision,” Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd) tweeted, tagging the PM.Congress lawmaker Shashi Tharoor said the government had no respect for democratic traditions and established conventions, and it was “snuffing out” the sanctity of the Amar Jawan Jyoti. Rashtriya Janata Dal MP Manoj Kumar Jha said such moves were “neither good politics nor good optics”.The government believes a lot more can be done to publicise the war memorial, attract more visitors and allow them to form a conscious connect with the sacred site and the fallen braves. The defence secretary on January 11 chaired a meeting that focussed on this issue.(With inputs from Malavika Murali and Isha Sahai Bhatnagar)
22-01-2022||India||Cosmetic makers can’t be mandated to put veg, non-veg labels, HC told||Labelling cosmetics as vegetarian and non-vegetarian cannot be made mandatory for manufacturers and they may do so voluntarily or on their own discretion, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) has told Delhi high court.In an affidavit filed before a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh, the CDSCO said that the Drugs Technical Advisory Board (DTAB) has not “agreed for mandating green (for vegetarian) or red (for non-vegetarian) dot on every packet of cosmetic as it may complicate the regulation and add regulatory burden on the stakeholders”.The board, however, opined that labelling items such as oaps, shampoos, toothpastes and other cosmetics and toiletries can be made voluntary and left on the manufacturer to decide, the drug regulatory body said. Subsequently, an advisory stating that “manufacturers of cosmetics may indicate red/brown or green dot on packages of soaps, shampoos, toothpastes and other cosmetics and toiletries on voluntary basis for its vegetarian or non-vegetarian origin respectively” was issued on September 10 last year, it added. The CDSCO’s affidavit was in response to a plea by Ram Gau Raksha Dal, a non-governmental trust, which sought labelling the products, including food items and cosmetics” as vegetarian or non-vegetarian, not only on the basis of its ingredients but also on the substance used in the manufacturing process. The petition, filed through advocate Rajat Aneja, said that it is the fundamental right of any citizen to know whether or not the food they consume, cosmetics and perfumes they use, clothes/garments they wear, contain, or are manufactured by using, components or parts derived from the body of an animal.Taking note of the plea, the high court on December 9 had made it mandatory for all food business operators to make a “full and complete disclosure” of all the ingredients that go into the making of any food item. The court ruled that “every person has a right to know as to what he/she is consuming and nothing can be offered to the person on a platter by resort to deceit, or camouflage”.The court also said that the ingredients used in the manufacturing process should not only be written in code, but also by source of origin -- plant or animal, made naturally or manufactured in a laboratory. It also threatened action against food operators who fail to comply with the order. The court, however, did not mention anything about cosmetic products. In its affidavit, CDSCO said that at a meeting of the DTAB on April 13 last year, the board emphasised that there is no clarity and system to certify vegetarian and non-vegetarian in cosmetic products across the country. The matter is slated for hearing on January 31. 
22-01-2022||India||Countdown begins for Supertech towers: Anatomy of an implosion||The two 32-storey towers of Supertech Emerald Court (Apex and Ceyane) in Noida will be the tallest ones to be demolished in the country so far. Experts say that the country is fairly new to the concept of skyscrapers and has only started building them. However, there is little expertise or experience in demolition of skyscrapers. While there are a few different techniques for demolition, the technique of “implosion” is most used and best suited for demolition of such tall structures in a densely populated area. In this technique, small explosive devices are placed at multiple locations in the building in a manner that the debris falls within the premises. After being admonished by the Supreme Court regarding delays, the builder and Noida Authority have finally assigned the task of demolition to Edifice Engineering earlier this week. HT speaks to Uttkarsh Mehta, partner, Edifice Engineering, about how this piece of history will unfold. So, when are the buildings coming down? According to the action plan that we have submitted to the authority and the builder, once we have the work order and all the paperwork is complete, we will start our survey on the ground and the entire preparation will take about three months. We are hoping that the day will be sometime around mid-May. After the blast, it will take around three months for us to clear the debris and remove the steel. What are the preparations and survey that you need to do now? There are two kinds of preparations – one is preparing the building or structure itself and the other preparation is for the neighbouring buildings or to the surroundings. We also need No Objections Certificates (NOCs) from all involved authorities like the DM, police, fire department. We also need a clearance from Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO) in Agra to transport and use the explosives. Additionally, we have to run a campaign to inform all the people in the neighbourhood about Dos and Don’ts during the blast. We will also have continuous meetings with all government departments to prepare an evacuation plan for all those living within 50 metres radius and for the halting of traffic in 250 metres’ radius for the blast duration. We will also discuss how emergency services will be allowed in the area during the blast duration. All this will be done in consultation with Central Building Research Institute (CBRI).What does the blast process involve? After the survey, our expert will prepare a ”blast design” for the structure to fall from all perspectives such as safety, vibration and other factors. The design will answer questions like which columns have to be blasted? Which walls have to be removed beforehand? At what floors the explosives will be placed? What will be the diameter and depth of the hole (in which they are placed)? What is the quantity of explosives needed? The building has to fall straight down like a pack of cards with minimum flying debris. That’s our biggest challenge. Maybe after a month of starting the survey, we will be able to decide on a blast date in concurrence with all authorities. Pre-structural analysis of all building in the radius of 50 metres will be done. We will survey for any existing damage to any of the structures and we will be checking them after as well to see if there was any impact of the blast. There are apprehensions among people who live close by, especially in Emerald Court that is just about nine metres away from the twin towers. What will be done to ensure safety? From our initial analysis of the location, we will have to build a passage between the twin towers and Emerald Court to avoid any flying debris. When we saw the site, there is a driveway between the two buildings that is already weakened. It has cracks and exposed reinforcement. We may have to remove the driveway entirely so that the debris falls straight in the basement. The driveway will then have to be reconstructed later, which is already a demand from the residents there. Our other option is to strengthen it but that is not very feasible. Additionally, we will use empty containers anchored to the ground and stacked up to three floors as an additional safety layer to protect the Emerald Court buildings from any flying debris. What other safety measures will be followed? We use at least four layers of geo-textile fabric or cloth to cover the entire building that has to be demolished so that there is no flying debris. Every part of the building to be blasted will be covered with wire mesh and then with geo-textile fabric. Every floor and pillar that will be blasted will also be completely covered by geo-textile fabric. A layer of the cloth will also be placed to cover the entire building.For ATS and other buildings in the surroundings, we will cover them with geo-textile fabric as well, which is mostly for dust control. Our assessment is that there will hardly be any flying debris that will leave the twin tower compound itself.During such implosions there is also a large dust cloud. Is there any way to control dust? Yes, there is a dust cloud and it is the only negative thing about this technology. While doing this inward blast there is a huge dust cloud and it usually dissipates within 6-7 minutes. How much time it will take to dissipate and how far it will go also depends on the wind speed and wind direction at the time of the blast. However, there is no way to control or minimise it from our practical experience. Fire tenders, mist guns and other solutions have been tried but have only been about 10% successful in controlling dust. However, we will ask the Noida Authority to be ready with mechanical sweeping machines. While sending advisory to neighbourig residents, we will mention that they should keep all doors and windows closed, switch off their ACs and keep the external unit of their ACs covered if possible so that the dust is not sucked in. (The Apex and Ceyane buildings were planned to have 40 floors, but went in litigation after 32 floors were constructed. The two buildings have 915 flats and 21 shops)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/countdown-begins-for-supertech-towers-anatomy-of-an-implosion-101642790439163.html
22-01-2022||India||Weekend, night curfews to remain in Delhi; offices can reopen||Private offices have been allowed to reopen with 50% on-site staff from next week but the weekend and night curfews will continue in the Capital, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority announced on Friday, notwithstanding a request from the city’s elected government that sought these curbs to be rolled back on the back of a sustained fall in the number of cases.The city recorded 10,756 new cases on Friday, comprising 18.04% positive results of tests carried out in the last 24 hours. These numbers are a major improvement from the peak of 28,867 cases and 30.64% test positivity rate in this wave logged on January 13 and 14 respectively.“The grave danger of the coronavirus has subsided in Delhi… Experts had warned that Delhi can record one lakh cases daily during this wave, but that danger has been averted. We will take a call on lifting of more restrictions within three-four days,” Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain said, after announcing that the administration wrote to DDMA seeking relaxation in curbs.The government asked the agency, which is led by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and is the authority on Covid-related rules – to withdraw the weekend curfew, lift the odd-even restriction on standalone shops, and allow private offices to call back 50% of their staff.In an order issued later in the day, DDMA accepted only the last suggestion. “It is clarified that the night curfew from 10pm to 5am everyday and the weekend curfew from 10pm of Friday till 5am of subsequent Monday shall remain unchanged…” the order said.Private offices, it added, shall be allowed to function with up to 50% attendance with immediate effect although officials will be advised to work-from-home as much as possible.Maharashtra announced earlier this week that it will allow schools to reopen, a decision also taken by Mumbai, from next week. Karnataka on Friday lifted its weekend curfew, while letting one for the night remain, after observing low hospitalisation rates.In Delhi, orders to close private offices came on January 11, a day after the city shut the last of non-essential activities, such as dining out. Earlier, on December 28, the city ordered schools and gyms to close as cases began to rise.In that time, the hospital infrastructure has been strengthened and crucial scientific assumptions has been confirmed: the Omicron variant that is driving the surge is less likely to lead to serious disease and people who have taken vaccine doses are protected.“Of the 43 fatalities recorded on Thursday, coronavirus was the primary cause in only three,” Jain said on Friday. The Capital has reported 396 deaths due to the infection in January so far. According to officials, most of these patients had serious comorbidities and Covid was not the primary cause of death.A person from Baijal’s office said the decision to continue the restrictions was taken because the positivity rate was still over 21% as on Thursday. “The Delhi government’s proposal of private offices working with up to 50% staff has been agreed with by the LG. With regards to weekend curfew and opening of markets, it has been suggested that the status quo should be maintained since positivity rate is still hovering above 21% and number of daily positive cases are more than 12,000. Once the situation improves, a review would be done by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority along with member experts and a final decision will be taken,” said this person, asking not to be named.But it has been clear for a few days that Delhi’s numbers are southbound. For instance, Friday’s health bulletin, which came hours after the DDMA order, showed that positive cases have fallen to 10,756 and the positivity rate to 18.04%. And almost 83% of the beds in dedicated Covid hospitals are unoccupied.Deputy CM Manish Sisodia, in a press conference on Friday, said the curbs must now be eased. “When Covid cases were on the rise in the city, it was important to impose various restrictions for the safety of people. But now the peak of Covid cases has passed and the cases are declining considerably. On January 12, the Capital reported the highest number of cases this season, which was nearly 28,000. About 8-10 days back, the positivity rate was around 31%, but now it has come down to 17%. Seeing the current graph of cases, we are currently in the situation to relax restrictions,” Sisodia said.“Now that the cases are coming down, it would be wrong to restrict people from moving out to earn for their survival,” he added, speaking before the order was issued.After the order, officials of the government said it was unfortunate that the LG rejected the strong demand of traders and business community. “LG has rejected the proposal of elected government despite the fact that Covid cases are reducing at a very fast pace. When all markets of Gurugram and Noida are open, why should the business community of Delhi be made to suffer by BJP’s Central government,” Delhi government said in a statement.Traders said they are planning to launch a protest against the LG if the odd-even restrictions are not lifted within three days. Chamber of Trader and Industry chairman Brijesh Goyal said the elected government has the right to act in the interest of the people of Delhi. “Delhi’s traders are deeply disappointed by the LG’s decision. We request DDMA chairman LG Anil Baijal to lift the odd-even restrictions from the markets and end weekend curfew keeping in mind the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of traders and lakhs of employees and laborers,” said Goyal.Confederation of All India Traders general secretary Praveen Khandelwal wrote a letter to the LG seeking reconsideration of the DDMA’s decision. “The traders of Delhi are facing acute financial crisis for last two years. Dine-in facilities in restaurants should be allowed with 50% seating capacity and non-vaccinated persons should not be allowed to enter any restaurants,” said Khandelwal.Community medicine experts backed the traders demands. Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital, said: “Now the third wave is receding in Delhi and most of the part of India, further imposing night curfew and restriction of commercial activities will not benefit in decreasing cases but may further delay the downfall of curve. With less movement of individuals, the infection spread will slow down. Due to restrictions the movements of individuals will be lower and thus the dip will also be slow. Omicron is known to be mild with high transmissibility therefore economic losses due to it are not justified.”The Aam Aadmi Party, which is in government, too hit out at the LG separately. “LG is a representative of the BJP led central government and it is clear that the BJP wants to destroy every single business running in Delhi... The wages of the poor people working at these shops have also been deducted due to the decline in sales, hence causing them to struggle even more. Meanwhile the BJP in Delhi is running a false campaign, plotting a conspiracy in which they are sending messages to Delhi’s market associations that CM Arvind Kejriwal is disrupting Delhi’s businesses,” said party spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj.Leader of opposition in Delhi assembly, BJP's Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, said he has been demanding for the past few days that the DDMA should ease the restrictions and give relief to the traders. “I have written a letter to the LG today (Friday) requesting him to reconsider the decision to continue the weekend curfew in Delhi and odd-even restrictions for markets. The proposal of Delhi government should be approved with the condition that it will ensure strict implementation of the Covid rules in the markets,” Bidhuri told HT.
22-01-2022||India||‘Anti-India’ content: Govt cracks down on 35 YouTube channels||The ministry of information and broadcasting issued orders to take down 35 Pakistan-based YouTube channels and two websites for “spreading anti-India fake news in a coordinated manner over digital media”, exercising powers granted to it under the new information and technology rules.“These channels were toxic and spreading anti-India propaganda,” secretary of information and broadcasting Apurva Chandra said in a press conference. “More and more such channels will continue to be blocked. Not only intelligence agencies, we urge the people to come forward and notify us of (such) content.”Union minister of information and technology Anurag Thakur said after the Cabinet meeting that any social media account trying to mislead the public would also be taken down. “Any account that is trying to spin a conspiracy or mislead the people will be actioned,” he told reporters.The channels, according to the ministry, have over 12,123,500 subscribers and over 1,320,426,964 views. They include Khabar with facts, Khabar Taiz, Information Hub, Flash Now, Mera Pakistan With, Hakikat Ki Duniya and Apni Dunya Tv.“These channels were spreading misinformation about the Indian army, including conspiracies that the death of chief of defence staff Bipin Rawat was an assassination,” said joint secretary in the I&B ministry and the designated officer for take downs, Vikram Sahay. “These threaten the sovereignty and the integrity of India.”According to the ministry, the YouTube channels, websites, and other social media accounts blocked were used by “Pakistan for spreading anti-India fake news about sensitive subjects related to India”. “These include topics such as the Indian Army, Jammu and Kashmir, and India’s foreign relations with other countries. It was observed that rampant fake news was spread through the YouTube channels regarding the demise of the former Chief of Defence Staff Late General Bipin Rawat. These YouTube channels had also started posting content to undermine the democratic process of the upcoming elections in five states,” the ministry said in a press release. “The channels propagated content to encourage separatism, divide India on the lines of religion, and create animosity among the various sections of the Indian society. Such information was feared to have the potential to incite the audience into commission of crimes adversely affecting public order in the country.”The last round of blocks in December 2021 was actioned on a global level, with YouTube taking down the channels across the world and not just in India.The blocking directions have been issued using the emergency powers granted to the secretary of the I&B ministry, who on being notified by the authorised officer, can order an immediate takedown of content under the new social media and intermediary guidelines. The interim order will be placed in front of the inter-departmental committee for review.The interdepartmental committee forms the apex of the three-tier redressal mechanism, which includes a self-regulatory mechanism, followed by regulation by industry bodies. The committee, in a first, also has members from the industry body — one member each from the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry and Confederation of Indian Industry, one member from the Bar Council of India and a member from the Press Council of India. Besides these, the committee also has members from the ministry of women and child development, ministry of law and justice, ministry of home affairs, ministry of electronics and information technology, ministry of external affairs and ministry of defence.The guidelines have been challenged by various media consortiums in court for leading to censorship of news content.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/antiindia-content-govt-cracks-down-on-35-youtube-channels-101642790257848.html
22-01-2022||India||Centre to introduce guidelines on relocation of tigers soon||India’s National Tiger Conservation Authority will soon come out with guidelines or standard operating procedures (SOP) for the reintroduction of tigers that can used by other Tiger Range Countries, environment ministry officials said on Friday, hours after environment minister Bhupender Yadav spoke at the 4th Asia Ministerial Conference on tiger conservation organised by Malaysia and coordinated by the Global Tiger Forum.Yadav said in his address that India achieved a remarkable feat by country’s doubling the tiger population from 2006 in 2018, fours years ahead of its goal. He said that the budgetary allocation for tiger conservation has increased from ₹185 crore in 2014 to ₹300 crore in 2022, and added that a Project Tiger-like model was being replicated for the lion, dolphin, leopard, snow leopard and other small wildcats, while the country is on the threshold of introducing cheetah in its historical range.Ministry officials said success with the tiger relocation could be replicated elsewhere.“We have successfully translocated a tiger in the western part of Rajaji Tiger Reserve last year. Similar reintroduction has been planned for Kanha Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh. The SOP will be shared with all Tiger Range Countries,” said a senior environment ministry official who asked not o be named.The Conservation Assured |Tiger Standards (CA|TS) accreditation has been already awarded to 14 tiger reserves in India (Manas, Kaziranga, Orang, Satpura, Pench, Kanha, Panna, Valmiki, Dudhwa, Parambikulam, Mudumalai, Bandipur, Anamalai and Sundarbans). CA|TS is a set of criteria which allows tiger sites to check if their management will lead to successful tiger conservation as per the international standards. Other than India, only one tiger reserve each in Russia and Nepal, and two in Bhutan have the CAITS status.The 12 TRCs other than India are Bangladesh, Vietnam, Cambodia, Bhutan, Thailand, Indonesia, Laos, China, Malaysia, Russia, Nepal and Myanmar.India has the highest number of tigers in the wild-- 2,967 tigers, or seven out of every 10 in the world, according to the All India Tiger Estimation Results released in 2019. The number reflects a 33% increase over 2014 when there were 2,226 tigers in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-to-introduce-guidelines-on-relocation-of-tigers-soon-101642790019020.html
22-01-2022||India||AG clears contempt action against Narsinghanand||Attorney general of India KK Venugopal has granted consent to initiate contempt proceedings against controversial Hindu priest Yati Narsinghanand over his remarks made against the Supreme Court in an interview last week.In the interview, given on January 14, Narsinghanand had said that those who believe in the Constitution, the Supreme Court, the politicians and the Army will “die a dog’s death”. Following this interview, Mumbai-based social activist Shachi Nelli wrote to AG Venugopal seeking permission for initiating contempt action against the controversial Hindu priest.Narsinghanand is the Juna Akhara Mahamandaleshwar and was arrested on January 16 in connection with the hate speeches and a call for genocide against religious minorities made at a 3-day religious event he organised in Haridwar in December.The AG’s permission is needed under Rule 3(a) of the Rules to Regulate Proceedings for Contempt of the Supreme Court of India, 1975 for bringing a contempt action under the Contempt of Courts Act 1971.Responding to Nelli’s letter on Friday, AG Venugopal said, “I have gone through your letter and watched the video of the statements made by Yati Narsinghanand which have been explained to me. I find that the statement made by Yati Narsinghanand is a direct attempt to lower the authority of the Supreme Court in the minds of the general public. This would certainly amount to Contempt of the Supreme Court of India.”Accordingly, he said, “I grant consent to initiate proceedings for criminal contempt of the Supreme Court in terms of Section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act.”After receiving the response, Nelli tweeted, “The Attorney General has granted consent to initiate proceedings for criminal contempt against Yati Narsinghanand. I will be proceeding accordingly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ag-clears-contempt-action-against-narsinghanand-101642789659284.html
22-01-2022||India||UP elections: BJP names 26 women in its second list||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday declared 85 more candidates for the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. It has thus far named a total of 195 candidates in four tranches. The latest BJP list for Uttar Pradesh was announced shortly after chief minister Yogi Adityanath launched the party’s theme song “UP phir maangey bhajapa sarkar (UP again seeks BJP government).” The list has 26 women and candidates belonging to other backward classes (OBCs). In total, of the 195 seats for which it has named candidates, the BJP has named 26 women.The BJP has retained candidates in at least 30 of the 195 seats for which it has announced candidates thus far. Riya Shakya, an OBC candidate, is among the 15 women on the list and will contest from Bidhuna assembly constituency in Auraiya, a seat held by her father Vinay Shakya, who is among the 14 BJP lawmakers, including three ministers who defected to the Samajwadi Party (SP) last week. The Samajwadi Party is expected to field a majority of BJP rebels on its symbol but has not named its candidate on the Bidhuna seat yet. If it does name Shakya, the move would set up an interesting father-daughter contest. Uttar Pradesh goes to polls between February 10 and March 7 to elect 403 lawmakers.The results will be announced on March 10. On January 11, Riya Shakya released a video that went viral in which she claimed that her lawmaker father had been abducted, a claim subsequently denied by Auraiya police and her father. The BJP’s new list comprises several turncoats: Ramvir Upadhyaya, who was among the Brahmin faces of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), from Sadabad assembly constituency in Hathras; formerl Congress lawmakers Rakesh Singh from Harchandpur and Aditi Singh from Rae Bareli ; Nitin Agarwal, formerly of the Samajwadi Party from Hardoi; Hari Om Yadav, the SP’s Sirsaganj MLA who had joined the BJP in Delhi a few days back. The list also includes former chief of UP Anti-Terrorist Squad (UP ATS) Asim Arun, a Jatav dalit, who recently quit the Indian Police Service (IPS) with nine years of his tenure remaining. He has been fielded from Kannauj, a reserved seat. When he quit, Arun was the police commissioner of Kanpur and his induction into the party has come in for sharp criticism from the opposition Samajwadi Party and the Rashtriya Lok Dal. Another Dalit IPS officer Brij Lal, who joined the BJP after retirement, is already a Rajya Sabha member from UP. The BJP has finalised its seat-sharing arrangement with its OBC allies, Apna Dal and Nishad party, though it has not made the details public yet.
22-01-2022||India||Expelled minister Harak Singh Rawat, daughter-in-law join Congress||Weeks before the Uttarakhand assembly elections, expelled Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) minister Harak Singh Rawat on Friday joined the Congress, along with his daughter-in-law Anukriti Gusain, in New Delhi in presence of former chief minister Harish Rawat.Rawat is the second cabinet minister and third BJP legislator to switch to the Congress in the last four months. In October last year, Yashpal Arya and his son Sanjeev Arya quit the BJP and joined the Congress.Elections to the 70-member Uttarakhand legislative assembly will be held on February 14. The counting of votes will be done on March 10.Soon after joining his old party, Congress, 61-year-old Rawat said he has joined the party unconditionally. He also said he will work for the party as a worker and ensure it wins the state assembly elections. He expressed his gratitude to the Congress high command for allowing him to rejoin the party.“When Congress will win with full majority on March 10, that will be my apology (for deserting the party in 2016),”Rawat told reporters in Delhi after joining the Congress.He was dismissed from the Uttarakhand cabinet and expelled from the BJP for six years on Sunday for “anti-party activities”. The last five days have witnessed drama over Rawat’s political future. Congress insiders said the delay in his joining the party was due to opposition from many Congress leaders, especially those close to Harish Rawat, the former chief minister of the state.Rawat was one of the 10 MLAs who left the Congress to join the BJP in 2016, which led to the toppling of the Harish Rawat-led government in the state. Congress functionaries, on condition of anonymity, said the party wants to use Rawat in the elections against the ruling BJP, but delayed his reinduction so as to not send a wrong signal to party workers.The functionaries added that the party will give a ticket to only one person from his family, with speculation rife that his daughter-in-law will be named as a candidate.Rawat’s daughter-in-law Anukriti Gusain is a social worker and model and has won multiple beauty pageants, including Miss Grand International India 2017 and Miss Asia Pacific World 2014. She also runs an NGO in Uttarakhand that works for women and children.Recently, former CM Harish Rawat had said that those who played a role in toppling his government in 2016 should apologise before joining the Congress. On Tuesday, Rawat said he was ready to apologise as many times as it takes to his elder brother (Harish Rawat). He said he will “apologise keeping in mind the interests of Uttarakhand and its people”, for whom he wants to work continuously.On XXXXXX Pradeep Tamta, senior Congress leader and Rajya Sabha member, said, “What happened in 2016 was a murder of democracy.” “What is the need to take ‘dhaagdaar’ (stained people) when the Congress is coming to power.”Rawat, a leader from Garhwal’s Thakur community, was first elected as an MLA in 1991from Pauri and became the youngest minister of then undivided Uttar Pradesh. From 1991 to 1993, he was tourism minister in Uttar Pradesh. Uttarakhand was carved out of Uttar Pradesh in 2000.In 2002, Rawat was elected as an MLA from Lansdowne assembly segment and was made cabinet minister of key departments. In 2007, he was re-elected form Lansdowne and was elected as the leader of Opposition in Uttarakhand legislative assembly. In 2012, he won the election from Rudraprayag assembly segment. After switching to the BJP in 2016, he won the 2017 election from Kotdwar assembly seat.Uttarakhand BJP spokesperson Suresh Joshi said, “Till yesterday, Harish Rawat was calling him (Harak Singh Rawat) a murderer of democracy. Today he and Congress accept the same leader. Harish Rawat should explain the reasons for his change of heart in front of the public, otherwise he should apologise to public for the statements he made earlier.”“ Now people will not trust Harish Rawat or any other Congress leader,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-elections-expelled-minister-harak-singh-rawat-daughter-in-law-join-congress-101642788878522.html
22-01-2022||India||UP elections: Priyanka says she is Congress’s face in state||Weeks before the Uttar Pradesh assembly election, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra made it clear that she is the face of the party in this state poll but didn’t confirm if she would contest the election. “Can you see any other face from the Congress? It’s my face that’s visible everywhere,” she said at an event held to release the party’s manifesto for the youth of the state, when asked who would be the face of the party in the UP election. But she didn’t confirm if she would be fighting the election and said, “If such as decision is taken, you will get to know.” Gandhi Vadra’s announcement is significant as the Congress has not projected a CM candidate in any of the five election-bound states, inviting criticism from within the organization, and from rivals, including the Bharatiya Janata Party, the incumbent in all five states, which has named its CM candidates. Analysts said that the Congress does not have a realistic chance in the election, but that Gandhi Vadra’s comment clearly showed her willingness to shoulder and accept responsibility. The party’s manifesto for the youth released on Friday focused on employment in both government and private sectors, weeks after it announced promises for women including a 40% reservation in party poll tickets. The focus on women and young people is seen as an attempt to counter the issue of caste-and religious-identity in a state where the Congress has never seen power in the post-Mandal era. She also announced that the party is open to be a part of a non-BJP coalition to keep the BJP out, if the situation arises, but the Congress’ poll promises would have to be at the core of such a coalition. Speaking at the launch of the manifesto for the youth, former Congress President Rahul Gandhi accused the Union government and said, “Our understanding and belief is that India requires a new vision. If you want to propose a new vision you need to start in UP. It’s a step towards giving a vision to the country.” Pointing a finger at parties that have been in power in Uttar Pradesh, Gandhi said, “Young people have understood that in last 25 years they didn’t get anything.” The Congress’ poll promises for the youth include filling 1.2 million government posts currently lying vacant and generating another 8 lakh private jobs along with promotion of local skills. Gandhi Vadra added: “This is strategy, not empty words. The question is, how to give you employment. In UP, every 24 days, 880 people lose jobs. In the last five years, 16 lakh (1.6 million) youth lost jobs. Youth of UP needs a new vision and Congress is only party that can give this.” She added: “We will remove the problems to generate employment. We will curb the scams in public job exams. The vacancies amount to 1.5 lakh posts in primary schools; 8000 teachers’ posts are vacant in higher education; 6000 doctors’ posts; and 100,000 police posts will be filled.” The Congress has also promised to appoint 20,000 anganwadi officials and 27,000 anganwadi helpers , 32,000 teachers for physical education, and 4000 Urdu teachers. Gandhi Vadra added that the current state government’s plan of “one district, one product” would be revised and the Congress would promote a cluster approach to support local industries. Fees for job exams would be waived and a single-window scholarship portal would be launched, she said. . Among other promises in the manifesto are: opportunities for children of sanitation workers; a ₹5 lakh loan to businesspeople from the most backward classes; a de-addiction centre with headquarters in Lucknow; a youth festival annually to showcase local talent; and world-class cricket academies for cricket and other sports.

22-01-2022||India||Punjab elections: BJP announces names of 34 candidates in first list||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday announced its first list of 34 candidates, including 13 Sikhs, nine Dalits and two women, for the February 20 assembly elections in Punjab.BJP general secretary Tarun Chugh said the party has given representation to all sections of society and the first list included 12 people from farmer families, nine from Scheduled Castes, and some professionals.“Tickets have been given to 12 candidates who belong to farmers’ families, eight tickets to members of the SC community, 13 tickets to Sikhs. The list has doctors, lawyers, sportspersons, farmers, youth, women, and former IAS,” Chugh said.The party’s first list includes former Congress minister Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi who joined the BJP recently.On its traditional strongholds such as Jalandhar Central, Jalandhar North, Fazilka and Hoshiarpur, the party has mostly banked upon its old guards by fielding Manoranjan Kalia, KD Bhandari, Surjit Jyani and Tikshan Sud, respectively.State BJP chief Ashwani Sharma, whose nomination from Pathankot assembly segment was looking certain, was not fielded by the party. Instead, the party has fielded sitting MLA Dinesh Babbu from the seat.Three Congress leaders, who shifted to the BJP recently, were also given tickets. These include former minister Rana Gurmit Sodhi, from Hindu-dominated Ferozepur Urban seat, and Nimisha Mehta, once a close aide of chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, from Garhshankar seat. Mehta joined the BJP immediately after he was refused a ticket from the Congress. The saffron party is fighting the polls for the 117-assembly seats in alliance with Punjab Lok Congress led by Capt Amarinder Singh and Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa-led Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt). 
22-01-2022||India||Goa elections: Parrikar’s son, Utpal, quits BJP; to contest as independent||Utpal Parrikar , the son of former Union minister and four-time Goa chief minister the late Manohar Parrikar, resigned from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday, and announced that he will contest the upcoming assembly elections as an independent candidate from Panaji, the seat represented by his father from 1994 until his death in 2019.Utpal Parrikar, 40,was denied a ticket by the party leadership, which chose to instead field Atanasio “Babush” Monserrate, who won the seat in 2019 on a Congress ticket in a by-election held to fill the vacancy resulting from Parrikar’s death.“Utpal’s prowess in Panaji is still something he has to prove on ground. During the last few elections, his father won Panaji through tacit alignment with Monserrate. But Uptal’s decision will have a broad impact on the BJP, especially because it’s claim of being a party which wants to take forward Parrikar’s legacy has now been found hollow in the wake of Utpal’s moves,” Mayabhushan Nagvenkar, journalist and author of the book ‘Manohar Parrikar: An Extraordinary Life’, said.“People of Panaji did not vote for Manohar Parrikar just because he is MP. They voted for him because he stood for some values. The time has come for me to also stand for those values. I would like to announce that I will be contesting as an independent candidate from Panaji constituency,” Parrikar said on Friday.“I tried my best even during last elections and this election to convince my party that I enjoy not only the support of all the workers, who have built this party for the last 30 years, who toiled with my father to build this party in Panaji. They are also toiling with me today. I have also enjoyed their support and the support of the general population of Panaji. In spite of that, for some reason I have not been able to get the candidature of Panaji constituency. It has been given to someone who has opportunistically come into the party within the last two years,” he added.The BJP offered Utpal two other seats to pick from, but he rejected both and questioned state in-charge Devendra Fadnavis who earlier said that the party does not hand out tickets just because someone is Manohar Parrikar’s son.“If the party does not hand out tickets just because you are somebody’s son then why was I being offered other seats? I am not asking for the ticket because I want something on the platter,” Parrikar said.When asked whether he would support the BJP in the future in a possible post-poll scenario, he said that he will place such decisions before the people of Goa at the right time.Parrikar also welcomed the support he was receiving from other political parties, notably the Shiv Sena, which said that should he decide to contest, other parties should support him. “Any support required to fight the type of candidate I am fighting is welcome,” he said.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had offered to field Utpal from Panaji if he joined the party, however, he said he had not considered joining another party.“As far as political party is concerned, only party available to me is the BJP. The other platform is as an independent -- my own platform-- which I had to do unfortunately in these circumstances for the values I believe in,” he said.The ruling BJP, in its first list of candidates on Thursday, ignored Parrikar’s claim for the Panaji seat and instead chose Monserrate, who joined the BJP from the Congress in 2019 along with nine other MLAs. Monserrate, who is facing trial for multiple charges including rape and rioting, was preferred on grounds of “winnability” with the party’s state in-charge Fadnavis saying that he was given the ticket because he was the “sitting MLA”.“A sitting MLA has been given a ticket in Panaji. Parrikar’s family is our family. They are close to us. I had given Utpal Parrikar two options, from where he could contest. BJP has respected the Parrikar family,” Fadnavis said.“The BJP had ample grounds to reject Babush’s claim for a ticket -- his history of jumping parties, his criminal background, his unabashed desire for power. They could have given the ticket to another person for whom giving the ticket would be easier to justify. It didn’t have to be a choice between Utpal and Babush. Besides the bad press, the decision could yet prove to be a strategic blunder,” senior journalist Vasudev Pagi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-elections-parrikar-s-son-utpal-quits-bjp-to-contest-as-independent-101642788698387.html
22-01-2022||India||From Jan 26, 1950: Biggest liberal experiment in democratic govt||When people in Britain try to understand and appreciate the written Constitutions of other countries, they are always at a disadvantage because they do not live under such a Constitution and have no direct experience of it. Of course Britain has its system of government, Constitutional law, Constitutional usages, customs and conventions, but its people have not attempted to define, describe and codify these rules in a single, comprehensive, agreed document. Yet though the people of Britain have not given themselves a Constitution they have given Constitutions to every other community within the Commonwealth. By this process of Constitution making the people in the U.K. have come to learn a good deal about the problems involved in contriving a system of government for other members of the Commonwealth. Of no country is this more true than of India. In the long process by which the Government of India Act of 1935 was framed, people in Britain learned much of the difficulties of making a Constitution for India, and anyone who followed the discussions of these years, in which Indians and British alike strove to devise a good government for India, will be slow to criticize the work which the Indian Constituent Assembly has done. It has been a tremendous task and to have produced any Constitution at all which can command so wide a measure of agreement is a great achievement. PARLIAMENTARY FORM Perhaps the first point which interests a British student of the Indian J Constitution is the fact that the Constituent Assembly should have chosen the Parliamentary form of executive---the cabinet system as understood in British countries-in preference to the non-Parliamentary or presidential form of executive which prevails in the United States. It was a difficult choice and there was much to be said on both sides, as the members of the Constitutional Assembly realized full well. It is impossible to prophesy how the system will work. So much will depend on factors such as the shape of the party system to come and upon the working of universal suffrage. India needs a strong and stable executive, but there can be no certainty that the Parliamentary executive will be strong. France provides sufficient evidence of that. Yet on the whole it was the wiser choice---if one may venture an opinion upon so controversial and uncertain a matter. The presidential executive, if one may generalize from experience in North and South America, is usually too strong or too weak; it seldom strikes the happy meaning. The Cabinet system has usually had a better record in this respect. Undoubtedly British students of government will follow the working of the Cabinet system, both at the Centre and in the States of the Indian Union, with the greatest interest and sympathy. They will feel, perhaps-as is only human-some gratification that the framers of the Indian Constitution should have chosen a form of executive which is distinctive British in its origin and development. These common institutions must surely strengthen the day-to-day working of the Commonwealth; they will help us to understand each other. Second matters of major interest to a British student are the Constitution provisions which deal with the relations between the Union and the States. Inevitably he looks back to the Act of 1935 and compares its provisions with those now adopted. The Constituent Assembly has thought it wise to adopt, as did the Act of 1935, three legislative lists--Union list, State list and concurrent list. There were no doubt good reasons for this, but I have always felt disappointed that it was deemed unavoidable. Since it is intended that the residual powers in the Union should rest with the Centre, why is it necessary to do more than enumerate the powers of the States, and the concurrent powers, and then to say that all that is left rests with the Centre? Would not two lists suffice? The problems of interpreting these three lists, set out in such detail, will surely provide some complicated cases for the Supreme Court. The experience of Canada is a solemn warning against over-enumeration, and the concurrent list in Canada is, in any case, very limited. The Constituent Assembly had to consider a variety of factors in deciding this matter. It is unfortunate, however, that the Assembly could not have adopted a much simpler and shorter method of dividing the powers. FEDERAL FEATURES On the whole it seems evident that the Constituent Assembly intends the Union to be more centralized than was proposed by the Act of 1935, although in that case also there were methods of intervention permitted to the Centre in the affairs of the provinces which reminded one more of the Canadian conception of federation than of the United States one. The new Constitution goes further still. It establishes, indeed, a system of government which is at most quasi federal, almost devolutionary in character; a unitary State with subsidiary federal features rather than a federal State with subsidiary unitary features. That, however, is what appears on paper only. It remains to be seen whether in actual practice the federal features entrench or strengthen themselves as they have in Canada, or whether the strong trend towards centralization which is a feature of most Western governments in a world of crises, will compel these federal aspects of the Constitution to wither away. To an outside observer, however, it would seem wise on the part of the Constituent Assembly to have placed the stress on unity, for in the immediate future at any rate India needs not only a strong executive but equally, a sense of unity and direction. Therefore, the Indian Constitution may not be strictly speaking “federal.” in the sense in which the Constitution of the United States is called “federal.” it does not follow that it is any the worse for that. Federalism is not necessarily good government: it is at the most a device which may secure good government in some cases. The framers of the Indian Constitution may have done well in not following slavishly any existing federal Constitution. They have chosen rather to make use of such elements in federal Constitutions as they thought likely to be of value to them. LIBERAL CONSTITUTION Finally, the Indian Constitution is a liberal Constitution. There is something heroic these days in a people declaring publicly that they have established their government in order to secure to all its citizens justice, liberty, equality and fraternity. These words have an old-fashioned, 19th century ring about them, yet they need re-assertion these days. The British student will feel perhaps that the Constitution contains rather too much assertion of abstract rights, for like the Irish Constitution, the Indian Constitution undertakes to guarantee a wide range of rights and privileges to the people. Difficult to justify to the practical minded British observer, perhaps, is the large section embodying the “Directive Principles of State Policy. “As these principles cannot be enforced in any court they amount to little more than a manifesto of aims and aspirations. In this matter of declarations of rights and of directives of State policy, the Indian Constituent Assembly has followed the Irish Constitution and European practice rather than the less colourful and more legalistic documents which serve as Constitutions for the other members of the Commonwealth. One thing is certain. If these declarations of liberal principles, strange as they may seem in a legal document to British eyes, help the Indian Constitution on its way and assist its people in working their government, they are more than justified. This is the biggest liberal experiment in the government of men by themselves that has ever been tried. We will wish it all success.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-jan-26-1950-biggest-liberal-experiment-in-democratic-govt-101642787079052.html
