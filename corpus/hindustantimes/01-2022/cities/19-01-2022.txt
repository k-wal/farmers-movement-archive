The Covid facility, which was established to help the state government combat corona cases, was later put on standby mode after the Covid cases began to decline. Besides, another 250-bed Covid facility established by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) is also likely to become functional soon. The decision is part of the state government’s anti-Covid 19 exercise that it is carrying out, anticipating rise in Covid cases. “With all mock drills done, we are ready and waiting for the state government’s nod. The hospital is currently on standby mode,” said nodal officer for DRDO hospital AP Singh. The DRDO’s 450 bedded-Covid facility was the initiative of defence minister Rajnath Singh. The facility was the most sought after Covid hospital that was inaugurated by chief minister Yogi Adityanath on May 5, 2021.The hospital is equipped with 150 ICU beds with 24-hours oxygen supply. “Back then, The Indian Armed Forces had deployed 30 medical specialists, 28 medical officers, six officers for administrative support, 51 nursing officers, 110 nursing assistants/technicians and 79 support staff to run the hospital,” said a senior official posted with the hospital. Similarly, the makeshift 250-bed hospital set up by the HAL is likely to re-start soon. Of the total beds, 150 would be ICU beds of L3 category.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/drdo-covid-facility-in-lucknow-set-to-start-again-101642616243755.html

Responding to the accusation of the four party leaders that he interfered in their constituencies, Rana Gurjeet said he is thankful to them for acknowledging his clout in their assembly segments. “This really means that they themselves lack something, so their constituents are influenced by me and not them,” he said. Three MLAs Navtej Singh Cheema (Sultanpur Lodhi), Balwinder Singh Dhaliwal (Phagwara) and Avtar Singh Junior (Jalandhar North) and former Bholath MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira had on Tuesday written to Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi to demand the minister’s expulsion from the party. This is after the latter’s son announced that he will contest as an independent candidate from Sultanpur Lodhi. The cabinet minister said that if they can get him expelled from Congress president Sonia Gandhi, he will sit at home like a true soldier of the party, and not jump ship to another party like Khaira who went party-hopping before joining back five years later. “If she does not throw me out, will they leave the party?” he said, challenging them to come to Kapurthala for campaigning to try and defeat him. The infighting in Doaba has been going on for some time; it escalated after some of the local MLAs joined hands to oppose Rana Gurjeet’s re-induction into the state cabinet four months ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cong-doaba-infighting-get-me-expelled-or-leave-party-rana-gurjeet-to-detractors-101642615943079.html
19-01-2022||Pune||Covid epidemiological curve to depend on population density, vaccination: state official||Pune: As per the state health department report, only five out of the 36 districts in the state report a higher than state average weekly positivity rate. These districts include Pune, Akola, Nashik, Raigad and Thane with 29.4%. The state has reported a positivity rate of 22.9%. Despite Mumbai reporting the highest number of Covid cases in the week between January 10 and January 16 — more than 88,000 new cases of the 0.3 million cases reported in the state — Pune has reported about 64,000 and Thane 53,000. State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said that sudden rise and fall in Covid cases reported in Mumbai might not be applicable to all the districts in the state. He said, “The positivity rate of a district informs what percentage of the population which has been tested is infected. In the first wave, the average state positivity peaked at 24.86% which then in the second wave peaked at 26% and then in the third wave peaked at 32% which means that three out of every 10 people tested will report to be positive and then the curve will begin to decline. We have seen in Mumbai that the positivity rate peaked at around 35%-36% and it is declining now. Multiple factors have to be considered like Omicron is the most transmissible variant, breakthrough infections, herd immunity and others.” On underreporting of coronavirus cases, Awate said the administration has appealed to the people to voluntarily upload their Covid-19 reports on the website so that the local health authorities can help them in case of any need. “We have also asked chemists to keep a record of all the home test kits which they have sold by noting down the details of purchaser,” he said. Awate said, “We have to also remember that after two Covid waves, the uninfected population is very low. The epidemiological curve will depend on multiple local factors like population density and vaccination. If a region has seen a much milder second or first wave then it is likely that the virus may linger on for a while before it starts declining which we saw in the second wave and previous waves when Kolhapur and Sangli saw a much slow decline. Multiple factors will influence the epidemiological curves in the areas.” In the past one week between January 10 January and January 16, the state reported a weekly average positivity rate of 22.9% as the state reported over 1,345,494 cases of the 308,376 samples that were tested. The highest positivity rate was reported from Nashik with about 35.4% followed by Pune (34.2%) with about 64,807 new cases. This is as high as the city reported during the second wave peak. Thane reported a positivity rate of 29.4%, Raigad 28.3% and Akola 27.7%. Mumbai which saw a drastic surge in new Covid cases in the past two weeks has reported a drop in the positivity rate of lower than the state average at 21.8% as 407,123 samples were tested of which 88,610 positive cases were reported. The above districts are reporting a drastic surge in active cases, however, the number of mortalities is not surging much as of yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-epidemiological-curve-to-depend-on-population-density-vaccination-state-official-101642615822925.html
19-01-2022||Pune||Covid surge: Flight count drops by half, passenger traffic hit at Pune airport||Pune: The reported rise in Covid cases in the state has seen a drastic fall in air traffic at Pune airport in the last one month. The daily operation of 76 flights on January 3 has dropped to 37 as on January 19. While airline companies have either cancelled or reduced their flights by half, passenger footfall has dropped from 20,000 plus in December last year to below 10,000 in January 2022. Airlines authorities said that many passengers have cancelled their trips after testing Covid positive. “The load factor of airline companies has reduced. Around 15 days prior, our arrival and departure passenger count was around 8,000 each. And the number had touched 18,000-20,000 last month, before dropping to 3,500 passengers each for arrival and departure. People are avoiding travel as a precautionary measure with reported rise in coronavirus cases,” said Santosh Doke, Pune airport director. “Airlines cancel a flight if it gets only 10-15 confirmed passengers and try to club it with other flights on the same routes. For example, if there are four flights from Delhi to Pune after one hour interval then passengers of these four flights are clubbed into one or else it incurs huge expenditure,” he said. While the winter schedule (October-March) is usually booked across the country with heavy air traffic, cases of Omicron variant of Covid reported since last month has left passengers to rethink their travel plans. “I had booked a ticket for January 12 to travel to Delhi for some work, but as Covid cases were on rise I cancelled the ticket. We don’t want to take any risk and many restrictions are also in place,” said Shilpa Gandhi, a chartered accountant. Another city-based businessman Atul Khode said, “We had a business conference organised at Chennai for last weekend and our group of 10 people was supposed to travel. Only two attended the conference and the rest cancelled with plans to hold another at a later date.” Covid surge sees drop in flights Daily flight operations and passenger count at Pune airport January 1, 2022 Flight operations: 52 Arrived passengers: 7,089 Departed passengers: 6,167 January 2, 2022 Flight operations: 70 Arrived passengers: 10,764 Departed passengers: 9,413 January 4, 2022 Flight operations: 66 Arrived passengers: 8,409 Departed passengers: 7,380 January 5, 2022 Flight operations: 68 Arrived passengers: 7,380 Departed passengers: 7,169 January 8, 2022 Flight operations: 53 Arrived passengers: 6,044 Departed passengers: 6,466 January 9, 2022 Flight operations: 61 Arrived passengers: 7,085 Departed passengers: 7,502 January 11, 2022 Flight operations: 48 Arrived passengers: 4,609 Departed passengers: 5,280 January 12, 2022 Flight operations: 45 Arrived passengers: 4,756 Departed passengers: 5,040 January 13, 2022 Flight operations: 50 Arrived passengers: 4,542 Departed passengers: 5,358 January 14, 2022 Flight operations: 51 Arrived passengers: 4,085 Departed passengers: 4,762 January 16, 2022 Flight operations: 50 Arrived passengers: 5,206 Departed passengers: 5,587 January 17, 2022 Flight operations: 46 Arrived passengers: 4,369 Departed passengers: 4,536||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-surge-flight-count-drops-by-half-passenger-traffic-hit-at-pune-airport-101642615645126.html
19-01-2022||Pune||State government mulls establishment of an online university||PUNE Maharashtra state government is mulling to establish an ‘Online university’. The department of Higher and Technical Education has appointed a committee to prepare a report on the feasibility of such a university, its administrative structure, required resources, courses to be taught, and functioning of such universities abroad and in other Indian states. According to the government resolution issued by the administration, the idea behind such an online university is to facilitate higher education for the students who live in remote areas or far away from their education institutions in this pandemic era. The ten-member committee consists of several senior higher education experts. RK Shevgaonkar former vice-chancellor of Savitribai Phule Pune University has been appointed as the chairman of this committee. Shrivarmangai Ramanujam, IT head at Mumbai University will function as a coordinator for the committee. State government has asked the committee to submit a report in six months.“Because of the Covid-19 pandemic colleges, universities in the state are teaching students through various online portals and applications. Students who live far away from their educational institutions cannot be present there regularly. Because of the online university students will not have to be physically present and they will not have to spend on accommodations, travelling.This option is viable for those students who want to take online education. It will also help to continue the uninterrupted education in this pandemic situation,” stated the government resolution issued by the Higher and Technical Education Department. The ten-member committee constituted to study and define the feasibility of such a university had been tasked to prepare a detailed and a comprehensive report within six months. The committee has been asked to study the online universities in developed countries and to form the policy based on that for Maharashtra. Also, it will have to check the legalities related to its establishment. The recommendations related to the basic facilities, Human Resource, and other equipment are expected to be included in this report. The committee will also have to finalise the eligibility criteria of the teachers, staffers to be hired by this university. With such basic and essential points the committee has been asked to prepare a comprehensive report related to the formation of such a university.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/state-government-mulls-establishment-of-an-online-university-101642614082853.html
19-01-2022||Pune||Hospital OPDs in Pune record surge in children with symptoms like fever, cold||PUNE As per the Maharashtra Education and Drugs Department (MEDD) data for the past one week, the state has reported over 32,000 new Covid-19 cases among the population aged less than 20 years. This is about 10% of the overall infected population in the week between January 11 and 19 as over 3.24 lakh people were reported infected. Although this is the same as per the last week of December, on ground city doctors say that the OPD patients among the paediatric age group has rapidly increased. Doctors also say that the most common symptom among kids is fever and cough which is usually mild.In the week between January 11 and 19 , the MEDD report states that the state saw a total of 324,867 new Covid-19 cases out of which 32,981 were reported in the age group under 20 years of age. However, the highest share of Covid-19 cases continue to be reported from the age group between 31 to 40 years of age, followed by 21 to 30 years of age and 41 to 50 years of age. The number of new cases among the senior citizens, those aged above 60 years of age is 49,590 new Covid-19 cases which in total account for 15% of the total number of cases reported. However, as anticipated earlier that the third wave might affect children the most is coming out to be true, said city doctors as the number of OPD patients in the paediatric ward complaining of symptoms like fever, cold and cough has risen drastically. Dr Pradeep Suryavanshi, city-based paediatrician said, “The number of children coming to OPD complaining of fever and cold and cough which is the most common symptoms among kids has increased drastically. We are treating all febrile kids as Covid-19 patients now. But the good thing is that in most cases the fever subsides in just 2-3 days and coughing is also treated in just a week. The numbers may not actually reflect the ground reality in the case of paediatric Covid-19 patients because we test most kids only if the fever stays for more than two days and most parents get the kids tested through the rapid antigen tests which may go unreported. The good thing is that the number of admissions among paediatric Covid-19 patients is very low unless the fever is high grade or if the kids report convulsions.”Another paediatrician from the city, Dr Sagar Lad however suggests that it is better to get the child tested as it helps in isolating the kids at an earlier stage. Dr Lad said, “Despite no vaccination, the rate of hospitalisation if infected with Covid19 remains nominal. Admissions take place only in case of high fever, above 102-103 degrees, and the child develops convulsions. However there is a hesitancy among parents to get their children tested for Covid-19. The common presentations which were not present last time include shivering, headache, cough and runny nose. Most cases are reported in the age group less than five and those aged between 10-11 years of age.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/hospital-opds-in-pune-record-surge-in-children-with-symptoms-like-fever-cold-101642613783036.html
19-01-2022||Pune||Yerawada jail officials seek for more space as Covid cases rise||PUNE: The Yerawada prison authorities seek new space for a temporary prison or isolation facility to accommodate the rising number of new inmate admissions who are testing Covid positive. As on Tuesday (January 18) night, the number of virus infected patients in the prison was 85, highest among patients in state prisons, according to prison statistics. The infected are held at the temporary prison facility in a hostel for Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes by Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Research and Training Institute (Barti). Along with the inmates, four jail officials of Yerawada and three officials working in the additional director general of police and inspector general of police of state prison department located in Pune have also tested positive. “We have three buildings occupied right now. One has water connection issue so cannot be used. One of the three is a Covid centre, one is for men, and another for women. Almost all prisoners coming from outside are positive and prisoners who are taken for court hearings or medical reasons also contract the virus,” said Rani Bhosale, superintendent of Yerawada Central Jail. The new admissions are tested and kept in isolation before being let into the main jail. The hospital and Covid centre are filled to their strength with patients, according to prison officials. “Sassoon General Hospital does not admit asymptomatic patients, so it is not an option for us. The capacity of temporary prison is around 400, but there are new admissions every single day,” said Bhosale. According to an official of the prison department, the daily admission to the temporary prison scales to around 80 every day. The jail officials are requesting the district authority to let them use the Sant Dnyaneshwar quarantine centre located at a hostel in Vishrantwadi, according to Bhosale. The facility will ease pressure on the temporary jail. However, the security at both the places is of concern. The city police have been given the responsibility of securing the temporary jails as per the original order of the district collector. There have been multiple incidents of undertrials escaping the temporary facility since its inception in 2020. To get a new space, the prison department will require security support from the city police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/yerawada-jail-officials-seek-for-more-space-as-covid-cases-rise-101642613485779.html

19-01-2022||Mumbai||Is third Covid-19 wave ebbing in Mumbai? Here’s what experts say||Mumbai The city has reported under 10,000 Covid-19 cases each day for the last four days, marking the flattening of the third wave that began on December 21, civic authorities said on Wednesday. Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has, however, said that it is too early to declare that Mumbai is now in the safe zone. The authorities have termed the forthcoming week as a ‘wait and watch’ period. Experts have also maintained that the decline in fresh cases is a good sign, but citizens must remain alert and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour.On Wednesday, Mumbai reported 6,032 Covid-19 cases, taking the caseload to 1,017,347. The city also recorded 3 deaths, pushing the death toll to 16,488. The positivity rate in the city dropped to 10 percent on Wednesday, after hovering around 13 percent over the past three days. Mumbai tested 60,291 samples on Wednesday, much higher than the daily average of 47,000 over the past four days.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in charge of BMC’s public health department, said, “The figures are declining by the day, and this is a very good sign for Mumbai. However, this is not the time to let our guards down. Citizens must continue to maintain Covid-19-appropriate behaviour, and mask up in public. We will monitor the situation closely for one more week.”At the peak of the third wave, Mumbai had a positivity rate of around 28 percent. On January 7, when Mumbai reported its highest-ever single-day spike of 20,971 cases, it had a positivity rate of 28.9 percent.Experts said that Mumbai is now in the safe zone with cases receding but it is too early to take a call on easing of restrictions in the city.Dr Harish Chafle, senior consultant (pulmonology and critical care) Global Hospital, said, “It is a good thing that fresh cases are coming down constantly. If this continues, we will be in a good position by the end of the week. However, we should not be in a hurry to ease restrictions and let our guards down.”Similarly, Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state’s Covid-19 task force, said, “The numbers are very encouraging but we need to wait and watch. We should not hurry in concluding that Mumbai is in the safe zone. The end of the week should give us a clearer picture.”Out of the 6,032 cases reported on Wednesday, 84 percent or 5,067 patients were asymptomatic; 538 patients needed to be hospitalised, out of which 103 needed oxygen beds.Bed occupancy across covid hospitals in the city at present is at 12.3 percent, with 5,058 beds out of the total 38,109 beds occupied as of Wednesday. As many as 18,241 patients recovered from covid-19 on Wednesday, according to the civic body.Dr Sonam Solanki, consultant pulmonologist and bronchoscopist from Masina hospital, said that this is a crucial period for the city, even though Covid-19 cases are declining.“If you compare to where we were in the first week of January, we are in a better place. This looks like we are flattening the curve. But we have seen it in the past where it takes hardly 4-5 days for numbers to rise. We are not yet at the end of the third wave, and any super spreader public event can give us a spike in cases very easily. Smaller spikes in cases are likely over the next few days,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/is-third-covid-19-wave-ebbing-in-mumbai-here-s-what-experts-say-101642612287046.html

Going ahead, the city plans to build wider footpaths and install street furniture at different locations, said officials.Pimpri-Chinchwad was hailed as the walking and cycling champion for reclaiming space from carriageway for segregated cycle lanes and footpaths. The city worked closely with their street design consultants to further their city-wide Harit Setu Masterplan, connecting green spaces across the city.Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “For the past many years we are taking efforts to make roads pedestrian friendly. It has now been appreciated at the national level and other cities in Maharashtra are following Pune’s road construction plan. We are planning to extend these schemes on various roads in the city and improve it by considering local needs.”“Recently, PMC celebrated pedestrian day which is an innovative concept. Even other cities are trying to celebrate pedestrain day after Pune. As the central government has appreciated our work, it proves that we are going in the right direction. Pune has given direction to the nation in various social and political movement, now iit has taken a lead in urban planning as well,” added Mohol.In a competition that was open to 113 smart cities, 38 cities piloted re-imagination of an important street each by prioritising them for pedestrians.

19-01-2022||Mumbai||Six forts in Mumbai to be turned into tourist spots, venue for cultural events||Mumbai: Six medieval and British era forts in Mumbai will soon be developed as tourist spots, venues for cultural events and a numismatic museum by the state government.This project will cover the forts in Bandra, Worli, Shivdi, Mahim, Dharavi, and Saint George. “The forts will be developed as sites where cultural and other events can be held. This will generate resources for their conservation, make the project financially self-sustaining, and develop these sites as cultural venues,” said Tejas Garge, director, Museums and Archaeology, government of Maharashtra, adding that a final proposal for the same would be sent to the government soon.The forts will get a sound-and-light show detailing the history of Mumbai, which can be accessed using a mobile app to prevent any noise pollution in the vicinity. An architect has been appointed to draw up a plan for the conservation and protection of these forts and the development of a fort circuit. Garge added that the project was being driven by the departments of tourism and culture after a meeting between Aaditya Thackeray, tourism minister and the guardian minister for the Mumbai suburban district, and cultural affairs minister Amit Deshmukh.Last week, Deshmukh convened a meeting where it was directed that apart from government funding, options like corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds and similar collaborations be explored for works other than those related to conservation. Committees under the district collectors of Mumbai city, and the suburban district will monitor works other than those related to archaeological conservation.The Sewri fort, which was originally constructed by the Portuguese on the island of Sewri, and later strengthened by the British to protect the eastern sea-front, will see spaces being developed in its halls for exhibitions, live events and cultural programmes. Similarly, the Worli fort will see the wall being strengthened, a stage being built for events and the existing jetty will be strengthened for those visiting the site by sea. The Dharavi fort or Kala Killa, which too dates to the colonial era, and marked the northern end of the British dominion of Mumbai, can be integrated with the slum tourism circuits that cover Asia’s largest slum-turned-industrial powerhouse.The Saint George Fort was built by the British, but was dismantled later with the fort of Bombay, after the threat to the British from the Marathas and Napoleon subsided. Today, parts of the gunpowder magazine survive and house the office of the directorate of museums and archaeology. The directorate plans to conserve and strengthen the site and also develop a numismatic museum, which will house its coin collection, noted Garge.The Bandra fort will get an information centre, security, and restoration of some portions of the original fort. At Mahim, which is alternatively believed to be the fort and capital of king Bimba, who ruled over Mumbai in the 13th century, from Mahikavati or present-day Mahim or a structure dating to the Gujarat sultanate era, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will shift the around 600 shanties in and around the site. Garge added that the project would cost around ₹50 crore, including the rehabilitation of the Mahim fort shanties.Bharat Gothoskar, founder of the heritage and experimental tourism initiative ‘Khaki Tours,’ said though some forts in South Mumbai like the Bombay Fort and the Dongri fort had been lost, seven others survived. The Bombay Castle was now an Indian Navy establishment and hence, out of bounds for citizens, and the Dharavi fort has slums on all sides.“However, the five other forts have huge tourism potential,” said Gothoskar, adding that while the Worli fort could be used for water sports, the ones at Bandra and Worli could be developed for entertainment, music and sound and light shows. The Sion fort, which is under the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), can be a rock climbing and young adults’ activity site, while a children’s activity-cum-nature centre can be developed in the Shivdi fort. In addition, the two small watchtowers at Sion and Wadala can be conserved and added to the circuit, with these forts being linked with a bus service.HighlightThe project will cover forts in Bandra, Worli, Shivdi, Mahim, Dharavi, and Saint George.These will be developed as tourism and activity centres.Tourist infrastructure will be developed with lighting, light and sound shows.A numismatic museum at Saint George fort behind CSMT station will house an enviable collection of coins.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/six-forts-in-mumbai-to-be-turned-into-tourist-spots-venue-for-cultural-events-101642611562695.html
19-01-2022||Lucknow||41 convicted of human trafficking in Prayagraj||The sessions court has convicted as many as 41 persons, who were found to be involved in the flesh trade and human trafficking. The accused were arrested from a brothel located in Meerganj area of Prayagraj district.The additional sessions judge (ASJ), who passed the order of conviction, will pronounce the sentence on January 25, 2022.The ASJ convicted these persons on the basis of facts and evidence available against the accused persons.Allegations against the convicts were that taking advantage of poverty and other compulsions of the girl children, they used to entice them away from their native places. Thereafter, they used to sell the girls in the red light area of Meerganj, where they were ultimately forced to join the flesh trade.Earlier in 2016, some social organisations and activists had filed public interest litigation (PIL) before the high court, which directed the authorities concerned to take appropriate steps to stop the illegal flesh trade and human trafficking going on in the heart of the city.Acting on the direction of the high court, the police launched a massive ‘operation freedom’ on Labour Day on May 1, 2016, to cleanse the Meerganj area. As a result, several girls, many of whom were minors, were rescued from the brothel.During the operation, as many as 48 persons were arrested, and a criminal case was registered against them. After the conclusion of the trial, the court, in its decision dated January 18, convicted as many as 41 accused persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/41-convicted-of-human-trafficking-in-prayagraj-101642611442715.html
19-01-2022||Lucknow||UP assembly polls: Samajwadi Chatra Sabha discusses modalities for door-to-door campaign||The national committee of Samajwadi Chatra Sabha met on Wednesday to apprise its office bearers of the COVID protocols to be followed during campaigning in the upcoming UP assembly polls, said Neha Yadav, national president of the chatra sabha.“The office-bearers of the committee were made aware of the COVID protocols to be followed during campaigning. Thereafter, the members were trained for the groundwork during the upcoming assembly elections. The main focus was on strengthening every booth by the committee,” Neha said.She appealed to all the office bearers to inform the voters about the schemes and manifesto of the Samajwadi Party through a door-to-door campaign and make an appeal to vote for the party.Office bearers were asked to spread the message of various welfare schemes rolled out by former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav during his regime from 2012-2017.“Also, everyone was made aware of BJP’s false propaganda style to befool common people,” she added.Among the attendees were Mohd Fahad, national president, Samajwadi Yuvjan Sabha, Vikas Yadav, ex-national president, Samajwadi Yuvjan Sabha, Sarvesh Yadav, national vice-president and others, said Arpit Sachan, national spokesperson of the student wing of the Samajwadi Party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-assembly-polls-samajwadi-chatra-sabha-discusses-modalities-for-door-to-door-campaign-101642610902838.html
19-01-2022||Lucknow||Poll campaign in Uttar Pradesh set for tech-tonic shift||The major political parties in Uttar Pradesh are bracing themselves up for the real challenge of a virtual campaign in the seven-phase state assembly elections.Among them, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) seems all primed for the information technology. The party leaders have been all smiles since the election commission announced that the poll campaign would be either door-to-door or virtual. To be sure, other parties are also trying to get their act together for a digital connect with the voters while being keenly aware of the need for virtual campaigns, probably separate ones for urban and remote rural areas as reaching out to people in villages may be far more difficult than doing so in the urban areas.This need arises as the election commission (EC) has urged all political parties and candidates to use digital/virtual media platforms, banning any physical rallies at least up to January 15, 2022 for now in view of Covid-19 concerns.As for the BJP, its smiles aren’t without reason. It was in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections that the party had first unveiled its then PM face Narendra Modi’s virtual avatar by holding 3D rallies. Those were political events in which Modi would appear simultaneously at different places to address rallies. “I think as of now, this 3D version is ruled out because till January 15, all political events that violate social distancing are banned by the election commission. So as of now, our campaigns would largely be amplified through WhatsApp groups, social media pages,” a party leader said. The BJP’s 24-member election panel for UP that includes chief minister Yogi Adityanath is mulling over ways to expand its reach to the people in villages and a door-to-door campaign will be rolled out from Tuesday. But party leaders also admit that since the first wave of Covid itself, the party had begun providing muscle to its plan for virtual rallies and campaign. “Virtual rallies are being talked about now, but few remember that during the Covid-19 second wave itself, three of our party leaders, including party chief JP Nadda, Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar and Smriti Irani, had addressed virtual rallies,” said UP BJP’s social media head Ankit Singh Chandel. “We have about 10,000 social media functionaries itself. The number of cadres with the social media and IT cells, which previously worked as one, but now are separate entities this time. During the Covid peak, as part of our ‘seva hi sangthan campaign’ we had used digital connectivity to connect with the cadre,” Chandel said, adding that the technology that the party has in place would be used to adhere to EC’s directives too during UP polls. The party has already held around 18 training sessions for its social media teams so far. So, what would a typical virtual rally be like? Picture this. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose proposed January 9 rally in Lucknow couldn’t take place due to a fresh rise in Covid cases, begins addressing a virtual rally from Delhi. At the same time, the party’s 150 odd Facebook pages and its Twitter handle start beaming the PM’s virtual outreach, which is further amplified through an estimated about 2 lakh plus WhatsApp groups that are reportedly active. “I am a member of a WhatsApp group and surely, as soon as the BJP social media teams provide me the link to the PM’s virtual rally, I would share it with all 256 people who are on my list. They will pass it on to others. So, in fact all those who have a smartphone, and these days most have one, would have instant access to the rally live. This is besides the live beaming of rallies on Doordarshan or several news channels,” a BJP member, who is part of these WhatsApp groups, explained. Such BJP karyakartas (workers) spread across the state are actively involved in what one of them described as “content monitoring and dissemination.” The BJP has little over 27,000 shakti kendras (booth clusters) in UP and the cadres of all these booths. There are an estimated 1.74 lakh booths where the BJP has presence. Each booth has at least 8 to 10 people, mostly youths. Plus, the party has created a team of about two lakh health workers, mostly in the rural areas.“These people, mostly connected with us or drawn to our party because of leadership and policies, have been trained to remain connected with the people through their respective booths or shakti kendras. All of them have a smartphone. So even in case someone has missed catching a top leader live, we can always play it back for him or send important clips to him,” said a BJP booth level cadre based out of Gonda in eastern UP.“All ministers, party functionaries and others who have an impressive list of followers, too, would host the rallies on their social media handles,” a party leader said.“During door-to-door campaigns too, the party would connect with the masses, sharing codes and links ahead of an important rally,” another party leader said. “It is not just about rallies alone. Rallies are just one way. For target messaging and to counter negative publicity, exposing the opposition through previous videos or clips or statements, too, are there,” another leader said.In October, union home minister Amit Shah had launched the party’s membership campaign through which the party sought to add 1.5 crore new members in addition to its existing 2.5 crore cadres. “Now, these four crore (40 million) people who are our party members all have a smartphone. Naturally, being connected to us, they will all have access to at least one basic WhatsApp party group about party programmes, rallies or campaigns. That would mean at least four crore BJP karyakartas automatically become our social media campaigners. So, our virtual programmes would definitely have more reach than ever before. Since no other party has as many active volunteers and karyakartas, we have an edge,” a BJP leader said. The Opposition, too, says it is ready. Samajwadi Party’s social media national coordinator Manish Jagan Agarwal said, “We are ready. The BJP has its information technology cell that is known to be having large number of computers, teams of workers and social trollers. The Samajwadi Party, however, has a dedicated team of workers to run the SP’s campaigns and counter the BJP’s propaganda on their personal social media accounts. Our job will be to counter their campaign based on lies.”A few hours before the ECI announced a ban on physical rallies, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was having a virtual connect with the people on Facebook Live on Saturday (January 8).“Following directives from Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, the party has been fighting for the cause of common man on various issues. About 18,000 Congress workers were sent to jail while fighting for the cause of people and partymen worked to distribute relief. The Congress has connected with 30 million people through 1,50,000 WhatsApp groups. An additional number of 40,000 to 50,000 people have been added as Congress members in every constituency through digital campaigns. The Congress organised more than 1800 training camps to train over 0.2 million workers for campaigning on social media. These workers have been trained to work at booth levels. We are going to deploy 4000 LED vans and this will mean 10 LED vans in every assembly constituency,” said Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee’s digital media incharge Anshu Awasthi.According to a report of TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) published in 2020, Uttar Pradesh has a tele-density of only 67.8%. This includes tele-density of 48.12% in the rural areas and 131.70% in the urban areas. A considerable number of vendors are already offering LED walls on rent for the polls. It is probably keeping in view this aspect that the EC has decided to increase the election expenditure limit from ₹28 lakh to ₹40 lakh in the state.As smaller groups of workers may be allowed for door-to-door campaigns, face mask printed with logo or election symbol of the political parties along with a kit carrying sanitisers may be among various options for no-contact campaigns. Vendors are already marketing such products online, emphasising how distribution of these items among workers can be effective for promotion of political parties during the pandemic. Besides asking the political parties to get ready for virtual campaigns, ECI has asked the official machinery, political parties and voters for Covid appropriate behaviour.“It is expected that all stakeholders namely political parties, candidates, campaigners, voters and authorities engaged in the election process shall be conscious of their prime duty towards public health, safety and therefore shall abide by general instructions and norms of Covid appropriate behaviour as mandated by the respective authorities prescribed,” said EC, adding, “In view of Covid concerns polling time has been increased by one hour…”“The commission has decided to double free equitable time allotted to recognized political parties on Doordarshan and AIR during these elections.”“Yes, political parties face a major challenge of reaching out to voters at this point of time. This is not the time for holding elections. If there is a peak, as predicted by medical expert next month, the voters will not turn up,” said Professor SK Dwivedi, former head of the department of political science, Lucknow University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/poll-campaign-in-uttar-pradesh-set-for-tech-tonic-shift-101642610362833.html

The incident happened on the CST Mumbai – Chennai (train no. 22157) special express train, which stopped at the Loni railway station in Pune division at around 2am on Tuesday. After the birth of the baby, the woman along with her family members continued on the 22-hout journey to Chennai, refusing to disembark and go to hospital.“A medical team was kept ready at Loni railway station to take the woman to a nearby hospital, but before they would reach the station the normal delivery of a baby girl happened inside the train,” said Manoj Jhawar, Pune railway division spokesperson. The pregnant woman was traveling along with her husband and sister from Mumbai to Perambur railway station in Chennai. They were traveling in sleeper coach of S8 coach no. when the incident happened. “As the woman started having pain in the stomach she immediately informed her husband and they rushed to the train staff for help,” said Jhawar.On board ticket checker Shailesh Kumar informed to the control room and a team of doctors and medical staff along with an ambulance was rushed to Loni station before the train’s arrival. “Doctors checked both the woman and baby and provided them necessary medications in the train itself. The woman and her family insisted on traveling further in the same train and gave a written undertaking to the Railways, who had no choice but to let them do so,” added Jhawar. Dr Avinash Bhondwe said, “There are many such incidents of deliveries happened in running trains, cars or buses in the past. And if the delivery was normal and woman’s consent was given to travel further after a medical checkup no one can stop them. At the same time we should consider the current weather conditions, and more importantly health of the baby. It would have been better if baby and woman didn’t travel further.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/woman-refuses-to-break-22-hr-journey-after-giving-birth-on-train-at-loni-station-101642610182567.html
19-01-2022||Other||No concrete steps taken to resolve sacrilege issue: Justice (retd) Ranjit||Chandigarh With the sacrilege incidents of 2015 and the subsequent events playing an important role in the state’s political history, a book ‘The Sacrilege’, written by Justice (retd) Ranjit Singh, was launched on Wednesday. Justice (retd) Ranjit headed the one-man commission formed to submit a report on the series of sacrilege incidents of holy manuscripts, including the Guru Granth Sahib, of 2015. In the 400-page book with 14 chapters, he has presented the events in a chronological narration. On assuming charge as Punjab chief minister (CM) in 2017, Captain Amarinder Singh had constituted the commission. Justice (retd) Ranjit also documents the events before and after the sacrilege incidents, terming it as a failure of the government machinery. Justice (retd) SS Sodhi launched the book with retired justices Nawab Singh and Mahesh Grover also in attendance. In his report on sacrilege submitted to the Punjab government in 2018, he had pinned the blame on former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal and ex-DGP Sumedh Singh Saini for their mishandling of the issue. The Badals, however, consistently rejected the findings as ‘politically motivated’ and refused to take part in the proceedings, under protest. Referring to police firing on protesters, who were seeking action in sacrilege cases in Kotkapura, Justice (retd) Ranjit, on Wednesday, again blamed the then CM and the then DGP. On the timing of the release, just ahead of the state polls he said, “It’s a coincidence.” On the role of the Punjab and Haryana high court into the matter, he said, “Its interference was more than extraordinary.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-concrete-steps-taken-to-resolve-sacrilege-issue-justice-retd-ranjit-101642610062507.html

19-01-2022||Pune||Baner abduction case: CCTVs in area fail to deliver footage to cops; most not functional||PUNE For nine days, a team of Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad police were desperately trying to trace the whereabouts of a 4-year-old boy allegedly abducted by an unidentified two-wheeler-borne man. One of the clues probe officials were looking at was to gather footage through the network of over 400 CCTV cameras installed by the civic body under Smart City mission across the city. However, most CCTV of the cameras are non-operational. According to police officials, they could gather footage from only one CCTV near Baner, where the alleged kidnapper is seen riding the two-wheeler with the child. The alleged kidnapper is then caught on another camera when he dropped the child off at Punavle.“In some CCTV cameras, there was no footage available as they were non-functional, while at some locations cameras were not installed,” said a senior officer from the Pune police. According to the officer, many private establishments had CCTV cameras working. “When it came to shops cameras were pointed towards their entrance not towards the streets,” the officer quoted above said. Local residents said Smart City has failed to deliver on its promise to keep the city safe. The local police probing the kidnapping case also tried to scan through CCTVs installed by private establishments including housing societies. They had limited success as only a few CCTVs – one near his residence and another at Chikhali - captured the image of the kidnapper. “The installation is still ongoing and has not been handed over to Smart City. It may not be true to say that all CCTV cameras don’t work, as we were informed almost 70% of them are working. The last survey after installation was seven months ago,” said Anirudha Shahapure, chief knowledge officer, PSCDCL. According to Shahapure, Smart City had awarded the tenders of 400 CCTV cameras to be installed in Aundh, Baner and Balewadi to a private firm at the end of 2019. “However immediately after that Covid-19 hit us and we were in lockdown, even though infrastructure was put in place. We are investigating with the firm as to why not all CCTVs are operational.” A major project of offering extra protection under Smart City was worked upon between PSCDCL, PMC and the Pune Police, where each location in the Aund, Baner Balewadi area was surveyed. It seems CCTV cameras placed in the area don’t really work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/baner-abduction-case-cctvs-in-area-fail-to-deliver-footage-to-cops-most-not-functional-101642610002412.html

In order to roll out the scheme on Republic Day from Dumka, chief minister Hemant Soren also launched CMSUPPORTS App for registration and verification of all beneficiaries under the scheme. “All beneficiaries registered under the national food security Act and the state food security Act who have an on-road two wheeler would be eligible for ₹250 as petrol subsidy every month. The money would be transferred through DBT in their bank account. The scheme is estimated to cost the state government ₹901.86 crore annually. A provision of ₹100.49 crore has been made for the remaining months of the current financial year 2021-22,” said cabinet secretary Vandana Dadel. Though the exact number of beneficiaries are yet to be ascertained, there are around 59 lakh beneficiaries under the NFSA in the state. The petrol subsidy scheme would be rolled by chief minister from Dumka on January 26. To avail the scheme, beneficiaries ought to be a ration card holder of the state and their card needs to be linked with Aadhar. “The bank account of the applicant should be linked with Aadhar and updated mobile number. The two-wheeler should be registered in name of the applicant. The vehicle needs to be registered in Jharkhand and the applicant should have a driving licence,” an official said. The applicant would have to feed in his/her ration card and Aadhar details on the app, which would further function on an OTP-based system for further verifications. “While the office of district supply officer would verify ration card details, the district transport department would very the vehicle registration authenticity.

The man apparently went dormant for around four years and become active again when he placed fake bombs in Naini, Meja and Manda area during the last one week, SP trans-Yamuna Saurabh Dixit said.Dixit said the person leaves a letter in poor English with each fake bomb.While most of the fake bombs were placed at railway stations, railway under bridges or foot over bridge in Meja and Karchhana in one such incident the device was found near a temple in Khiri area. Police had rounded up some suspects for questioning but none of them were found involved. Police took a sigh of relief after such incidents stopped all of a sudden following which the search was called off.But the man became active once again in the last one week during which he placed fake bombs under railway underpass resulting in delay of trains on the concerned routes. The person makes fake bombs using bottles, plastic boxes, wires, red tapes, clocks and has even used wooden sticks and even a corn. Police said in the letter the man issues threats to railway officials and demands hefty cash. However, in two letters found in Naini and Minto Park, he had also issued threats to authorities of ALSTOM company in Naini area and demanded large amounts from them.Based on the letters, police suspect that the person may be related to railways and ALSTOM company in some or the other way and has some old grudge with the authorities there. Dixit said a list of suspects has been prepared and they were being questioned. Ruling out possibility of the culprit’s alignment with any organisation or any particular ideology, Dixit said the man might be suffering from some kind of mental disorder. “Police teams are working continuously to identify the man and are taking help of surveillance and available CCTV footages. Once caught, strict action will be ensured against him,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/prayarajs-elusive-serial-fake-bomb-planter-gets-active-again-101642609763637.html

The child was found unhurt, albeit covered in dirt, officials said. Svarnav Chavan, son of a doctor couple, Satish and Prachi Chavan, was with his 12-year-old close relative, around 9:45am on January 11 when he was believed to have been kidnapped. The older child was walking the younger one to a daycare from their house in Ram Indu Park, Baner, when it happened. The parents had left for work at their private practice. “We have found the child. And now the investigation is on to look for the kidnapper. We will continue this investigation till this man is found. Until then, we cannot reveal any more details,” said Amitabh Gupta, commissioner of police, Pune. Senior police officers including Ravindra Shisve, joint commissioner of police, Pune, visited the child at his house in Baner on Wednesday evening. After the boy went missing, social media platforms were flooded with posts praying for his safe return. He was later taken to paediatric doctor for a medical check-up. The return of the boy was as dramatic as his abduction. “The kidnapper gave the child to a group of labourers in Punavale under the water tank near Lotus Business School. He told them that he will return in 10 minutes, but did not. The child started crying and the labourers checked his bag. They found his father’s number in the bag and called him,” said Rohidas Pawar, deputy commissioner of police, Zone 4 of Pune police. The police are now on the lookout for the two-wheeler rider who dropped the child near the water tank. The same person is believed to be the kidnapper. A police team has been posted at the house of the child to keep a watch on him. “I thank the police department, commissioner, joint commissioner, additional commissioner, and deputy commissioner of crime and other for co-operating with us. I thank everyone who helped and prayed directly and indirectly. The police worked tirelessly even though a number of them had tested Covid-19 positive. There have been days when police officials have taken saline, recovered and immediately come back to work,” said the child’s uncle, who asked to remain anonymous. The parents and relatives of the child spread the information with regular updates on various social media platforms looking for their child. “The man (kidnapper) was standing outside our building when we came out of the building. He had opened the storage of the two-wheeler (suspected to be a dark-coloured Honda Activa) and was looking inside. We walked to the end of the lane near the garden (PMC’s Sopandada Saykar garden) where I saw them waiting again. He asked me to check if there was a puncture in the back tyre. As I bent slightly to look at the rear tyre, he grabbed Svarnav and started moving. I tried to catch on to him but they dragged me with the vehicle for some distance. I ran behind them but they were gone,” the 12-year-old relative, who was accompanying Svarnav said while narrating the incident to the police. The man was believed to be on a charcoal, black, or blue coloured Activa on which they passed from the gate of the Paathshala daycare and then from the gate of Baner-Balewadi police outpost office, before fleeing. Their movements were caught on CCTV cameras. The police have formed multiple teams of hundreds of police officials. “This happened at a long distance away from the school. He was a quiet child who had become comfortable with the children in the daycare. Either his parents would drop him in a car or the other child would walk him to the daycare. Our caretaker had opened the gate for another child to come in when she saw the old child running,” said Aboli Ruikar, owner of the daycare. The police have registered a case under Sections 363 (kidnapping) and 364(a) (kidnapping or abduction for ransom) of the Indian Penal Code at Chaturshringi police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/4year-old-abducted-from-baner-9-days-ago-dropped-off-at-pcmc-101642609644178.html

To note, on Tuesday Prayagraj with a minimum temperature of 4 degrees Celsius was even colder than Shimla (5.1 degrees Celsius).On Wednesday, though the minimum temperature stood at 8.2 degrees Celsius but it was the low day temperature (13.4 degrees Celsius) that made things worse.Adding to the problem, was dense fog in the morning. The brief sunshine in the afternoon failed to provide any respite. According to weather expert and head of the department of Geography, Allahabad University, Prof AR Siddiqui, “The cold will remain dominant for now and there is a possibility of thunderstorms by the end of the week. The condition would improve on Thursday and Friday followed by rain or overcast condition on Sunday and the day after.” To beat the cold, common man was seen lighting bonfires, even during the day time. Although there was some movement in the markets and localities during noon, but in the evening, the roads and markets witnessed only essential movement as people avoided going out in the open and remained confined to their houses. Situation at the Magh Mela was no different wherein groups of devotees and visitors were seen huddled around bonfires trying to keep themselves warm. “We are observing Kalpwas and following all the religious practice but because of the intense cold conditions, these are testing times as heaters or blowers are not allowed in the tents,” said Kusum Tripathi, a resident of Ballia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/cold-winds-cloud-cover-makes-prayagraj-shiver-101642609343795.html

19-01-2022||Mumbai||BMC to set up vaccination camps in schools and jr colleges to inoculate max adolescents||Mumbai: The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Tuesday said that in order to inoculate maximum number of adolescents between the age group of 15-18 years, vaccination camps will be set up in private and public schools along with some junior colleges in the city. Inoculation of 15–18-year-old adolescents started from January 3, 2022 and till January 18, a total of 1,90,237 adolescents have been vaccinated. On Tuesday, the BMC said that as many as 9.18 lakh adolescents in this age bracket living in Mumbai are eligible to take the doses.“So far, we have been able to vaccinate 20% of the target population and to expedite the process, vaccination camps will be held within the premises of every school in the city. This will be compulsory for private institutions also so they can get their students registered and vaccinated at the earliest,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner and in-charge of public health in the BMC.Kakani said that junior colleges that have a significant proportion of students between 15-18 years will also have to arrange their own camps.On Tuesday, a Covid-19 review meeting was held at the BMC that was also attended by state minister of environment, Aaditya Thackeray. The key agenda of the meeting was ramping up the drive for adolescents in Mumbai.Kakani said that so far, 125 plus private schools have been finalised and camps in these schools will begin soon. “We are starting this in a phased manner. Some of the schools in Mumbai have already started to have their own vaccination camps through private hospitals. Tomorrow (Thursday) we have a meeting with the school authorities following which we will prepare SOPs for this and by the end of this week or early next week camps in these schools will be started,” Kakani said.He also added that in case a school doesn’t have adequate student strength then it can arrange joint vaccination camps with nearby schools and junior colleges in their wards.According to the rules laid out by the government of India, only Covaxin doses are being administered to the adolescent beneficiaries. The BMC has set up dedicated vaccination booths in nine of its jumbo centres where doses are being administered exclusively to the adolescent beneficiaries.Kakani on Tuesday said that to avoid mixing up of doses the beneficiaries will be allotted time slots at vaccination booths.“Besides adolescents, all other eligible students are also coming for their doses in jumbo centres and they are preferring Covishield over Covaxin. So to avoid mixing up doses we will divide our staffers in shifts and allocate time slots to them. For example, 15-18 years will get their doses only in the afternoon while the rest of the eligible beneficiaries will get their doses in the morning,” said Kakani.The BMC on Tuesday also hinted that reopening of schools can happen anytime soon. Kakani said that during the meeting possibilities of reopening schools were discussed as well.“We want to open schools at the earliest which is why we are working towards vaccinating as many adolescents as we can at the earliest. We have conveyed this to the task force during the meeting and they will take up this matter to the state government following which a decision could be taken,” Kakani said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-to-set-up-vaccination-camps-in-schools-and-jr-colleges-to-inoculate-max-adolescents-101642607902318.html

Ltd. and two other directors of the Lower Parel-based company -- Sourabh Manjrekar and Ishita Manjrekar.All three were booked in abetment to suicide case after an engineer died by suicide.The court observed that prima facie, the involvement of accused persons was patent from the available material and needed thorough investigation, which is not possible without custodial interrogation of the accused.Additional Sessions Judge MG Deshpande, however, allowed the anticipatory bail plea of another director Ruchira Manjrekar, wife of Dr Surendra Manjrekar.According to Dadar police, the deceased, Nikhil Joshi, was working with Sunanda Speciality Coatings, which supplies construction chemicals, since 2001. He was a trusted employee of Dr Surendra Manjrekar. However, after 2011, Dr Manjrekar’s son Sourabh and daughter Ishita joined the company and they did not get along with Joshi.Police said that Joshi was insulted in meetings in the presence of juniors, his targets were hiked and he was asked to give reports in writing every day. Besides, Joshi was not allowed to quit the job, nor was he granted leave, police said.Josi ended his life on September 30. His wife later learnt that Joshi had met with Surendra Manjrekar and Sourabh Manjrekar in the pantry before committing suicide.The prosecution argued that Joshi had noted in his diary about the situation and how it was adversely affecting his life.The applicants’ advocated. however, argued that the deceased was unable to cope with work pressure and was blaming the management. “He was undergoing medical treatment, a fact that can’t be overlooked. He could have resigned and joined other services as per his wish. What has happened is due to his own responsibility and the accused are in no way linked to it,” they said, adding that there was a delay in lodging FIR.FIR was lodged in December to extract compensation from the accused, they said.Judge Deshpande observed that after Joshi committed suicide none of the employees nor the applicants helped him or took him to hospital and the act prima-facie speaks volumes. “The pantry meeting cannot be overlooked at this stage and needs further investigation. The diary notings indicated he was mentally harassed and became helpless,” the court noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/court-refuses-pre-arrest-bail-to-cmd-2-directors-booked-in-abetment-to-suicide-case-101642607422841.html
19-01-2022||Lucknow||UP polls: Akhilesh Yadav hints he’s open to contesting assembly seat for first time||Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday hinted he was open to contesting his first-ever election to an assembly seat in the 2022 Uttar Pradesh polls.“If I decide to contest, I will contest (2022 assembly election) with the permission of the people of Azamgarh. I will need permission of the people of Azamgarh who got me elected to the Lok Sabha,” Akhilesh Yadav said to the media at the Samajwadi Party headquarters here.Asked about contesting from a seat in Azamgarh, Akhilesh Yadav said the seat from where he may contest should go to polls before the Gorakhpur seat.“I will request the people of Azamgarh (for permission) and contest the poll from where the party decides. The election to seat (from where I contest) should be held before Gorakhpur so that I contest the poll before Yogi Ji,” said Akhilesh Yadav.Azamgarh will go to polls in seventh phase (March 7) and the Gorakhpur seat in the sixth phase (March 3).Chief minister Yogi Adityanath will contest the election to the state assembly from Gorakhpur (urban), where the Gorakhnath Math is located. Yogi is also the chief priest of the Math. After having won the Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat five times, Yogi is now an MLC.Akhilesh Yadav is the Samajwadi Party MP from Azamgarh. He had earlier indicated he would not contest the 2022 assembly elections. If Akhilesh Yadav contests the assembly polls, he will be doing so for the first time. As chief minister from 2012 to 2017, Akhilesh Yadav opted to be a member of the state legislative council. Yadav’s move to contest the state assembly elections is bound to make the fight for power in 2022 UP polls more interesting.With Yogi Adityanath himself in the fray, it will be after a gap of nearly 15 years that any serving chief minister will be contesting the election to lower house of state legislature.As chief minister, Mulayam Singh Yadav had won the by-election from the Gunnaur assembly seat in 2004. Mulayam Singh Yadav also won the Gunnaur seat in the 2007 assembly elections but the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) got a majority and formed the government.Uttar Pradesh BJP spokesman Avnish Tyagi said, “By saying that he (Akhilesh Yadav) needs permission of the people of Azamgarh, Akhilesh Yadav is trying to evade contesting the assembly elections. He does not have faith in people and thus making efforts not to contest assembly elections.”FEELERS TO BJP MLA AGARWALReplying to a question, Akhilesh Yadav used the occasion to send feelers to BJP MLA Radha Mohan Das Agarwal to get in touch with the SP as he may be feeling disgruntled after being denied a BJP ticket. “If he (Agarwal) is in touch with you, meet me separately,” Akhilesh Yadav said in a lighter vein while responding to a question from the media. Agarwal is the MLA from Gorakhpur (urban) seat from where chief minister Yogi Adityanath will contest the 2022 UP assembly election.SAMAJWADI PENSION SCHEME TO BE RELAUNCHEDAkhilesh Yadav used the occasion to announce his party’s plan to relaunch the Samajwadi Pension Scheme if voted to power.“We launched Samajwadi Pension Scheme for the poor when in government. We will relaunch the Samajwadi Pension Scheme and give them a sum of ₹18,000 per annum in place of ₹6000 per annum paid earlier. This scheme was providing financial support to 50 lakh families,” Akhilesh Yadav said, while recollecting a number of instances of how the scheme, along with Samajwadi Lohia Awas, benefited the people.Akhilesh Yadav also referred to families of snake charmers living near SGPGI, whose land was taken away and how his government decided to link them to Samajwadi Pension Yojana. He said a village of snake charmers would be set up near Kannauj adjacent to the Agra-Lucknow expressway as announced earlier.“We decided to set up a village of snake charmers and land was identified near the expressway. We will set up this village for snake charmers when in power,” said Yadav.He also announced that the people of all the castes having a large number of poor people would also be linked to the Samajwadi Pension Scheme.Akhilesh Yadav accused the BJP of speaking bundles of lies and said it was during the tenure of his government that the maximum number of bank accounts were opened, along with the maximum number of bank branches.WILL CONVEY GOOD WISHES TO APARNA: SP CHIEFAbout Aparna Yadav’s decision to join the BJP Yadav said he would convey his good wishes to her. He said SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav made efforts to convince her to stay back. “First of all, I will congratulate and extend my good wishes. I am happy it’s expansion of the Samajwadi Party’s ideology. I hope our ideology will help save democratic institutions. Netaji Mulayam Singh Yadav made all efforts to convince her to stay back… I am happy they are giving ticket to the ones who are not able to get a ticket from the Samajwadi Party.”PLIGHT OF COWSAkhilesh Yadav also targeted chief minister Yogi Adityanath and his government for what he called failure to feed the cows.“One of his favourite works was feeding animals. Mother cow is hungry now. They will have to face the curse of mother cow’s hunger,” Akhilesh Yadav. He said the Samajwadi Party manifesto, when released, would have schemes for women.

19-01-2022||Kolkata||TMC trade union chief in Haldia arrested for armtwisting industries, suspended||KOLKATA: The Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Wednesday announced a ‘zero tolerance’ policy for high-handed trade unionism and suspended the president of the party’s trade union front in the port and industrial township of Haldia shortly after his arrest on charges of pressurising major industrial units to hire contractors and workers of his choice.The case was filed on the basis of a complaint lodged by Exide Industries Ltd. which manufactures batteries in Haldia, TMC leaders said.The accused Indian National Trinamool Trade Union Congress (INTTUC) Haldia unit president, Tapas Maity, was arrested along with three others. They were also charged with extortion. Bengal law minister Moloy Ghatak and INTTUC state president Ritabrata Banerjee rushed to Haldia and suspended Maity and the party’s special observer for Haldia, Sanjay Banerjee. The post of special observer, which the TMC does not have in other districts, was also summarily abolished. Maity was replaced by Shibnath Sarkar, a veteran trade union leader.“The charges against Sanjay Banerjee were serious in nature. He crossed his brief and interfered in internal matters of local industries,” said a senior state TMC leader who did not want to be named.The action has been taken months before the TMC government hosts the Bengal Global Business Summit scheduled to be held in Kolkata in April. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi and captains of the industry, including founder chairman of the Adani Group, Gautam Adani, to the event.Ghatak and Ritabrata Banerjee have held a three-hour-long meeting with the managements of all 34 big companies operating in Haldia, such as Tata Steel, Indian Oil Corporation, Hindustan Unilever and Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd.“The only work of the trade union is to look after the interests of workers, to see if they are getting their salaries and perks on time. Trade unions cannot interfere in managerial matters,” Ghatak said.“The actions have been taken as part of the zero tolerance policy that has been adopted,” said Ritabrata Banerjee. “The law minister and Banerjee assured us that there will be no interference from now on,” an Exide Industries official in Haldia said on condition of anonymity. Gautam Adani met Mamata Banerjee at Nabanna, the state secretariat, on December 2 and held discussions on investments for around 90 minutes. State officials said Banerjee assured Adani that her administration will provide businesses a trouble-free environment. The discussions also included the sea port project that the government is developing with help from the Centre.Adani tweeted after his meeting that he will attend the summit, which Banerjee projects as the signature of her achievement. “Delighted to meet @MamataOfficial, Hon’ble Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. Discussed different investment scenarios and the tremendous potential of West Bengal. I look forward to attending the Bengal Global Business Summit (BGBS) in April 2022,” Adani tweeted after meeting the chief minister. Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani has attended the summit in the past and has been invited again.Banerjee invited Prime Minister Modi to inaugurate the Bengal Global Business Summit in Kolkata on April 20 during her visit to Delhi on November 24. In recent years, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has accused the TMC government of ruining the state’s economy and failing to draw investments despite the chief minister’s foreign trips. Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, too, has demanded a white paper from the government on actual investments made after previous business summits.Reacting to the arrest of the INTTUC leaders on Wednesday, Bengal Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said, “The action must have been taken because the TMC’s interests were hampered. This has nothing to do with safeguarding industries.” Leader of the opposition in the Bengal assembly, Suvendu Adhikari, said the disciplinary action and arrests were an eyewash. “All this is an eyewash. After coming to power in the assembly polls last year, the TMC started making all efforts to control the industries in Haldia. There is constant tussle among local TMC leaders,” said Adhikari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/tmc-trade-union-chief-in-haldia-arrested-for-armtwisting-industries-suspended-101642605561850.html

The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has plans to get the ‘Flamingo City’ tag for the city, which the activists claimed would be difficult as these birds have begun to vanish from the strategic wetlands. “The CM has marked the mail specifically to Environment Principal Secretary, Manisha Mhaiskar, and Urban Development Secretary, Mahesh Pathak,” NatConnect Foundation director, BN Kumar, said. Meanwhile, the Union Environment Ministry has again asked the Maharashtra Wetland Authority as well as its State counterpart to look into the green activists’ complaints of destruction of the two wetlands, Talawe (or NRI) and TS Chanakya, and asked them to file an Action Taken Report.The State Mangrove Cell, too, evinced interest to conserve the two wetlands along with Belpada, Bhendkhal and Panje wetlands of Uran, as per a BNHS plan, to maintain them under the Thane Creek Flamingo Satellite Sanctuary Project. “It is highly disturbing that artificial bunds are blocking the tidal water flow into the NRI and TS Chanakya wetlands in a déjà vu of the sabotage of Uran’s Panje wetland,” Kumar said. “We have not seen any semblance of flamingoes in recent times at these wetlands,” said Dharmesh Barai, who pointed out that mangroves are being chopped and thrown into the wetlands. The greens alleged that instead of preserving these wetlands, CIDCO was planning developmental activities here. Dismissing the allegations of blocking tidal water, CIDCO PRO, Priya Ratambe, said, “CIDCO is committed to preserving the environment. All steps taken by CIDCO are in accordance with the due process of the law.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/flamingoes-are-fast-disappearing-from-navi-mumbai-claim-environmental-activists-101642604301811.html

19-01-2022||Mumbai||38 fishermen get ₹5.35 lakh compensation for releasing protected species into sea||Mumbai The state forest department has paid ₹5.35 lakh to 38 fishermen from Thane and Palghar districts in compensation for releasing protected marine species back into the sea. The pending claims were resolved last week during a meeting between the forest department’s mangrove cell and the fisheries department.As many as 26 Olive Ridley turtles, six whale sharks, two guitarfish, one green sea turtle, one Hawksbill turtle and one finless porpoise were released into the sea after being inadvertently caught in fishing nets. The fresh addition takes total compensation claims during the current financial year (2021-22) to 86 cases, pushing the amount to ₹11,52,500.The scheme, jointly launched by the forest and fisheries department in December 2018, seeks to compensate fisherfolk for a loss of fishing nets and encourage them to release protected species caught inadvertently. Since its inception, 264 compensation claims have been received by the state government and ₹40,78,050 has been disbursed to 253 fishermen.Sea turtles are the most commonly affected species, with 138 Olive Ridleys having been caught-and-released in just over three years, followed by 67 green sea turtles, five hawksbill turtles and two leatherback turtles. At least ₹30 lakh has been paid in compensation for the release of turtles alone. This is followed by 37 whale sharks, whose release was compensated with ₹8,54,700, followed by six giant guitarfish, one Indian Ocean humpback dolphin and one Indo-Pacific finless porpoise.A similar scheme in Gujarat offers compensation for the release of whale sharks, but Maharashtra is the only state at present that compensates fishers for the loss of all protected marine species. As per the compensation scheme, if any fisherman finds a protected marine animal caught in their nets, they are entitled to compensation of up to ₹25,000 if they release the animal and their fishing gear is damaged in the process.All applicants have to submit video graphic and photographic evidence of the incident, along with the GPS coordinates of where the animal was caught and released along with details of their boat license. In January this year, the state government revised the compensation structure of the scheme, and fisherfolk are now reimbursed based on the size and degree of protection according to the animal under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/38-fishermen-get-rs-5-35-lakh-compensation-for-releasing-protected-species-into-sea-101642601844790.html

The incident occurred shortly post-noon on the fifth floor of a house in the Old Seemapuri area at Shahdara in the national capital.A PTI report, quoting police officers, said a PCR call was received at their office around 1:30pm wherein it was reported that four to five persons were lying unconscious inside a room of the Old Seemapuri building.After police hurried to the spot, they found a woman and three of her children lying dead, while the fourth and youngest son was alive but in a critical condition. The child was rushed to the hospital but was declared dead on arrival by the doctors.Police said preliminary inquiry suggested all of them died of suffocation. A stove kept inside the small unventilated room due to the severe cold is likely to have caused a build-up of toxic fumes inside the chamber and suffocate its occupants.According to a senior police officer, the place where the incident occurred was a rented accommodation inhabited by one Mohit Kalia (35), his wife Radha, and their four children – two daughters and two sons.The flat belongs to Amarpal Singh, a 60-year-old resident of Shalimar Garden, said deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-woman-her-4-kids-after-choking-on-toxic-fumes-from-stove-101642599384589.html

The Kolkata-bound flight was numbered 6E455, while the one departing for Bhubaneswar was numbered 6E426,” officials of the aviation regulator said.A ‘breach of separation’ takes place when two aircraft breach the minimum mandatory vertical or horizontal distance in an airspace. In this case, according to DGCA, there was an interval of approximately 5 minutes between each flight taking off. “After departure, both planes were moving towards each other. The collision was avoided after an approach radar controller gave a diverging heading,” it added.The aviation controller also claimed the incident was not logged in any logbook, nor reported to it by the Airports Authority of India (AAII).

As vaccination for teenagers is picking up pace, students have started preparations for offline exams for Class 10 and Class 12.The Secondary School Certificate (SSC) or Class 10 and Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) or Class 12 exams for Maharashtra state board are scheduled in March and April this year.As per the health department, over 245,535 students have received the first dose till January 18 in Pune district. There are a total of 553,190 students in the district eligible for the vaccine.Across Maharashtra, a total of 43.44 per cent of students in the age group had received their first dose of Covaxin.Teaching and non-teaching staff are already vaccinated. While most schools follow Covid appropriate norms and behaviour, offline examination seems more likely this year.Sneha Waghmare, a student of Class 10, said that she received her first dose as soon as the vaccination drive started for the age group.“My vaccination dose was arranged at my school itself. Class 10 students were given an early dose to ensure that we get the doses before our final exam starts. Last year there was a lot of confusion and delay regarding the offline exam. But this year, because we have the vaccination, it looks like we will have to give the exam offline. My classmates and I have already started preparing likewise with regular practice of writing,” said Waghmare.Another student from Class 12, Amruta Kulkarni shared similar views.“I got the first dose in the first week of vaccination. And I hope the exam is offline this year. I have been studying very hard for my final exam,” said Kulkarni.Milind Telawne, a city-based parent, said that at least for higher classes, there should be an offline examination.“Because of online classes and online education from the last one and half years, we have seen that students are not in the habit of writing. However, if they know that an offline exam will be conducted, they will start preparing. Unlike last year, this year students are getting vaccinated and the board is also firm on their stance. So, students are excited about the offline examination. If all students get vaccinated, conducting offline tests with Covid appropriate norms can be easier. It also sends a good message to students from other standards,” said Telawne.Sharad Gosavi, chairman of Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE), said that we are firm on offline examination as of now.“We have taken all necessary steps to ensure that students are safe. We are holding discussion with the education minister as to how can these exams be conducted in a safe environment for children and staff,” said Gosavi.Last year, when the board were preparing for an offline examination, the centres for students were same as their school or junior college. As per education board officials discussions are ongoing on similar lines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/class-10-class-12-students-gear-up-for-offline-exams-44-students-vaxxed-in-pune-dist-101642596381039.html

19-01-2022||Lucknow||Hindu Yuva Vahini jumps into poll campaign mode for Yogi’s victory||LUCKNOW The Hindu Yuva Vahini (HYV), founded in 2002, when he was an MP, by Yogi Adityanath, has emerged after five years of dormancy, with the likely trigger being the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) decision to field Adityanath from his and its base, Gorakhpur, in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh assembly elections.The HYV played an important role in Adityanath’s election campaigns in 2004, 2009 and 2014 and also propagated the message of Hindutva in rural areas of eastern UP. After Adityanath became chief minister in March 2017, units of the HYV in various districts of Gorakhpur were disbanded at the request of the BJP leadership over fears that it would function as a parallel political outfit. Its office-bearers and members who protested this move were expelled from it. This included HYV’s then state president Sunil Singh.Over the following five years, the HYV withdrew from political activities to focus on social issues, including ration distribution, building awareness about Covid-19 and Japanese Encephalitis, assisting migrant workers, and assisting local authorities in the implementation of development and welfare schemes.The announcement that CM Adityanath will be fielded from the Gorakhpur urban seat has charged members of the HYV. Though polling on this seat will be held in the sixth phase of UP polls on March 3, the HYV has already launched an intensive campaign to ensure Adityanath’s victory. In view of Covid-19 guidelines implemented by the Election Commission of India (ECI), the HYV has decided to organise door-to-door meetings, digital meetings, and strengthen its organisation at the booth level across the assembly segment, said PK Mall, general secretary, HYV.HYV office-bearers will hold a meeting with the chief minister over the election strategy and campaign when he arrives in Gorakhpur, Mall added.“Political activities of the HYV were dormant for around five years, but the organisation has been reactivated with the announcement of Yogi Adityanath’s candidature from the city seat. The outfit will hold meetings in all the wards and also campaign for BJP candidates in other assembly segments on the direction of the CM,” said Ram Laxman, a senior HYV leader and former students’ union leader of DDU Gorakhpur University.In the 2017 assembly elections, HYV leader Raghvendra Pratap Singh contested from Domariyaganj seat in Siddharthnagar. In a close contest, he defeated BSP candidate Saiyada Khatoon by a margin of 171 votes. In the 2022 assembly polls too, several HYV leaders are aspiring for BJP tickets.From 300 members in 2002, the strength of the HYV increased to 1.5 million in 2017.However, the activities of the HYV did not go down well with local BJP leaders who considered the outfit a “private force of Adityanath”.They urged the party leadership to curtail the activities of the HYV after Adityanath became CM, Singh added.

The Shiv Sena has managed to win 278 seats.Initially, the NCP was leading in the election with 379 seats, followed by the BJP with 359 seats.“Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray seems to be content with his post. He cares less for his party or party leaders, as they are losing ground across the state. The situation has benefitted the NCP,” Patil further said.He added the discontent among leaders of the Maha Vikas Aghadi-led government in Maharashtra was visible, and hence, the setback in the elections.Another BJP leader, Pankaja Munde, said the MVA government suffered a setback during the nagar panchayat elections because they did not fight strongly for the Other Backward Classes (OBCs).“Despite having no official quota for the OBCs, the BJP gave tickets to leaders from the community, which benefitted us in the polls,” Munde said.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-nagar-panchayat-polls-bjp-leading-in-majority-of-seats-101642590087976.html
19-01-2022||Chandigarh||ED recovers ₹10 crore from Punjab CM Channi’s nephew, his partner||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday concluded its raids on Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s nephew Bhupinder Singh and nine others, including six mining contractors, in the illegal sand mining case with the seizure of ₹10 crore. Also read: Former Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal tests positive for Covid-19The central agency seized total ₹10 crore from Bhupinder and his partner, Sandeep Kumar, besides recovering gold worth ₹21 lakh during the searches. The financial investigation agency had recovered nearly ₹6 crore from Bhupinder and Sandeep from their premises in Ludhiana on Tuesday and the amount touched ₹10 crore on Wednesday. The ED raided 10 locations in poll-bound Punjab, including those linked to the CM’s nephew, in connection with probes into illegal sand mining in the state on Tuesday. The ED officials, accompanied by Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel, conducted searches at locations in Chandigarh, Rupnagar, Ludhiana, Pathankot and Mohali. An apartment belonging to Bhupinder was raided in Mohali. The ED is probing the source of unaccounted cash recovered from Bhupinder and Sandeep. The agency’s probe under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) is based on a 2018 case registered by Punjab Police for illegal sand mining in the border state. The central agency had lodged an ECIR (Enforcement Case Information Report), an FIR, at its zonal office in Jalandhar in November last year after taking over the probe. ED officials said Kudrat Deep Singh, one of the main accused, had set up a firm, Provider Consultancy Services Private Limited. The three directors of the firm are Kudrat Deep, Sandeep and Bhupinder. The ED has been probing money-laundering charges against them as it suspects the proceeds of crime from the illegal sand mining has been further transferred. Following the probe against Kudrat Deep, the ED investigated the role of six contractors for illegal sand mining. Besides, it searched the premises of miner Sunil Joshi in Pathankot, Jagbir Inder Singh in Rupnagar and Randeep Singh in Fatehgarh Sahib, while the properties of Sandeep and Bhupinder were searched in Ludhiana, too. According to the FIR, there are 26 accused, including Kudrat Deep. Most of them are truck drivers. The case was registered on the complaint of the Punjab mining department that found sand quarries being run without approval during its raids in 2018. The mining department impounded 30 vehicles and other machinery being used for the illegal mining. The FIR said that the mining was done outside the designated area and the operators used forged slips that were not issued by the mining department. Police cracked down on six companies in connection with the illegal sand mining case. In 2019, Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar police had also filed challan in the case against accused Baldev Singh and others. An SBS Nagar court has fixed February 23 as the next date of hearing in the matter. In 2018, the case was registered under Sections 21(1) and 4(1) of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, and Sections 420 (punishment for cheating), 471 (whoever fraudulently or dishonestly uses as genuine), and 465 (punishment for forgery) at Rahon. 
19-01-2022||Pune||Sutradhara’s Tales: Once upon an opulent past... a story of wealth||The present day monument of Shaniwarwada is a memory and relic of a bygone past. It is but a dim reflection of the opulence of the haydays of the Peshwas. The opulence can be very well imagined through contemporary paintings and first-hand impressions recorded by the British. At the site itself, the monument survives in the form of stone plinth and obscure place names. Surviving amongst these place names, one particular name that caught my eye, was “Javahirkhana”. Javahirkhana, also known as Ratnashala, was part of the original two courtyard complex of Shaniwarwada built by Bajirao I. Thanks to the elaborate archival notes and lists, one finds miniscule details of the objects that once occupied the Javahirkhana at Shaniwarwada. Maratha period scholar, Bhasvati Soman, has painstakingly surveyed these lists and documents in the Modi script to present us with the nature and functioning of the Peshwa’s “Ratnashala” department. As the Maratha territory expanded north and south, Maratha sardars were acquainted with jewellery traditions and design forms of Karnataka, Gujarat, Malwa, Bundelkhand, Delhi, Agra and Bengal. Adornment of various types of jewellery, both by men and women was in vogue. For that matter, the very designation of Peshwa was awarded by felicitations of rich paraphernalia of royal clothes, precious jewellery and royal standards, including a palanquin.The practice of felicitating the sardars and commanders before the campaign and on the conquest was quite prevalent; it was considered encouragement and luck. Jewellery and objects of personal use were carried by the Peshwas during travels and even during the military campaigns.One letter from 1770 records Madhavrao Peshwa I asking Nana Phadnis to send the Sirpech (ornament worn on the pagadi) without fail, which was originally forgotten. Additionally, he asks Nana to oversee the making of precious idols of Gods and select the best one for the Peshwa. Another interesting record from 1750s mentions awarding of a watch to sardar Vitthal Shivdev Vinchurkar which he was ordered to wear on all occasions. Peshwas and other Maratha sardars engaged in charity during the campaigns and carried the treasures including objects of gold and silver to be donated at various religious centres and pilgrim sites. Places of personal faith such as Trambakeshwar, Jejuri and Astavinayakas had received generous grants of gold, silver masks and jewellery. The family treasury was added to and flourished with every ruling Peshwa. The Javahirkhana included jewellery of both men and women of the Peshwa family, gold and silver idols of deities, utensils, artefacts, décor, weapons, toys, games, animal and bird figurines, spare precious stones and pearls. The men were fond of decorating animals such as cows, elephants and horses with their custom-made jewellery to reflect the riches; they were to be deposited in Javahirkhana. Certain sets of furniture too were made using precious metals or embellished with precious stones. For example, the fountain spouts at Shaniwarwada were made of silver. Another record registers cost of a silver swing owned by Khajagiwale as Rs2,273.Though men and women dwelled in their own respective chambers or performed rituals in the pooja room, the family’s treasury held all the precious objects of importance. The objects may be used on a daily basis or during festivities, but the thorough central accounts were maintained at the Ratnashala. The inflow and outflow register along with expenses of upkeep were recorded. The records of the Ratnashala starts with 51,402 diamonds, 1,132,292 rubies, 26,643 emeralds, 176,011 pearls, 435 sapphires, 432 Cat’s eye, 417 Yellow sapphire, 444 Red coral, 1,912 corals, 75 Hessonite and so on. The list of various objects made of gold and silver is much longer. The treasures of Devghar (family Gods), treasures of Devdeveshwar sansthan at Parvati and personal treasures of individual men and women formed the main parts of the Ratnashala. It also included the use of various precious objects used in fire rituals (Homa-shala) and for medicinal purpose (Vaidyashala). Numbers of toys and board games such as dolls, spinning tops, balls, dice and chess are mentioned. The lists provides more than 100-odd names for various jewellery items of which some could not be identified as most of the traditional designs have not survived. Women of the family owned a considerable part of jewellery which includes typical Maratha period jewellery. This jewellery was passed over to junior members from the seniors on weddings, festivities or by inheritance. Ramabai, wife of Madhavrao, donated her own jewellery when she ascended the sati pyre. Personal ownership of objects such as writing stylus and inkpots indicate that most Peshwa family women were literate and engaged in both personal and political correspondence. Sardar Khajagiwale was incharge of personal affairs of the Peshwa family under Bajirao, Nanasaheb and Madhavrao and maintained records in the form of registers. In later times we find similar lists from 1768 and 1783 describing objects of the treasury. The lists meticulously recorded the number of precious stones attached to every piece of jewellery or artefact fearing the loss in handling. The officers responsible for the records were handsomely paid to deter any theft or corruption.Money lenders had a crucial role during these times to check the purity of objects and certify them. The objects were weighed in Gunja-Masa-Tola scale where 1 tola of those days corresponds to 11.66 present day grams.Many sardar families had deposited their jewellery with moneylenders in exchange for loans for campaigns or personal use. Money lenders such as Krishnaji Hari Chipunkar were commissioned with transport of precious objects and in addition would insure the safe transport. Of all the Peshwas, Raghunathrao Peshwa owned the biggest share of the treasury which was unfortunately squandered away as he rebelled against Marathas and took refuge with the British.Most of the Peshwa’s Javahirkhana were confiscated by the British; some parts of it was inherited by Bajirao II’s adopted heir, Nanasaheb Peshwa. Nanasaheb could not carry the treasures with him after defeat of Kanpur and Bithur. So, except for the most precious stones, he hid the treasures in a well which was traced by British spies. Colonel Gordon Alexander has recorded the nature of this treasure in his book. It consisted of Rs30 lakh in gold and silver, plates, bowls, other utensils, a palanquin of a few 100kg of silver and jewellery worth Rs70 lakh, apart from precious stones. In all, the remaining treasure of more than Rs1 crore, in those days, was lost to British. That is the last we saw of the magnificent Peshwa treasures!

Palekar emerged as the front runner to be the party’s face after AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal announced they would choose the candidate from the Bhandari Samaj, which comes under the Other Backward Class category.Kejriwal said Palekar’s heart beats for Goa. “We said we will give a Goa chief ministerial face whose heart beats for Goa and who is willing to give his life for Goa. One who can take everyone along in Goa... And most importantly he should be an honest man. That man is Amit Palekar,” Kejriwal said.The announcement came a day after Kejriwal named Bhagwant Mann, 48, as the party’s chief ministerial face for the assembly elections in Punjab.A lawyer, Palekar joined the AAP in October last year. He has no prior experience in electoral politics. Palekar has handled several prominent cases including that of former minister Francisco Pacheco when he was on the run following the death of his friend Nadia Joelle Torrado, who died by suicide in 2010.More recently Palekar represented one of the parties arguing for better Covid-19 facilities during the peak of the Covid-19 wave in Goa in May last year.“You have seen the dirty politics of the last five years. In the last two months, you have seen it fall to such a level that the Goans have begun to feel ashamed. We have entered politics to change this and are asking for one chance to bring a change,” Palekar said.He said he became a lawyer because his father did not have the money to pay a bribe when he qualified for a government job. “And I decided that one day I will fight against this injustice. I want to thank Arvind Kejriwal for this opportunity,” Palekar said.He accused other parties of having sold Goa. “Check their balance sheets. They have only done corruption. People want clean governance; corruption-free governance. ...Do we choose the same corrupt people who have been running the government or do we want new clean faces that can take Goa forward,” Palekar said.AAP and Trinamool Congress have been seeking to make inroads into the state, where the Congress emerged as the single largest party in the last assembly elections but the Bharatiya Janata Party managed to form the government in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aap-names-amit-palekar-as-chief-ministerial-candidate-in-goa-101642585759858.html

The estimates of ₹1.44 crore for this project were approved by the MCG’s finance and contract committee on Monday.Currently, in the absence of a bitumen road, many commuters residing in sectors 69, 70, 70A, and 75 opt to travel through the heavily congested Southern Peripheral Road (SPR) to head towards Sohna Road or Golf Course Extension Road (GCER) via Vatika Chowk. “Residents of the area had raised a demand with the MCG for constructing a road. Accordingly, estimates for the project were approved by the MCG commissioner after which it was put up before the finance and contract committee for deliberation on Monday. After deliberation, the project was given approval by the committee,” said Tushar Yadav, executive engineer, MCG, who is overseeing the project.Yadav said that the MCG is aiming to start construction of the project by the last week of February and it is expected to take around seven weeks to build it.He said that a 700-metre stretch of the Darbaripur Road, linking the road running parallel to the pond with Sohna Road, was constructed by the MCG last year. Once the 1.2km stretch is constructed, commuters can bypass the SPR and Vatika Chowk route, and reach Sohna Road directly via Darbaripur Road.Besides saving commuters around two kilometres of extra travel, the new road will bring down travelling time by 15-20 minutes during peak traffic hours.“Due to the absence of a proper road, I drive through SPR and Vatika Chowk to head towards GCER or Sohna Road. Both the road and the junction are heavily congested, and crossing the signal at Vatika Chowk alone takes more than 10 minutes. Once the road is built, I can use the main Gujjar Road to head towards GCER and take Sohna Road to head towards Badshahpur,” said Nirmala Chahal, a resident of Sector 70A.The 1.2km portion of Darbaripur Road is currently a pothole-riddled unmetalled road and commuters have a harrowing time navigating their way through the stretch especially during monsoon.“Without any bitumen surface, the soil mixes with rainwater during monsoon and becomes a swamp. This not only makes it difficult for commuters to drive on but also makes it difficult for them to spot potholes leading to minor accidents and vehicle breakdowns. Most commuters avoid this stretch,” said Aashish Sharma, who works at a private company in Sector 70.

19-01-2022||Bhopal||MP to slash booze rates, retail liquor at airports, select supermarkets||In the new Excise Police for the next Financial Year, the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh has decided to allow the sale of liquor at all airports in the state and select supermarkets in four big cities, and issue home bar licenses to those earning ₹one crore or more annually.In the Excise Policy 2022-23, approved by the state Cabinet on Tuesday, the government also decided to slash retail prices of liquor by 20 per cent in a bid to "make them practical".The Cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan also cleared the Madhya Pradesh Heritage (Traditional) Liquor Policy.Under the new Excise Policy, counters selling liquor can be opened at all the airports in MP while licenses for (opening) such outlets can now be issued in select supermarkets in Indore, Bhopal, Jabalpur and Gwalior at a fixed fee, an official statement said.Now, a home bar license will be issued at an annual fee of ₹50,000 to applicants with an annual individual income of ₹one crore or more, it said.Under the upcoming policy, bar licenses can be issued at concessional rates to temporary units being operated by the Eco-Tourism Board and the Tourism Development Corporation at tourist places. The state government also decided to simplify the liquor import process. Opening of microbreweries will be allowed in Bhopal and Indore cities subject to No Objection Certificates (NOCs) to be issued by local civic bodies and the electricity department and after securing environmental clearance.Officials said that all the liquor outlets will now be composite shops to curb the sale of illegal alcohol.Composite shops are the ones from where traders can sell Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL), Country Made liquor and beer together.District-level high power committees that include the collector and MLAs will be empowered to change locations of liquor shops, if needed, under the new excise policy.Besides, wine prepared from grapes by farmers in MP will be made duty free, the officials said.The new excise policy also has a provision of tetra-packing liquor and scanning the QR code to check the authenticity of the product. The Madhya Pradesh cabinet also gave its nod to the new Heritage Liquor policy, announced by the chief minister last November, which will enable tribals to brew liquor from 'mahua' (Madhuca) flowers in a traditional way and sell it.This policy will be later presented before a cabinet sub-committee which was formed to discuss the heritage liquor project, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-to-slash-booze-rates-retail-liquor-at-airports-select-supermarkets-101642583111182.html

Asserting that the district needed to focus on the use of treated waste water, the authority also asked the district administration to form a sub-committee under the district water harvesting committee that will submit daily reports which can be used to make a water action plan for Gurugram. “Serious efforts will have to be made to utilise the waste water in Gurugram city. Keeping in mind the future of the coming generations, efforts need to be made from now on with a better water plan. Gurugram is the financial capital of the state, and special focus should be given for water harvesting here. A concrete strategy must be adopted regarding the depleting groundwater level and water harvesting in Gurugram,” Keshni Anand Arora, chairperson of HWRA, said during a virtual meeting on Tuesday.Arora added that the departments working in the field of water harvesting should collaborate with NGOs and other institutions if needed. Yash Garg, deputy commissioner of Gurugram, apprised the HWRA chairperson that the district administration was keeping an eye on violation of water harvesting rules and action is also being taken against the violators based on surprise checks. During the meeting, officials also discussed the installation of water recharging system in the city parks, as a measure to increase groundwater level.Gurugram, a dark zone district, has been seeing a reduction in the groundwater level for the past few years. Between 2014 and 2018, the groundwater table in the district fell by two-and-a-half metres. According to pre-monsoon data from the agricultural department’s groundwater cell, the groundwater table in the district dropped by 0.27 metres between June 2019 and June 2020 and was at 29.86 metres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hwra-asks-gurugram-to-focus-on-increasing-use-of-treated-water-in-city-101642583300341.html

The urban environment division of GMDA will install the high-density polyethylene pipeline with hydrants by connecting them to the master line of treated water, already laid along major roads of the city. These hydrants will be installed with a spacing of 30 metres, the officials said, adding that the pipeline will be laid using trenchless technology, a method used for installing or replacing pipelines with a minimum disruption on the surface. Subhash Yadav, head of GMDA’s urban environment division, said, “Our aim is to install pipelines for treated water across the city. In areas falling under GMDA, treated water will be used for upkeep of green belts and in areas under Municipal Corporation of Gurugram, it will be used for horticulture activities and maintenance of parks. Our target is maximum utilisation of treated water so that it does get wasted as run off to the Najafgarh Lake. This year we plan to lay 50km long pipeline which will be increased gradually every year.” The project is likely to cost around ₹3 crore, the officials said. The project was discussed in the 25th core planning committee meeting of GMDA held last week.The city already has a network of over 100km of treated waste water pipelines. The GMDA has been trying to increase the use of treated waste water in green belts, construction sites and parks in the city. During the ninth authority meeting held in December last year, the chief executive officer had said that at present, 64% of treated waste water is being used in Gurugram for different purposes like in green belts, industries, rejuvenation of water bodies, among others. Gurugram generates 243 MLD (million litres per day) of treated waste water at present.Under the ‘reuse of treated waste water policy’ of the Haryana government, every municipality has been given a target of using at least 25% of treated water by 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gmda-to-lay-50km-pipeline-to-use-treated-waste-water-in-gurugram-101642583299558.html

19-01-2022||Kolkata||Palanquins carry women to hospital from remote, hilly Bengal villages||KOLKATA: Pasalam Dukpa, 22, a resident of a remote village in the Buxa Tiger Reserve in West Bengal’s Alipurduar, was lucky to have reached a local hospital on January 14 to give birth to a girl. The mother and child were doing well and went home a day after.Unlike Dupka, many women from remote villages along the India-Bhutan border in Alipurduar have not been as fortunate. The region’s hilly terrain, dense forests and narrow paths make it difficult for people to arrange transport to take expecting mothers in labour to the nearest hospital, around 12 km from the nearest motorable road. In December 2021, a tiger was also spotted in the Buxa Tiger Reserve after almost two decades.District magistrate Surendra Kumar Meena said every time a pregnant woman needed to reach the hospital for delivery, the locals would prepare a makeshift stretcher with bamboo and cloth. “The woman, despite suffering from labour pain, had to cling on to the bamboo, as the men trekked through the jungle and hilly terrain for almost three-four hours.”The situation has changed since the district administration and Family Planning Association of India (FPAI), an NGO, started a Palki “Ambulance” service on December 8. “It is a basically a palanquin made of wood and decorated with aluminium sheets, which is being used to transport such emergency patients from the remote corners of the district to the nearest motorable point from where they can avail the government ambulance service to reach the hospital,” said Meena.Around 11 villages are located in the remote corners of the district along the India-Bhutan border and the Buxa Tiger Reserve. The remotest of them such as Adma and Sewgaon is located around 12 km from the Zero Point, the nearest motorable junction. Adma is located at an altitude of 5,000 feet.FPAI general manager Tushar Chakraborty said institutional deliveries was almost unheard of even a decade ago. “It took years to convince the locals to go for institutional delivery. But the journey to the hospital was traumatic. In February 2021, a woman delivered a child on the banks of a rivulet while she was being carried all the way down. Now at least the journey would be comfortable as the woman can lie down on a bed inside the palanquin as the men trek down.”He said the terrain is hilly and remote and some of the roads are very narrow. “It is almost impossible to trek with such a huge load. The palanquin weighs around 55 kilos. Now add to this the woman’s weight, who needs to be transported. We are planning to bring some changes so that the palanquin could be made lighter.”The NGO pays for transportation as well as a trained attendant, who accompanies the palanquins to the hospital to take care of a patient in case of any emergency.Two palanquins have been pressed into service for seven of the 11 villages and at least eight more were being introduced to cover even the remotest Adma and Sewgaon villages.

19-01-2022||Mumbai||Man held for cheating women after meeting them via matrimonial sites||MUMBAI: The Mumbai Police have arrested a 34-year-old man for allegedly cheating at least 40 women after meeting them via matrimonial sites. They said the accused, Vishal Suresh Chavan alias Anurag Chavan, who has B Tech and MBA degrees, would get in touch with women from rich backgrounds and claim he worked in a high-end mobile manufacturing company. Chavan allegedly took money from at least 30 people by promising to get them the latest iPhones.Chavan faces three two cheating and a rape case. Police said a 28-year-old woman in August registered a cheating case against Chavan, saying they met through a matrimonial site and he allegedly took ₹2.25 lakh from her on the pretext of investing in the share market. After a month, he stopped meeting her and receiving her calls.“Based on the technical evidence and call data records, we gathered that the person was using a mobile number in the name of someone else. We had his photographs and after connecting one link to another, we found his residential address in Kalyan East but he had not been home for 15 days,” said a police officer.Inspector Sudhir Jadhav said Chavan duped many women. “Most of them are not coming forward to register cases against him. He was arrested in 2017...after a woman registered a cheating case against him...he had taken ₹17 lakhs from her. He got bail from the high court after submitting ₹17 lakh in the court.” He added Chavan would contact women on matrimonial sites and promise to marry them and get details of their financial background. “He would then start visiting the woman’s home to gain trust and later take money to invest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/man-held-for-cheating-women-after-meeting-them-via-matrimonial-sites-101642568298106.html

19-01-2022||Bangalore||‘Teacher threatened to push us out’: Students barred for hijab||A group of six Muslim students at a government college in Karnataka’s Udupi district, who were denied entry into classrooms allegedly for wearing a hijab, have claimed that a teacher threatened to push them out of the class.The six students have been barred by the college since the last week of December. A photograph of the students in headscarves and college dress, sitting on the staircase outside the classroom, has gone viral.“We are still sitting outside the class. We are not allowed to go inside the classroom,” said Aliya Assadi, one of the six students. “One day, we had gone inside the classroom, but the teacher’s response was, ‘If you don’t go out of the class, I will push you out.”College authorities said the students were in violation of the dress code.According to the principal of the college, Rudra Gowda, the students can wear headscarves on the college premises, but not inside the classrooms. The rule is being implemented to ensure uniformity in classrooms, he said.“There are no provisions to have hijab as the uniform in our school’s rules...They can attend classes if they remove the hijab...,” he added.“Though it is our fundamental right, though it is our constitutional right, they are still not allowing us to go in the class because we are wearing hijab,” Assadi said. “There is a lot of discrimination in the college. We can’t speak in Urdu. We can’t do salam to each other.”The All-India Lawyers Association For Justice has demanded an investigation by the state government. “The actions of the college administration and staff against the students is per se violative of the fundamental rights of the students,” the non-profit organization said in a statement.Deputy commissioner on Udupi district and Karnataka education minister didn’t respond to the calls for a comment.Yashpal Suvarna, vice-president of the college development committee, said: The protest was politically motivated as the students are members of the Campus Front, a students’ organisation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/teacher-threatened-to-push-us-out-students-barred-for-hijab-101642545268020.html
19-01-2022||Delhi||Delhiwale: White is as good as red||Winter means carrot halwa, means colour red.Not always. There is at least one place in Delhi that sells carrot halwa, which is not red. It is white.You may taste this extraordinarily unusual cold weather delicacy at Sheeren Bhawan in Old Delhi’s Chitli Qabar Chowk. The congested market is crammed with a range of edible heritage (Diamond Bakery, Shaberati Nihari Wale, etc). This mithai shop, too, is as iconic. One of the oldest surviving culinary landmarks in the Walled City, it was established long before Partition by a gentleman called Fayazuddin, whose descendants continue to thrive in a sprawling house within walking distance of the shop, in Pahari Rajaan.This evening, the glass display by the entrance is filled with sweet-tasting distractions (khoya kadam, chocolate burfi…) The star attraction though is atop the counter. A gigantic platter is perched on a burner, filled with what looks like a mound of crushed snow that has been shallow-fried to a pale golden shade. Steam is silently escaping from the surface. This is the enigmatic white carrot halwa. Sprinkled generously with kaaju and pista, shop attendant Mr Mateen is stirring the prized dish frequently with a heavy ladle.Seated on a chair, the founder’s great-grandson Adnan Qureshi confirms that the white carrot is not a fairytale legend, and that it exists for real. He calls it sunheri gaajar (golden carrot). “These are not easily available… we commission them from a farm in Ghaziabad.”Handing over a bowl of the halwa (60 rupees, 100 grams), Mr Qureshi asserts that it is made in pure desi ghee by Sheeren Bhawan’s chief cook, the “exceptionally skilled” Ustad Suger Singh Tomar. Incidentally, this gentleman, presiding over the kitchen of the famous Old Delhi landmark, is not a native of Delhi, but of Morena in Madhya Pradesh (see photo).It is possible that a first-timer to the white carrot halwa might feel uneasy about the confection. After all, one’s most cherished memories of this dessert are made of its universally recognisable red version. But one bite of the white halwa, as made in this Chitli Qabar establishment, might temper your loyalty towards the red. The halwa is supremely delicious, very rich, and so aromatic that you may end up feeling heady and happy. A must-try, it will last until the end of February, following which it will return the next winter, in mid-December.PS: While in the area, also look for a sweet shop further ahead, in Matia Mahal, that makes jalebis, which are not customary red but black (already celebrated on these pages).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-white-is-as-good-as-red-101642544323038.html

19-01-2022||Chandigarh||Soon, Chandigarh MC to name and shame waste segregation defaulters||Come January 27 and Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) will go all out to get residents to segregate dry and wet waste.First, a massive awareness campaign will be run to encourage people to segregate waste at source, and then, MC will start penalising violators on a “mission mode”.City Beautiful’s Swachh rankings had seen a sharp decline last year, and one of the major reasons for this was its poor record in waste segregation. The city had also failed to properly process its wet waste, the reason for which was attributed to lack of segregation. Reaching 2.5 lakh units Under the sensitisation campaign, the MC will endeavour to reach more than 2.5 lakh households and establishments in the city from which it collects the door-to-door garbage.“We have charted out an action plan under which we will be distributing four-coloured stickers to households. Each colour will represent a different type of waste like solid, wet and hazardous. These stickers will also have details of what all garbage comes under a certain category of waste. People will be given stickers to be pasted in their kitchen or a place where a type of waste is generally generated,” said MC commissioner Anindita Mitra.In the sensitisation drive, the MC will involve not only its employees but also councillors and other stakeholders.“We have detailed point-wise charts for our employees too which delineate their duties as well as inform them about the types of waste, and how to go about their segregation,” said Mitra.The MC had taken over the door-to-door garbage collection last year through its two-bin vehicles. Earlier this year, these were converted into four-bins. In addition to dry, wet and hazardous waste, the MC will also collect sanitary waste in these vehicles.Zeroing in on defaulting housesFrom area-based approach, the MC will now shift to making individual establishments and houses accountable for not giving segregated waste.It had earlier identified eight such localities - Hallomajra, Bapu Dham Colony, Sanjay Colony (Industrial Area), Indira Colony (Manimajra), Maloya, EWS Colony (Maloya), Mauli Jagran, and Vikas Nagar (Mauli Jagran), where segregation was not up-to-the-mark.“We had earlier identified localities and areas from where we were not getting segregated waste. Now, we are zeroing in on individual houses, which are still giving us mixed waste. If there are 20 houses in a lane, and even one doesn’t give us segregated waste, then the whole waste becomes mixed,” said Mitra.The MC is preparing a list of repeat offenders, who even after requests and warnings continue to flout the mandate of segregation of waste at source.“We are penalising people even now for not segregating waste, but after the awareness campaign, it will be done on a mission mode,” said Mitra.Revving up the wet waste processingThe MC plans to increase the wet waste processing capacity of the solid waste processing plant, Sector 25. Currently, the plant is only processing around 100 MT per day against its full capacity of 300 MT per day. The MC plans to clear up around 300 MT of legacy waste lying at the plant to have more space to dry the wet waste for its full processing. After removal of legacy waste, the plant is expected to double the processing of the wet waste.For dry waste processing, the MC is planning to spend around ₹3 crore for overhauling of the machinery at the existing plant, and another ₹3 crore for running and maintenance costs.
19-01-2022||Chandigarh||Meet Chandigarh’s zero-waste warriors||Even as City Beautiful slipped to an ignominious 66th rank in Swachh Survekshan 2021, thanks to poor waste management practices of the municipal corporation (MC) and lack of citizens’ participation, some of its residents have taken it upon themselves to set things right. From composting at home to recycling waste, these zero-waste warriors are showing the way towards regaining Chandigarh’s lost glory as the cleanest city in the country. Recently, the municipal corporation (MC) had also acknowledged their contribution and honoured them with Swachhta awards. MC commissioner Anindita Mitra said, “We want city residents to become Swachhta partners with the MC, like these individuals and institutions, by taking the lead in solid waste management and also spreading awareness among their neighbours and general public about Swachhta.”Supriya GoyalA social worker, Supriya Goyal, who resides in Sector 28, has taken up the initiative of converting single-use plastic into ‘eco-bricks’. Instead of throwing away single-use plastic items such as biscuit packets, chips packets, toffee rappers, she stuffs it into plastic bottles and donates it to an environment NGO, which further sends it for use in construction of roads and buildings.“I started creating eco-bricks after reading about the damage plastic causes to the soil. Plastic, being non-bio degradable, releases harmful toxins into the environment. We should all pledge to make Earth plastic-free,” she says.“I create eco-bricks with 1-2 litre bottles. So far, I have donated more than 50 eco-bricks to the NGO,” she says while adding that she has been encouraging her neighbours to follow suit. Amit GargAn IT sector entrepreneur, Amit Garg, 37, a resident of Sector 40, started composting wet waste in his house around a year ago. His kitchen waste is helping him get fresh organic vegetables for his kitchen.“Landfill and its hazardous environmental impact is the biggest issue today in Chandigarh. Also, buying compost from the market is expensive. So, creating one’s own compost at home with kitchen waste is a win-win situation.”He first segregates all the wet waste and composts it using earthen pots. “I started with one pot, now there are 40 such earthen pots for composting. We use cocopeat to make manure, and it is totally odourless. We are giving out almost zero waste to the MC.”He urges every resident to start composting at home. “It’s eco-friendly, and the least one can do for the environment. Some of my friends and relatives have also started composting at home.”Naresh KohliNaresh Kohli, a resident of Sector 29, and an employee of the Chandigarh administration, has taken inspiration from Nek Chand and created artefacts for his garden using old tyres, kids’ toys, cycle parts, spoons and broken crockery.He also converts kitchen and garden waste into manure. Kohli also makes eco-bricks. “Around 350gm single-use plastic can be stuffed into a one-litre bottle. We use these as barricades and supporting material for our garden. If produced on large-scale, these can be used in road and pavement constructions,” he adds. He also supports the Chandigarh municipal corporation in creating awareness about waste segregation and home composting, in his ward.Seema GirdharPrincipal of Government Model Senior Secondary School, Dhanas, Seema Girdhar has created a vertical and herbal garden. “We have taken several initiatives and practices, which are aimed at improving the environment and cleanliness in the city. All the waste generated in school is reprocessed on campus, and we don’t need to give any waste to the MC.”GMSSS, Dhanas, is a double shift school where more than 3,500 students study. Most students come from migrant workers’ families and are first-generation learners. The school is teaching them how to be Swachhta warriors and bring change around them. Vertical and herbal gardens on school premises have been created with student participation and use of recycled materials and in-house compost. Prachi MannPrachi Mann, a programming officer of the National Service Scheme (NSS) for Government Model Senior Secondary School, Sector 32, was recognised by the MC for being an “inspiration and role model for students” in creating Swachhta awareness.“We have been focusing on the recycling single-use plastic. Students are being trained to reuse single-use plastic, which otherwise end up polluting the environment. We are converting plastic into eco-bricks, which are donated to the MC,” she says.In addition to involving students in creating awareness about Swachhta through street plays and awareness campaigns, Maan is also training students to convert waste materials into artefacts. “Our students participated in an MC-organised exhibition displaying waste-to-art products. We have also created a green wall in the school, which is entirely made of waste products,” said Mann.
19-01-2022||Chandigarh||2 Punjab cops arrested, 1 detained for forgery of promotion orders||The UT police arrested two Punjab cops while detaining another one for alleged involvement in forgery of promotion orders of 11 Punjab police personnel issued under the name of former Punjab director general of police (DGP). Those arrested were identified as Sandeep Bahadur and Mani Katoch, both working with Punjab police. As per sources, Sandeep is superintendent while Mani is a head constable and is among the 11 Punjab police personnel whose names figured on the list. Sources added that Mani, according to the forged order, was to be promoted as “officiating ASI with immediate effect.” Sources revealed that another person had been detained while an inspector posted in Mohali police lines and a dismissed sub-inspector of Punjab police were being questioned at the time of filing of this report. “We have arrested two persons and questioning of others is on,” said Ketan Bansal, superintendent of police (SP, City), Chandigarh. The Chandigarh police had on January 12 registered a case against unidentified persons on the complaint of a deputy superintendent of police, on behalf of the Punjab Police, alleging forgery of promotion orders. The promotion orders were of constables, senior constables, sub-inspectors and assistant sub-inspectors, including the gunman of the former director general of Punjab (DGP). Sources said the orders were issued directing the units concerned to issue separate orders of promotion. These letters were purportedly issued on January 8 in the name of former Punjab DGP S Chattopadhyaya, the day the model code of conduct was enforced in the state with the announcement of assembly elections. In reality, no such orders were issued, claim sources. A case under Sections 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (cheating), 464 (false document in the name of a fictitious person), 465 (forgery), 467 (forgery of valuable security, or to receive any money, etc), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered at the Sector 3 police station.
19-01-2022||Lucknow||Opposition trying to bring back anarchy that prevailed before 2017: Yogi||LUCKNOW Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday said political parties, which believed in dynastic rule, had reminded the people of riots, crime and ‘goondas’, from which they had been relieved after 2017 Assembly elections in UP. In a press statement, he said criminals and rioters had made the electoral battle a fight of mafia, rioters and those carrying country-made revolvers instead of a fight for development and nationalism. He said Uttar Pradesh would win this election while the mafia, rioters and those carrying country- made revolvers would be defeated. “On March 10, the BJP would form the next government with absolute majority,” stated Adityanath. He said the Samajwadi Party, the Congress and the BSP were giving tickets to criminals, rioters and mafia and this became evident from the list of candidates released by these parties. “The three parties are making efforts to bring back the situation of anarchy that prevailed in the state before 2017. People of the state would give a befitting reply to this,” said the CM. Yogi Adityanath said the SP’s move to give tickets to Imran Masood and Nahid Hasan were examples of what kind of agenda the party wanted to pursue in the state. He also listed names of other leaders to make his point. Adityanath said the SP had given a new definition to law and order under its regimes in UP. “Anarchy was law for them and dreaded mafia like Mukhtar Ansari used to be protectors of law for them,” added the CM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/opposition-trying-to-bring-back-anarchy-that-prevailed-before-2017-yogi-101642540795954.html
19-01-2022||Gurugram||Infant trafficking: Two arrested from Rajasthan, five-month-old girl rescued||Gurugram police arrested two more suspected members of the interstate infant trafficking gang, which was busted earlier this month, from Alwar district in Rajasthan, and rescued a five-month-old girl child from them, said police on Tuesday.The suspects have been identified as Rajinder Kaur alias Baby (45) of Sadar locality and Anand Kumar (38) of Khairthal locality, both in Alwar. Police said the child was rescued from Anand’s possession.“A police team was camping in Alwar. While Rajinder was arrested on Tuesday, Anand was nabbed on Monday. Both of them are being interrogated ,” said a senior police officer. “There are high chances that the girl was purchased from a poor couple somewhere in Delhi,” he added. Manoj Kumar, station house officer of DLF Phase-III police station, said the interrogation of the suspects will help them find more clues and trace more people involved in the racket. Another police officer said that till now, they have got to know that Rajinder was the first to sell the five-month-old girl to a person. “That person, who is also a native of Alwar, further sold the child to Anand. We are interrogating Anand to find out if he was going to sell the child to someone else or not,” said the officer. He said the person who had bought the child from Rajinder is evading arrest and efforts are on to trace and arrest him. Police said that with the two fresh arrests, 13 members of the interstate gang have been nabbed till now and three female and one male infant have been rescued. The gang was busted after an alert taxi driver drove two women and a man directly inside the premises of DLF Phase-III police station in Gurugram on January 7 with two female infants who were allegedly to be sold. The driver had become suspicious after hearing the telephonic conversation of his passengers, who were talking about selling infants. “The parents of the male child could be traced till now. They are labourers from Delhi, who had sold the child to the gang for money,” said an officer privy to the investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/infant-trafficking-two-arrested-from-rajasthan-five-month-old-girl-rescued-101642540615632.html
19-01-2022||Noida||No increase in forest cover in Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar, finds govt survey||The forest cover in Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar remained unchanged in 2021 from what it was in 2019, showed the State of Forest Report, 2021, released by the Forest Survey of India (FSI) on January 13 this year. The report also indicates there has been no increase in forest cover in the neighbouring districts of Meerut, Baghpat and Bulandshahr compared to 2019, shows the FSI report. According to the report, of the total geographical area of 1,282 square kilometres (sqkm) in Gautam Budh Nagar, the district has a forest cover of 20sqm, which is about 1.56%. Likewise, out of the total 1,179sqkm in Ghaziabad, only 25.22sqm (2.14%) is under forest cover. The report said the two districts have not shown any increase in forest cover compared to the previous assessment carried out in 2019. In fact, the forest cover recorded in Gautam Budh Nagar in 2019 was no different than the assessment carried out in 2017 while there was a decline of -0.78% in Ghaziabad’s forest cover compared to 2017. Officials of the Uttar Pradesh forest department said in the last few years, many trees have been felled for infrastructure projects while efforts are on to increase the area under plantation. “The issue is also with the land availability. This is why the compensatory afforestation, which we take up in lieu of permission given for felling of trees for infrastructure projects, is taken up in districts, such as Shravasti, Chitrakoot and Jhansi among others. The forested areas have old plantation and new addition is done only on a rotational basis. Hence, the forest cover has not shown any increase over the years in the region,” said Ganga Prasad, conservator of forests (Meerut) from UP forest department. Some of the major infrastructure projects which have come up or are under-development includes the Delhi Meerut Expressway, Regional Rapid Transit System, Delhi-Dehradun Expressway, Meerut-Bulandshahr (NH-235) and Eastern Peripheral Expressway. The projects span in Ghaziabad, Meerut, Bulandshahr, Hapur and Baghpat districts, among others. Officials said the data for the permission obtained for felling trees for infrastructure projects was not readily available. According to previously reported figures, for instance, the Delhi Meerut Expressway accounted for felling of about 22,000 trees in phase 2 (UP-Gate to Dasna) while phase 4 (Dasna to Meerut) accounted for 11,025 trees while about 5,500 trees were axed for phase 3 (Dasna to Hapur) of the project. Against this, officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) vouched to plant 101,500 trees in three phases and also paid ₹15 crore for the felled trees to the UP forest department. According to the FSI report, the forest cover includes all lands measuring over one hectare in area with tree canopy density of more than 10%. The forest cover recorded in the report does not make any distinction between the origin of tree crops (whether manmade or natural) or tree species, and encompasses all kinds of lands, irrespective of their ownership, land use of legal status. “Since the survey is taken up by the help of a satellite, it may be possible that smaller trees or patches may not have been accounted for. But it is also true that there is a shortage of land for compensatory afforestation and as a result, the exercise is taken up in other districts,” added Prasad.  Officials of the forest department in Ghaziabad could not be reached for comments. P K Srivastava, divisional forest officer of Gautam Budh Nagar, said, “The FSI report will not take into account the plantation taken up in the last five years.” He, however, declined to elaborate further on his remarks. Overall, in Uttar Pradesh, the forest cover has increased by 6.15% of the total geographical area of 240,928 sqkm. Environmentalists said the districts have a target of planting 500,000-700,000 plants every year. “Despite this, there is a shortfall in forest cover. If the forest cover has not increased over the years, there has to be some serious planning. In the coming years, more infrastructure projects will come up and it would mean more trees would be felled,” said Sushil Raghav, an environmentalist from Ghaziabad. “Plantation is taken up by the forest department and other agencies, besides citizens also do their bit. However, such plantation is scattered and undertaken on a patch of land, which many not qualify as forest cover as per the methodology taken up by FSI for the report. On the other hand, old trees have also been felled for major projects. Hence, more and more plants should be planted on roadsides and vacant patches and the increase may reflect in the coming years,” said Vikrant Sharma, another environmentalist from Ghaziabad.
19-01-2022||Noida||Daily cases drops 1,000-mark as Ghaziabad reports 793 new infections||For the first time in over a week, the daily infections dropped below the 1,000-mark as the district recorded 793 fresh Covid cases, taking the number of infections reported in January to 17,080--the highest number of cases to be reported in a month since the beginning of the Covid outbreak. According to district data, Ghaziabad district recorded more than 1,000 fresh cases per day from January 10 to 17.Currently, there are 8,828 active cases in the district, of whom 94 patients are taking treatment in hospitals while the remaining are in home isolation. As many as 2,473 patients were declared ‘recovered’ on Tuesday.“The patients requiring hospitalisation are majorly senior citizens or those who have comorbidities. Otherwise, a majority of the patients are recovering well in home isolation,” said Dr Sunil Tyagi, additional chief medical officer. Meanwhile, the week spanning from January 12 to 18 recorded a positivity rate of 15.62%, the highest positivity rate recorded in a week since December 1, when Covid cases started increasing. Positivity rate refers to the number of samples which returns positive for Covid-19 out of the total samples tested. According to official data of the district health department, the weekly positivity rate stood at 0.03% with 26,067 samples yielding seven positive cases during the week from December 1-7 in 2021. Thereafter, the weekly positivity rate increased and shot up to 15.62% in the week ending on January 18, when the samples of 10,843 patients confirmed positive for Covid-19 on the back of 69,396 tests. Official data indicates that the Covid-19 infection is at its peak since it started rising in December. Officials said they will observe the trend for another week. “We are seeing the 793 cases (reported on Tuesday) as a decline as many test reports are pending at a lab in Lucknow and the figure may rise once these reports come. According to our estimates, the rise in Covid cases has reached a plateau and we expect that it will stay this way for another week or a fortnight, after which cases may start declining,” said Dr Tyagi. Experts feel there has been a decline in Covid cases. “If we just discuss the cases at our hospital (32), then I will say cases are decreasing and we have reached a declining stage. The peak may have not arrived yet, though we are observing a decline in daily cases, but if the government withdraws the night curfew and other restrictions, cases will reach its peak anytime soon,” said Dr Sharad Joshi, associate director (pulmonology) at Max Hospital, Vaishali. “If proper Covid precautionary measures are not followed and if political rallies or public gatherings are conducted, we are assuming that cases will increase at a faster rate and soon reach its peak,” said Dr Joshi. Between December 1, 2021, to January 18 this year, the health department collected 286,066 samples, of which 17,308 have returned Covid positive. 
19-01-2022||Noida||With over 19,000 cases in January, monthly tally in GB Nagar now highest ever||Gautam Budh Nagar reported 1,262 fresh Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, taking the number of infections reported in the district in January to 19,662, the highest number of cases to be reported in a month ever since the pandemic began. Currently, there are 10,428 active cases in the district while 3,150 people have been declared ‘recovered’ in the 24 hours. Though the daily count of Covid cases is much lower than Monday, when 2,158 cases were reported, the monthly Covid cases are now higher than ever before. According to data available with the district administration, the monthly Covid tally has crossed the infections recorded during the peak of the second wave, when the district recorded 17,358 cases in April and 18,729 cases in May. Not just the total cases, even the fatality count was very high during this period. While 213 Covid deaths were recorded last April, there were 143 fatalities from the infection in May. This year, however, just one Covid death has been reported in January so far. Though the severity of the infection is less this time, the transmissibility is much higher. There are still 12 days left in this month. “In this wave, the number of positive cases have been high all over as compared to the previous wave. Obviously, transmissibility is more. At the same time, serious cases and hospital requirement are less this time. This is a positive sign and we hope that cases start reducing soon,” said district magistrate Suhas L Y. Another positive trend is the age profile of those who tested positive for Covid-19. Unlike previous assumptions that more children will be infected in the current wave, this has not been the case. According to district data, just 8.2% of the total confirmed cases recorded between December 15 to January 17 were of children while the remaining cases were of adults. Of the total cases recorded during this period, 1.8% were of children less than five-years-old while around 6.4% were children between the age of five and 17 years. Meanwhile, adults accounted for 17,095 cases in the last one month. Doctors said it was clear very early on that it may not be a ‘paediatric wave’ and preparations should be made accordingly. “We had suggested to the administration that preparations should be made for hybrid ICUs where, both adults and children can be treated. It seemed like a false assumption very early on since children usually have better immunity and there was no scientific reason why more children would be affected,” said Dr D K Gupta, chairman, Felix hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/with-over-19-000-cases-in-january-monthly-tally-in-gb-nagar-now-highest-ever-101642539174875.html
19-01-2022||Delhi||SDMC announces waiver of previous years’ property tax in newly regularised unauthorised colonies||In its revised budget estimate for the fiscal 2021-22 and 2022-23, the standing committee of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Tuesday rejected the proposal to hike property taxes in recently regularised unauthorised colonies. Standing committee chairman Col (Retd) BK Oberoi said that the waiver will be made under a special amnesty scheme. “According to the scheme, property tax of residential property for previous years will be waived if a taxpayer deposits the property tax for the financial year 2021-22. The property tax of non-residential property for previous years will be waived if a taxpayer deposits the property tax for the last three fiscals from 2019,” he said. He said that while the SDMC collaborated with BECIL to operate all parking lots through My Parking App, it has also signed an MoU with Indian Solar Energy Corporation to install solar rooftop plants at its buildings. “Not only that, the civic body has also set up 20 STPs with a capacity to process 50 kilolitres waste per day at 16 locations using its urban development fund. We have also signed an MoU to set up a CBG plant having capacity to dispose of 100 TPD [tonnes per day] wet garbage at Hastsal,” he said. Oberoi also said that to ensure proper garbage management in the areas under the jurisdiction of the SDMC, waste segregation is being done in 16 model wards. “One small Mechanical Sweeping-cum-Jetting Machine will be made available in each zone. The engineered landfill site has been set up at Tehkhand, Okhla, besides a waste-to-energy plant on 15 acres of land at this site. We also planned to set up a 100 TPD capacity material recovery facility there,” he said. He said that in the health sector, one 24X7 maternity services centre has been established at Mata Gujri Hospital in Tilak Nagar. “We have also set up two dialysis centres at Mata Gujri Hospital, Tilak Nagar, and Poornima Sethi Hospital, Kalkaji. The SDMC has also approved a proposal to open eight new health centres, besides computerised OPD registration facility at all health centres,” he said. Highlighting the budget provisions in the education sector, the standing committee chairman said that rain water harvesting system has been constructed in 399 school buildings of the 431 school buildings under the SDMC’s jurisdiction. While CCTV cameras have been installed in 388 schools so far, they will be installed in remaining 43 schools very soon. We have also decided to set up a resource centre in each zone for children with special needs (CWSN). The standing committee has also approved the hike in the boys’ fund from ₹40 per year to ₹100 per year,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sdmc-announces-waiver-of-previous-years-property-tax-in-newly-regularised-unauthorised-colonies-101642537494329.html

19-01-2022||Chandigarh||Iranian apples in mandis worry Kashmir growers; write to PM Narendra Modi||In summer, young growers from Sopore Asif and Adil purchased thousands of apple boxes across north Kashmir with the hope that they will reap good dividends by selling those apples outside state fruit mandis in winter.The arrival and export of Iranian apples have marred the prospects of these young growers, who say that now over 2,500 apple boxes are lying inside their house at Saripora, Rafiabad, which is known as the apple bowl of north Kashmir and is close to Asia’s second-largest fruit mandi at Mazbough, Sopore. “If market doesn’t stablise then we are staring at a bleak future. I recently sold a few hundred boxes in Jammu as there were no takers in big mandis outside the state. Even in Kolkata, after spending huge freight, I did get a good price for my produce,” said Adil Malik, who after completing a master’s degree in education from Pune started doing his own business. “Last year, I had purchased 2,000 boxes, but this year I and my brother took a big risk by purchasing 4,000 boxes during summers. So far, we have just sold less than half of our apples as we didn’t get the good money that we had desired for our produce. The apple box that usually used to fetch us ₹1,100 to 1,300 is currently sold at ₹600 to 700 per box,” he says, adding that if the market doesn’t stabilise then they will lose huge money. “Due to slump in mandis, we haven’t paid to growers from whom we had purchased apples. All this is due to apples from Iran,” he said.Adil’s brother Asif too is perturbed due to the present market condition. “We had been eyeing to earn good money, but now we fear losses,” he said.From the last two weeks, growers across Kashmir have expressed concern over the sale of Iranian apples in mandis without the imposition of tax. At Sopore and Srinagar fruit mandis where apples are brought by big commission agents, the growers held protests after they failed to fetch a good price for their produce.As per official records, 7 lakh farming families (approximately 35 lakh people) are directly or indirectly associated with the sector. The apple trade contributes to around 8% of the UT’s GDP and the government is trying to increase production by introducing high-density plantations.Growers allege that the arrival of apples from Iran has increased from the last year which is damaging the fruit industry not only in Kashmir but also in Himachal Pradesh.“Compared to the previous year, this time production was very good in Kashmir. Till Diwali we had good business. Once the apples started arriving from Iran, the rates have come down more than 50 percent,” said Bashir Ahmad Bhat, president, Kashmir Valley Fruit Growers-cum-Dealers Union.He said, “If we have our production then why we are allowing apples from Iran here. This will ruin not only the apple industry in Kashmir but also in Himachal Pradesh. We have brought this issue to the notice of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union agriculture minister and other officials but so far the issue hasn’t been resolved.”Bhat said that allowing apples from Iran via Mumbai, Cochin ports or Afghanistan via the Wagah border will cause severe damage to the trade. “Last year Iranian apple came via Afghanistan without any tax and everybody knows that Afghanistan doesn’t produce apples. We fear if things aren’t stopped in coming years, the quantum of apples from Iran will see a spike and there won’t be any takers for our apples,” he said.Even J&K’s horticulture department has shot a letter to the Central government highlighting the issue of import of Iranian apple/kiwi under the name of Afghanistan that has certain tax relaxation and sought regulation of import of apples from Iran to safeguard the local apple industry of J&K and Himachal Pradesh.Director, horticulture, Ajaz Ahmad said more than 16 lakh metric tonnes of apple have been exported from Kashmir and sold already this season. “This time1.87 lakh metric tonnes are in cold stores. I don’t think the apple from Iran has any potential to damage our industry. Usually, the apples stored in cold stores are sold April onwards,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/iranian-apples-in-mandis-worry-kashmir-growers-write-to-pm-narendra-modi-101642537434332.html

I congratulate the bridegroom, though. Our high command is intelligent and whatever decision it will take, it will be in the interest of the state. I have trust in the people of Punjab that they will vote for ‘Punjab model’, a roadmap for the state’s future. Sidhu stands by the roadmap; Sidhu stands for giving a better life to the people of Punjab. Getting power for the heck of it is not Sidhu’s interest,” he said at a press conference in Amritsar on Tuesday. He said the ‘Punjab model’ will end the ‘thekedari’ (contract) system, bring the state’s money back and invest in people’s welfare. “Complete government control over sand mining is the only solution. ‘Punjab model’ proposes the formation of Punjab State Mining Corporation to disband the ‘thekedari’ system and to sell sand at a fixed rate and date. As long as the ‘thekedari’ system exists, people won’t have access to cheaper sand,” he said. “The ‘Punjab model’ policy includes state-owned stockyards, online booking, delivery on fixed date through GPS-fitted trucks. This will provide cheap sand to the people and earn the exchequer about ₹2,000-3000 crore extra on yearly basis besides creating 60,000 jobs for the youth,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/i-congratulate-the-groom-but-wedding-in-voters-hands-sidhu-on-bhagwant-mann-as-aap-s-cm-face-101642537266281.html

19-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Covid vaccination numbers go down as residents fear infection at sites||Amid rising Covid infections, Chandigarh’s daily vaccination figures are seeing a consistent dip. Health officials feel that residents are avoiding visiting vaccination centres and hospitals, fearing infection at these sites. On Tuesday, the city recorded only 968 vaccinations even as two weeks ago, on January 4, it had recorded its highest ever single-inoculations with 14,627 getting jabbed.UT’s director, health services, Dr Suman Singh said, “As cases are going up, people are not willing to visit vaccination centres or hospitals. Over 9,000 people in the city are presently infected and in mandatory isolation. Their family members (even if they are not infected) are in quarantine. However, these people, despite their eligibility, cannot move out and get vaccinated.”She added that people are now contacting health workers through helpline numbers (see box) and requesting vaccination at home. “We are going to their doorsteps and administering the doses,” she added. Jittery wait as city close to 100% vaccinationDue to the slow-pace of vaccination drive, UT has already missed its target of fully vaccinating its entire eligible population by December 31, 2021. According to the latest electoral list and central government’s set target, there are around 8.43 lakh adults eligible for vaccination in Chandigarh. For the last four days, the vaccination percentage has been stuck between 98% and 99%.UT health secretary Yashpal Garg said, “Until Monday, the city had around 91,000 people who had taken the first dose of Covid vaccine, but had not turned up for the second dose even after the completion of the time gap between both doses. We are contacting each one of them are asking them to get vaccinated.” ‘Youngsters enthusiastic, precaution dose evokes dull response’According to the eligible population projected by the central government, about 72,000 children, aged 15 to 18, are eligible for vaccination in Chandigarh. Since January 3, UT health department has vaccinated 46,869 (65%) children with the first dose while they are expecting to meet their vaccination target by January 26. However, for the precaution dose, the response has been dull. Since January 10, only 2,325 healthcare workers (9% of the target), 2,055 frontline workers (9%), and 3,578 (23%) comorbid senior citizens (above the age of 60) have taken the precautionary jab in UT.“Since healthcare workers, frontline workers and co-morbid senior citizens are more vulnerable to catching the infection, they should get vaccinated with the boaster at the earliest,” said Garg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-covid-vaccination-numbers-go-down-as-residents-fear-infection-at-sites-101642536954234.html
19-01-2022||Chandigarh||SSM’s poll plunge will have no bearing on AAP prospects in Punjab: Bhagwant Mann||Why should people vote for AAP? People have made up their minds to vote for us. In 2017, they trusted Capt (Amarinder Singh) thinking he was the same Capt of 2002-07. Prashant Kishor also got them to make lofty promises. People feel cheated because the Congress didn’t fulfil its promises and tried to wriggle out by replacing Capt with Channi just 70-80 days ago. This will not work as Channi and others were part of his team. We are doing positive politics, laying out our roadmap. ‘Khazana vi bharange, debt vi clear karange aur logan nu facilities vi dewange’. There is a feeling that Sanyukt Samaj Morcha set up by farmer bodies will dent AAP. Kejriwal Ji also conceded this. What’s your sense? SSM is a political party. Let’s stop calling them farmers. They are fighting elections and the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (an umbrella organisation that spearheaded the farmers’ stir) has already announced that the unions contesting the elections are not part of it. People are very intelligent. They know very well who is going to dent whom, who is splitting votes, and who is helping whom. I don’t think there will be much loss to us. You haven’t been campaigning hard so far. Why? Circumstances were such due to Covid-19 first and then the EC restrictions. But the EC guidelines suit us. We are specialists of door-to-door campaign. We forced those who used to get votes by waiving their hands from helicopters to go door to door. We have passionate people in our social media teams. Their people are on salary. If restrictions are relaxed, I will switch gears and hold rallies. In 2014 and 2017, AAP’s footprint was limited to just Malwa and absent from Majha and Doaba. Have you made up? The response we are getting these regions is competing with Malwa. Our ‘Tiranga Yatra’ in Pathankot and Jalandhar saw good turnouts. I got huge response in Patti. We will do very well in all three regions. Allegations are that AAP is being run from Delhi. What do you have to say? Is the Congress run from Bhucho Mandi? Every third day Channi or Sidhu are called (to Delhi). Does Harish Chaudhary belong to Mansa? Where are Gajendra Shekhawat, Hardeep Puri and Meenakshi Lekhi from? Ours is a national party. It is headquartered in Delhi. This does not mean that decisions are taken in Delhi. All decisions are taken by Punjab leadership. In 2017, you did well in reserved constituencies. How will Channi’s appointment as the first SC chief minister impact the electoral dynamics? We don’t do caste politics. We talk about 2.75 crore Punjabis. When we say that we will transform schools, who will benefit from it – the poor, and ditto for hospitals. We are getting same response from every section.

Police have recovered mobile phones, laptops and debit cards from their possession. The victim, Kirandeep of Sector 21, stated in her police complaint that she had befriended a person who called himself Richard through a social media platform. He told her that he would be sending her a gift. Initially, she refused, but gave in after he insisted. She said that on November 3, she got a call from a courier company saying that Richard from England had sent her a parcel and to claim it, she needs to deposit ₹40,000 in their account, which she did. But, she did not receive any parcel and called the courier company, who told her that the parcel contains expensive items, so she has to deposit more money for customs, police and finance department clearances. Meanwhile, Richard told her that he had sent her gold sets in the parcel. So, Kirandeep ended up depositing ₹13.31 lakh into the courier company’s account. But, when she did not receive the parcel, she lodged a complaint. Acting on her complaint, a cheating case was registered at the Sector 19 police station on December 6, 2021.The accused were produced in court on Tuesday, from where Satvinder was sent to judicial custody while Ifeanyi was sent to four days in police remand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nigerian-national-among-2-held-for-cheating-chandigarh-woman-of-rs-13-32-lakh-101642536594105.html
19-01-2022||Chandigarh||Haryana government provided 70k jobs in seven years: Ambala MP||Member of Parliament from Ambala constituency and former Union minister Rattan Lal Kataria on Tuesday said that the BJP-led Haryana government has provided 70,000 jobs in the last seven years. “All these jobs are permanent and there are several projects underway that will further provide more jobs to the youth. The government has already probed the job recruitment scam in HPSC thoroughly,” Kataria claimed.He was responding to reporters on being asked about Haryana having the highest unemployment rate in India as per a report released in December last year. The BJP MP was in Ambala to chair a meeting of the District Development Coordination and Monitoring Committee and addressed a press conference after that. As per the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) report released in December, Haryana topped the nation with the highest unemployment rate at 34%, followed by Rajasthan (27.1%) and Jharkhand (17.3%), against the national average of 7.91%. However, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar rejected the report, dubbing it “fictional” and said that the rate is only 6.1% in Haryana and action will be taken against CMIE.Meanwhile, Kataria said that the farmer groups led by Balbir Singh Rajewal and Gurnam Singh Charuni contesting elections in Punjab will remain unsuccessful and that BJP will win in the state and also retain power in four other states where the assembly elections are scheduled for February.The BJP lawmaker said that he will seek several new projects for his constituency in the upcoming budget session including renovating Ambala Cantt station as a world-class facility, a logistics hub and a defence corridor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-government-provided-70k-jobs-in-seven-years-ambala-mp-101642536414249.html
19-01-2022||Chandigarh||60% of Chandigarh tricity area’s Covid deaths in January were of unvaccinated||Around 60% of people, who succumbed to Covid-19 in the tricity since January 1, had not taken a single dose of vaccine, data available with the health departments shows.Since January 1, as many as 33 Covid-19 patients have died at various hospitals across the tricity. Of them, as many as 20 people had not got even a single dose; one person had received the first dose while 10 people were fully jabbed. The vaccination status of two people-- one from Chandigarh and the other from Panchkula – has not been ascertained.Of the three jurisdictions, Mohali remains the worst-affected with 18 fatalities this month. For the Mohali health department, it is a cause of worry as despite door-to-door vaccination drives and awareness campaigns, 16 out of the 18 deceased were not even vaccinated with first dose. The other two were fully vaccinated.Dr Girish Dogra, nodal officer for Covid-19 in Mohali, said: “Despite setting up awareness camps and conducting special drives, people are not coming forward to get jabbed. Vaccination is definitely helping in reducing the severity of infection. The first dose of vaccine helps in building antibodies, but without a booster dose, the antibodies are insufficient to fight the virus. In Mohali, over 2 lakh people have not turned up for their second dose. People must end vaccination hesitancy.”In Chandigarh, seven of the 12 deceased were fully vaccinated while one had taken only the first dose. But, three had not received any dose. So far, Panchkula reported three fatalities this month, with one person being fully vaccinated and the other not even being vaccinated with first dose.‘Most died of co-morbidities’As per the UT health department, all 12 deceased in the city were suffering from co-morbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, and heart or kidney related illnesses. In Panchkula and Mohali too, the deceased had co-morbid conditions and most of them were above the age of 50.‘Fatality rate low this time only because of vaccination’Dr Sanjeev Palta, the nodal officer of ICU management at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, said, “During the first and second wave of the pandemic, the fatality and hospitalisation rates were much higher than the ongoing third peak. This is because vaccination is helping in lowering the severity of the infection and most people requiring hospitalisation or dying, these days, are either not vaccinated or have co-morbidities. So, people must get vaccinated at the earliest so as to protect themselves from severe infection.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/60-of-chandigarh-tricity-area-s-covid-deaths-in-january-were-of-unvaccinated-101642536354178.html

While disposing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by advocate HC Arora, a division bench comprising chief justice RS Jha and justice Arun Palli, recorded a statement by the additional advocate general, Haryana, that the January 6 representation of Arora will be considered by the authorities and all possible steps to save the tress on either side of the Morni-Panchkula Road will be taken while undertaking the widening project. In his PIL, Arora stated that government is going ahead with the uprooting/ cutting of 1,137 trees, which include 175 pine trees, and the remaining Khair trees, for the purpose of widening of the road. The petitioner alleged that he had submitted a representation to the chief secretary requesting that all steps and alternatives be considered for the purpose of saving maximum number of trees, while carrying out the project, but the respondents were going ahead with the uprooting/cutting of the trees standing on either side of the road, without first considering the various alternatives to save more than 1,100 of them. It is necessary to maintain a balance between the environment and development, but unfortunately, the state was considering only the aspect of development and construction of the road, while totally ignoring the duty to protect the environment by protecting the trees, he had submitted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/widening-of-morni-panchkula-road-hc-directs-haryana-to-explore-all-possible-alternatives-to-cutting-trees-101642535694434.html

Verma pointed out that the UPPCL had to buy power from the Lalitur plant at a very high rate due the inflated capital cost and the UPPCL finally passed the cost on to consumers.The UPPCL in 2015 evaluated the ceiling capital cost of the plant to be ₹16006 crore and on Monday it submitted an affidavit in the UP Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC) saying the initial capital cost of the plant could not be more than ₹11848 crore.“This is in the reference to Hon’ble UPERC order dated 23-03-2015, regarding submission of ceiling capital cost of Lalitpur Power Project (3x660 MW).

19-01-2022||Noida||Pandemic, ECI curbs hold back independents from filing papers in Ghaziabad||With the last date of filing nominations (January 21) drawing nearer, candidates of several parties are filing their nominations in Ghaziabad district, while independent candidates are yet to file their papers for the upcoming assembly polls.The Uttar Pradesh assembly election is scheduled to be held from February 10 to March 7 in seven phases. Ghaziabad goes to polls in phase 1 of the election on February 10. Under phase 1, candidates began filing their nominations on January 14. Nominations will be scrutinised on January 24, and the last date of withdrawal of nominations is January 27, according to the Election Commission of India (ECI). According to the latest electoral roll, there are 2,899,484 eligible voters in the five assembly segments -- Loni, Muradnagar, Sahibabad, Ghaziabad and Modinagar -- of the district. According to official records of the district election office, nominations have so far been filed by Prerna Solanki (Muradnagar) from Nyay Party, Manoj Kumar Sharma (Muradnagar) from Subhashwadi Bharatiya Samajwadi Party, Nand Kishor Gurjar (Loni) from Bharatiya Janata Party, and Chhavi Yadav from the Aam Aadmi Party, Amarpal Sharma from Samajwadi Party and Sunil Sharma from the BJP have filed their nominations from Sahibabad. Sushant Goyal (Ghaziabad) from the Congress, Rakesh Suri (Ghaziabad) from the Right to Recall Party and Sudesh Sharma (Modinagar) from Rashtriya Lok Dal have also filed their nominations.“This time, the pandemic has affected the prospects of independent candidates. I was not socially active during the pandemic and the campaigning will also not be easy due to the restrictions imposed by ECI on account of the rising Covid cases. Supporters will also not come out. Due to all these factors, I have decided not to contest the elections this time,” said Shamsher Rana, who contested the 2017 elections as an independent candidate from Ghaziabad. “It is not easy to contest elections as an independent candidate as we have to find funds for campaigning. Further, over a period of time, independent candidates have also understood that people vote more for political parties. Not to mention the difficulty in campaigning during a pandemic. All these factors are holding back independent candidates this time,” said Rajiv Sharma, who contested the 2017 elections as an independent candidate from the Sahibabad assembly constituency. In the 2017 assembly elections, two of the six candidates contesting from Loni were independents while three of the 11 candidates from Sahibabad were independents. From Ghaziabad, five of 13 contesting candidates were independent, while seven of 14 candidates who contested from Muradnagar were independents. From Modinagar, three of the nine candidates were independents. Experts said the present trend of elections is more focussed on political parties. “Over time, voters have shown an inclination towards major political parties. During the elections held in the past, many people contested as independents. However, social interactions have reduced due to the pandemic and expenditure on election campaigns is also taxing,” said associate professor (history) KK Sharma from MM College, Modinagar.“The current trend of fewer independent candidates has put less burden on state resources. A separate ballot unit needs to be installed if the number of candidates contesting from an assembly is more than 16. Although anyone can contest elections in a democracy, independents have also figured out that their chances of winning an election are slim while contesting against bigger parties, which have huge resources at their disposal,” he added. District election officer RK Singh could not be reached for his comments despite repeated attempts on Tuesday. With regard to past performance, official records show that the option of ‘None of the above’ (NOTA) garnered more votes than independent candidates during the 2017 assembly elections. People from Muradnagar voted on Nota, which received 1,053 votes -- higher than the highest number of votes -- 770 -- garnered by an independent candidate in the 2017 assembly elections. In Sahibabad, Nota received 3,057 votes compared to 1,205 votes received by the candidate who polled the highest among independents. In Ghaziabad, Nota received 1,184 votes. Only the votes polled for one independent candidate from this seat was higher (2,136 votes) than the total votes Nota received. In Modinagar, 1,074 people voted for Nota compared to the 490 votes received by the best-performing independent candidate, while in Loni, only one independent candidate secured 3,808 votes, higher than the 1,663 votes Nota received.

Since Khaira is in judicial custody, his son Mehtab Singh Khaira gave consent to the letter on his father’s behalf. Besides Sonia, copies of the letter were also sent to former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu and state affairs in-charge Harish Chaudhary. In the letter, the signatories alleged that ‘tainted’ Rana Gurjeet, who had to resign as a minister in 2018 over his alleged involvement in a sand mining scam, is trying his best to harm the party in the forthcoming elections. They further said the minister was weakening the Congress by interfering in the party affairs of various constituencies of Doaba region. “Though we had apprised the state leadership about his anti-party activities, unfortunately, he was reinstated in the Punjab cabinet,” the letter reads. “Rana Gurjeet has allowed his son to contest as an independent candidate from Sultanpur Lodhi against the two-time Congress MLA Navtej Singh Cheema. This is a gross violation of the party discipline. He is playing into the hands of opposition parties, especially the BJP,” mentions the letter. The signatories alleged that Rana Gurjeet was still close to former CM Capt Amarinder Singh and he recently facilitated his close aide Amandeep Singh’s entry into Capt’s Punjab Lok Congress party who is a probable candidate from Bholath. “Besides this, Rana Gurjeet is making baseless allegations against PPCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu,” they said.

Bajwa had lost to sitting Dhillon in 2012, while Bitti had lost to Dhillon in 2017.For the Jagraon assembly seat, which is reserved for the Scheduled Caste community, Congress leaders Malkit Singh Dakha, Buta Singh’s daughter Gurkeerat Kaur, Punjab State Safai Karamchari Commission chairperson Gejja Ram Valmiki and sitting Raikot MLA Jagtar Singh Hissowal are aspiring for a ticket. Hissowal, a former Aam Aadmi Party leader, had not been given a ticket from Raikot and is hoping to get one from Jagraon. Whoever gets the ticket will have to go against sitting MLA Saravjit Kaur Manuke of AAP, who is the deputy leader of opposition. During the previous assembly elections, Dakha had lost to Manuke.In Samrala, sitting MLA Amrik Singh Dhillon is seeking a ticket for his grandson Karanvir Singh Dhillon this time. However, the party is yet to take a final call.Those privy to the development say the Congress is expected to announce the candidates soon.Gill, Samrala in eye of the stormMany eyebrows were raised after the party reserved the decision to announce the candidates from Gill and Samrala constituencies, which are represented by sitting Congress MLAs – Kuldeep Vaid and four-time MLA Amrik Singh Dhillon, respectively, especially as the party had given tickets to six other sitting MLAs — cabinet ministers Bharat Bhushan Ashu (Ludhiana West) and Gurkirat Kotli (Khanna), MLAs Rakesh Pandey (Ludhiana North), Sanjay Talwar (Ludhiana East), Surinder Dawar (Ludhiana Central) and Lakhvir Lakha (Payal).In Gill (reserved seat for SC community), the names of Lehra and Congress leader Balbir Singh Barewal are doing the rounds, and the party high command is yet to decide whether it wants to continue with Vaid or not. Recently a group of sarpanches and their supporters had protested against Vaid for his “poor performance” , and backed Barewal instead. Vaid had however refuted the allegations as an “attempt to defame him.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-assembly-polls-congress-ticket-aspirants-in-ludhiana-bank-on-political-connections-101642534613757.html

19-01-2022||Noida||Noida authority to organise camps for mandatory registration of all pets on app||The Noida authority has decided to hold camps for the registration of pets in residential areas of the city, said officials on Tuesday.The mobile application -- Noida Pet Registration App -- was launched in September 2021. It is mandatory for all residents to register their pets on the app. The registration costs ₹500, and must be renewed every year at the same price. However, the app received a lukewarm response.The authority officials have appealed to the apartment owners’ associations (AOAs) in the city to make a list of pet owners in their respective housing complexes to facilitate the registration process.“Since the launch of the application last year, only 156 pets from Noida have been registered on the app, which is a very low count. So, we have decided to hold camps with the help of all the AOAs,” said Husana Praveen, coordinator for the initiative from the Noida authority. Six representatives from the Noida authority will hold the camp at residential areas, she added.“At the camp, residents do not need to download the mobile app for registration. The representatives will add the details of the pets on the mobile app and take the registration fee instead. For this process, residents need to submit their ID, photograph, address proof and their pet’s vaccination book,” Praveen said, adding that the pets will also be eligible for free vaccination by the Noida authority on completion of the registration.According to Rajiva Singh, president of Noida Federation of Apartment Owners’ Association (NOFAA), which comprises over 70 housing complexes as members, “All AOAs have been instructed to make a list of residents who have pets. This will be shared with the officials of the Noida authority. Representatives from the authority will visit a cluster of housing complexes or sectors on a pre-scheduled date and organise a camp to facilitate registration of pets in the respective housing complexes.”

As part of their drive, cops will be carrying out surprise checks at shops selling or fitting modified silencers on vehicles. Saying that the sound emitted by the modified silencers often creates panic amid residents, who fear that a gunshot has been discharged, assistant commissioner of police (ACP, Traffic Zone 2) Karnail Singh held a meeting with spare parts dealers and warned them against selling the banned silencers.Over the past two days, the police have issued challans to 28 violators, and have asked them to name the seller of the modified silencer. The ACP said that action will also be taken against the mechanic for fitting silencers on the vehicles.In a similar drive, cops had issued 1,523 challans to offenders in two months in 2021. Such silencers are available in the city at different spare part shops at very reasonable prices.RTI activist Rohit Sabharwal had raised the issue in 2021 and had also filed a contempt petition before court.

In all, 12 nominations were filed on Tuesday in the Braj region, including three in Agra, five in Mathura and four in Aligarh. Many blamed the cold weather for the low nomination turnout on Tuesday, but most party workers held that it was ‘padwa’ (pratipada) or the first day of ‘paksh’ (fortnight of Hindi calendar) and thus not a good day for beginnings. “Our party candidate will file nomination on Wednesday and Tuesday was avoided as it was ‘padwa’ and no auspicious task is begun on this day,” said a party office-bearer on condition of anonymity.None of the BJP candidates in Agra and Aligarh filed nominations on Tuesday and in a press release issued by Media Cell for BJP in Aligarh, it was informed that BJP candidates Sandeep Singh for Atrauli, Ravendra Pal Singh for Charra, Rajkumar Sahyogi for Iglas, Anup Pradhan for Kair and Jaiveer Singh for Baroli will file nomination in Aligarh on Wednesday.“Yes it was ‘padwa’ today and many avoid beginning an important task on this day although there is more to this belief. It was ‘padwa’ today but it was Pushya Nakshatra (lunar mansion of Hindu astrology) and is a rare occasion of good luck but not many are aware about it and thus prefer to avoid filing nomination papers on the day of ‘padwa’” said Mahant Yogesh Puri from Mankameshwar Temple in Agra. It is believed that filing of papers will rise from Wednesday onward before the last day of nomination: Friday, January 21. However, on Tuesday, four nomination papers were filed in Aligarh, by Pintu Kumar from Bhartiya Mahasangh Party for Khair assembly seat, Narendra Kumar Sharma from Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) for Baroli assembly seat, Satish Lodhi, an independent for Charra assembly seat and Jafar Alam from Samajwadi Party for Aligarh city assembly seat.

19-01-2022||Chandigarh||Haryana vigilance arrests HCS officer in bribery case||The Haryana State Vigilance Bureau has arrested Amrinder Singh Manais, an HCS officer, accused of involvement in a bribery case while he was holding additional charge of district transport officer, Ambala during the leave period of the regular incumbent.The 2019 batch HCS officer, who holds additional charge of estate officer of Haryana Sehari Vikas Pradhikaran Kaithal, was arrested from his office in Kaithal’s mini-secretariat soon after he reached the office on Tuesday morning.Deputy inspector general vigilance (Ambala) Ashok Kumar said the officer was arrested in a case of corruption during his previous posting in Ambala. As per an official communication sent to Haryana chief secretary’s office by the office of DIG (vigilance), the accused was arrested in a case registered on December 17 last year under Sections 7 and 7A of the Prevention of Corruption Act and Section 120 of the Indian Penal Code.The arrest was made following allegations by a Kaithal-based transporter Devraj, who accused Manais and other officials of taking ₹6.50 lakh to allow inspection-free movement of overloaded vehicles on highways. The matter was reported in September last year when Ambala DTO Gauri Midha was on leave and Manais, the then DTO of Panchkula, was given the additional charge of DTO Ambala temporarily. Reacting to the complaint, the vigilance bureau had started an investigation and arrested Ambala-based agent Gurpreet Singh, assistant sub-inspector Jaspal Singh, who was posted in the DTO’s inspection team, and DTO’s driver Karanvir Shergill in the case. Later, ASI Jaspal Singh agreed to become a witness in the case and recently named the then DTO for his involvement in the racket.While giving this information, a vigilance bureau spokesperson said three accused who had been arrested in the case had disclosed the modus operandi adopted by the accused officer in the scandal.During investigation, sufficient evidence has come on records to show that after taking over charge, the accused HCS officer had established a network of subordinate officials and agents and obtained illegal gratification through them for allowing overloaded vehicles to ply in his jurisdiction, following which, the arrest was made on Tuesday.The spokesperson said, “The probe will further help in getting to the bottom of the matter and the possibility of involvement of other accused cannot be ruled out. Strict action will be taken against all culprits as per law.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-vigilance-arrests-hcs-officer-in-bribery-case-101642533053586.html
19-01-2022||Delhi||AAP MLA seeks legal action against sale of ‘school land’ by North MCD||Aam Aadmi Party MLA Somnath Bharti on Tuesday sought legal action against the sale of land belonging to schools by North MCD, a claim that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which rules the MCD, dismissed as baseless.Bharti said that he raised the issue of commercialisation of land given by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to the MCD for development of schools. “I raised this issue in the DDA meeting, chaired by the Lieutenant Governor (LG), on Tuesday. The land in Delhi principally belongs to the DDA, and it is the DDA which gives properties to everyone. So all this land, which is now being sold by the MCD, was once given by the DDA to the MCD for building schools. But, instead of utilising this land meant for developing the schools, the BJP-ruled MCD is selling it. I submitted a request to the LG in writing, asking him to save MCD schools. The DDA should take action on it and hand over all MCD schools to the AAP-ruled Delhi government. The way Arvind Kejriwal has made Delhi’s schools world-class, he will also transform the schools under the MCD,” he said. Refuting the allegations, the Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that the AAP leaders are blowing this issue out of proportion. “The AAP, leaders, in an apparent competition, repeat the same lie many times. The North MCD has repeatedly clarified that no school land is being sold and actually car parking are being constructed under PPP model on the demand of local residents and traders. The lands near schools in Shalimar Bagh and Bank Street (Karol Bagh) were allotted 6-7 years ago by the DDA to the North MCDs. But as this is the election year, they are simply creating a brouhaha,” said Kapoor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aapmlaseeks-legal-action-against-sale-of-school-land-by-north-mcd-101642532873388.html

He alleged that as per local farmers, the gas was released on the intervening night of January 14 and 15 following which, the crop got damaged and people complained of pains in their eyes. He alleged that the impact could be seen on all crops, especially wheat and mustard.He said earlier, the local farmers tried to take up the issue with officials of the refinery but they were not ready to listen to the farmers following which they had to hold protests.He threatened to intensify their agitation and launch an indefinite protest if the refinery did not give compensation to the farmers. After protests of hours, the refinery management called a delegation of farmers for talks and agreed to get the affected areas examined by the agricultural experts and sought two days from the protesting farmers.On the other hand, the refinery officials have refuted the allegations and called them baseless. They said the refinery never releases any poisonous gas and the recent rainfall and bad weather could also be a reason behind the damaged crop. And yet, they will conduct a survey of the affected areas and an inspection team of the refinery officials has already been formed.In 2019, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had held the IOCL refinery responsible for violating environmental norms and spreading pollution in nearby villages and directed the IOCL officials to deposit a sum of ₹17.31 crore and later, ₹25 crore, in 2019 and 2020, respectively, as interim compensation for restoration of the environment, subject to further orders.The interim orders were issued on the reports of the joint committee formed by the NGT to assess the damage caused by the refinery to environment and human health following a complaint by the locals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/poisonous-gas-from-panipat-refinery-damaged-crops-allege-farmers-101642532756227.html

19-01-2022||Delhi||2 BSF personnel killed, 3 others injured after ambulance overturns in NE Delhi||Two personnel of the Border Security Force (BSF) were killed and at least three others injured after an ambulance that was carrying them to a hospital in Shahdara overturned in Shastri Park area of northeast Delhi on Monday, police said on Tuesday.A police officer said the BSF’s ambulance was carrying the personnel to a hospital in Shahdara around 8.30am, when the vehicle overturned while trying to save a man who was crossing the road in Shastri Park. Locals rushed the five personnel to GTB and JPN hospitals.The dead BSF personnel were identified as Yashvir Malik, 51, and Manoj Paswan,31. Malik was declared brought dead at JPN hospital while Paswan died at GTB hospital, the officer said.They were posted to BSF’s 165 battalion in Sector 26, Rohini. Malik, who belonged to Shamli in Uttar Pradesh, was a head constable, and Paswan, from Jharkhand’s Hazaribagh, was a constable. The injured personnel KS Gupta, Praveen (known by his first name), and Arun Kumar were discharged after treatment.A case was registered at the Shastri Park police station and the bodies of the dead personnel were handed over to their families after an autopsy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/2-bsf-personnel-killed-3-others-injured-after-ambulance-overturns-in-nedelhi-101642532213494.html
19-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi Police register suo motu FIR against derogatory Clubhouse chat||The Delhi Police on Tuesday registered an FIR (first information report) against unknown persons over an offensive chat on Clubhouse, a social audio network, in which participants could be heard making derogatory comments about Muslim women. Clips of the taped audio conversation have since been widely shared on social media platforms and though HT could not independently verify the authenticity of a 2.20 minute leaked audio clip that it is in possession of, the screen showed that there were at least 70 to 80 participants in the particular Clubhouse discussion.This is the third such case in the past eight months, wherein offensive photographs or messages were posted online to target Muslim women. The first was the “Sulli Deals” app on GitHub in July and the second was the “Bulli Deals” app, which was flagged earlier this month. Both apps featured doctored photographs of prominent Muslim women along with offensive and derogatory comments about them. They were taken down after widespread outrage and the police registering cases against five men for creating the two apps. Police have maintained that the two alleged app developers -- Neeraj Bishnoi, a BTech student, and Aumkareshwar Thakur, a freelance web developer -- were self-radicalised.In the Clubhouse case, the audio clips revealed participants purportedly making offensive comments about Muslim women during a discussion session that took place on Monday afternoon. The clip has since been widely circulated on other platforms, leading to public outcry. On Tuesday, the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) issued a notice to the Delhi Police’s cybercrime unit, the Intelligence Fusion Strategic Operations (IFSO), seeking details of the action taken. The DCW also sought to know from the police why no one has been arrested in the matter so far.KPS Malhotra, chief of the IFSO, said, “ We have filed a case suo motu against unidentified persons. The case has been filed under Indian Penal Code sections of 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion), 295A (deliberate and malicious act, intended to outrage religious feelings), and 354A (sexual harassment). We have started the probe.”Clubhouse is a social audio app, where members can participate and listen in on chat sessions and discussions based on their topics of interest. The app has in the past been banned by a few countries after participants took part in similar offensive discussions.In response to HT’s email seeking a comment on the matter, a Clubhouse spokesperson said, “Clubhouse is a place for people around the world to spend time with friends, meet others, engage in discussions and learn. There is absolutely no place for hate or abuse on the platform. We invest significantly in keeping our community safe and take swift action at any violation of our policies. In this instance, the room was reported and those involved in organising were quickly actioned.” The spokesperson added that community health is a top priority for the platform and Clubhouse has built features such as room title reporting, blocking, shared block lists, removing replays, and NSFW filters, and improved policies to keep a check on real-time voice conversations and group discussions.The investigation into the two offensive apps had initially hit a road block, after GitHub -- the platform where the apps were hosted -- refused to share details of its users -- the persons who had created the app. Delhi Police was able to trace the alleged culprits and make arrests after one of the them, Neeraj Bishnoi, masked his identity on Twitter and claimed responsibility for the app. Bishnoi was arrested from his house in Jorhat, Assam. It was on his “confession statement” that police arrested Thakur from Indore, Bhopal. Thakur, police said, is the creator of the second GitHub app. Police have said the two men knew each other on social media platforms and were part of the same groups where the idea to come up with such apps was first discussed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-register-suo-motu-fir-against-derogatory-clubhouse-chat-101642532153289.html
19-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi CP writes to central armed police forces, seeks officers on deputation||Paving the way for lateral entry of personnel from Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs), the Delhi Police has written to the heads of the five forces to send their personnel on deputation for an initial period of three years.According to a copy of the letter seen by HT, there are 700 posts available for lateral entry between the ranks of constables and inspectors. The letter was sent by Asthana’s office on January 10, addressed to the chiefs of the paramilitary forces(CAPFs) asking them to send applications of “willing and eligible” personnel for a period of three years, which could be extended to five years.The five central forces include Border Security Force (BSF), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), and Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB).According to the letter, 375 constables, 60 head constables, 20 sub-inspectors and 5 inspectors would be posted to different police units within the force. And, 240 constables on deputation would be those who are experts in units such as finger print bureau, dog handling, drill instruction and unarmed combat.The five forces must also send a “vigilance clearance and integrity” certificate of the candidate when applying for the post, the letter said. The heads of the CAPFs must also send the annual confidential report(ACR) along with details of major or minor penalties, if any, that the candidates have received. The candidates must be less than 56 years old, according to the letter.To be sure, this is not the first time that junior police personnel from forces such as CRPF, BSF or CISF will be joining Delhi police. There are many serving inspectors and ACPs, who joined Delhi police from CISF and CRPF on deputation and were later inducted into the force.But, this will be the first time that recruitment on such scale is being done.“The lateral entrants will be posted in specific departments, where their expertise could be used. For example, an inspector from CISF could join the security department. Security is an important issue in the national Capital today,” a police officer, who asked not to be named, said.Senior officers, especially those who are from the Indian Police Service (IPS) are regularly transferred from the Delhi Police to the paramilitary forces and vice versa. Until his appointment as the Delhi police commissioner, Asthana was the chief of the Border Security Force (BSF). Former commissioner SN Shrivastava was in the CRPF when he was appointed the Delhi police chief in February 2020.Junior Delhi police personnel such as constables or mid-level ones such as inspectors also join CBI and NIA on deputation.Retired Delhi police ACP, Rajender Singh, who served the force for over three decades, said, “If you look at the larger picture, this is a very good initiative. A trained person from an outside force will use his/her experience and improve police’s productivity. At the same time, the police headquarters should ensure that only deserving candidates are selected. The headquarters must also maintain balance between serving police personnel and those on deputation when it comes to delegation of responsibilities. There should not be mistrust. No one should feel at a disadvantage in terms of promotion or posting.”Another police expert, advocate LN Rao, who retired as a DCP in Delhi police, said such experiments have in the past yielded little success. “Senior officers from outside come here in leadership roles and deliver give good results. The present commissioner came from BSF and is doing well for Delhi police. But at the junior level, a transfer like this may not work. Instead of getting people from outside, the police headquarters must promote their own personnel or quickly fill up the vacancies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cp-writes-to-central-armed-police-forces-seeks-officers-on-deputation-101642531973516.html
19-01-2022||Delhi||Omicron behind most fresh Covid cases in Delhi||The Capital added 11,684 new cases of Covid-19, according to the health bulletin released on Tuesday that showed a drastic drop in the share of tests turning positive, reinforcing signs that the outbreak may have begun to taper.Officials aware of the matter said they will continue to watch these trends further to take any decision on restrictions, while experts separately said Omicron is now virtually the only variant causing infections in the city, which has helped keep hospitalisation rates low. Senior officials of Delhi’s government’s health department said the share of Omicron variant in community samples sent for genome sequencing has been consistently increasing, reaching nearly 95% in the last week, up from 62% in the last week of December. “Omicron is definitely the dominant variant in the city currently and that is a sigh of relief for us because generally among patients, the symptoms are milder compared to the earlier variants. The hospital admissions are also lower because the infection under this variant is not impacting the lungs of patients,” said a senior health official, asking not to be named. SK Sarin, director of the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS)—among the labs that conduct genome sequencing of Covid-19 samples in Delhi—said similar trends were seen at his facility with nearly 90-95% samples among the total samples tested in Delhi turning out to be of the Omicron variant. “People are largely testing positive for Omicron in Delhi currently and its share has shown a steep rise since December. Almost 90-95% of the cases being tested are of the Omicron variant,” Sarin said. The rise of the variant has been drastic. Delhi government data showed that the variant comprised 65% of all infections in the first week of January, growing to 81% in the samples sequenced the following week, according to government data. The variant is the most transmissible version of the Sars-CoV-2 yet, and has led to near vertical case trajectories in the countries where it has taken hold. But the hospital rate has remained under control, with over 85% of the bed strength in the capital still available. Only 2,730 of the 15,606 beds in dedicated Covid-19 hospitals have been occupied, data released by the government showed. The bulletin also showed that on Tuesday, 38 people succumbed to the infection, the highest since January 12 when the city reported 40 Covid deaths. A little over 52,000 Covid tests were conducted over the last 24 hours, according to the health bulletin. The number of tests carried out has fallen after a change in testing guidelines said those without symptoms need not be tested. But the reduction is not only due to fewer tests. The test positivity rate of 22.47% recorded on Tuesday was significantly lower than the 27.99% on Monday. On Sunday too, the positivity rate was over 27%. “It seems like the cases have started declining but we will have to wait a few more days to actually call this a trend and not just an aberration. The cases along with the positivity rate and consistent testing numbers, need to be taken into account to say definitively that there is a decline. But if the trajectory of other countries are to be followed, then yes in the next week or so, Delhi should also start seeing a fall in daily infections,” said DR KK Talwar, former head of the Medical Council of India, who was also heading the Punjab government’s expert group on Covid during the second wave of the pandemic.

Justice Subramonium Prasad granted bail to Mohd Tahir, Shahrukh, Mohd Faizal, Mohd Shoaib, Rashid and Parvez.According to police, the rioting incident had taken place near Shiv Vihar Tiraha on February 24, 2020, in which accused persons allegedly pelted stones, and ransacked and torched several shops there. Negi’s mutilated dead body was found in the shop two days later, following which the FIR, under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, was registered at Gokulpuri police station.During the earlier hearings on the bail pleas, the prosecution had opposed the petitions, saying that while the riots started in the morning and continued till late in the night, it cannot be said that the accused were part of the riotous mob in the afternoon and not during the night.Communal clashes had broken out in north-east Delhi on February 24, 2020, after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control, leaving at least 53 people dead and around 700 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/nedelhi-riots-hc-grants-bail-to-6-accused-in-murder-of-22yearold-101642531733274.html
19-01-2022||Patna||Akhilesh hits back at BJP on charges of fielding criminals in polls||Lucknow: Under attack over fielding candidates with a criminal background in the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday alleged that his party leaders had been framed in false cases by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Flanked by veteran leader Azam Khan’s son Abdullah Azam who was recently released from jail and new entrant Swami Prasad Maurya, Akhilesh Yadav also claimed that the maximum number of MLAs with a criminal background were from the saffron party. Akhilesh said this in response to media queries on a PIL which sought a direction from the Supreme Court to the Election Commission to de-register any political party which violated the directions of the apex court on making public information about their candidate’s criminal record. The public interest litigation (PIL) cited the case of SP candidate from Kairana constituency - Nahid Hasan - who was arrested recently under the Gangster Act. Terming the PIL as BJP-sponsored, the SP president said that going by this standard, the BJP would not be able to contest anywhere in the country. “The chief minister and deputy chief minister have a number of cases against them. The maximum number of MLAs with a criminal background has reached the assembly from the BJP,” he claimed. To note, the BJP has been accusing the Samajwadi Party of sheltering gangsters and mafias during its rule in Uttar Pradesh. “The Samajwadi Party, which has been protecting criminals, has now given tickets to anti-social elements and history -sheeters for several assembly seats, including Kairana, Muzaffarnagar, Siyana, Bulandshahr and Loni in western Uttar Pradesh,” chief minister Yogi Adityanath had said on Monday. The SP chief, however, alleged that a large number of his party leaders had been framed in fake cases under the BJP government. ‘I have said this earlier also. A DM who had come from another state and wanted extension was posted in Rampur and he worked there as per the wishes of the government. An IPS who had charges against him was sent to Rampur to end his inquiry. During the past five years, the BJP lodged fake cases against Samajwadi Party leaders and Nahid Hasan also comes in this category,” Akhilesh Yadav claimed. On senior leader Azam Khan, who is presently in jail, Akhilesh alleged that both the Congress and the BJP colluded in framing him. ‘We have an app’ On Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressing party workers in his parliamentary constituency-Varanasi through Namo app today, Akhilesh Yadav said that BJP was aware of how the elections were going to be conducted and so strengthened its digital medium while other parties were making the preparations now. “We have an app which has been activated,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/akhilesh-hits-back-at-bjp-on-charges-of-fielding-criminals-in-polls-101642531613322.html
19-01-2022||Delhi||Relaxations in Covid-19 restrictions unlikely this week in Delhi||There are no plans yet to rollback some of the Covid-19-related restrictions on activities and movement of people, Delhi government officials privy to discussions said on Tuesday, even as the number of new cases grew at a significantly slower pace and the share of tests that turned positive also dropped.There were a little under 12,000 cases on Tuesday, the second day this was under 15,000, and the positivity rate clocked in at 22.47%. Last week, Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain said some curbs, like the weekend curfew, could be rolled back if new cases stay under 15,000.An official aware of the planning said the situation will be monitored further before relaxations are made. “There is going to be no relaxation in the ongoing restrictions in Delhi this week. Restrictions will continue till the situation comes in grip. The weekend lockdown will continue this weekend (January 22-23),” said this person, a senior official, who asked not to be named.The decisions on restrictions are taken by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), which is headed by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal. A second senior official said no meeting of the DDMA has been scheduled this week so far. “It is likely that status quo will be maintained on all the previous DDMA orders this week. In all likelihood, the matter may be reviewed early next week ahead of Republic Day (January 26),” said this person, asking not to be named.A third official, from the health department, too said they will wait to see how the trend in cases holds. “We will be assessing the situation for a few more days,” this person said, while adding that if a recommendation will then be sent to the DDMA accordingly.Chief secretary Vijay Dev directed all concerned teams to increase Covid-19 testing from Wednesday, the first official quoted above added. The directive came after the ministry of health, in a letter dated January 17 (Monday), asked all states and Union Territories (UTs) to immediately increase testing in a strategic manner.The Centre said it seemed from data that testing declined in many states and UTs, although the drop likely took place due to a change in guidelines that said people without symptoms need not be tested.A host of restrictions are in place in Delhi, including a weekend curfew, a night curfew and a ban on high-risk, non-essential activities such as dining at a restaurant or going to a cinema.Shops and malls are allowed to operate only on odd-even basis on weekdays and restaurants can only offer take-out meals.These rules have been criticised by businesses, which say that they are excessive since the city’s health infrastructure has adequate capacity to deal with even larger numbers of cases as the variant now causing infections is less likely to lead to serious disease.The New Delhi traders’ association (NDTA) on Tuesday wrote to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal urging him to allow all shops to operate on all weekdays till 8 pm. They requested that the existing rule of running shops in markets and malls in odd-even manner be lifted. “Please note that by adopting an odd-even process, the crowd increases in front of a shop. Crowds will only reduce if all shops are allowed to open regularly till 8 pm,” wrote Atul Bhargava, president of NDTA.(With inputs from Soumya Pillai)
19-01-2022||Gurugram||Gurugram: Circle rate hike makes property dearer in many key micro markets||Property rates in the city are set to go up, especially in areas along Golf Course Road, Golf Course Extension Road, Southern Peripheral Road (SPR) and in sectors along Dwarka Expressway, after the implementation of new circle rates, which were revised by the district administration at the start of the year.According to the new circle rates, which came into effect from January 1, the average hike ranges from 10% to 25% depending upon the area.Collector or circle rate is the minimum price at which a property is registered with the revenue department when being transferred. The stamp duty levied on such properties is a major revenue earner for the government.An analysis of the new circle rates shows that hike has been effected primarily for properties that have witnessed higher sales, and where there is a difference in the market and circle rates (market rates in these areas are higher). Market rate is the rate at which a property transaction takes place and its price is determined by market forces, while circle rates are fixed yearly or twice a year by the district administration.The Gurugram administration said that in most areas there was a marginal increase in property rates, and they took care to ensure that affordable housing is not affected by the hike.District administration officials said circle rates of privately developed colonies have been revised in Gurugram and Wazirabad tehsil by 5-10%, Manesar tehsil by 10-15%, Farrukhnagar tehsil by 30-50%, and Badshahpur tehsil by 25%. In the case of group housing colonies, the price has been increased from 5% to 66% in some cases depending on the revenue registration data, said officials.Yash Garg, deputy commissioner, Gurugram, said that the objective was to rationalise the circle rates in tune with prevailing market rates as the difference had become too high and, in several cases, rates had not been revised in the last two years.According to authorities, the circle rates for Golf Course Road have been revised for The Verandas, Palm Springs, The Summit, La Lagune, Sun City, Central Park, and other similar projects from ₹1,500 per square foot (PSF) to ₹2,500 PSF. Local property dealers said these projects have seen the maximum sale and purchase over the last two years.The circle rate of properties in the Ambience Group has witnessed a hike of ₹500 PSF, while prime properties on Golf Course Road (including DLF Aralias, Magnolias, and Camellias) have not witnessed any hike in circle rate. Several mid-level but older projects such as Laburnum, Unitech World Spa, Park Place, Belaire have also not seen any change in rates. The rates are changed based on revenue data and number of registrations in the last six months, authorities said, and these projects have not seen much traction in this period.Compared to group housing projects, the circle rates of plots in private licensed colonies saw a much higher hike, primarily due to a higher demand of plots and floors among buyers, said real estate dealers.The circle rate for plots in Sushant Lok 1 and DLF phase 1 has been revised from ₹77,000 to ₹85,000 per square yard (PSY), for DLF phase 2,4 and South City 1 from ₹72,000 PSY to ₹85,000 PSY, for DLF phase 3 from ₹66,000 PSY to ₹72,000 PSY, and for DLF phase 5 from ₹72,000 PSY to ₹90,000 PSY.The circle rate of plots in sectors 58 to 64 has been increased from ₹3,000 PSY to ₹36,000 PSY. The circle rate in developing sectors (104, 105, 106, 109, 110, 110A, 11 112, 113, 114, 115) has been increased from ₹25,500 to ₹30,000. In municipal areas, circle rates have been revised by an average rate of 8-10%, said officials.In colonies located from Railway Crossing to Daulatabad, the rate has been revised from ₹21,000 PSY to ₹23,000 PSY. From Civil Lines to Jail Road, the rate has been revised from ₹52,000 PSY to ₹58,080 PSY, they added.The deputy commissioner said that the hike has been put in place in areas where there was a sharp difference in market and circle rates. “We have taken inputs from different stakeholders, and based on the revenue registration data, the circle rate has been increased in some areas. We have ensured that affordable housing and housing meant for similar categories are not affected by the revision,” he said.The hike in circle rates has, however, not gone down well with the developers and property dealers, who said that given the Covid-19 pandemic, and lack of business in previous years, the government should have waited for the market to revive.Pradeep Aggarwal, chairman, Signature Group, a city-based developer, said that this hike will increase the burden of stamp duty on the end-user by 25%. “This will further burden buyers financially and hit sales. This hike will have a cascading impact on the prices of properties. Higher acquisition costs caused by the higher circle rates will dampen sentiments. An objective market assessment of property prices in Gurugram is the need of the hour. The approach to determine circle rates needs to be reconsidered in order to capture the market rates more accurately,” he said.Property experts said that government must take into account the fact that circle rates in neighbouring Delhi and adjoining states have been reduced, and any hike in Gurugram might see buyers rushing to these places.Vinod Behl, a city-based real estate expert, observed that the authorities’ prime focus is to maximise revenue and the hike in circle rates is a step in that direction as funds for development are shrinking.“Any increase in circle rates results in an increase in the transaction cost by way of increase in stamp duty and registration charges. In the wake of the pandemic, states such as Maharashtra and Karnataka, last year, cut stamp duty to push home sales. At a time when the Union budget is around the corner and the real estate sector is demanding relief in the form of reduction in stamp duty and GST on properties under construction, putting any extra burden on property buyers is questionable,” he said.Santosh Agarwal, chief financial officer, Alpha Corp, a real estate company, also said that any decision to raise circle rates now undermines the recovery process and has a detrimental influence on the real estate sector. A higher circle rate correlates to a higher registration cost, which translates to a higher acquisition cost and thus has an impact on the property’s transaction worthiness.
19-01-2022||Delhi||HC pulls up UP Police for forging papers, illegally arresting two from Delhi||The Delhi high court pulled up the Uttar Pradesh Police on Tuesday and said the police had resorted to “complete forgery of documents” and “illegally” arrested from Delhi two family members of a man who had married against the wishes of the woman’s parents.Justice Mukta Gupta noted the submission made in a status report by the Uttar Pradesh government that the inquiry conducted by senior police officers had revealed that the two men were illegally taken from Delhi without informing the local police; neither was the date and place of arrest shown correctly.The judge also said though the two were kept in illegal custody for two days, their arrest was shown only on September 8, 2021, when talks to take back the woman, petitioner no 1, to her mother failed.Additional advocate general (AAG) Garima Prashad, appearing for the UP government, told the court that a fair inquiry has been conducted in the matter and the strictest of action will be taken against the errant police officers under disciplinary proceedings.Noting her stand, the court disposed of the plea by the couple who had approached the high court with a petition seeking the court’s protection. The plea, filed through advocate Awadesh Kumar, had said the couple got married in July of their own free will but were now being threatened by the woman’s family. They contended that the whereabouts of the man’s father and brother were not known after their arrest on September 8, 2021, allegedly from Delhi.On October 28, 2021, the court slammed the UP Police and said it will not let any illegal arrest take place in Delhi. The court took strong exception to the UP Police personnel picking up the father and brother from Delhi without intimating the local police, besides completely ignoring the fact that both bride and groom were adults. “Yeh sab UP me chalta hoga, yahan nahi (these things may happen in UP, but not here),” the judge had said.On November 18, 2021, the UP government, represented by Prashad, told the court that the two police officers, who had arrested the family members, have been suspended and an SIT has been constituted to probe their role in the illegal arrests.During the last hearing on January 11, the court gave one last opportunity to the Uttar Pradesh government to file their status report.On Tuesday, Prashad submitted that although the mother of the man, petitioner no. 2, stated that the arrest was made on August 6, 2021, it was made on September 6.The status report also said in the FIR by the woman’s mother, the woman’s age was mentioned as 21 years and it had given an address in Delhi, but the IO, Narendra Kumar Verma, had not taken any efforts to find the woman or get her statement.It added that then SHO of Shamli police station, Pankaj Tyagi, also did not render proper support to his juniors.The status report said on September 6, 2021, the sub inspector and investigation officer, along with constables, come to the house of the petitioner around 6pm and took away his two family members. But their arrest was shown as on September 8, 2021 -- from a bus stand in Shamli.Noting these, the court said, “Complete forgery of documents, A to Z every document is forged…Investigation may be callous but you cannot fudge documents. Take away somebody, pick up from one place, take him there illegally and then show arrest. Laxity and forgery of documents are two different things. Laxity in investigation is not an offence but you forge documents, this is a clear case of forging documents by IOs”.The judge also said when a major (adult person) marries someone of her own free will, the same is not an offence of kidnapping.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hc-pulls-up-up-police-for-forging-papers-illegally-arresting-two-from-delhi-101642531313238.html
19-01-2022||Delhi||DDA approves construction of new flats for MPs in central Delhi||Paving the way for the construction of flats for Members of Parliament in central Delhi, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) approved a proposal to include a government residential colony as a redevelopment area under the zonal plan.The proposal was approved in a meeting on Tuesday along with DDA’s annual budget for ₹7,933 crore for the financial year 2022-23.The meeting, chaired by Delhi lieutenant governor (LG) Anil Baijal, approved budgetary allocations for various ongoing projects for the next financial year. However, no new projects were announced.The area where new housing for MPs is proposed is located along Baba Kharak Singh Marg and Pandit Pant Marg in central Delhi. A senior DDA official aware of the development said, “Currently, it has CPWD [Central Public Works Department] flats, which are in a very bad condition. Earlier, the area was not included in the zonal development plan.Now this area can be taken up for redevelopment.”On Tuesday, Baijal tweeted, “Inclusion of multi-storied flats along Baba Kharak Singh Marg and Pt. Pant Marg under Redevelopment area in Zonal Development Plan (ZDP) for construction of multi-storied flats for Hon’ble Members of Parliament (Lok Sabha) for final notification by the MoHUA (ministry of housing and urban affairs).”The land-owning agency’s budget outlay for the financial year 2022-23 is ₹7,933 crore, which is ₹1,195 crore more from last year. Its project receipt for the next financial year is ₹7,943 crore, whereas it was ₹6,749 last year.In the meeting, the DDA approved the allocation of monies to projects, such as the upgradation of physical infrastructure in Rohini, Narela and Dwarka; construction of Urban Extension Road-II, completion of housing projects, etc.Last year, the DDA announced that it will pay the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation ₹1,000 crore for the construction of the Metro corridor connecting Narela with the Rithala-Narela corridor under Phase 4 and allocated ₹400 crore for 2021-22. While the project is in the planning stages, the DDA has allocated ₹240 crore more for the project in the new financial year.The DDA, which is currently the main developer in Delhi, has planned no new housing project in the new financial year. The land-owning agency has allocated ₹2,543 crore for 2022-23 to complete ongoing projects.According to a senior DDA official, “DDA is likely to earn ₹2,761 crore from the sale of flats in the new financial year. We recently launched a housing scheme in which 18,000 flats were put on sale. There are flats in Narela and Dwarka in various stages of construction.”For the UERI-II, also referred to as the third Ring Road of Delhi, the DDA will be paying the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), which is executing the project, ₹3,600 crore as viability gap funding.“Of the ₹3,600 crore, ₹1,787 crore will be paid from the Urban Development Fund and rest by the DDA…While an additional ₹100 crore will be given in this financial year, ₹725 crore will be released in the next financial year,” said an official.A senior DDA official said that work on about 10 in-situ slum rehabilitation projects will also start this year. Close to ₹300 crore has been allocated for these projects for this and the next financial year.The land-owning agency is likely to start work on three new sports complexes –two in Dwarka (including a golf course) and one in Rohini--and will spend ₹546 crore on the projects this year. The work on phase 1 of the Delhi Cycle Walk project between Badarpur and Malviya Nagar is going on. For this, ₹6 crore has been allocated. DDA officials said that the project is likely to be finished by the end of this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ddaapproves-construction-of-new-flats-for-mps-in-central-delhi-101642531133099.html
19-01-2022||Delhi||Tension in outer Delhi’s Sultanpuri as rape accused kills survivor’s brother||A 38-year-old man, the brother of a rape survivor, was stabbed to death allegedly by the rape accused and his brother in outer Delhi’s Sultanpuri on Monday night, three days after the accused was released on bail in the rape case. Another resident of the area was also shot and injured after a bullet fired by the attackers missed the target (the dead man) and hit him, police said.Both brothers, aged 40 and 35 years, were arrested within a few hours of the firing and stabbing incident that took place near a public park in Sultanpuri, the police said. While the deceased’s family alleged that the murder was an act of revenge, over them having filed the rape case, the police said the rape accused and the dead man also had an ongoing dispute over some money and a car that the deceased was not returning.The passerby, aged 42 years, who was shot and injured was known to the families of both the deceased and the alleged attackers, who live just 20 metres apart. The injured man underwent a surgery at a nearby hospital and is stable, the police said.The identities of the deceased, the injured man, and the arrested men have been withheld to protect the identity of the rape survivor.Tension prevailed in the neighbourhood as the deceased man was a Hindu and the arrested men belonged to the Muslim community. Apart from the local police, over 30 paramilitary personnel were deployed in the area to ensure law and order. The arrested men’s family is the only Muslim family in that lane, the police said, adding that soon after the incident, the family locked up their three-storey house and left, fearing a retaliation. The family members of the dead man said the murder was a revenge as the dead man’s 28-year-old sister had filed the rape case against the Muslim man last August. He was arrested and sent to jail, but was released on bail on January 14. He (the suspect) and his family members would stand outside our house and threaten us with dire consequences for filing the rape case. He intimidated us and said he had friends in high places who would protect him even if he killed everyone in our family. My sister, who filed the rape case, had to shift to a new address as she feared for her life,” said another sister of the dead man.According to the man’s mother, on Monday afternoon, the rape accused came to their house with a sword in hand and threatened to kill everyone in the house for having filed the rape case, which he claimed had ruined his life. An argument ensued between him and the rape survivor’s brother, but the mother intervened and stopped it.That evening, around 7.30, the rape survivor’s brother had gone to the market nearby when he met the rape accused and his brother and an altercation again ensued. Eyewitnesses told the police that the brothers stabbed the man and also fired at him. But the bullet missed the intended target and hit the 42-year-old passerby.Deputy commissioner of police (outer) Parvinder Singh said the police received a call at 7.53pm about the incident. A police team reached the hospital and found that two injured men were admitted there. One of them had succumbed to stab wounds while the other was undergoing treatment for a gunshot wound. A case of murder was registered and the brothers were arrested, the DCP said.He further said, “We will examine all the allegations and action would be taken accordingly. Our investigation has revealed that the 40-year-old accused had given some money and a Swift car to the deceased man as they once used to be friends. However, the man neither returned the money nor the car. The accused was also arrested in the rape case filed by the man’s sister last year.”

However, citizens have raised questions on the decision and the demand for reopening of gardens for fully vaccinated adults has been gathering chorus. The Pune Municipal Corporation closed all public gardens in the city on January 10. Around 170 gardens in the city had reopened when the Covid cases had dropped in the city. However, fresh guidelines were introduced owing to the rise in Covid cases, and the public gardens were again out of the reach of kids and the elderly, who usually visit these parks. Several people have taken to Twitter to appeal to the authorities to reopen public gardens in the city. “Two years later, seems like we have learned nothing about the risks of outdoor vs indoor activities. Indoor activities are open (good)... but parks and walking tracks are closed again,” tweeted Amit Paranjape, an entrepreneur. He also tagged BJP MLA Siddharth Shirole, Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol, and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar in the tweet. According to Paranjape, public gardens are very important for physical and mental health for everyone and outdoor spaces are much less risky as compared to crowded indoor places. “Public parks and walking tracks provide a good place for people of all age groups to get fresh air, walk or light exercise, and for children to play some games,” he said. Few others have demanded the reopening of public parks due to lack of public space for daily runners. “Aai’s friend walking on the dug-up Prabhat road had a fall. She went to a hospital which increased her chances of contracting the coronavirus. She lives alone. Chances are that the fall wouldn’t have occurred if she were walking inside KNP (Kamala Nehru Park). Open the parks,” read a January 17 tweet by Shilpa Godbole, who works as a marketing consultant for a sports apparel brand. Some also questioned PMC’s decision to keep restaurants and malls open while shutting down public gardens. “Outdoor parks and swimming pools bring in no revenue to the government. Govt can show it’s taking actions without any loss of revenue,” read another tweet. “We only follow the guidelines that have been introduced by the Maharashtra state government and as per those guidelines all public gardens in the state have been closed,” said Ashok Ghorpade, chief garden superintendent, PMC. Kids come to play in these parks and the risk of spread of the virus lingers, Ghorpade said. “Gardens and public parks have gym and exercise equipment. Sanitising them all the time is a difficult task and the danger of spread of virus remains,” the head of PMC garden department said. s||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/puneites-demand-reopening-of-gardens-101642530653007.html
19-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi shivers for sixth consecutive day, IMD says relief likely soon||Parts of Delhi recorded cold day conditions for the sixth consecutive day on Tuesday and overcast skies and low clouds hung over the city even as India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicted that the cold is likely to abate during the next 24 hours followed by a rain over Delhi and other cities in northwest India between January 21 and 23.Delhi recorded a drop in the maximum temperature on Tuesday with Safdarjung, Delhi’s base observatory, recording a high of 15.4 degrees – four notches below this time of the year. It was 16.1 degrees on Monday. Jafarpur was yet again Delhi’s coldest location, with a maximum of 12.8 degrees. IMD said that fog at the upper-level of the atmosphere that is currently stretching across the entire northern plains is taking longer to dissipate, and Delhi may record a similar weather on Wednesday as well.“We are expecting cold day conditions over Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan to last for 24 hours, and then abate gradually as the wind direction changes to northwesterly and then to easterly. But cold day conditions will intensify over Uttar Pradesh and Bihar where its been very cold. They are likely to have cold day for another three days and dense fog also. Due to approaching western disturbance there may cloudy days from January 22 to 24 when again low day temperatures may be recorded. This January we have been seeing extremely low maximum temperatures over a vast region,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre.The IMD classifies it as a ‘cold’ day when the maximum temperature is 4.5 degrees or more below normal, while the minimum is below 10 degrees Celsius. It is classified as a ‘severe’ cold day when the maximum is 6.5 degrees or more below normal. While this criteria wasn’t met at Safdarjung weather station, recordings at Palam, Narela and Jafarpur stations qualified for it being classified a cold day.During this last six days, Safdarjung has recorded the lowest maximum of 14.8 degrees on Sunday -- the same day when the maximum dropped to 10.7 at Narela station. “For Wednesday, the maximum is expected to be around 16 degrees at Safdarjung, making for another possibly cold day in parts of Delhi. Even on Thursday, the maximum will only be around 17 degrees and from Friday night, we can expect rain, which will help reduce the maximum temperature. Light showers are expected on Saturday, while Friday and Sunday may also witness a drizzle,” Jenamani said.In its national weather bulletin, IMD said that cold day to severe cold day conditions prevailed in many parts of Uttar Pradesh and in some parts over Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and cold day conditions were recorded in some parts of Punjab and isolated pockets over Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-shivers-for-sixth-consecutive-day-imd-says-relief-likely-soon-101642529994372.html
19-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi: JNU students protest after PhD student molested on campus||Dozens of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) students on Tuesday evening staged a protest outside the central varsity’s North Gate, demanding swift action against a biker who allegedly sexually harassed a PhD scholar on the campus on Monday night. According to students, the woman student was taking a late night stroll on the campus when a motorcyclist sexually harassed her. Police said efforts are on to identify and arrest the suspect.According to police, they were alerted about the incident after the woman made a call to the police control room. Deputy commissioner of police (DCP, south-west) Gaurav Sharma and the station house officer of Vasant Kunj police station immediately reached the campus to investigate the matter.Sharma said they received the woman’s call around 11.45pm. “We rushed to the spot and found that the woman was taking a stroll on the campus and was on the East Gate Road when a biker came from within the campus and tried to molest her. When she raised the alarm, the suspect managed to escape and disappeared within the campus itself,” he said.Sharma said an FIR under sections 354 (A) (sexual harassment) and 354 (B) (assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered on the woman’s complaint and efforts are on to nab the suspect.On Tuesday evening, the JNU students’ union said the incident was “an attempt to rape” and that it took place near the V-C house. “Cases of stalking and harassment have increased on the campus due to which women now feel uncomfortable and unsafe stepping out at night. The private agency hired to look after security on the campus has failed to ensure the safety of students on campus,”the student body said. Renewing its demand for the re-establishment of the Gender Sensitisation Committee Against Sexual Harassment (GSCASH), the JNUSU said, “The latest incident brings to light the failure of the JNU administration that dismantled the GSCASH and replaced it with an inefficient body called the ICC (Internal Complaints Committee). The incident also calls forth the need to reinstate the democratically elected GSCASH to fight against sexual harassment and to sensitise people on campus regarding gender and gender-based crimes.” Both left and right-leaning student groups such as AISA, SFI, BAPSA, and ABVP condemned the incident and sought swift action from the police. “It is extremely concerning that such a grievous incident occurred on campus and the JNU administration has shown a callous attitude and is yet to issue any statement in support of the survivor. This shows the utter disregard and lackadaisical approach with which the JNU administration and Delhi police handle gender-related crimes,” AISA said in a written statement. Until Tuesday evening, the JNU administration was yet to issue any statement in the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhijnu-students-protest-after-phd-student-molested-on-campus-101642529272801.html
19-01-2022||Delhi||With special drive, Delhi’s 3 jails race to bring inmates under vaccine net||Under the Delhi government’s special vaccination campaign for prisoners, a majority of inmates lodged inside the Capital’s jails, including those with life sentences, have been vaccinated because everyone has the right to life under the Constitution, officials said Tuesday.In Delhi’s largest jail--Tihar--almost 90% of the inmates have received the first Covid vaccine dose, while 85% of the inmates in Rohini Jail have received the first dose. In Mandoli Jail, almost 84% of the inmates have received the first dose, according to jail authorities.Delhi’s three prison complexes have been badly hit during the current wave of the pandemic (dominated by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus) as well as in the past. The jails can accommodate 10,024 inmates, but currently house around 18,000 inmates, thus making social distancing challenging.Vaccination against Covid-19 is crucial for protection from the virus, according to experts and real-world evidence from many countries. There has been negligible resistance towards vaccination from inmates, but a group of 150 Nigerian inmates in Rohini Jail are refusing to take the jab and authorities said they are still trying to convince them.Women inmates, including those pregnant and lactating, have also been administered the vaccine--there has been no side effect so far, authorities said.According to authorities, prisoners released before being administered the second dose of the vaccine are given certificates of the first dose to facilitate them in receiving the second dose.Since the total number of inmates constantly changes with daily arrivals and departures, authorities said it is challenging to achieve 100% first-dose vaccination. District authorities said they are coordinating with the jail authorities to ensure 100% first- and second-dose coverage of all inmates at the earliest.“The jails are very close to achieving 100% first-dose coverage. Since new inmates arrive every day and the total number of inmates constantly changes, 100% vaccination coverage is challenging. Inmates jabbed in the jails are counted as vaccinated, while those vaccinated before arriving in jail are not immediately counted as vaccinated-- thus the vaccination coverage as compared to the total inmate population keeps changing on a day-to-day basis. As compared to a month ago, a majority of the inmates who arrive in the jails now are already partially or fully vaccinated. Efforts are being made to immediately update the vaccination coverage status of prisoners upon arrival,” a Delhi government official, who did not want to be named, said.A North district administration official said that the district administration is coordinating with the Rohini Jail authorities to complete 100% first-dose vaccination as soon as possible. “A vaccination camp is being organised in the jail premises on Wednesday where we will try to vaccinate as many remaining people as possible,” the official said.Since the prisoners do not have access to mobile phones, and some do not have identity proof either, jail authorities create special session sites on Co-WIN by using the identities and mobile phone numbers of medical officers to vaccinate such inmates.An official from the West district, where Tihar Jail is located, said since inmates are not allowed mobile phones, “it was decided to vaccinate the prisoners by using the “facilitator option” in Co-WIN. Vaccination for prisoners started on March 23, 2021, and since then we have administered over 16,000 doses– around 11,200 first doses and 4,850 second doses. The prisoners also include women, some of whom are pregnant or lactating. About 428 women prisoners have been vaccinated, of whom two were pregnant and four were lactating mothers,” the official said.In Tihar Jail, booster doses are also being administered to those eligible-- so far 625 doses have been administered, authorities said.An official said that the Rohini Jail authorities, with the assistance of the district magistrate (North) are taking all steps to ensure all inmates are vaccinated as soon as they enter the jail. “Since April 2021, nearly 84% of the inmates have been vaccinated with single doses. Vaccination camps are organised to vaccinate the inmates regularly,” the official said.All district magistrates have asked jail authorities to administer the second dose of the vaccine to eligible inmates at the earliest so that they are better protected against Covid-19.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital, said vaccinating jail inmates is important because they are living in overcrowded and poor hygienic conditions. “Such inmates should be vaccinated on priority. However, they should be encouraged to adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour, and should be asked to quit tobacco, and exercise and meditate regularly,” said Dr Kishore.Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases department in Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said it was imperative to be careful of an outbreak of cases in jails.“Jails and prisons have been severely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic in many countries. In the US, more than 40 of the 50 largest clustered outbreaks in the country have occurred in jails and prisons. Compared with the general population, the number of Covid-19 cases in jails is almost 5-6 times higher. Outbreaks in jails spread rapidly and uncontrollably. Once the virus enters these facilities, many of which are already overcrowded, it is almost impossible to maintain the recommended 6-feet safe distance. Ventilation is inadequate. Quality face masks may not be easily available. Further, there may not be any facility for quarantining or isolating exposed individuals. In such conditions, providing Covid-19 vaccine would be beneficial to the inmates, and help prevent severe illness and death among the vaccines,” Dr Kant said.
19-01-2022||Delhi||Weather forecasts in Delhi to get sharper with third doppler radar||Forecasts of rain and thunderstorms in Delhi are set to become more accurate, with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) installing a third doppler weather radar (DWR) system for the capital at Ayanagar last week. Two such radars are already functioning at Palam (2010) and Lodhi road (2012). While the Ayanagar DWR has the smallest area of influence among the three, covering a radius of around 100 kilometres, it is also the most precise and will now be used in combination with the DWR at Lodhi road, which was being utilised to predict rain and thunderstorms in Delhi.DWRs operate within the S, C and X bands of the microwave spectrum, allowing wavelengths ranging from 2.4 to 15 cm to be sent out to detect different weather systems. While the Ayanagar’s DWR has an X-band radar, the Lodhi road one uses a C-band, and the Palam radar, S band.Met officials say each radar fulfills a different function, with the one at Palam having the longest wavelength (7.5-15 cms) and the biggest radius of around 400 kilometres, allowing IMD to track severe weather events occurring further away from Delhi NCR, but which could potentially impact flights into and out of the capital. These also track wind shear, cumulonimbus clouds (CB) and thunderstorms and dust storms farther away.In comparison, the DWR at Lodhi road has a shorter wavelength of 3.8cms to 7.5 cms, allowing IMD to identify weather events within a 250 km radius, including intensity of winds and the type of precipitation -- whether it is rain or hail.R.K Jenamani, scientist at IMD told HT that the Ayanagar DWR, which has the shortest wavelength, ranging from 2.4 to 3.8 cms, will now be used in combination with the Lodhi road DWR to give rain and risk-based warnings at the ward and street level.“This is the most precise out of the three and is aimed at giving precise warnings for rainfall, thunderstorm, squall or hail activity within Delhi. While having a smaller radius, the data from this radar will be able to capture thunderstorm and heavy rainfall activity at a higher resolution and will help in identifying areas and the depth of inundation in real-time and for each location,” added Jenamani.IMD uses its nowcast feature to issue a weather warning related to rain or hail that could occur in a region within the next two or three hours. Jenamani says the Ayanagar DWR will make these warnings more precise. “Earlier, the forecast would state which parts of Delhi will be impacted by rain, but through this, exact areas at the street level can also be mentioned. It is possible only a few wards receive heavy rainfall in Delhi and we will be able to forecast that.”Navdeep Dahiya, an amateur weather who runs ‘Live Weather of India’ and analyses weather across northern India, says that a radar with a smaller 100-km radius can display specific parts of Delhi and allow for sharper forecasts. “Earlier, the radar (being used( was much wider and covering a larger area, so forecasting for a small area like Delhi and its districts was extremely difficult. The forecasts made were valid for a larger area such as entire south Delhi, but with this, forecasts, such as chances of rain at Connaught Place will be possible.”The Ayanagar DWR’s installation was announced as part of the IMD’s 147th foundation day on Friday. The same day, similar radars were also commissioned in Leh, Mumbai and Chennai. These radars have been designed and developed indigenously by IMD and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). While the doppler radar at Mumbai, the city’s second, is a C-band radar, the one installed in Chennai is an X-band radar similar to Delhi and is the southern city’s third, covering an area in a 150-km radius. The doppler installed at Leh is at the highest altitude anywhere across the country. With this, India now has 33 operational DWRs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/weather-forecasts-in-delhi-to-get-sharper-with-third-doppler-radar-101642528373040.html
19-01-2022||Lucknow||Ensure entire eligible population is given 1st dose of Covid vax by Jan 25: UP CM||LUCKNOW Uttar Pradesh had so far seen a single-day peak of 17,000 fresh cases in the current wave of the pandemic as compared to 38,000 cases in a day during the second wave. Lower positivity rate and comparatively decreased virulence of the Omicron variant indicated that the infection was well in control in the state, said chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday.He asked officials to ensure that the entire eligible population was administered the first dose of Covid vaccine by January 25. “At present, very few people are requiring hospitalisation. Most patients are recovering in home isolation with medical consultations,” he said during the virtually held Covid-19 review meeting with Team-9, a team of top UP government officers involved in Covid management.However, he had a word of caution over the elderly, people with co-morbidities, children and pregnant women. “The infection might take a serious turn in these categories of people, so there is a need to protect them from Covid infection,” he told officers. He asked nigrani samitis (monitoring committees) to stay alert in tracking such cases.He asked officers to ready at least one dedicated Covid hospital in each district and fully activate the Integrated Covid Control Centres.Yogi said in the last 24 hours, UP recorded 14,803 fresh infections with a total active count of 1.01 lakh.“Till yesterday, 23.43 crore vaccine doses were administered and 8.86 crore people got both their doses,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ensure-entire-eligible-population-is-given-1st-dose-of-covid-vax-by-jan-25-up-cm-101642528192461.html
19-01-2022||Lucknow||My predecessors had ‘fear’ of visiting Noida, says Yogi||GREATER NOIDA Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday took a jibe at the opposition, saying his predecessors had a “fear of visiting Noida in Gautam Buddh Nagar” during their terms at the helm of the state as they had no agenda for the welfare and economic well being of people.Adityanath was referring to a “superstition” among previous state governments that if the sitting chief minister visited Gautam Buddh Nagar district, their government would collapse or they would not be re-elected.“The district is of prime importance as it is close to the National Capital and there is frequent movement of people across the state borders. My predecessors used to shy away from visiting this district as their own life and position of power were more important to them than the people of this area. However, I am thankful that I got the opportunity to visit this district many times,” he said while reviewing the Covid situation at Gautam Buddh Nagar’s Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS). This was his first visit to the 500-bed hospital in the Kasna region.The CM’s visit comes ahead of the UP Assembly elections slated to begin from February 10. Yogi Adityanath lauded the efforts of the state and central governments to ensure better Covid management during the first and second waves of the pandemic.“After taking control of Covid situation during the first wave, we witnessed oxygen crisis across the country during the second wave. Looking at the situation, the Centre made all possible efforts to supply oxygen to all parts of the country, via railways as well as airways. In UP, 550 new oxygen plants have been added, of which 11 are in Gautam Buddh Nagar,” he said.Adityanath said UP had achieved over 95% coverage of first dose of the vaccine and 62% coverage of the second dose.“UP has a target of vaccinating 1,40,00,00 children between the age of 15 and 18, of which we have already given the first dose to 62,83,00 teenagers. On the other hand, 52,900 beneficiaries have been given the precautionary dose in the state so far,” he added.Talking about Gautam Buddh Nagar, Adityanath lauded the efforts of the district health department for completing 100% first dose coverage of the Covid vaccine.“This district has carried out the vaccination drive very efficiently, as it has already completed 100% coverage of the first dose of the vaccine while the second dose coverage is 92%. Among 15-18 age group, 1,16,00 doses have been administered while 46% coverage of the precautionary dose has been achieved,” said the CM.Adityanath also appreciated the efforts of frontline workers, healthcare workers, administration, health department and local surveillance teams comprising ASHA and Anganwadi workers in controlling the spread of Covid-19 infection in the district.“Last year, we were anticipating that the third wave of Covid would hit us in August-September, 2021. However, we were able to control that. Now, the Omicron variant of Covid has spread rapidly across the country, but if we look at hospitalization figures, less than 1% of the infected cases require hospitalization. In UP, only 0.5% of the total active Covid cases are hospitalized. Similarly in Gautam Buddh Nagar, of the 9,500 active cases, only 200 are under hospitalization. In fact, even these cases are those patients who are suffering from other comorbidities,” the CM said while addressing the media.He added, “The third wave is less harmful as compared to the second. But it is a disease and we have to save children, women and senior citizens. For that, we have also installed 5,500 public address systems to give out public awareness messages. People should avoid going to crowded places. We are hopeful that we will be successful in saving lives and livelihoods during this third wave too.”At GIMS, Adityanath inspected the flu out-patient department (OPD) , control room and vaccination area. “He also interacted with patients admitted to the isolation ward and inquired about the state of heath facilities available at the hospital. GIMS is an L-2 category hospital that has 500 beds. Of these, 450 are Covid beds and currently 54 beds are occupied by Covid patients,” said Dr (Brig) RK Gupta, director, GIMS.After a review of Covid situation at GIMS, the chief minister visited Kayampur village five kilometers away. Here, he interacted with the local surveillance team (nigrani samiti) at a government school in the village.“Local health teams have done exceptional work in the last two years during the Covid pandemic and I thank them for their service. The focus of health teams should now be to ensure full coverage of precautionary dose of the Covid vaccine and vaccination for teenagers in 15-18 age group,” he told the workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/my-predecessors-had-fear-of-visiting-noida-says-yogi-101642611082692.html

He said the state government is open to exempting industries such as brick kilns, where engaging workers from outside the state is essential.The controversial piece of legislation – the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Bill – passed by the assembly on November 5, 2020 and assented to by the governor on March 2, 2021, provides for 75% reservation in private sector jobs to those having a resident certificate (domicile). The law will be applicable for a period of 10 years.The state government has also relaxed the residency (domicile) requirement from 15 to five years for a person to get a bona fide resident certificate in state to provide flexibility to the private companies in hiring. The law modelled on the lines of a law enacted by YS Jaganmohan Reddy government in Andhra Pradesh has been termed regressive by India Inc.The deputy chief minister said industries having more than 10 employees will need to register on the designated portal and hire 75% locals. He said so far, more than 22,000 companies and 3,280 job aspirants have got their registration done.The private sector job quota move was piloted by Dushyant’s Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), the coalition partner of the BJP, in Haryana. Initially, the controversial piece of legislation did not find much support from the BJP quarters. In fact, Khattar had once sounded non-committal on the prospect of enacting such a law. Even the BJP-led government at the Centre has a different view on such a law.Dushyant on Tuesday said some industrial associations have moved court challenging the law and he will try to convince these associations to withdraw their petitions.He said to ensure that job aspirants do not have to run around to get the domicile certificate, the state government has decided Parivar Pehchan Patra (PPP) can be used by the candidates for authenticating the domicile credentials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/private-sector-job-quota-law-farm-trade-short-term-labour-it-start-ups-to-be-exempted-says-dushyant-101642533537696.html
