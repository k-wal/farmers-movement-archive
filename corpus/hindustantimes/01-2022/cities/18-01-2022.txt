18-01-2022||Pune||PMC to begin precautionary dose vaccination in old age homes Feb-mid||Pune: As the number of new Covid cases rise, the demand for vaccines among the immuno-compromised and senior citizens has also gone up. With such beneficiaries finding it difficult to access vaccination centres, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has started the vaccine-on-wheels initiative for the third dose or precautionary dose among those who are eligible for it. With the mandatory nine months gap period between doses in place, the civic body has asked for requests among the bedridden patients for the third dose. It will also start vaccination among those living in old age homes who had been vaccinated through this initiative earlier last year. Ravindra Bhinwade, additional municipal commissioner said, “We had vaccinated about 3,000 beneficiaries with both first and second dose in 52 old age homes. We have the list of all the old age homes and the beneficiaries who were vaccinated and will now get the third jab if they are eligible. We had completed the second dose during last May and so we will start the vaccination for the third dose in the old age homes from mid-February. We have also started vaccination for bedridden senior citizens and have been getting many requests from such beneficiaries and are inoculating them as part of our daily drive.” As of January 15, the civic body has vaccinated 3,062 senior citizens in 52 old age homes. The third dose vaccination for these senior citizens will begin from February as two old age homes will get the jab next month, five in March, three in April and rest in May as per the eligibility criteria. About 1,187 people have got the vaccine, first and second dose who were bedridden and can take the third dose by sending a request and details to the civic body via mail on bedriddenvaccination.pune@gmail.com. Bhinwade said that since the third wave has begun, requests have been pouring in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-to-begin-precautionary-dose-vaccination-in-old-age-homes-febmid-101642530412781.html

18-01-2022||Lucknow||SP MLA Nahid Hasan’s bail plea rejected||MEERUT The fast track court in Shamli rejected the bail plea of sitting Samajwadi Party MLA from Kairana Nahid Hasan on Tuesday. Nahid was booked under Gangster Act in Kairana Kotwali in February last year along with 30 others, including his mother and former MP Tabassum Begum. Inspector of Kairana Kotwali Anil Sabbharwal confirmed that the fast track court in Shamli had rejected Nahid Hasan’s bail plea on Tuesday. SP has fielded Nahid Hasan again in the contest against Mriganka Singh of BJP and Nahid filed his nomination on the very first day the Election Commission issued notification. Police arrested him the next day on January 16 . He was presented in court and sent in 14-day judicial custody. His arrest raised speculation that the SP would replace him and news started doing the rounds that his sister Ikra could be fielded in his place. But SP district president in Shamli Ashok Choudhary claimed there was no change in candidature of Nahid Hasan yet and explained that a person could be tagged gangster or criminal only after court verdict against him. Choudhary said that the BJP had many candidates with crime history, including minister Suresh Rana and MLA Sangeet Som who were accused in Muzaffarnafar riots case. Besides, Union minister of state for home Ajay Kumar Mishra Teni also had a tainted image. The BJP is once again using Kairana constituency as its ‘ lab of experiment of Hindutva’ by raising the issue of ‘ palayan’ (exodus). BJP’s MP from Kairana Hukum Singh had raised the issue of “Hindu exodus” from Kairaba and neighbouring Kandhla town and issued a list of over 300 families who reportedly moved out of the town because of atrocities of some Muslim gangs, including the gang of Mukeem Kala who killed two traders in broad day light. Later, a fact-finding committee formed by the then SP government said that people had no problem with each other and they wanted effective action against a few criminal gangs who were involved in ‘ extortion’. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath visited Kairana two months ago and fanned the issue of ‘ palayan’ again by meeting members of those families who made an exodus and later returned in the town. He also indicated giving financial aid to the families which were victim of exodus. The BJP also accused Nahid Hasan of masterminding the exodus and criticized SP for giving ticket to him. The BJP fielded Hukum Singh’s daughter Mriganka Singh in 2017 election against Nahid Hasan but the latter defeated her by a margin of 21,162 votes. The BJP has again fielded Mriganka to take on Nahid Hasan and it would be interesting to see the contest between them in changed atmosphere when Nahid is cooling his heels in jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/sp-mla-nahid-hasan-s-bail-plea-rejected-101642529992466.html
18-01-2022||Pune||Covid ex-gratia relief: Pune district records 19,888 deaths, receives 26,000 plus applications||Pune: More than 26,000 applications have been received from Pune district on the portal launched by the authorities where the kin of Covid-19 deceased patients can apply for an ex-gratia of ₹50,000. However, as per the data of public health department, 19,888 Covid deaths have been registered in Pune district. Of the total applications received, 8,500 have been approved and the district administration has claimed that the ex-gratia amount of ₹50,000 has been disbursed to the related accounts. The verification process of other applications is on. According to officials, there are multiple factors behind more applications than recorded Covid deaths in the district. “The data related to the number of Covid deaths is with the public health department. But one of the reasons is the multiple number of applications on the name of the same deceased person. In some cases, the same application has been filed from various jurisdiction limits. Once it is submitted, it is added to the application list. For the disbursement of the financial assistance, Covid deaths verified through the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) are considered. In Pune district, there are 19,200 deaths due to Covid which have been verified through ICMR. Verification of these applications is a rigorous process,” said Vitthal Banote, district disaster management officer. “As per the jurisdiction limits, the applications first go to the authorities concerned in the limits of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and rural areas. Post verification, it is forwarded to the office of civil surgeon and later to the district disaster management authority. However, some applications cannot be immediately approved because of lack of information or other doubts. Such cases get the opportunity to present their side in scheduled hearings before the grievance redressal committee (GRC),” said Banote. In Pune district, the approval of around 7,000 applications have been put on hold and the applicants will have to undergo a hearing before the grievance redressal committee. In the compliance of Supreme Court’s order, the state administration has asked every district administration to constitute GRC which can be approached by the next of kin of the deceased Covid patients if any problem is encountered in the ex-gratia assistance. “These hearings will begin next week. They could not be processed because of technical issues. For example, if a Covid patient dies at home after discharge from the hospital, then ICMR number is not generated. So, such cases have to be verified. In some cases, there is the issue of identification of next of kin. Once proper documents are presented, then the process of approval is carried forward,” said Banote. Financial relief to kin of Covid victims Officials cite multiple number of applications on the name of the same deceased as one of the reasons for many submitted forms Applications received for ex-gratia assistance from Pune district: 26,000 Approved applications: 8,500 Applications to undergo hearing before GRC: 7,000 Covid deaths recorded in district: 19,888 Covid deaths recorded in PMC: 9,303 Covid deaths recorded in PCMC: 3,530 Covid deaths recorded in rural parts: 7,055 Source: Public health department||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-ex-gratia-relief-pune-district-records-19-888-deaths-receives-26-000-plus-applications-101642529692724.html
18-01-2022||Pune||Pune chemists log details of Covid home test customers||Pune: Medical stores in the city have started to keep a record of those buying Covid self-test kits. Chemists say that many showing symptoms of viral fever are purchasing the kit. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) joint commissioner (Pune division), SB Patil, said, “Post our notification, it is the duty of medical stores to keep a record and submit the data to any department that seeks it. We are not conducting any drives to keep a track of it.” On January 12, the state public health department directed civic bodies about using self-testing kits and on the following day FDA Pune division issued a notification asking retail as well as wholesale chemists and pharmacists in Pune to keep a record of customers who buy the home test kits. FDA has told medical shop owners to record information such as name, phone number, address of the customer who buys a kit and also the particulars of the kit. “Many people are buying Covid self-testing kits, I am getting 25-30 customers daily who ask for these kits. Even if there is mild flu, people are asking for it. As per the FDA order we are keeping track of it and making sure that private information does not come in public domain,” said Vilas Shah, Surbhi medico, Sadashiv Peth. Sheetal Malusure, whose daughter is having fever, said, “I had given her medicines for two days, but when her fever did not come down, I purchased Covid self-test kit.” “The notification to druggists, chemists and even officials state that customers should be explained about the self-kits and steps to be taken if someone turns Covid positive,” Patil said. In Bibwewadi, at few medical stores, self-test kits are in demand while others prefer clinic instead of purchasing the home kit. “At our store, majority of people are coming with doctor’s prescription,” said Saurabh Nigde, medical store owner in Bibwewadi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-chemists-log-details-of-covid-home-test-customers-101642529393659.html
18-01-2022||Lucknow||SP’s door-to-door registration campaign for 300 units of free electricity from today||LUCKNOW: In a sequel to his promise of free power to consumers if the party came to power in the 2022 UP polls, Samajwadi Party (SP) national president Akhilesh Yadav said on Tuesday that the party would launch a door-to-door campaign from Wednesday to register domestic consumers for up to 300 units of free electricity in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh. He said through this campaign, the party would be taking its free power promise to the people.To recall, on January 1 Akhilesh had announced that if the SP formed government in 2022, then it would give 300 units of free electricity to domestic users and free power for irrigation to farmers. “The decision is a very important for the people of UP. Many people faced problems of bills, inflated bills and harassment over bills. The SP is going to launch a door-to-door registration campaign for the scheme. So those who currently have domestic power connection and want to avail the 300 units’ free scheme, should fill in the exact name as mentioned in their power bills or ration cards”, he said at the press conference at the party’s state headquarters in Lucknow. Akhilesh announced the registration campaign’s name as ‘Naam likhao abhiyaan: teen sau unit muft paao; naam likhao, chhoot na jao (Registration campaign: Get 300 units free; register, don’t be left out)” When asked about the relevance of the registration at the level of the party when it was not in power, Akhilesh said: “The relevance is that we have to take our promise to the people. In a democracy, in an election, we are taking to the people what we want to convey to them. How will our candidates take their issues to the public? We want to go with this issue door-to-door when campaigns and big rallies are a no-no due to the restrictions and rules by the Election Commission. We are waiting to seek permission for the Vijay Rath whenever the restrictions end. Even if it means riding alone on the rath, I will do it.” The SP chief said that 300 units of free power to domestic consumers and free power for irrigation to farmers would be the “number one promise” in the manifesto that would soon be formally released. Party cadres would get the forms filled in a door-to-door campaign tomorrow onwards, he said and added that soon online registration process too would be launched. Speaking on the SP’s manifesto for the upcoming elections, Akhilesh said it had taken into consideration the suggestions of the general public and various sections such as doctors, traders and farmers. Among other poll promises, the Samajwadi Party has announced ₹25 lakh to the families of farmers who died in the farm agitation, minimum support price on all crops, interest-free loans, insurance and pension to farmers, ₹5 lakh to kin of cyclists who die in road accidents and ₹5 lakh to kin of those who die in bull attacks. When asked about the manifesto release date, Akhilesh said: “We will release our election manifesto after the BJP releases its manifesto. Let the BJP tell the people how and when they doubled the farmers’ income as they had promised in their 2017 manifesto.” Elections to the 403-seat Uttar Pradesh assembly are scheduled to be held in seven phases starting February 10. Polling in Uttar Pradesh will be held on February 10, 14, 20, 23, 27, March 3 and March 7. The counting of votes will take place on March 10.

18-01-2022||Lucknow||Used to fight with Rahul a lot in childhood: Priyanka||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Tuesday said her brother Rahul Gandhi and she were good friends though as children they had lots of fights in which her brother used to win. Priyanka was replying to a question on whether she had lots of fights with Rahul Gandhi as a child and who used to win in their childhood fights.“Guess! Rahul used to win in such fights. I was 12-year-old when my grandmother (the late Indira Gandhi) was assassinated. We used to stay together. Following her (Indira Gandhi’s) assassination, we were not able to go to school. We completed all out studies and took examinations at home. So, my interaction with other children was stopped. We both used to be alone as my father used to travel a lot and our mother accompanied him. We were good friends and fought a lot too. But when any outsider came, we used to team up,” said Priyanka while replying to a question from Himanshi Goel on her Facebook live session.Priyanka said she used to help her children in their home work too. “My daughter called up this morning to check her assignment. I was one of the aunts who used to help her children and their friends in home work. At times, I had to remain awake up till 4am to take care of children’s home work after returning from election campaigns,” she said in reply to a question of one Yogita Tomar.Priyanka said her party has come out with the idea of online competitions following cancellation of marathon runs in view of fight against Covid-19. “We have same prizes for online competitions to be held on a large scale,” she said.Priyanka used the occasion to target Prime Minister Narendra Modi and UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath alike. She said the Congress candidate cine actress Archana Gautam fielded from Hastinapur (SC) seat was being targeted for no reason. Priyanka said the Congress candidate was being asked such questions that would never be put to Prime Minister Narendra Modi or any other men. She targeted chief minister Yogi Adityanath and the BJP leadership on the issue of women empowerment when she was asked about Yogi’s observations that the women energy needed to be channelised. She said it reflected the BJP’s ideology towards empowerment of women. Priyanka also used the occasion to urge women to support her party’s candidates in 2022 assembly polls. Asked why did the Congress field mother of Unnao rape victim and one Asha worker as other parties may consider such candidates weak, Priyanka said her party decided to filed them to give them power to fight these battles.“It is possible that other parties take them to be weak. But how much these women have struggled. Atrocities have been perpetrated upon them. Our party felt they should be given an opportunity to get political power. We should give them an opportunity to stand up and take up their fight politically. This is why we have given them a ticket. We are with them. Our party is supporting them,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/used-to-fight-with-rahul-a-lot-in-childhood-priyanka-101642528492217.html

Installation of submersible pumps is against the norms and orders issued by National Green Tribunal (NGT). Further the building is also being constructed moving against the bylaws. The authorities should stop installation of pump and take required action against the illegal building, otherwise we will be forced to move the court.”“As it is mandatory to install a rain water harvesting system in every building with area above 120 sq yards, the authorities should make sure that the system is installed in the building which is being constructed in 250 sq yards of area,” said Arora.Despite attempts made to reach MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal, he was not available for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-mc-senior-official-accused-of-installing-submersible-pump-at-his-house-101642528312443.html

18-01-2022||Mumbai||Woman strangles friend to death to steal gold ornaments, arrested||DOMBIVALI: A woman, 40, was arrested on Tuesday for murdering another woman, 58, to steal her gold ornaments at Tilak Nagar in Dombivali. The accused was known to the victim and managed to enter the house and strangle the victim to death at night. The Tilak Nagar police conducted an overnight investigation and arrested Seema Khopde from Patharli in Dombivali on Tuesday.The victim, Vijaya Baviskar, 58, was a divorcee and stayed alone in Dombivali. She was found strangled to death Monday morning by her house help. As there was no forced entry, the police suspected that the murderer was someone known to the victim. Unit 3 of the Kalyan crime branch and the Dombivali Tilak Nagar police together formed five teams and started the investigation on Monday night itself. “We conducted a combing operation in the slums within the jurisdiction of Tilak Nagar police station. Following technical evidence and information from sources, we came to know that Khopde was friends with the deceased and had gone to her place during the time of the incident. We arrested her and booked her under section 302 of IPC,” said Ajay Aphale, senior police inspector, Tilak Nagar Police Station.The victim, Vijaya Baviskar, was Khopde’s friend and hence, Baviskar allowed Khopde to stay overnight with her on Sunday. “Khopde took advantage of the situation and strangled Baviskar to death. She stole, the gold ornaments worn by Baviskar including earrings, chain and bangles. Upon arrest, Khopde admitted to having committed the murder and stolen the gold ornaments,” added a police officer from Tilak Nagar police station.Further investigation is underway whether there were any aides to the murder or involvement of others or any other motive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/woman-strangles-friend-to-death-to-steal-gold-ornaments-arrested-101642527651714.html
18-01-2022||Mumbai||City reports over 6K cases, TPR remains constant||Mumbai Mumbai’s positivity rate remained the same on Tuesday as the city reported 6,149 fresh infections in the last 24 hours taking the total case tally to 1,011,314 and seven deaths, taking the toll to 16,476.With 47,700 tests conducted in the last 24 hours, the Test Positivity Rate (TPR) on Tuesday stood at 12.89 per cent, while earlier on Monday the TPR was around 12.51 per cent. Earlier last week, the TPR was around 13 per cent on Sunday (January 16), and 19 per cent on Saturday (January 15).Besides these, the bed occupancy also showed a marginal dip on Tuesday. As per the BMC data, 13.8 per cent (5,265) of the total beds (38,116) are occupied in Mumbai.Experts on Tuesday said that the downward trend in Mumbai has started, however, they also maintained that they need to wait for two more weeks to make a concrete remark on the trend.“At present, our primary objective should be tracking down symptomatic patients and keeping a watch on those on ventilator and ICU treatment. The Delta variant is still there which is causing most of the serious symptoms,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the state Covid-19 task force.“Even though cases have started to decline, there are still close to 5,000 to 6,000 cases now. The numbers are definitely better than how it was during the start of this month, but we shouldn’t become complacent and wait for a few more weeks before making any solid comment,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, member of the national and Maharashtra Covid task force.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner and in charge of public health in the BMC, said that out of the total cases that were reported on Tuesday, around 3,500 positive cases were the patients who got tested with self-test kits.“In the past 24 hours, around 1.25 lakh people had bought and used their self-test kits, out of which 3,500 cases have turned out to be positive. The data of these patients have been shared with the local ward war room which is monitoring their health condition,” said Kakani.He also maintained that the case figures of Wednesday will be important to conclude if the downward trend is consistent.“Usually on Wednesdays, we record more number of cases because of backlog clearance,” Kakani said.Out of the total number of cases that were reported on Tuesday, 84 per cent of them were asymptomatic and at present, there are 44,084 active cases in Mumbai while the recovery rate of the city stands at 94 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/city-reports-over-6k-cases-tpr-remains-constant-101642526933770.html
18-01-2022||Mumbai||Use of national symbols in PM-CARES Fund in conformity with law: PMO to Bombay HC||Mumbai: The use of the national flag and national emblem in the PM CARES Fund is in conformity with the usage allowed by the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950 and Rules madeunder the enactment, the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) has said in an affidavit filed in Bombay high court. The affidavit is filed in response to a public interest litigation challenging the use of the prime minister’s photo, national flag and the national emblem in the PM CARES Fund.The affidavit stated that the flag is used to the extent permitted to any citizen of the country with some exceptions and there is no violation of the national signs and hence the challenge raised in the PIL cannot be maintained and the reliefs sought in it should not be granted.According to the PIL filed by Vikrant Chavan, president, Thane District Congress and councilor of Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC), the Trust called PM’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations (PM-CARES) Fund is a non-government organisation and as amounts collected by it does not go to the Consolidated Fund of India, hence sought directions for removal of the name ‘Prime Minister’, the ‘National Flag’ and the ‘Emblem’ from the name of the Trust and its web portal. The PIL stated that as the Trust was a private entity the use of the name and picture of the prime minister, flag and emblem violate the laws and rules governing the said symbols.Advocate Sagar Joshi for the petitioner had informed HC that as per the Trust Deed, which was executed on March 27, 2020, the PM was the chairman and all the trustees, including union ministers, were appointed in their personal capacity but the trust did not discharge any sovereign functions. The bench was informed that the trust has collected over ₹3,000 crore for relief work using the name and photograph of the prime minister, national flag and emblem thus flouting the relevant laws and rules governing such national signs and symbols.The bench had then directed additional solicitor general Anil Singh for the Union government to file an affidavit in reply to the petition.On Tuesday, the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Makarand Karnik which was hearing the PIL was told that Pradeep Kumar Srivastava, under-secretary, PMO had filed the affidavit. The affidavit denied the claims of the petitioner and challenged the correctness of the contentions.“PM-CARES fund and Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF) are both chaired by the Prime Minister. As the name, photograph of the Prime Minister and National Emblem are being used for the PMNRF, they are also being used for the PM CARES Fund. Flag Code of India, 2002, which brings together all laws, conventions, practices and instructions regarding display of National Flag provided that there cannot restriction on display of National Flag by members of general public, private organizations, educational institutions etc, except to extend provided in the Emblems and Names Act, 1950,” states the affidavit.The affidavit adds that the prime minister is chairperson (ex-officio) of the PM CARES Fund and various ministers are ex-officio trustees of the fund and all of them are in pro bono capacity. The composition of the Board of Trustees consisting of holders of public office ex officio is merely for administrative convenience and for smooth succession of trusteeship.Srivastava has concluded the affidavit stating that the petitioner approached HC without exhausting the administrative remedies available under the concerned laws and rules and hence the petition deserves to be dismissed.After perusing the affidavit, the bench granted 15-day time for the petitioner to file a rejoinder and posted further hearing after three weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/use-of-national-symbols-in-pm-cares-fund-in-conformity-with-law-pmo-to-bombay-hc-101642526932458.html
18-01-2022||Mumbai||Gavit sister case files: How a 25-year-old legal battle unfolded||Mumbai: More than two decades after they were convicted for kidnapping 13 young children, and killing five of them, and seven years after Pranab Mukherjee, the then President of India, rejected their mercy petitions, Renuka Shinde (48) and Seema Gavit (43) will not be hanged. The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday commuted their death sentence to life imprisonment — they will remain lodged at Pune’s Yerwada jail for the rest of their natural lives — on account of the state’s delay in seeking a decision on their mercy petitions after the Supreme Court rejected their appeal in 2006. The mercy pleas were presented in 2014.The kidnappings and murders took place between 1990 and 1996. Anjanabai Gavit lived in a room on rent in Gondhale Nagar, Pune with two daughters, Renuka (aka Rinku aka Ratan) and Seema (aka Devki). The trio moved around in western Maharashtra, including Mumbai Metropolitan Region attending jatras (processions), festivals and other celebrations and visiting landmark temples, where they made a living out of stealing valuables including ornaments of women at these crowded places.Renuka’s husband, Kiran Shinde, who worked as tailor in Pune, reportedly also assisted his wife and in-laws in these thefts. In 1990, Renuka visited a temple with her baby boy. She tried to snatch the purse of a woman but was caught. She was, however, let off, after she raised a hue and cry that she was falsely implicated and she was merely the mother of a small toddler. It was then that the four decided to conduct these thefts with small children in tow, to help them escape easily.According to the police, between 1990 and 1996, the family kidnapped 13 small children below five years of age. According to the police, the women killed nine of these 13 children, disposing of the bodies of at least five in different places in Kolhapur district. They were arrested by the Kolhapur police in October 1996. On June 28, 2001, an additional sessions judge at Kolhapur convicted the two sisters for kidnapping 13 minor children and killing at least six of them — four girls and two boys —sentencing them to death. Five years later, the Bombay HC upheld the sentence but, convicted them for the murder of five children. On August 31, 2006, the Supreme Court upheld the HC’s ruling.Using toddlers as coverTheir first victim was the son of a beggar in Kolhapur and was picked up by Renuka in July 1990. They brought him to Pune and named him Santosh. In April 1991, they took him to Kolhapur, where Seema was caught while trying to steal purse of a devotee at the Mahalaxmi temple. To divert attention away from Seema, Anjanabai dropped Santosh, barely a year old at the time, who sustained injuries. In the melee that ensued, Seema managed to escape, the 2006 SC judgement narrated.The three then went to Kolhapur bus stand where they flicked some purses, but Santosh was crying continuously because of his injuries. Worried that they would get caught, Anjanabai pressed his mouth and dashed his head on an iron bar. Santosh died on the spot, the order further explained. Apart from Santosh, the four also kidnapped children between one and five years, including Anjali, Bunty, Swati, Guddu, Meena, Rajan, Shradha, Gauri, Swapnil and Pankaj — they were convicted for their wrongfully confinement — and murdered at least five of them including Santosh, Shradha, Gauri, Swapnil and Pankaj.In October 1996, Anjanabai, Seema and Renuka were arrested over an unrelated matter — they were accused of kidnapping Anjanabai’s ex-husband’s daughter from another marriage — and during a search of their house, Kolhapur police found several clothes of small children. This opened an investigation which led to the revelation of their heinous crimes. Suhas Nadgauda, one of the investigating officers in the case recalled how a team of policemen from different districts worked hard to establish the chain of events in the court. Nadgauda who is currently assistant commissioner of police at the Anti-Corruption Bureau posted in Kolhapur as a sub-inspector at the time. “The case was first detected in Nashik when the local police arrested Anjanabai. Later, the Crime Investigation Department constituted a team of officers from various places to probe multiple crimes committed by Anjanabai and her two daughters. These cases were later clubbed together and the trial was held at the sessions court in Kolhapur where I was posted,” said Nadgauda. The prosecution’s case was strengthened after Kiran Shinde, Renuka’s husband, turned approver. “Kiran first submitted an application in the Nashik court seeking permission to turn approver. He explained the chain of events, and the roles played by Anjanabai, Renuka and Seema,” Nadgauda said. Kiran also told the police of where the trio had disposed of the children’s bodies. According to advocate Manik Mulik, who represented Renuka and Seema at lower court between 2000 and 2002, some of the parents of the victims would attend the proceedings and deposed before the judge. “Later, they stopped coming and all of us lost their touch,” Mulik said. During the trial, the prosecution examined 156 witnesses. Anjanabai died in 1997 before the trial began. Kiran Shinde was pardoned by the court.The case of the mercy pleasAfter the SC ruling, Seema and Renuka filed a mercy petition on October 10, 2008 and October 17, 2009, respectively. After the President rejected their mercy pleas in 2014, they approached the Bombay HC seeking commutation of their death sentence on the ground that the state had taken an inordinate time causing an unexplained delay in seeking their mercy plea. Their petition stated that on August 28, 2013, the Governor of Maharashtra had rejected their mercy plea and thereafter the file was forwarded to the Central Government – to be submitted to the President of India, who decided on the pleas on July 7, 2014 — within 10 months of receiving it. Shinde and Gavit contended that the President took more than five years to reject their mercy petitions when such a plea should have been disposed of within three months.Through that time, they contended that they lived under the constant fear of death which had caused mental torture, emotional and physical agony to them. On its part, the Maharashtra home department maintained that there was no unreasonable delay on part of the state in forwarding their mercy pleas to the Governor and the President of India. “Whatever delay has been caused, has occurred for complying with the procedure required to be followed at each level,” the state’s affidavit contended. An affidavit filed by the Central government, however, indicated that in April 2012, it sought information from the Maharashtra government on the mercy petitions filed by Renuka and Seema. The Union’s affidavit added a reply from the Maharashtra government dated May 2013, stated that the file pertaining to the sisters’ mercy pleas was destroyed in a fire that broke out in the Mantralaya on March 9, 2013 and work on recreating the file was ongoing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/gavit-sister-case-files-how-a-25-year-old-legal-battle-unfolded-101642525732195.html

18-01-2022||Chandigarh||BJP defaming Punjabiyat: Cong on ED raids against Channi’s relative||New Delhi: The Congress on Tuesday accused the BJP and its government at the Centre of defaming Punjab and Punjabiyat by raiding a relative of Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi in an old case, and said the people of the state will give a befitting reply to the saffron party in the upcoming assembly polls.Congress’s chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the BJP government is insulting a Dalit who was made the chief minister of Punjab and the Dalits and backward classes would not forgive the party for this.e also accused the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) of working in cahoots with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as its convenor Arvind Kejriwal was the first to attack Channi over the raids conducted by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).Surjewala alleged that the ED has turned into the “election department” of the BJP.“Today we saw the limit of vindictiveness. To seek revenge on a Dalit chief minister, the ED has been unleashed in Punjab, with which the chief minister and his family have nothing to do. The BJP is taking revenge on a Dalit chief minister.“The ED is not the enforcement directorate but the BJP’s election department,” he told reporters.Surjewala also alleged that the AAP and the BJP are working together, adding that when the prime minister’s convoy was stalled in Punjab, it was the Arvind Kejriwal-led party that jumped in his defence.“Today, it was Kejriwal who gave the first statement on the raids. In Punjab, Uttrakhand and Goa, the AAP and the BJP are working together. One does a wrong act and the other supports it.“Today, when the ED is raiding on baseless charges, Kejriwal launches the first assault. But the people of Punjab know the meaning of collaboration between Modi and the AAP. Modi has assaulted the dignity of the poor and the Scheduled Castes. They are unable to digest a Dalit as a chief minister. But three crore Punjabis will decide the future,” he said.Surjewala also alleged that Modi and Kejriwal are conspiring to malign Punjab. “Is it not true that the BJP labelled the people of Punjab as Naxals and anti-India? The BJP is constantly conspiring to defame Punjab and Punjabiyat. When the prime minister’s convoy was stalled, BJP leaders called Punjabis Khalistanis. Did anyone stop him?” he asked.All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge for Punjab Harish Chaudhary said according to all the surveys, Channi is the most popular leader in Punjab.He said Punjabis were maligned during the farmers’ agitation, but Punjabiyat stood strong.“The BJP is forgetting that this is not Amarinder Singh, this is Channi. The attempt to muzzle Channi is a mistake. He will keep standing tall. The BJP is anxious with the good governance of Channi,” Chaudhary said.Asked if Channi is so popular, would he be named as the chief ministerial candidate of the Congress for the February 14 Punjab Assembly polls, he said, “That is not the question. The question is whether ED raids can muzzle Channi or Punjabis. Who will be the chief minister is secondary.” Chaudhary said the ED raids are aimed at putting pressure on the Congress, but the leaders of the party will not be deterred by this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-defaming-punjabiyat-cong-on-ed-raids-against-channi-s-relative-101642525492221.html

18-01-2022||Dehradun||Three earthquakes hit Uttarakhand’s Bageshwar, Pithoragarh and Chamoli in 3 days||Seismic tremors measuring 2.5 on the Richter Scale were felt in Uttarakhand’s Bageshwar district on Tuesday, according to data from the National Center for Seismology. The earthquake occurred at 12.05 am in Bageshwar about 5 km beneath the surface of the earth. This is the third earthquake in the state in the last three days. On Monday evening, at around 7.19 pm, Pithoragarh was hit by an earthquake, measuring 2.8 on the Richter Scale. On Sunday, tremors measuring 3.8 on the Richter Scale were felt in Chamoli district. This is not the first earthquake in Bageshwar area in recent times. In January last year, an earthquake measuring 3.3 on the Richter Scale hit Bageshwar. In February 2020, Bageshwar was hit by an earthquake measuring 4.7. At least two people, including a woman and a girl were injured after the earthquake hit the district at around 6.30 am, causing panic among residents who soon came out of their houses, added officials. The National Center for Seismology (NCS) is the nodal agency of the Centre under the earth sciences ministry for monitoring earthquake activity in the country on a 24X7 basis. Dr Kalachand Sain, Director, Wadia Institute of Himalayan Studies said these small tremors that are being reported in the state for the last three days are due to release of accumulated stress in the Himalayan region in the area. “We are looking into the data related to these tremors to check what exactly is happening in the area,” he said. Earthquakes continue to shake up the Himalayas. In August 2021, tremors measuring 3.8 on the Richter Scale were felt in Dehradun district. On December 1, 2020, an earthquake hit Haridwar after a gap of 40 years. The earthquake measuring 3.9 was reported from the Haridwar region at 9:41 am. Experts pointed out that the source of the earthquake was due to stress release in the Himalayan Frontal Fault which is located in this area. On December 8, 2019 Joshimath area was hit by an earthquake measuring 3.2 on the Richter Scale. On November 12, 2019 an earthquake measuring 4.5 was felt in Pithoragarh district. In September 2019, an earthquake measuring 3.6 on the Richter Scale was reported from Chamoli district. In February 2017, a magnitude 5.1 earthquake had struck at a depth of 16 km near Rudraprayag. The Himalayas are the youngest mountain chain (around 50 million years old) in the world, and one which is still rising (around 5 mm per year) due to the Indian plate folding under the Tibetan plate. Uttarakhand being a Himalayan state reports high seismic activity, with most areas falling under Seismic Zones IV and V.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/three-earthquakes-hit-uttarakhand-s-bageshwar-pithoragarh-and-chamoli-in-3-days-101642525072119.html

Radhika Kinnar, 26, resides in a locality in the constituency and claims to be better aware of the issues faced by the locals. “I have to prove that transgender can be active in politics and take care of issues faced by denizens. I aim to work for making education affordable and strengthen the network of government schools, which are in reach of a common man,” said Radhika, who will be contesting as an independent. “With pandemic badly affecting the poor and middle class, I will advocate relaxation in house tax, water tax, GST and income tax for those finding tough to meet ends meet. If there is provision for arresting of a woman by women police, then why not have transgender police for transgender accused,” she said. “Better opportunity for education and job should be provided to transgender as this section has remained neglected and were given identity only in 2014 when it was recognised as a gender. We need a separate reservation for our community,” Radhika said. “Transgender had been doctors and lawyers but are very few.

On Tuesday, the state logged 39,207 fresh cases and 53 deaths. The positivity rate dropped to 20.05 percent with 1,95,542 samples tested.However, state surveillance officer, Dr Pradeep Awate, said that the situation was stabilising by the day. “We are now seeing the numbers settling at 40,000 cases and it does not look like there will be any surge as such in the coming days,” said Dr Awate.“Districts like Mumbai and Palghar, which initially reported a surge, are now recording a decline in the number of cases. In other districts of the state, the numbers may still be high, but that is because the surge started late and still they will stabilise over the coming days,” Dr Awate added.Dr Ishwar Gilada, secretary-general, Organised Medicine Academic Guild, too said that the overall situation has improved. “Various districts like Pune and Nagpur are now witnessing the peak and in a few days we will be seeing the decline in cases,” said Dr Gilada.“The situation is similar to that of South Africa, where the cases came down significantly after a huge surge, unlike European countries,” he added. Notably, Pune recorded 8,617 new Covid-19 cases, while Nagpur logged 2,322 fresh infections in the last 24 hours.Maharashtra did not record a single case of omicron variant case on Tuesday. A total of 1,860 people have tested positive for omicron variant of Covid-19 to date.

18-01-2022||Lucknow||Taking family’s political legacy forward||PRAYAGRAJ While most of the political parties are yet to open their cards on fielding candidates from the 12 Assembly seats of Prayagraj, the district that also has two Lok Sabha seats is witnessing new generations of political families carrying forward their legacy amid the war of words on dynastic politics. “The second generation leaders of some political families have already established themselves over the years and there are also many families whose third generation has either already entered politics or are almost ready to do so,” said Prof MP Dube, political analyst and former vice-chancellor of UP Rajarshi Tandon Open University (UPRTOU). Be it the brother-sister duo of Vijay Bahuguna Joshi and Rita Joshi (sitting MP from Allahabad Parliamentary seat), both taking forward the legacy of their father and former UP CM HN Bahuguna or Sidharth Nath Singh, grandson of former PM Lal Bahadur Shastri to Satish Jaiswal, son of socialist leader Saligram Jaiswal — all are the second-generation leaders, said Prof Dube. Joining the league are leaders of the younger generation like Harshvardhan Bajpai, Ujjwal Raman Singh, Deepak Patel, Shailendra Kumar and his younger brother Satyaveer Munna, both sons of Dharamveer, veteran Congress leader, he added. Harshvardhan is the sitting MLA from Allahabad North Assembly seat. The third generation of the family of former Union minister and governor Rajendra Kumari Bajpai, he had defeated five-time MLA from Congress Anugrah Narain Singh in 2017 to emerge victorious. His father, Ashok Bajpai too, was MLA from the same seat in 1980, said political observers. Likewise, Ujjwal Raman Singh, son of former UP minister and Rajya Sabha MP Kunwar Rewati Raman Singh, became an MLA and a minister in the state government in 2007. He became MLA for the second time in 2017 on Samajwadi Party (SP) ticket. Similarly, Deepak Patel, son of former zila panchayat president and BJP MP from Phulpur, Kesari Devi Patel, became an MLA from Karchana in 2012. Neelam Karwaria of the BJP is wife of former MLA Udaybhan Karwaria. She became MLA for the first time in 2017 from Meja seat. Former MP from Phulpur Kapil Muni and former MLC Surajbhan Karwaria too are from the same family. The political legacy of former MLA of SP Mahesh Narayan Singh is being carried forward by his son Prashant Singh, after he won the Handia Assembly seat in the by-elections of 2013. Pooja Pal of the BSP, wife of Raju Pal, a former MLA from Allahabad West, also became MLA from the same seat, twice, first in 2007 and then in 2012. Former MLA Jawahar Yadav’s wife Vijma Yadav has also moved ahead with his political legacy getting elected from erstwhile Jhunsi seat and later from Pratappur seat of Prayagraj. Former MP Shailendra Kumar, the eldest son of Dharamveer, who was a Union minister and very close to the Gandhi family, is also carrying forward the political legacy of his father. He was also an MP twice. At the same time, Dharmaveer’s younger son Satyaveer Munna became an MLA in 2012 from the Soraon Assembly seat of Prayagraj. However, there were some prominent politicians from Prayagraj, family members of whom did not carry the legacy forward. One such name is MP from Chail seat Ram Nihor Rakesh. The family of former Prime Minister VP Singh, who is said to have changed the course of Indian politics, has also distanced from politics: Neither his son Ajay Singh entered active politics nor anyone else from the family. The families of Jang Bahadur Patel, who became a minister after defeating BSP founder Kanshi Ram from Phulpur and Rang Bahadur Patel, former MLA from Soraon seat, are also away from politics. The son of former Union minister Salim Sherwani has also kept distance from politics.

18-01-2022||Pune||Lack of awareness, social media overuse reasons for rise in cybercrime, say experts||PUNE With increasing use of internet, there has been rise in cybercrimes, with city cybercrime cell receiving 19,023 total complaints in 2021 compared to 14,950 in 2020, and 7,795 in 2019. Cyber experts have attributed lack of awareness, overuse or addiction to social media and increased use of online mode by many looking to earn money during Covid-19 pandemic as some of the reasons for the rise in cybercrimes. Among social media-related cybercrime, the cases from Facebook and Instagram are the highest. Cybercrimes majorly are of two types, namely corporate crime and individual crime. “Corporate firms majorly suffer from the threats related to company’s database. They are attacked through hacking or by sending huge traffic to the system,” said Rizwan Shaikh, cybercrime expert, who has previously assisted Pune police in probing cyber offences. “Individuals become the victim of cyberstalking, payment frauds and blackmailing in the times of social media,” Shaikh added. Cybercriminals are becoming smarter and utilise the trending opportunity to blackmail people. “Recently, majority of the people have fallen prey to the fake calls regarding booster dose of the vaccine. Citizens end up losing money by providing the OTP sent by the hackers,” said Shaikh. “There is an increase in internet-related crimes. Such crimes include debit and credit card related frauds, online payment frauds, and much more,” said Sunil Srivastava, director of Cyber Crime Helpline LLP. Complaint against cybercrime helps to get back the losses. “Majority of the cybercrime includes children, women, senior citizens or people with lesser awareness regarding the digital platform. Most of the complaints filed during Covid-19 were of digital payment frauds,” said Advocate Vaishali Bhagwat. “Cases related to digital sexual harassment increased. Social media has proven to be an advantageous tool to commit identity theft which involved editing of a picture from social media account,” Bhagwat added. Reporting a crime has eased and the identity is not revealed without consent. Such crimes can be reported directly on cybercrime.gov.in. The government website will then direct your complaint to the concerned department near your area. This reduces the burden of visiting a police station or bank (for a financial crime). Non-disclosure of the name has encouraged a larger number of people to file complaints, especially complaints related to sexual harassment. “The percentage of people filling complaints has risen because of the simplified procedure and non-disclosure of identity,” said advocate Bhagwat. To avoid such crimes, awareness among people is highly needed. Keep at least 12-14 character alphanumeric passwords to avoid hacking. Keep a minimum number of apps on your smartphone to avoid bugs, according to experts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/lack-of-awareness-social-media-overuse-reasons-for-rise-in-cybercrime-say-experts-101642523512673.html

PU is the first varsity in the state to introduce CBCS at UG level. The new system would encourage multi-disciplinary courses which is a part of New Education Policy 2020.”Choudhary also clarified the varsity has yet not announced fee hike for B.Ed course.“Like other government colleges, we are considering to increase B.Ed fees to ₹25,000 for two years, which is as low as ₹1,800 per year at present. As the college is facing huge financial crunch, we are planning a considerable hike in fees so that the training college will be able to meet administrative expenses. However, the decision is yet to finalised,” he said, dismissing rumours of hiking fees to ₹1.50 lakh which recently created unrest among students. Talking about the work progress in the current session, he said, “Covid-19 outbreak has adversely affected proposed work in various fields including infrastructure development, recruitment of guest faculties and PhD course work. Our academic session is also running late by six months. We hope to bring the derailed work on track in the next academic session.”In an effort to improve NAAC grade, Choudhary emphasised on cultivating conducive research environment among students and teachers.“We have already allotted a sum of ₹2 crore for encouraging research work which would eventually help the varsity to fetch better grade in the next NAAC assessment. We are ready to extend all possible help to research scholars for creating a favourable environment for research work”, he added.Choudhary also said that the varsity is looking forward to strengthen placement facility and alumni association.In the meeting, the V-C answered queries of several senate members and noted their suggestions for formulating future action plan.Manish Kumar, president of Patna University Students’ Union (2019-20), pointed out that hostels near Rani Ghat are in dire need of repair and renovation.“Rani Ghat hotels are in dilapidated condition from many years. We demand immediate renovation of the hostel. Besides, special bus service should be provided to girls for transportation. Students showing interest in research work should also get financial assistance”, he pointed.The senate meeting was held virtually owing to Covid-19 restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/patna-university-gives-nod-to-rs-525-77-crore-deficit-budget-101642523455146.html

The total number of Omicron cases in the state had now gone up to 67 after the strain was detected in 27 (85%) of the 32 Covid-19 samples tested on January 9. Four samples (12%) were then found to have the Delta variant while one was of an insignificant variant, which remained unknown, IGIMS director Dr NR Biswas had then said. Patna accounted for 55% (22) of the 40 cases of Omicron on Tuesday. Muzaffarpur reported five, followed by Gaya three; Jamui, Khagaria and Munger two each. Samastipur, Saran, Sitamarhi and Bhagalpur had one each, said officials aware of the development.

He also undertook tours as part of his Samaj Sudhar Abhiyan and attended to his weekly janata durbars to hear public grievances, which were subsequently put on hold. “Omicron has emerged as the predominant strain of Covid-19 in Bihar. There is definitely a declining trend in the number of new Covid-19 cases, but it is too early to conclude anything at this stage. We are keeping a close watch on the situation. Vaccination and following Covid-appropriate behaviour are the key to slowing down the spread of the virus,” Pratyaya Amrit, Bihar’s additional chief secretary (health), said at a press conference later in the evening.

18-01-2022||Patna||Bihar considers relaxation in liquor law||Faced with all-round fire from all sides in the wake of multiple hooch tragedies and harsh comments from the Supreme Court due to mounting legal cases and huge pendency, the Bihar government is now contemplating to relax some of the stringent provisions of its liquor prohibition law in force since April 2016 and provide relief for first-time offenders, said a senior official of the prohibition and excise department. This intends to insert new sub-sections in the Bihar Prohibition and Excise (Amendment) Act, 2016, to scale down the penal provisions and impose financial penalty. The amendments may be brought through an ordinance or the proposed Bihar Prohibition and Excise (Amendment) Bill, 2022, during the next session of the state legislature. Additional chief secretary (home) Chaitanya Prasad said consultations are under way on the proposal initiated by the excise department to amend some provisions and provide relief to first-time offenders caught drinking by imposing a fine. Failure to pay penalty shall invite simple imprisonment of one month, but repeat offences may invite additional penalty or imprisonment or both. According to the proposed amendments under discussion, all offences related to prohibition law shall be disposed of through summary trial by an executive magistrate not below the rank of deputy collector. Investigations will be conducted by an excise officer or a police officer not below the rank of assistant sub-inspector. The proposed amendments also have a provision for release of vehicles/ animals used for carrying intoxicants or liquor by the collector upon payment of fixed penalty, failing which the collector shall proceed with confiscation proceedings. In July last year, the Patna High Court had directed that all proceedings related to confiscation of property under the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016, must positively be initiated/concluded within a period of 90 days from the date of appearance of the parties concerned and the appeal/revision, if any, be also decided within a period of 30 days from the date of initiation, failing which the “things” (vehicle/property/ etc.) shall be deemed to have been released.The new amendments propose that any person arrested under this Act shall be produced before the nearest judicial magistrate or executive magistrate within 24 hours either in person or through the medium of electronic video linkage. For seeking custody also, production of seizures will not be necessary and electronic evidence will suffice. As per the proposed amendments, all offences shall be tried by special court(s). The state government may, if necessary, appoint in every district more special court in consultation with the chief justice of the High Court and appoint retired judges to preside over these courts.“In cases where offences are punishable with death or imprisonment for a term not less than l0 years, the report has to be filed within 90 days from the date of the registration of the case. In all other cases, the report needs to be filed within 60 days from the date of the registration of the case,” say the amendments. As per official statistics, nearly 25 per cent of the total pendency of cases in lower courts and 20% in the High Court is prohibition related cases. In 2019, alarmed by the growing pendency, the Patna High Court had asked the state government to present a plan for how it plans to dispose these cases. Though special courts were mandated in the new law for trial of liquor related cases, they could not be set up. Later, the state cabinet cleared a proposal for setting up 74 special courts, but virtual hearing for the last two years further added to pendency and lack of production of witnesses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-considers-relaxation-in-liquor-law-101642523154270.html

18-01-2022||Mumbai||Study pitches for 5,000 artificial bird nests to mitigate impact of bullet train||Mumbai A study funded by the National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL), which is executing the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project, has suggested the installation of 5,000 artificial bird nests along the 508.17 km alignment of the proposed railway line to mitigate the potential impact on avian biodiversity. The allocated budget for the nests is ₹8,48,458.The study titled ‘Report on Mitigation Measures on Birds’ Nests Along the Proposed Alignment of Mumbai- Ahmedabad High Speed Rail Project’ was conducted in 2019 and submitted to the forest department last month as part of the process to obtain Stage-II forest clearance (FC). It found that the area of alignment houses as many as 55,446 bird nests, of which a large majority (44,897) were baya weaver nests. Of these, 10 percent of baya weaver nests are “active” because males of the species build multiple nests in a single area, but use only a fraction of them.  The researchers noted, “Under this (bullet train) development, there will be an impact on biodiversity due to alteration/loss of habitat due to tree cutting and other activities. The study involves understanding the qualitative and quantitative impact on the avifauna nest and proposing mitigation measures for the same.”Through primary data collection, researchers with Terra Nero (a Thane-based environmental consultancy were able to identify a total of 26 different bird species in the study area, while the presence of another 62 species was confirmed through secondary data collection (i.e., from academic publications in scientific journals and a range of environmental impact assessment reports). “Out of the total avifaunal species observed, no species is found to be globally threatened as per the International Union for the Conservation of Nature,” the study noted.Researchers also noted significant evidence that birds were breeding in the area. They observed specimens carrying food and nesting material, performing “distraction displays” to divert possible predators away from their nests (which may harbour young ones) and indulging in persistent alarm calls and agitated behaviour, which also indicates the presence of offspring nearby. Researchers noted the presence of nests across six different types of habitats, including forest land, rivers, scrubland, paddy fields, ponds and also human settlements.HT reached out to Anjum Pervez, officer on special duty, NHSRCL, for a comment but did not receive a response on Tuesday. Dipti Sharma, a Quality Council of India certified ecologist and founder of Terra Nero, said, “Based on our assessment of the project’s impacted area and the budgetary allocation, we arrived at a figure of 5,000 artificial nests which should be installed to minimise the project’s impact on birds, particularly through loss of habitat. It is very hard to predict how many of these nests will  be used. They are typically more successful in urban settings, with species such as sparrows. For baya weavers, nest building is an important part of their behaviour so they may not take to artificial nests at all.”Terra Nero’s study recommends, “An optimal density of about 5,000 artificial nests is suggested to be placed in the study area as an effort towards rehabilitation of the disturbed birds. The artificial nests should be a mixture of a box type as well as platform and cup type nests made of materials usually used by birds. The placement of these artificial nests may be in a mixture of natural and modified habitats. It must be ensured that after placing the artificial nests, the overall carrying capacity of those habitats is not exceeded.” Veteran birder and former director of the Bombay Natural History Society, Dr Asad Rahmani, said, “I cannot comment on this report as I have not seen it, but the use of artificial nests is not very effective at mitigating the impact of any project. Fortunately, birds are not as affected as terrestrial mammals by liner intrusions. Nevertheless, the project proponent should ensure that habitat restoration is carried out around the project area so that the birds do not move away due to loss of trees.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/study-pitches-for-5-000-artificial-bird-nests-to-mitigate-impact-of-bullet-train-101642522375566.html

18-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Bhagwant is AAP’s Mann of the moment||Chandigarh: The announcement of two-time Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann’s name by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal as the party’s chief ministerial face in Punjab on Tuesday has not come as a surprise. Mann, 48, who is also the AAP’s Punjab president, is easily the party’s most recognisable face in the state, where polls are scheduled on February 20. His selection following a phone-based survey in which 93.3% of the 21.59 lakh respondents favoured him is on the expected lines. Mann, who has faced several controversies, is a proven crowd-puller for his party for which he has been leading the campaign since its electoral debut in the state. His folksy style topped by quick wit and biting sarcasm, particularly “kikli” (satirical speeches) targeting politicians and issues, have been a huge hit in the rural areas of Punjab, particularly the Malwa region, which sends 69 of the 117 lawmakers to the assembly, on which the party is counting a lot. Mann’s tryst with politics Mann, a college drop-out, is a standup comedian-turned-politician. He took the political plunge in 2011 by joining the People’s Party of Punjab (PPP), a party set up by Manpreet Singh Badal (now in the Congress) after he parted ways with the Akalis. He took on former chief minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal of the Congress in Lehra assembly constituency in the 2012 elections, but came third. When Manpreet allied with the Congress, Mann did not follow him, opting for the AAP instead, and he has not looked back since. In 2014, Mann won the Sangrur seat by more than 2.11 lakh votes, which was the highest margin in the state. When the newbie outfit contested its first assembly election in 2017, he crisscrossed the state to campaign for the party candidates, besides taking on SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal in the latter’s stronghold of Jalalabad. He lost and came second ahead of Congress’ Ravneet Singh Bittu, now MP from Ludhiana. But the AAP won 20 seats to become the principal opposition party in Punjab. In the 2019 national polls, when all other AAP candidates in the state lost their security deposits, Mann again retained the Sangrur seat by over 1.11 lakh votes. Mann is the lone AAP MP in the Lok Sabha, but has been grabbing attention regularly with his quick wit and sharp digs at the rival BJP and Congress. He has also worked assiduously to help Punjabi youth and women stranded abroad return home. Brush with controversies The humorist was in the new for all wrong reasons a few years ago after his embarrassing videos showing him in an inebriated state. In January 2019, he took a public pledge, with his mother Harpal Kaur by his side, to quit alcohol to avoid any embarrassment to the party. “I have taken a solemn vow to say no to booze for good in my mother’s presence,” he told a gathering at a rally also attended by Kejriwal. Mann’s rivals have often portrayed him as unfit for public office because of his past drinking problem. A campaign with hashtag #Pegwant is being run on social media to target him, despite his statements that he has given up alcohol. After being named the CM face, he told a news channel that people of Punjab have put their stamp of approval on him and his rivals have nothing else to say against him. “They cannot accuse me of corruption or send ED (Enforcement Directorate) after me. I have a clean image. I still live in a rented house. They have been saying this about me for 11 years,” he said. Mann was once also accused of compromising parliamentary security by live-streaming the security arrangements at the Parliament House on social media and several parties had demanded action against him. Serious bid for top job Born in Satoj village of Sangrur district, Mann, who came out with his first satire in 1992 and then became a household name with his popular albums and TV shows like “Kulfi Garam Garam”, “Mithiya Mircha” and “Jugnu Mast Mast”, is making a serious bid for the top post. Though his political rivals often criticize him for being “facile” on governance and policy detail, he has started laying out his vision and roadmap for the state lately. Gone is the relaxed demeanour and jokes, and the burden of responsibility and growing expectations is writ large on his face these days. A tireless campaigner with ability to tilt the scales, Mann is undoubtedly AAP’s man of the moment.

18-01-2022||Mumbai||Pay ₹1,212 toll for one-way trip on Mumbai-Nagpur e-way||Mumbai: The Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) that is constructing India’s longest access-controlled expressway between Mumbai and Nagpur has proposed a toll of ₹1,212 as one-way for light motor vehicles like cars and jeep. The distance between Mumbai and Nagpur is 701 km. Interestingly, the toll will be charged on the basis of the km one wants to travel. For instance, if someone is travelling between Mumbai and Nashik or Aurangabad, vehicles will be charged ₹1.73 per km.The MSRDC is planning to open Nagpur-Aurangabad stretch of the expressway by March or April this year and the entire stretch by end of the year. Chandrakant Pulkundwar, joint managing director shared, “We have proposed the toll rates after consultation and approval from the state government, however, the proposed toll rates will be officially notified by a gazette few days before opening of the expressway. The toll rates that we have proposed will be for 701 km, and the proposed rates are on the basis of per km.”Further, according to the toll rates list, the second category is light commercial vehicle, light goods vehicle or mini bus for which the one-way toll between Mumbai and Nagpur will be ₹2.79 per km, which tallies down to ₹1,955. The third category is bus or truck (two axle) for which ₹5.85 per km will be charged, summing up to ₹4,100.The remaining three categories are heavy vehicles that includes three axle commercial vehicles for which ₹6.38 per km or ₹4,472, followed by ₹9.18 per km or ₹6,435 will be charged for mobilising of heavy construction machinery. The last category is of oversized vehicles or multi axles (seven or more axles), the toll per km is ₹11.17 which essentially means ₹7,830 between Mumbai and Nagpur.The entire stretch between Mumbai and Nagpur will have 26 toll booths and the MSRDC has recently floated bids for appointing agency for toll collection agency on the expressway.As per the average daily traffic study, the daily vehicle usage has been divided into more than 20 sections and the highest volume of traffic is anticipated is between Mumbai and Nashik. As per the study, daily around 150,000 vehicles are expected to ply between Mumbai and Nashik using the Mumbai Nagpur Expressway by the end of 2025. The MSRDC has further also listed 23 categories of vehicles who are listed as VIP vehicles and they will be eligible for being exempted from paying toll using the Mumbai Nagpur Expressway also known as Hindu Hridaysamrat Balasaheb Thackerat Maharashtra Samruddhi Mahamarg.According to MSRDC, it is aiming to make the entire expressway between Mumbai and Nagpur operational by December 2022. However, it is also aiming to make the Nagpur to Aurangabad stretch operational by March or April and further by December the expressway will be made operational in phases. However, due to COVID lockdown there are chances there being a three months delay in making the entire expressway operational.Officials said at least 70% of the civil construction work is completed on the Expressway, and in the first phase it will be made operational in phases possibly from the Nagpur end. On the Mumbai end, the Expressway will start from Shahpur district. According to MSRDC officials, the civil work will shortly be completed for Expressway but the supporting infrastructure like petrol pumps, food plaza, toilets etc are all being set up simultaneously.Meanwhile, around 30% of daily passenger traffic travelling via flight and train may shift their travel mode to the road, once the 701-km-long Mumbai-Nagpur Expressway is ready for public use by 2022, revealed a report prepared by the MSRDC in 2018.The report added that currently, more than 26,000 passengers travel between Mumbai and Nagpur daily via flight and train of which nearly 8,000 passengers may shift to the road. 87 more buses and 1,166 more cars are expected to run on the road due to the construction of the expressway, revealed the detailed project report (DPR) prepared for the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pay-1-212-toll-for-one-way-trip-on-mumbai-nagpur-eway-101642521351153.html
18-01-2022||Chandigarh||Bhagwant Mann is a compromised CM candidate: Sukhbir||Chandigarh :Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Tuesday said the AAP had fallen back on “compromised candidate” as no one was ready to lead the party in Punjab.He called the move as a “stage-managed non-event”. “AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal never wanted to make Mann the face of the party in Punjab. He has been saying so at Mann’s face because the party was looking for a capable candidate. It is also a fact that the AAP sounded off a number of prospective candidates but they refused” said Sukhbir adding that the responsibility has been given to Mann after a make belief survey. Sukhbir said Mann as AAP’s CM candidate reflected the complete bankruptcy, adding, “a desperate public relation exercise is underway to wash away Mann’s omissions and commissions and project him as a leader who can take on the mantle of a CM even though his wayward and irresponsible conduct is known to everyone”. He asked Kejriwal to tell Punjabis whom they should repose their trust now. “AAP has led a public campaign urging Punjabis to repose trust in Kejriwal. Now Mann has been chosen to lead the party, it needs to explain why Punjabis should trust a leader who Kejriwal refused to endorse,” asked Sukhbir. Sukhbir said, Punjabis need strong, decisive leadership who has a proven track record of conducting swift development, ensuring law and order and peace and communal harmony in this border State. Bhagwant Mann does not fit this bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bhagwant-mann-is-a-compromised-cm-candidate-sukhbir-101642521111198.html

Besides various sarpanches and local party office-bearers from the segment, former MLA from erstwhile Beas segment Vir Pawan Kumar also attended the meeting to back his claim to the ticket.Also read: Punjab minister Tript Bajwa questions ‘one family, one ticket’ formulaSpeaking over phone, Satinder Singh said: “All party workers and voters have been disheartened by the allotment of the ticket to the sitting MLA, who they wanted to get rid of. The high command was made aware of his record; yet, he has been fielded again. Party workers are angry with this decision and want this ticket to be withdrawn from him within 24 hours. Otherwise, they will be forced to chalk out the next course of action.”Responding to the ultimatum and corruption allegations against him, Bhalaipur said: “The high command didn’t express trust in me overnight. It was done after a series of surveys in the segment. As far as allegations levelled against me are concerned, everyone can visit this segment and ask the people if I have indulged in any wrongdoing ever. These are false allegations.” Satinder Singh had organised a massive rally in the segment to stake his claim on December 11.

The seizure followed a tip off received by senior police inspector (crime), Shatrughan Mali, on January 15 that a large quantity of gutkha had been stocked in the Mahape MIDC area. Following this, the crime branch unit 3 started patrolling the area and laid a trap.According to Navi Mumbai police commissioner, Bipin Kumar Singh, “The crime branch team found four tempos near Tata Motors area of MIDC, of which one was checked. The personnel found Gutkha in it. Thus, the other three were checked and they also had gutkha. On interrogation, the tempo drivers revealed that they had got the contraband from a nearby godown. We checked the godown and found gutkha there as well.”The police informed the FDA officials and ₹42,72,000 worth of Maharashtra state government-banned flavoured tobacco and pan masala was seized. He added, “We also seized the four tempos worth ₹18 lakh used in the crime, taking the total seizure to ₹60.72 lakh and seven people have also been arrested.” Explaining the modus operandi, Singh said, “The accused smuggled the contraband from other states after purchasing them at cheaper rates. They stock them in the rented godown in Mahape MIDC area. From here, they are taken in smaller vehicles like tempos to Navi Mumbai, Mumbai and Thane areas for retailers to sell at higher prices.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/gutkha-tobacco-worth-43l-seized-in-navi-7-arrested-101642518590799.html
18-01-2022||Mumbai||Maharashtra Congress chief leaves party red-faced, again||Mumbai When he was appointed as the Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) President last year, Nanabhau Falgunrao aka Nana Patole’s redeeming feature was his aggression.The Congress was at a low ebb in the state, where it was born in 1885 and strode the political stage like a colossus till the 1980s. Patole was expected to revive the party with his aggression and credentials as a leader of the other backward class (OBC) Kunbi (peasant) caste, which has a strong presence in Vidarbha.Ironically, a year on, the Congress is finding itself at the receiving end of Patole’s mercurial temperament.From claiming that he was under police surveillance, ruffling allies Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Shiv Sena by stating that the Congress would fight elections on its own, and complaining of irregularities in the allocation of a coal washing tender, which was seen as an attack on party colleague and energy minister Nitin Raut, Patole’s utterances have left the Congress red-faced.The crowning glory came when Patole was captured on camera saying at Lakhni in Bhandara: “I can beat Modi, I can abuse him.” However, Patole claimed he was referring to a local goon who was the Prime Minister’s namesake. “I am aware of the dignity of the post of the prime minister and I have not said anything against Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” he said.Upset Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers took to the streets in protest, while union minister Narayan Rane, who was arrested last year for threatening to slap Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, called for similar action against Patole as this is an issue with “national security” ramifications. Union Nitin Gadkari too demanded Patole’s arrest for making such a statement against the Prime Minister.Former chief minister and leader of the Opposition, Devendra Fadnavis attacked the Congress and asked if it was a political party in a democratic setup or organisation spreading terror. “Where is the Congress Party heading? Once known for participation in the freedom struggle, now stooping down so low just for sake of power. Is Congress a political party in a democratic setup or organisation spreading terror?”Fadnavis remarked and added that Patole had grown only physically but not mentally. Maharashtra BJP president Chandrakant Patil dared Patole to produce the criminal he was referring to and said they would complain to Governor B.S. Koshyari and approach the court. Former minister and BJP general secretary Chandrashekhar Bawankule lodged a complaint against Patole at Koradi police station in Nagpur and staged a dharna on Tuesday morning to seek his arrest. Bavankule was later detained by the police.Former BJP minister Dr Anil Bonde outdid Patole’s intemperate language by likening him to a dog and threatening that his palm would be chopped off. Security was beefed up at Patole’s Nagpur residence in view of the protests.“This is an almost childish controversy,” admitted a senior Congress leader. “Aggression can be a double-edged sword when we are one of the parties in the ruling coalition. This is time to rebuild the party organisation ground-up,” he said. The Congress leader said personal attacks on Modi could boomerang. Patole’s rather unconvincing clarification had deepened the embarrassment, he added.“At present, we are in an ideological confrontation with the BJP, which is challenging the cohesive idea of India… In such times, we much build the party organisation and a strong team, rather than stoke controversy through such statements,” said another Congress leader. He pointed to how the NCP, which controls crucial departments like home, finance and rural development in the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA), was spreading its social base at the cost of the Congress.Patole’s own ambitions—the four-term legislator from Bhandara district and former Lok Sabha MP is said to be eager to become a minister—are churning the pot further, the leader admitted.H.K. Patil, All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary and in-charge for Maharashtra, could not be contacted. However, state Congress spokesperson Atul Londhe reiterated that Patole’s comments were not aimed at the Prime Minister but at a local criminal. He added that this criminal, Umesh alias Modi, who is a history sheeter from a village called Gondi, has been summoned by the Bhandara police.Political analyst Hemant Desai said Patole’s statement had come in the backdrop of the alleged breach of Modi’s security in Punjab and added that his clarification did not seem to hold any water. “The Congress seems to be caught in a controversy of its own making… (Patole must ensure that) he does not become the Mani Shankar Aiyar of Maharashtra,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-congress-chief-leaves-party-red-faced-again-101642518290720.html
18-01-2022||Lucknow||Tell people about the power of every vote: PM to BJP workers||VARANASI Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday urged BJP workers in his parliamentary constituency Varanasi to tell people about the importance of voting and emphasised that “every vote is important.”He also inquired about the condition of farmers in the district and in adjoining areas. He asked them to expand the reach of the government’s welfare schemes to farmers and said they should make farmers aware of the use of chemical-free fertilisers. Modi was holding an audio interaction with BJP workers of his constituency through the Namo App and reaffirmed the BJP’s commitment towards development. Expansion of Kashi Vishwanath temple in the form of KV Corridor, women empowerment, infrastructure and healthcare development were among the topics that came up for discussion during the interaction.This was his first political interaction involving party workers since the Election Commission (EC) announced the schedule for the Assembly polls to five states, including UP. In the wake of rising Covid cases, the EC, in its order, had forbidden political parties to hold road shows, rallies, padyatras till January 22.The PM spoke to a BJP worker each of eight assembly constituencies, including Varanasi South, Varanasi North, Varanasi Cantt, Shivpur, Ajgara, Pindara, Sevapuri and Rohania in the district. He began the interaction by speaking to Ashutosh Sharma, BJP booth level president of Bageshwari Mandal in Varanasi North Assembly constituency. He asked, “How cold is it in Varanasi.” In response, Sharma said: “We were expecting good weather after Makar Sankranti. But this year, it’s colder in Varanasi.” “It will be cold there (for sometime). Now, weather keeps changing. Tell me, how is the heat of election in Varanasi,” asked Modi. Sharma informed that people were happy with the “double engine government” and mentioned various development works like construction of ring roads, convention centre etc in Kashi. The PM said he worked for improving Kashi’s connectivity, focused on preserving its ‘virasat’ (heritage) and ensured ‘vikas’ (development). He appealed to the people of Kashi to park their vehicles properly in order to avoid the problem of traffic jam. He said, “The election is a test for political parties, but it is also a sort of training camp in which large number of workers can be trained. We should always remember the mantra of expansion of the organisation (BJP) and development of party workers.” “This is the time of election. We have to tell people about the power of each and every vote. Me and Yogiji are able to do so many things as the people of UP gave blessings of their votes to us,” said Modi. Modi interacted with Shravan Rawat, booth president of Pt Deendayal Mandal of Varanasi South constituency, and asked him if he, (Rawat) along with his family, visited the Kashi Vishwanath corridor and what changed he felt now. Rawat told the PM: “The KV corridor is grand and divine. A large number of devotees are visiting the Kashi Vishwanath Temple daily, due to which business of flower sellers and other tea vendors is thriving.” Modi thanked Rawat for describing the change in an articulate manner and asked him and other workers not to miss any chance to work for the people. The PM also urged BJP workers to take visitors to Kabir Chaura and Sant Ravidas Temple for ‘darshan’ as the government undertook many developmental works at both the places. Seema Kumari, BJP booth president of Mahamana Mandal in Cantt Assembly constituency, informed the PM that women were happy as they got houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. “All these works were done because women gave us the opportunity to serve them by taking a right decision,” Modi told Seema. The Prime Minister also asked her to connect more with women self help groups and digital payment facility. While interacting with BJP booth president Manoj Patel of Rohania Assembly constituency, Modi asked: “What is the condition of farmers in Varanasi and its adjoining areas? Patel informed that the farmers were happy as the government promoted farming of vegetables and fruits. Modi also spoke to BJP worker Narayan Prajapati of Sevapuri area and urged him to work as a team. Prajapati informed the PM that health services had improved in Varanasi due to the construction of new hospitals. When the PM inquired about electricity supply in the district, BJP worker from Pindara, Akhilesh Dubey, said rural pockets were getting uninterrupted power supply. Modi also appealed to BJP worker Shriratan of Ajgara Assembly constituency to motivate people to take the Covid vaccination shot. Modi asked party workers run a micro donation drive through the Namo App and make efforts for micro donations of ₹5 and ₹10 by people. “This drive would not be for fund raising, but will be a powerful medium to connect with more people. It should be completed by the end of January,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/tell-people-about-the-power-of-every-vote-pm-to-bjp-workers-101642518232663.html
18-01-2022||Chandigarh||One family, one ticket: Punjab minister Tript Bajwa questions Congress formula||Amid widespread revolt in the Congress over ticket allotment for the Punjab assembly elections, cabinet minister and Fatehgarh Churian MLA Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa on Tuesday questioned the party high command’s “one family, one ticket” formula.Already announced as the party candidate from Fatehgarh Churian, Bajwa organised a show of strength at his residence in Qadian to stake his family’s claim to the ticket from Batala, a largely urban segment in Gurdaspur district from where the Congress is yet to field a candidate. “Congress rank and file want me or my son to contest elections from Batala. I would like to request the high command to have a rethink, considering their sentiments. We want the Congress to form the government in Punjab again, for which the high command should take the decision according to the ground reality,” said Bajwa, while interacting with the media on the occasion.Also read: Eyeing Baba Bakala ticket, Youth Cong leader revoltsQuestioning the Congress formula, the cabinet minister said: “Not allotting two tickets to a family is not the verdict of the Supreme Court. This is the thinking of the high command. Forming government in Punjab is necessary, not applying such formulas.”Giving examples of MPs Chaudhari Santokh Singh and Dr Amar Singh, Bajwa said that their sons have been given the tickets for assembly polls. “Even this implies giving two tickets to a family. In fact, Santokh Singh’s family has been given three tickets, as his brother has also been fielded from Kartarpur. Then why are we being given such treatment?” he said.On his present candidature, Bajwa said there was no question of leaving Fatehgarh Churian. “If the party gives us tickets on both seats, we will win both. This is demand of the segment, and I have conveyed it to the party high command,” he said, while remaining silent on his supporters’ suggestion to field him or his son as an Independent from Batala.The cabinet minister has been eying the Batala seat for long. He has ensured execution of several development projects in the assembly segment and has been taking part in its local politics. He got his loyalists appointed on key posts, including mayor, Improvement Trust chairman and market committee chairman, and even in the bureaucracy. Amid his active participation and presence in Batala, its former three-time MLA Ashwani Sekhri, who is a strong contender for the party ticket, has been upped the ante. Recently, even Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu backed Sekhri’s claim.Sri Hargobindpur: Partap Bajwa asks high command to review decision Rajya Sabha member Partap Singh Bajwa, who is the Congress candidate from Qadian segment, has expressed his disagreement with the party’s decision of giving the Sri Hargobindpur ticket to Mandeep Singh Rangar Nangal.Currently serving as the sarpanch of Rangar Nangal village, Mandeep Singh is seen close to Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa and was preferred over sitting Sri Hargobindpur MLA Balwinder Singh Ladi. After conducting a meeting with his supporters at Ghuman in this segment in Gurdaspur district, Partap Singh Bajwa asked the Congress high command to review the ticket allotment. Former state legislator Ashwani Sekhri also accompanied him. Sources said they are supporting Ladi. 
18-01-2022||Lucknow||Scramble for party tickets in UP: Many want to script ‘son rise’, others pitch for relatives||LUCKNOW From veiled threats to outright rebellion, from a woman politician eyeing her ‘son’s rise’ signaling that she won’t contest elections anymore to a couple staking claim from the same assembly seat, politicians in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh are doing everything it takes to force their parties to allot tickets to their relatives. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), whose leaders have been pitching for their relatives, has now decided against fielding relatives of the same family (barring those already elected representatives), a stance that is said to have angered its OBC minister Swami Prasad Maurya who quit the party, triggering a spate of resignations. BJP leaders have been openly stating that Maurya, who won the 2017 UP polls on BJP ticket from Padrauna and whose daughter Sanghmitra is a BJP MP from Badaun, was angry over denial of ticket to his son. Maurya has denied the charge, though. The ruling party is said to be less accommodating in terms of individual family requests, but the opposition is a bit more liberal to the prospect. BJP MP Rita Bahuguna Joshi is eyeing a ticket for her son Mayank, who has been politically active since 2009. “I am ready to quit if that is what it takes to get ticket for my son,” she said in Delhi, where she is currently camping. The list within the BJP of those leaders seeking a ‘son-rise’ is growing – from union minister Kaushal Kishore, MP from Mohanlalganj to another BJP MP Jagdambika Pal. But, the most interesting family pitch has come from a couple with husband, BJP vice-president Daya Shankar Singh making a bid from the same seat from where his wife Swati, a minister too, is a lawmaker. “I am a BJP man and there is no confusion with us. If I will get a ticket, Swati will sit out and if Swati gets it, I will have to sit out,” said Daya Shankar. But it isn’t the BJP alone. There is a long list of opposition leaders from the Samajwadi Party to the Congress pushing to accommodate family members. While the SP has declared former minister Azam Khan, currently in jail, to be the party’s candidate again from his traditional Rampur seat, his son Abdullah, just out on bail, would be the party candidate from Swar Assembly segment of Rampur from where he had won before being disqualified for using fake age record. There is suspense on the Unchchar seat in Rae Bareli, which is currently represented by SP’s Manoj Pandey but reportedly eyed by Swami Prasad Maurya for his son Utkrisht. Pandey who won the seat in 2012 and 2017 is a strong claimant. “It would be interesting to see how far the SP accommodates Maurya’s demand,” a BJP leader said. Harendra Malik, a Rajya Sabha MP and Pankaj Malik, father-son duo who resigned from the Congress to join the Samajwadi Party, are also said to be making a pitch for assembly seat for Pankaj and a Lok Sabha ticket later for Harendra. Ambedkarnagar MP and BSP leader Ritesh Pandey’s father Rakesh Pandey recently left BSP and joined SP. However eyeing tickets, Rakesh’s brother Pawan Pandey and his son Prateek have since left BJP and joined BSP. Former MP Ramakant Yadav, who recently left the BJP and joined SP, is reportedly eyeing tickets for his two sons. BJP lawmaker from Bilhaur, Bhagwati Sagar, who was among the party rebels to join the SP is now seeking tickets for his son from his seat while he reportedly is interested in contesting from Mauranipur Assembly segment in Bundelkhand. There are reports that the SP might field Krishna Patel, leader of Apna Dal (Sonelal) from Pratapgarh, but suspense prevails over whether Krishna Patel’s daughter Pallavi Patel too would get to contest. “The maximum push is for BJP and SP, the two most sought-after parties this election,” said Irshad Ilmi, a political observer, who said while the BJP has cleared that it won’t give tickets to more than one family member, there is confusion on the stand of other parties. “A big reason for the SP being the most favoured destination could also be that the party leadership hasn’t cleared the air on more than one family member seeking tickets. May be winnability is,” said Ilmi. 
18-01-2022||Mumbai||Unidentified persons booked for mangroves destruction, illegal shrimp farming in Kharghar||Taking cognisance of the Hindustan Times report published on January 15, the Revenue officials registered a case under the Environment Protection Act against unidentified persons for the destruction of mangroves and illegal shrimp (prawns) farming ponds in the creek area in Kharghar.The FIR filed by Revenue Circle Officer, Pandurang Kachre at the Kharghar police station, mentions that after HT report, a team of revenue and forest officials conducted an on-the-spot check of the site confirming the destruction of mangroves. A cursory check of Google images indicated that the mangroves might have been destroyed during 2005-09. But the prawns’ culture ponds have been freshly noticed, the FIR said, and registered a case under Section 15 of the Maharashtra Environment Protection Act, 1986. The section stipulates a five-year jail term for the violators, if convicted.HT, in its report titled “CM Thackeray asks forest secretary to look into complaint against mangrove destruction” had drawn attention to the destruction of mangroves in Kharghar. NatConnect Foundation and Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan have, earlier, complained to the Chief Minister against the destruction of mangroves and the illegal prawn culture ponds, and the CMO asked the Forest Department to investigate. Simultaneously, Raigad District Collector, Dr Mahendra Kalyankar, asked the SDO (sub-divisional officer) to look into the issue. Appreciating the prompt action as a good start, NatConnect Foundation director, BN Kumar, said, “The police should take the case to its logical conclusion and trace the culprits. The vehicles used for levelling the ground could provide vital clues. The investigation must also get into the details of the mangrove destruction and the officials concerned.”Nandakumar Pawar, head of Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan, pointed out that the creek and the mangrove fall under CRZ-1 and that no one has any business to fiddle with the free flow of tidal water. The organised, planned prawn and crab culture ponds cutting into mangroves is an act of certain vested interests and not ordinary fishing community people, he said, and called going to the root cause of this menace.Mangroves not only serve as a breeding ground for a variety of fish and crabs, but are also useful as carbon sinks, rainwater forests and host a whole lot of birds, insects and animals. Recently, golden jackals were noticed in Kharghar.Kharghar activist, Naresh Chandra Singh, said the chopping of mangroves definitely is a major threat to the housing colonies. “The destruction at Sectors 17 and 25 is a recent and ongoing occurrence. The National Wetland Inventory Assessment (NWIA) clearly shows that the miscreants have drained out water from these areas and converted them into fish ponds, recently.”Sandipan Shinde, senior police inspector of Kharghar police station, said, “We have registered the case against unnamed persons. We have begun investigations in the matter and will take further action accordingly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/unidentified-persons-booked-for-mangroves-destruction-illegal-shrimp-farming-in-kharghar-101642517451058.html
18-01-2022||Chandigarh||Drugs case: HC extends Majithia’s interim anticipatory bail, asks him to cooperate in investigation||Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday extended interim protection from arrest to Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader and former Punjab minister Bikram Singh Majithia till January 24 in a drugs case and directed him to cooperate with the police in investigation. The court of justice Lisa Gill, while posting his anticipatory bail for final disposal on January 24, also made it clear that protection order would “automatically” stand vacated if arguments are not addressed on the adjourned date. The court was reacting to adjournment request from Majithia. Appearing for Majithia, Arshdeep Singh Cheema had sought deferring of hearing submitting that senior advocate RS Cheema, one of the senior counsels of Majithia, has contracted Covid. Hence, an adjournment be granted. P Chidambaram, appearing for the state government, though did not oppose the adjournment request, submitted that Majithia having joined investigation, has not extended “full cooperation” during questioning. The court said it was not inclined to adjourn the matter but as both the petitioner side and the government counsels have agreed for the same, the hearing in the matter was being adjourned to January 24 for final arguments. “The interim order will continue till the next date of hearing. It is made clear that in case arguments are not addressed on the next date of hearing, interim bail afforded to the petitioner shall automatically stand vacated,” the bench ordered, directing Majithia to continue to join investigation as and when required and extend full cooperation to the probe agency. Acting on the anticipatory bail plea of Majithia, the HC on January 10 had asked him to join the probe on January 12 and also directed the police not to arrest him. After remaining underground for nearly 20 days, Majithia surfaced a day after the high court gave him interim protection. He appeared before the special investigation team (SIT) in Mohali on three occasions after that. A case was registered against Majithia under Sections 25 (punishment for allowing premises), 27 (A) (whoever is financing any activities pertaining to narcotic drugs) and 29 (party to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence) of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act on December 20. On December 24, a Mohali court dismissed his anticipatory bail plea. In the high court, Majithia has roped in Supreme Court lawyer Mukul Rohtagi and senior advocate RS Cheema. Former Union minister P Chidambaram is leading the team of lawyers for Punjab Police. In his plea, Majithia termed the FIR an “election stunt” and alleged that the Charanjit Singh Channi-led Congress government had changed three Punjab Police chiefs in three months to get this FIR registered. The plea also accused Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu of indulging in “unwarranted propaganda” and deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa of demonstrating “intense hatred” towards Majithia. Punjab Police, in its response, had said that the government machinery was used for the benefit of drug cartels during the Akali regime in the state. Majithia was a key minister in the Akali government and it was during the SAD’s term that the cartel was unearthed, the police submitted. The SIT also said incriminating material had come on record against Majithia. While giving interim protection to Majithia, the high court on January 10 had directed that he will not leave the country and provide his mobile number to the SIT. He was also asked to share with the SIT his live location through WhatsApp. The court also directed him to appear before the SIT as and when required. These conditions, he will have to abide by till next date of hearing as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/drugs-case-hc-extends-majithia-s-interim-anticipatory-bail-asks-him-to-cooperate-in-investigation-101642517210662.html

18-01-2022||Chandigarh||CM face: Bhagwant Mann’s home seat Sangrur welcomes AAP decision||People in Sangrur, the home constituency of Bhagwant Mann that is represented by him in the Lok Sabha since 2014, have welcomed the Aam Aadmi Party’s decision to field the humorist-turned-politician as its chief ministerial candidate for the Punjab assembly elections scheduled next month.Mann, 48, who has won two consecutive parliamentary elections from Sangrur and is the lone Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader in the present Lok Sabha, belongs to Satoj village in Sunam tehsil of Sangrur. According to AAP national convener and Delhi chief minister (CM) Arvind Kejriwal, 93% respondents in the party’s survey for its Punjab CM face showed confidence in Mann, who is also the state AAP chief. Also read: Meet the Mann of the moment“We are very happy, as all our phone calls (survey responses) were in favour of Bai’s (brother’s) name. He was already the AAP’s face, and the people of the state will vote in his name,” said Lakhbir Singh, a resident of Satoj village, where the announcement was streamed live on a big screen. “All residents are celebrating the moment. Punjabis will vote for Mann,” said Jasvir Singh, another local.Nirmal Singh, a resident of Nagra village in Sangrur, said the AAP and Bhagwant Mann are synonymous in Punjab. “It is like giving ‘Ik mauka Bhagwant Mann nu’ instead of ‘Ik mauka Kejriwal nu’,” he said, referring to the AAP campaign seeking “one chance to Kejriwal” in the Punjab elections.‘In AAP, no campaigner like Bhagwant Mann’Historian Sumail Singh Sidhu, who was the AAP election campaign committee convener in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, said the party has no campaigner like Mann and it wanted to cash in on his popularity.“The AAP can’t afford to antagonise Mann in polls. Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and Bhagwant Mann have their own followers. However, the Punjab unit is bigger and more influential as compared to the Delhi unit. The party tried to find a face to counter Mann, but he was selected after rejecting all other faces. Mann is still following the party’s national policy, and will have to face challenges in future when time comes to choose between it and Punjab’s stance,” said Sidhu.Aman Arora, state legislator from Sunam and senior AAP leader, said Punjab’s people will back Mann and the party. “Though some names were discussed, it was a very good decision at the appropriate time. Mann aggressively raised Punjab’s issues in the Parliament, because of which the party high command, workers and people showed confidence in him,” said Arora.

Of the 202.65 hectares, no land has been acquired in the Mumbai suburban area yet. NHSRCL, an undertaking Ministry of Railways, is responsible for the construction of high-speed train corridor projects in India, also called bullet trains. NHSRCL said that 105.84 hectares of land has been acquired in Palghar of the 288.86 required, 96.81 hectares of land in Thane of the 140.32 required and no land of the 4.82 hectares of land required in Mumbai’s Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC).

18-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Kairon inducts 2020 hooch tragedy key accused into SAD, courts controversy||TARN TARAN: Senior Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader and former minister Adesh Partap Singh Kairon courted a controversy after he inducted one of the prime accused of the hooch tragedy, which claimed the lives of more than 100 people in Punjab in 2020, into the party fold during his election campaign. Gurpal Singh, alias Pala, of Dhotian village, who is out on bail, was arrested by the Tarn Taran police for running a network of illicit liquor across Punjab. Gurpal’s brother Rashpal Singh, alias Shalu, is still absconding. Around 140 people died while more than a dozen people lost their eyesight after consuming spurious liquor in August and September 2020. More than 80 victims were from Tarn Taran district while the others were from Amritsar and Gurdaspur districts.Kairon along with his supporters visited Gurpal’s residence on Sunday and honoured him for joining the party. Kairon, who is son-in-law of SAD patriarch Parkash Singh Badal, also addressed a function, which was organised by Gurpal and other SAD leaders, at Dhotian village on Tuesday. “Kairon inducted me and my family into the party on Sunday, but today’s function was organised by former sarpanch Jashandeep Singh and former chairman Paramjit Singh,” said Gurpal, while talking to HT over phone.Tarn Taran police had claimed that Gurpal and his brother Rashpal were the kingpins of the illicit liquor smuggling racket. The police had also frozen the property of Gurpal and Rashpal worth ₹2 crore under the NDPS Act. Dhotian village sarpanch Ranjit Singh said: “Inducting a person who is accused in the hooch tragedy into a political party ahead of the state elections is shameful. Such accused should not be given political patronage.”He said: “Police had attached the property of both the accused in the village soon after the incident. But they and their family members are still using the properties, including big houses, due to a support by some politicians.”Police post Naushehra Pannuan’s in-charge assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Davinder Singh said: “They might be using the property which was not attached by the police. We are keeping regular watch on their activities.”Repeated efforts to contact Kairon proved futile. Kairon’s political advisor Gurmukh Singh Ghulla said he was unaware about the development. “I will check about Gurpal’s background,” he added. The SAD had demanded strict action and a thorough probe against Congress leaders soon after the tragedy.An Aakli leader, who didn’t wish to be named, said during the 2017 state elections, Gurpal and his brother Rashpal were inducted into the Congress by Patti MLA Harminder Singh Gill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-kairon-inducts-2020-hooch-tragedy-key-accused-into-sad-courts-controversy-101642513069785.html

18-01-2022||Mumbai||Param Bir Singh skips ACB summons due to Covid||Mumbai Former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh on Tuesday skipped the summons issued to him by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) in connection with the complaint filed by police inspector Anup Dange.Singh’s advocate RB Mokashi said, “He has sought three weeks’ time from the agency due to the pandemic.”A senior IPS officer attached to the ACB confirmed the development and said, “Singh was summoned to appear before the agency on January 10, but he had cited pendency of his case before the Supreme Court and sought time. We accordingly postponed the date and fresh summons were sent to Singh, asking him to attend our office on January 18.”Agency has been conducting an inquiry against Singh after Dange submitted a complaint to the chief minister and the home department on February 2, 2021, alleging that Singh had sought money for not initiating departmental action against him.According to Dange’s complaint, in November 2019 while he was posted at the Gamdevi police station, he and a team had visited a pub on Bhulabhai Desai Road during night patrol. The officer asked the pub staff to close down the establishment, as, under the prevailing rules, it was not permitted to operate beyond the deadline of 1:30 pm.Policemen on patrolling duty also asked customers to leave, but one customer entered into a heated argument with the policemen and attacked them. A case was registered against seven people. Dange claimed that Singh -- who was the director-general, ACB at the time, prevented him from taking action against the bar owner, which Dange did not heed. Soon after Singh took charge as the Mumbai PC in February 2020, a departmental enquiry was initiated against Dange.Dange’s complaint further stated that in 2020, Singh asked Dange to pay ₹50 lakh to avoid action taken against him. “We have recorded Dange’s statement twice and the inquiry is going on as per the legal procedure. Param Bir Singh has been summoned to record his statement. We are following the legal process,” said an ACB officer.In December 2021, Dange had written a letter to home minister Dilip Wale Patil demanding that the case be transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), complaining that ACB had not taken any in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/param-bir-singh-skips-acb-summons-due-to-covid-101642510429536.html
18-01-2022||Mumbai||Court rejects Anil Deshmukh’s default bail plea||vinay.dalvi@htlive.comMumbai A special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Tuesday rejected the bail plea of former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh.Additional sessions judge R N Rokade rejected the bail plea of the 71-year-old Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader arrested in a money laundering case on November 2.Deshmukh had moved for default bail through advocate Vikram Chaudhri and Aniket Nikam, contending that, excluding the date of first remand, a period of 60 days had elapsed, but the special court had not taken cognisance of the ED’s supplementary chargesheet against him and therefore, he was entitled to default bail. His counsels had argued that mere filing of the prosecution complaint cannot be construed as the conclusion of an investigation, as notwithstanding the same the court has ample powers in terms of Section 156(3) CrPC directing a further investigation, instead of taking cognizance.That, till now i.e. till the presentation of this application, no satisfaction was recorded by this court regarding completion of the investigation on perusal of any prosecution complaint presented before it. Unlike sub-section (1) which requires the satisfaction of the Investigating officer, in sub-section (2) of Section 167 CrPC, satisfaction is required to be recorded by the court. That, till now, no cognizance is taken by the court, which is prerequisite for the purpose of granting remand under Section 309(2) CrPC, they had argued.They claimed that a combined reading of Section 156(3), 167(2), 190 and 309(2) of CrPC clearly showed that at the pre-cognizance stage, there was a statutory embargo in granting remand beyond 60 days under Section 167(2), if the accused was willing to furnish bail bonds on expiry of 60 days of his arrest. Thus, if by that time i.e. 60 days, cognizance is not taken, his remand can not be continued, they asserted. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had opposed the bail plea. Arguing for the agency, additional solicitor general, Anil Singh and advocate Shreeram Shirsath had submitted that default bail cannot be considered once the chargesheet or the supplementary chargesheet is filed within a period of 60 days from the date of the arrest.“It is submitted that the concept of statutory bail/default bail cannot be considered once the chargesheet and supplementary chargesheet have been filed. The supplementary prosecution complaint against Deshmukh and 11 others has been filed on December 29, 2021, within a period of 60 days from the date of his arrest. The registry has even given a central filing number to the said complaint,” the agency said in its reply opposing the bail plea.The Court while rejecting the bail plea said the ED had filed a chargesheet in time and section 167 of CrPC does not speak of taking cognisance of the chargesheet.The agency claimed that its investigation began after former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh had alleged that Deshmukh had directed assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze to collect ₹100 crore every month from bars in Mumbai. Singh approached the Bombay high court (HC) and filed a petition in the matter. Based on HC’s order, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) initially conducted a preliminary enquiry and on April 21 registered an offence under provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, after which ED started its investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/court-rejects-anil-deshmukh-s-default-bail-plea-101642508326356.html
18-01-2022||Mumbai||Ex-minister Anil Deshmukh asked Mumbai court for default bail. Judge says no||MUMBAI: A Mumbai court on Tuesday turned down former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh’s request for default bail, ruling that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has filed a charge sheet against him.The 71-year-old Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader, arrested on November 2 in a money laundering case, had moved a bail application before Additional Sessions Judge R N Rokade, the designated judge to try offences under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).Lawyers Vikram Chaudhri and Aniket Nikam, appearing for Deshmukh, argued that the former minister was entitled to default bail since the court hadn’t taken cognisance of two charge sheets filed against him by ED. Deshmukh’s lawyers argued that mere filing of the prosecution complaint /charge-sheet cannot be construed as a conclusion of the investigation since the court has ample powers to direct further investigation.Till now, no satisfaction was recorded by this court regarding the completion of the investigation on perusal of any prosecution complaint presented before it, they said, arguing that the court taking cognisance of the charge sheet is a prerequisite for granting Anil Deshmukh’s further remand.They claimed a combined reading of the provisions showed that at the pre-cognizance stage, there was a statutory embargo in granting remand beyond 60 days if the accused was willing to furnish bail bonds on expiry of 60 days of his arrest. “Thus, if by that time i.e. 60 days, cognizance is not taken, his remand can not be continued”, Deshmukh’s legal team said.ED contested this interpretation of the law. Arguing for the agency, additional solicitor general, Anil Singh and lawyer Shreeram Shirsath submitted that default bail cannot be considered once the charge sheet or the supplementary charge sheet has been filed within 60 days of the arrest.“It is submitted that the concept of statutory bail/default bail cannot be considered once the charge sheet and supplementary charge sheet has been filed.

According to the agency, Vaze handed over the money to Kundan Shinde, personal secretary of Deshmukh who has been also arrested and subsequently, a part of the amount was routed to the charitable trust run by Deshmukh in Nagpur through various shell companies in the form of donations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/exminister-anil-deshmukh-asked-mumbai-court-for-default-bail-judge-says-no-101642508085598.html
18-01-2022||Bangalore||K'taka warns medical practitioners against spreading misinformation on Covid-19||The Karnataka government on Tuesday issued a warning to medical practitioners spreading misinformation on the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.In a statement, the government said such misinformation shared on media and social media platforms lead to confusion among the public on the prevailing crisis and encourage them to deviate from the well laid-out guidelines issued by the health and revenue authorities.“It has come to the notice of the government that few medical practitioners, while communicating to the public on various media platforms, are giving incomplete, inaccurate and unsubstantiated information about Covid-19,” the statement read.“Any misinformation/non-factual data on Covid-19 shared on any media/social platform would be deemed as an offence and necessary action would be initiated as per Section 54 of Disaster Management Act, 2005 and Section 4(k) of Karnataka Epidemic Diseases Act, 2020,” the statement added.It urged medical practitioners to exercise caution while communicating with the public on the Covid-19 crisis and asked them to refer to the official guidelines and orders thoroughly before sharing any information on media and social media platforms.The latest guideline comes after some doctors, who appeared on news channels, allegedly made statements about the pandemic that contradicted facts and could create panic among people, health officials told news agency PTI.The daily Covid-19 tally in Karnataka saw a reduction on Monday with 27,156 infections, pushing the caseload to 32,47,243.

18-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab elections: Meet the Mann of the moment||The announcement of two-time Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann’s name by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal as the party’s chief ministerial face in Punjab did not come as a surprise to anyone. Also read: Bhagwant Mann is AAP da CM for PunjabMann, who is also the AAP’s state president, is easily its most popular leader. His selection as the CM face by people in the phone line survey of this kind – 93.3% of the 21-lakh plus respondents favoured him – undertaken by the party was on the expected lines. The 48-year-old political leader, who has come a long way with Tuesday’s announcement despite several controversies, is a proven crowdpuller for his party for which he has been leading the campaign from its first electoral outing in the state. His folksy style topped by biting sarcasm and side-splitting jokes, particularly ‘kikli’ (satirical speech) in which he targets politicians and issues, have been a huge hit in the rural areas of Punjab, particularly the Malwa region having 69 of the 117 seats and on which the AAP counts the most. Mann’s tryst with politics A college dropout, the humorist-turned-politician first flirted with politics in 2011 by joining the People’s Party of Punjab (PPP) which was set up by Manpreet Singh Badal (now in the Congress) after parting ways with the Shiromani Akali Dal. He took on former chief minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal in Lehra assembly constituency in the 2012 elections, but trailed in the third position. When Badal decided to forge an alliance with the Congress, Mann did not follow him, opting for the AAP instead, and he has not looked back since. In 2014, Mann won the Sangrur seat by more than 2.11 lakh votes, the highest margin in the state. When the newbie outfit contested its first assembly election in 2017, he crisscrossed the state to campaign for the party candidates, besides taking on SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal in the latter’s stronghold of Jalalabad. While he lost to Sukhbir and came second ahead of Congress’ Ravneet Singh Bittu (now MP from Ludhiana), his party won 20 seats to become the principal opposition party. In 2019, when all other party candidates in the state forfeited their security deposits, he again scored a spectacular win in his Sangrur parliamentary constituency by over 1 lakh votes, and is today the only AAP MP in the Lok Sabha. Brush with controversies The AAP CM-face’s journey has not been without controversies, particularly his alleged drinking problem, as embarrassing videos kept surfacing from time to time showing him in an inebriated state. In January 2019, he took a public pledge, with his mother Harpal Kaur by his side, to quit drinking alcohol to avoid any embarrassment to the party. “I have taken a solemn vow to say ‘no’ to booze for good in my mother’s presence,” he told the gathering at a public meeting also attended by Kejriwal. The rivals have often portrayed him as unfit for this reason, and are already targeting him. The Congress social media team and party volunteers have been running a campaign, #Pegwant, on social media against him, despite his assertions that he has given up alcohol and turned sober. Mann was once also accused of compromising parliamentary security by live-streaming the security arrangements at the Parliament House on social media and several parties had demanded action against him. 
18-01-2022||Mumbai||HC commutes death sentence of sister-duo convicted of murdering five children in the 1990s||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday commuted the death sentence of sisters Renuka Shinde and Seema Gavit to life imprisonment after the state delayed in having their mercy petition reviewed for seven years and 10 months. The sisters were convicted for kidnapping 13 children between 1990 and 1996 in and around Kolhapur district to use them as a cover to snatch chains and purses. They were also tried for murdering nine children, but were eventually convicted for murdering five. Their mother, Anjanbai, who was also taken into custody, died in 1997 before the trial began. The sisters were sentenced to death by a Kolhapur trial court in 2001, and the ruling was upheld by the HC in 2004. Subsequently, their appeal was rejected by the Supreme Court in 2006 and their mercy petition was rejected by the president in 2014. Advocate Aniket Vagal, who represented the duo in the HC, informed the division bench of justices Nitin Jamdar and Sarang Kotwal — which heard the sisters’ 2014 petition — that the two sisters had approached the HC against the inordinate delay on the part of the state to get the mercy petition decided by the president after the apex court had rejected their appeal. The sisters claimed that the delay of nearly eight years between the SC’s ruling on their death sentence and the state filing their mercy petition before the president was unfair, cruel, excessive, unexplained and arbitrary and the delay had caused immense mental torture and emotional and physical agony to the petitioners. As per procedure, once the SC confirms a death sentence, the convict may file a mercy petition before the president, seeking pardon. It is the state government’s responsibility to get a mercy petition heard and decided by the president. The HC in its order on Tuesday observed, “Having considered the facts and circumstances in which the delay of seven years, 10 months and 15 days in the disposal of the mercy petitions has occurred, we find that it is entirely attributable to the officers of the respondent — governments, more particularly that of the state government.” After their mercy petition was rejected, the sisters moved the Bombay HC on the day set for their execution, seeking commutation of their death sentence to life imprisonment on the grounds that the delay by the state government was dehumanising. Vagal also argued before the bench — the same one before which their 2014 petition came up — that the delay was flagrant violation of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution and hence the death sentence should be commuted to life imprisonment. Their mother had died awaiting hearing of the current petition and the sisters, who had already spent 25 years behind bars, should be released. The bench concluded hearing of this petition on December 22 and reserved its order, which was pronounced on Tuesday. While pronouncing the order, justice Jamdar rapped the state administration for the delay in getting the mercy petition heard and decided after the apex court had rejected the appeal against the death sentence. “The state machinery showed laxity and indifference and has failed in its duty as a representative of the criminal justice system and also failed the innocent victims of serious crimes.” The bench said that while it acceded to the prayer for commutation of sentence, it could not accept the request of releasing them forthwith as the crimes committed by petitioners were heinous and beyond words to condemn. “The Supreme Court dismissed their appeal. They were a menace to society. We have no doubt that the competent authority will consider the gravity of offence and the observations are considered,” said the bench and set aside the death sentence and commuted it to life imprisonment till the end of the natural life of the convicts. “It’s end of the mental agony of the petitioners who have been living under the fear of death since 2006. The petitioners can at least now lead their life, though in prison, without the thought that they can be executed anytime. Petitioners will definitely lead peaceful lives and will rehabilitate themselves,” Vagal said. The life sentence is till the end of their natural lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/death-sentence-for-sisters-convicted-of-murdering-9-children-in-1990s-commuted-101642498185297.html

18-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab drugs case: HC extends interim protection from arrest to Majithia till Jan 24||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday extended interim protection from arrest to Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader and former Punjab minister Bikram Singh Majithia till January 24 in the drugs case registered against him by Punjab Police in Mohali on December 20. Also read: Punjab election: AAP announces Bhagwant Mann as its chief ministerial candidateThe order was passed during resumed hearing of his anticipatory bail plea by the bench of justice Lisa Gill, one of his counsel, Arshdeep Singh Cheema, said. On January 10, the high court had asked Majithia to join the probe on January 12 and also directed the police not to arrest him. After remaining underground for nearly 20 days, Majithia surfaced a day after the high court gave him interim protection. He appeared before the special investigation team (SIT) in Mohali. Majithia was booked under Sections 25 (punishment for allowing premises), 27 (A) (whoever is financing any activities pertaining to narcotic drugs) and 29 (party to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence) of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act on December 20. On December 24, a Mohali court dismissed his anticipatory bail plea. In the high court, Majithia roped in Supreme Court lawyer Mukul Rohtagi and senior advocate RS Cheema. Former Union minister P Chidambaram is leading the team of lawyers for Punjab Police. In his plea, Majithia termed the FIR an “election stunt” and alleged that the Charanjit Singh Channi-led Congress government had changed three Punjab Police chiefs in three months to get this FIR registered. The plea also accused Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu of indulging in “unwarranted propaganda” and deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa of demonstrating “intense hatred” towards Majithia. Punjab Police, in its response, had said that the government machinery was used for the benefit of drug cartels during the Akali regime in the state. Majithia was a key minister in the Akali government and it was during the Shiromani Akali Dal’s term that the cartel was unearthed, the police submitted, seeking his custody. The SIT also said incriminating material had come on record against Majithia. While giving interim protection to Majithia, the high court on January 10 directed that he will not leave the country and provide his mobile number to the SIT. He was also been asked to share with the SIT his live location through WhatsApp. The court directed him to appear before the SIT as and when required.

The Janata Dal (United), the Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) and the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) that are alliance partner of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar have decided to go solo in 2022 UP assembly polls after the talks of pre-poll alliance with the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) failed. Janata Dal (U) national general secretary and UP in-charge KC Tyagi will release the first list of party candidates in a programme organised in the party state unit office in Lucknow on Tuesday (January 18). Senior JD (U) leader and Union steel minister RCP Singh has held several rounds of talks with Union home minister Amit Shah, BJP national president JP Nadda and BJP UP in-charge and Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan over the pre-poll alliance in UP but there was no response from the BJP leadership.With four days left in the filing of nomination papers for the first phase of assembly election to be held on February 10, the JD (U) had decided to contest the assembly election on its own, said a JD (U) leader. The Lok Janshakti Party-Ram Vilas (LJPRV), led by MP from Jamui Lok Sabha seat in Bihar Chirag Paswan, has decided to field candidates on 100 assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh. LJPRV state unit president Mani Shankar Pandey said the party had sent the list of 60 candidates to the central unit. The central leadership was likely to finalise the candidates on Tuesday, he added. “The LJPRV has launched a digital campaign in various assembly constituencies to mobilise the party cadre,” he added. Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) leader and minister in Bihar government Santosh Suman Manjhi had met UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath and other BJP leaders in Lucknow in August last. The party has decided to contest assembly election in UP in alliance with the BJP. HAM (S) enjoys influence over Manjhi, Machua and Kewat communities settled in eastern UP.

ED officials said that Kudrat Deep Singh, one of the main accused, had formed new companies with two directors, Sandeep Singh and Bhupinder Singh. The ED has been probing money-laundering charges against six contractors as it suspects the proceeds from the illegal sand mining has been further transferred. Besides Kudrat Deep Singh, the ED probe has found the involvement of the other contractors. The ED team, comprising six officials and four policemen, raided the posh Homeland Heights apartment of Channi’s nephew in Mohali early on Tuesday. According to the FIR, there are 26 accused of whom most are truck drivers. The case was registered on the complaint of the Punjab mining department that found sand quarries being run without approval during its raids in 2018. The mining department impounded 30 vehicles and other machinery being used for the illegal mining. In 2018, the case was registered under Sections 21(1) and 4(1) of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957,and Sections 420 (punishment for cheating), 471 (whoever fraudulently or dishonestly uses as genuine), and 465 (punishment for forgery) at Rahon. Pressure tactics in run-up to elections: ChanniReacting to the ED raid at his nephew Bhupinder Singh’s house, Channi said: “The same thing happened during the West Bengal elections. It is to put pressure on me in view of the upcoming assembly polls.”“They are targeting me. This is not good for democracy. We are ready to fight this. The same thing happened during the WB elections,” Channi said, adding that “the entire issue is to settle scores with us for what happened a few days ago in Punjab”. He was referring to the faceoff between Punjab and the Centre over the breach of security during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s January 5 visit to Ferozepur.Raids a poll gimmick, says Congress leader Alka LambaSoon after the raids, Congress leader Alka Lamba, who is the party’s media coordinator for the Punjab elections, tweeted, “CBI, ED & IT raids have become a tool of the BJP govt during the elections.”Terming the raids a poll gimmick, she claimed that the BJP and the B-teams of the BJP were stunned with increasing popularity of Punjab chief minister Channi due to his works. “The people of Punjab will themselves respond to this in the coming days,” Lamba added.

18-01-2022||Dehradun||Why Uttarakhand BJP’s pre-emptive strike hurts Harak Singh Rawat, helps Congress||DEHRADUN: The pre-emptive action by the BJP against Harak Singh Rawat by expelling him from the party for six years amid speculation that he is headed to join the Congress has compromised Rawat’s bargaining power, analysts said.Rawat, who hadn’t foreseen that the BJP will take such an action, told reporters on Monday that he feels insulted as he was not told anything about the decision and that the party took action based on social media reports.With his sacking from the cabinet and expulsion from the party, he is now left with no other option but to join the Congress that he had quit ahead of the 2017 state assembly polls. Rawat told local media on Monday that he will join the Congress or serve the people of the state.Also Read: ‘Joining Congress wasn’t my plan... BJP overreacted,’ says Harak Singh RawatAccording to political experts, the pre-emptive action has benefited the Congress as the party can now take him into the party fold on its own terms. Political analyst MM Semwal said if Harak Singh joins Congress, it won’t send a good signal in the party as most of workers and leaders have struggled for last five years, while he was enjoying power. “Now, with the BJP taking pre-emptive action, the Congress has an upper hand as it can decide whether to take him in or not and if they taken him in, what role he would be given.”Most senior Congress leaders, including state president Ganesh Godiyal and leader of opposition Pritam Singh maintained that party high command will take the decision on Rawat’s joining and the role that he will be assigned. With Rawat almost set to join the Congress, many people both within the party and outside have started questioning if the party take back a leader who played a key role in the rebellion of nine Congress MLAs in 2016 and switched to the BJP. Many Congress leaders were seen now trying to defend this in media by saying that he has apologised for it and his joining the party will make the party stronger. Godiyal said Rawat acknowledged that what he did in 2016 was wrong and as such these issues should not be brought up now.When Congress leader Harish Rawat was asked by reporters in Delhi about his past equation with Rawat and if his joining the party will send a wrong signal , the veteran leader, who has not been in good terms with Harak Singh given his role in 2016 rebellion, said, “Harish Rawat is not important; democracy and democratic traditions are important, and state is important…. This question is imaginative as right now, I don’t even know whether he wants to join or not join (Congress)…” When asked about statements that his support will strengthen the Congress, Harish Rawat said, “There are many people for strengthening the party…whether to take him in the party fold will be decided by the party high command.”Meanwhile, Governor Lt Gen Gurmit Singh (retd) removed Harak Singh from the state cabinet and allotted his departments to chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami. Dhami on Sunday had written to governor that Harak Singh be immediately removed from the cabinet. The 1960 born Thakur leader from Garhwal was first elected as an MLA in 1991 from Pauri and became the youngest minister of Uttar Pradesh. In 2002 he was elected as MLA from Lansdowne assembly segment. In 2007, he was re-elected form Lansdowne. In year 2007 he was elected as leader of opposition in Uttarakhand legislative assembly. In 2012, he was elected from Rudraprayag assembly segment and in 2017 form Kotdwar assembly segment.
18-01-2022||Kolkata||Shantanu Thakur reaches out to disgruntled Bengal BJP leaders, calls it a picnic||KOLKATA: Two days after accusing the Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of ignoring the Dalit Matua community, union minister of state and Matua leader Shantanu Thakur on Monday organised a get-together with his followers and a section of disgruntled BJP leaders who were left out of the new state committees that were eventually dissolved on January 13 following protests.“The picnic is part of the preparations for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. We discussed our strategy. None of those who attended it are dissidents. We all owe our allegiance to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. We have assembled here because the new state-level committees were formed with an ulterior motive. We foresee a danger for the Bengal BJP,” Thakur said on Monday.The meeting was held at the residence of a BJP local unit president at Bongaon in North 24 Parganas district.On Sunday, Thakur held a meeting with leaders of the All India Matua Mahasangha at Thakurnagar, the community’s headquarters in North 24 Parganas district. Thakur is the president of the Mahasangha.The Matua community’s support to the BJP was believed to have helped the BJP bag several Lok Saba and assembly seats 2019 and 2021, respectively.“Implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) has been the principal demand of the Matuas. We will discuss it with our central leaders and union home minister Amit Shah,” said legislator Subrata Thakur, also the brother of union minister Shananu Thakur.Shantanu Thakur and four legislators left all WhatsApp groups of the West Bengal BJP on January 4, saying the Matua community was not properly represented in the new organisational committees formed during a state-wide reshuffle on December 22.On Saturday, Thakur demanded the removal of Bengal BJP general secretary (organisation) Amitava Chakraborty without naming the latter.On Monday, huge posters, demanding Chakraborty’s removal appeared near the Bengal BJP headquarters at Muralidhar Sen Lane in central Kolkata. In one poster, he was accused of being the agent of Mamata Banerjee’s election strategist Prashant Kishor.Chakraborty did not make any comment. “The post of general secretary (organisation) is above this bickering in the BJP. The person holding that post does only internal work. He does not form organisational committees or make public speeches. Dragging Chakraborty into this is unfair and condemnable,” Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said.“There are no differences between the Matuas and the BJP. The new citizenship law will surely be enforced in Bengal before the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. This is being handled by the Central government. The party cannot comment on administrative issues,” Bhattacharya added. The recent rejig made not just the Matua leaders unhappy but left many others grumbling as well. Signs of dissent emerged from several quarters as many BJP old-timers were replaced. The party announced the names of 11 new vice-presidents, five general secretaries, 42 organisational district unit presidents and 12 state secretaries alongside seven new morcha (front) presidents.Apart from the Matua leaders, Ritesh Tiwari and Jay Prakash Majumdar, who were state vice-presidents before being dropped, and Sayantan Basu, who was a state general secretary, attended Monday’s picnic.“See this as a social gathering,” Majumdar quipped. The Centre has said that it is in the process of framing laws for the CAA which the Parliament passed in 2020.The law offers citizenship to non-Muslims who entered India from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh before 2015. The TMC insists that the law is unconstitutional as it links citizenship to faith in a secular country. The Matuas are a part of the large Dalit Namasudra community that migrated from Bangladesh during India’s partition in 1947 and the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War to escape religious persecution.Thakur, 39, the Lok Sabha member from Bongaon, was made minister of state for ports, shipping and waterways during the Union cabinet reshuffle last year.This was seen as a move by the BJP central leadership to keep the Matuas happy as Thakur has been demanding the implementation of the new citizenship law. He even accompanied Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the latter’ visit to Bangladesh on the eve of the March-April assembly polls last year.Modi offered prayers at the Matua temple at Orakandi near Dhaka and praised Thakur in his speech, triggering a sharp reaction from chief minister Mamata Banerjee.In February last year, Shah announced during his visit to Thakurnagar that the Centre will enforce the citizenship law once vaccination across the country is over and the Covid-19 pandemic ends.Even as the BJP found itself in an embarrassing situation, Sukanta Majumdar said: “Winter is a right time to organise picnics. Anybody can attend it. I do not want to comment. As far Sunday’s meeting is concerned, it was held by Matua leaders. The BJP stands by the community.”The TMC observed that the rumblings were bad news to the BJP. “The signs are clear. The Bengal BJP is breaking up,” said TMC Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/shantanu-thakur-reaches-out-to-disgruntled-bengal-bjp-leaders-calls-it-a-picnic-101642452822449.html
18-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: More desertions, rebellion by sulking leaders prickle Cong||The ruling Congress’ troubles mounted in Punjab on Monday with more leaders, including a six-time former minister and a senior cabinet minister’s son, miffed over being ignored in the first list of candidates for the February 20 assembly elections, quitting the party or throwing their hat in the ring. Cabinet minister Rana Gurjeet Singh’s son Rana Inder Partap Singh announced to contest as an Independent candidate from Sultanpur Lodhi after the party decided to again field sitting MLA Navtej Singh Cheema from the constituency. “I am going to fight this election for the people of Sultanpur Lodhi who suffered immensely during the past five years,” he told Hindustan Times, giving a tongue-lashing to Cheema for alleged corruption and neglect of the segment. The first list of 86 candidates out of 117 that came out on Saturday has led to an outpouring of anger from those who were denied tickets with some of them rushing to join other parties. On Sunday, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s brother also rebelled and decided to fight as an Independent after being denied ticket from Bassi Pathana, landing the party leadership in a thorn bush of embarrassment. Claiming that he was fighting to save the Congress, Rana Inder said he had the blessing of his father. Rana Inder, who had applied for the ticket and made his intentions known to the leadership well in advance, has been crisscrossing the assembly segment continuously for the last two months. Both Rana Gurjeet and Cheema have been at loggerheads and targeting each other. Former jails minister and six-time former MLA Sarwan Singh Phillaur and his son Damanvir Phillaur were also upset and quit the Congress to join the Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa-led Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt). Damanvir was seeking the Congress ticket from the Phillaur reserved assembly constituency and had been active in the area, but he was ignored as the party opted for Vikramjit Singh Chaudhary, who was the runner-up in the 2017 elections, losing to Baldev Singh Khaira of the Shiromani Akali Dal. SAD (Sanyukt) president and Rajya Sabha member Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa inducted them into the party. The SAD (Sanyukt) is fighting the elections in alliance with the BJP and Capt Amarinder Singh-led Punjab Lok Congress. Another setback for the party was the exit of two-time former MLA Luv Kumar Goldy, who, along with several of his supporters, jumped ship to the PLC after the party overlooked his candidature from Garhshankar. On Sunday, Nimisha Mehta had also joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after the party opted for former Punjab Youth Congress president Amarpreet Singh Lally from Garhshankar. Mehta was being backed by chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi but faced opposition from campaign committee chairman Sunil Jakhar. Rajya Sabha member Ambika Soni was also backing Lally, according to party sources. Earlier, sitting Moga MLA Harjot Kamal Singh also crossed over to the BJP after the name of actor Sonu Sood’s sister Malvika Sood Sachar was announced from the seat. Also, senior leader and former MP Mohinder Singh Kaypee, who is related to the chief minister, was also discontented over the denial of ticket from the Adampur assembly seat. Sukhwinder Singh Kotli, who joined the Congress from the BSP last month, has been fielded from the segment. Only one person gets the ticket, heartburn is natural: Channi Chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi said the candidate selection was a democratic process. “Everyone has the right to seek the party ticket but only one person gets it, and heartburn is natural,” he said at a press conference. Asked about his younger brother’s decision to fight as an Independent, the CM said theirs was a joint family and he was aware of the circumstances. “My brother was a doctor and posted in Bassi Pathana from where the MLA (Gurpreet Singh) GP got him transferred. He requested the MLA, even telling him that he is the minister’s brother, but that did not help,” he said. Channi said his brother quit his job and decided to contest the election, asking for the party ticket. “The party did not give it. GP is also our brother. We will sit together and work out something,” he said. In response to another query, he justified Kaypee’s resentment, stating the party leadership was considering the matter. “He is a stalwart and has been the Congress chief. The party is looking into it,” he said.
18-01-2022||Chandigarh||Clear stand on SYL Canal issue, Sidhu tells Kejriwal||Launching a fresh attack on Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal, Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu on Monday asked him to clear his stand on the Sutlej Yamuna Link (SYL) Canal issue, while dubbing him “migratory bird who comes to Punjab during the poll season”. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, through an affidavit in the Supreme Court, had initially supported Haryana’s stand on SYL Canal issue, but he took a U-turn in December 2016 ahead of the Punjab polls, saying that Punjab had no water to spare. Addressing a press conference at his residence here, Sidhu said, “I am not against Kejriwal personally. But I am against his activities in Punjab. He is like a chameleon that changes colour according to the place and situation. I will also call him a “political tourist”. “Why am I calling him so, there are a number of reasons. He apologised to Majithia after making a statement on his alleged link with the drug peddlers. He accumulated money through donations from NRIs, but never made the accounts public. Now, he is facing accusations of selling tickets. Does he have a roadmap for Punjab as I have?” he said, adding that under the Congress’s ‘Punjab model’, there was a plan to introduce single-window e-governance for hassle-free services. Sidhu further said he doesn’t speak against Bhagwant Mann because he is not a thief. “Kejriwal facilitates the businesses of Badals and liquor barons. He must tell people what is his stand on the SYL canal issue. Is there a Punjabi in his Delhi cabinet? He is planning to run Punjab with remote control from outside,” Sidhu said. “This time, the Congress will contest the polls on an agenda. I have given a 13-point programme. We will see what points are figure in the party manifesto,” he said, while welcoming BSP former district president Tarsem Singh Bhola and his supporters into the party fold. On Congress’s CM face, Sidhu said, “Last time, Rahul ji announced the CM face at an election rally in Majitha. So, it is up to the party high command to make such an announcement. We will abide by what the high command decides.” He said ideology was the core strength of the Congress. “Nobody can defeat the Congress if the leaders are united. It is the Congress that defeats itself,” he said, adding that he will try to pacify leaders who have revolted over denial of ticket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/clear-stand-on-syl-canal-issue-sidhu-tells-kejriwal-101642451623088.html

Sachar had gone to the BJP after expressing his disappointment at the Congress denying him a ticket from the Majitha assembly segment. On his homecoming in less than 24 hours, Sachar said, “I was in deep shock at the ticket denial. My supporters also exhorted me to contest the elections at any cost. Hence, I went to the office of the BJP and joined it,” adding, “I was not in a normal state of mind when I joined the BJP.”On Monday, Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, along with Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa and Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria, approached him at his residence. After meeting them, Sachar said, “I committed a mistake in not contacting these three ministers who are my big brothers. I made that decision in haste. Sarkaria ji visited my house and asked me why I took the step (of joining the BJP). All three ministers have given me their word that the issue of my ticket will be taken up with the high command, and reconsidered.” Sachar had been working tirelessly and was considered the front-runner for the Congress ticket from Majitha, the bastion of senior Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader and former minister Bikram Singh Majithia.His claim to the ticket got a fillip after Sukhjinder Raj Singh, aka Lali Majithia, joined the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). The Congress, however, allotted the ticket to Lali’s brother Jagwinder Pal Singh, aka Jagga Majithia. Deputy CM Randhawa said, “Sachar is an old leader of Congress. He has corrected a decision taken in haste. The party will respect his feelings and consider the hard work he has done for the party in the constituency.”

Cheema has the backing of Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, it is learnt. Rana Gurjeet, who represents Kapurthala constituency, and Cheema don’t see eye to eye with each other. After Rana Gurjeet’s ouster from the previous Capt Amarinder cabinet over the ‘sand mining scam’, Cheema was among the six MLAs who had written to Navjot Sidhu, opposing the former minister’s comeback after the change of guard in the state. Rana Inder Partap said during his interaction with the constituents over the last two months, he received complaints about how Cheema allegedly implicated people in false police cases. He also accused Cheema of misappropriating funds meant for 550th birth anniversary celebrations of Guru Nanak. Cheema on the other hand trashed the allegations, saying ‘it is a fit case where the pot is calling the kettle black’. “I would request the party to take disciplinary action against Rana Gurjeet for the anti-party activities.

The party didn’t name candidates for the said seats in its first list, implying that the sitting legislators were not the obvious choice. Two-time MLA from Khadoor Sahib Ramanjit Singh Sikki has been facing a stiff challenge from party’s member of Parliament (MP) Jasbir Singh Dimpa, while Khemkaran MLA Sukhpal Singh Bhullar is facing heat from his elder brother and senior Congress leader Anoop Singh Bhullar. Dimpa has already been campaigning in Khadoor Sahib for a couple of months with an eye on the ticket either for himself or his son Updesh Gill. Sikki has been camping in Chandigarh for about a week and meeting people to set the tide in his favour. Dimpa, however, claims that he has only been canvassing for the party. “I will support anybody the party high-command will choose,” he said in reply to a question what if Sikki is the party candidate. Dimpa and Sikki have not been sharing the stage at party events in the constituency in the recent weeks. Both are holding separate functions to mobilise support. Though Sikki won the last two assembly elections from the segment that was considered an Akali Dal bastion, MP Dimpa also considers Khadoor Sahib as his stronghold. Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has already fielded former minister Ranjit Singh Brahmpura from the segment. In Khemkaran constituency, Sukhpal Singh Bhullar has been facing a challenge from his elder brother Anoop Singh Bhullar. The day the Congress party released its first list 86 candidates, Anoop, on his Facebook page, demanded party ticket for his father and former minister Gurchet Singh Bhullar. “If the party high command will give the ticket to my father (Gurchet Singh Bhullar), I will support him. If anyone else gets the ticket, I will fight the election as an independent candidate,” Anoop told HT over phone, adding, “I am confident that the party won’t give ticket to my brother Sukhpal.” Meanwhile, senior Congress leader and vice-chairman of Punjab Mandi Board Tejpreet Singh Peter said, “If the party gives ticket to any member of the Bhullar family, I and my workers will oppose this. The party should consider giving ticket to somebody else.” During the 2017 assembly elections, Sukhpal managed to get the party ticket with the support of former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh. In the 2012 elections, his father Gurchet Singh Bhullar was the party candidate. Insiders say it will be a tough call for the party to name candidates for the two seats. “Ignoring sitting MLAs is not easy as there will be widespread dissent,” said a party leader on condition of anonymity. Repeated attempts to contact Sikki and Sukhpal Bhullar for comment went futile.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sitting-congress-mlas-from-khadoor-sahib-khemkaran-in-a-quandary-over-ticket-101642449461979.html

18-01-2022||Chandigarh||Jammu and Kashmir sees 2,827 Covid cases, five deaths; Srinagar records 618 infections||Jammu and Kashmir on Monday witnessed five Covid-induced deaths and 2,827 fresh infections – reporting a drop of 19 percent over Sunday’s cases. Since January 6, the cases have been consistently increasing from 349 to an 8-month high of 3,499 on Sunday. Of the total infections on Monday, Kashmir valley saw 1,734 infections while 1,093 cases and five deaths were reported in the Jammu division. Jammu division’s Jammu district reported the highest 711 cases followed by 122 in Udhampur and 52 in Samba. Kashmir valley witnessed the highest 618 cases in the summer capital Srinagar followed by 315 cases in Baramulla, 295 in Budgam and 168 in Anantnag. Jammu district has the highest number of Covid active cases at 4,289 followed by Srinagar and Baramulla districts with 3,877 and 2,514 active cases, respectively. This month has witnessed a steep rise in cases. As many as 2,456 cases were detected on Friday, 1,996 cases on Thursday, 1,695 cases on Wednesday and 1,148 on Tuesday. From January 5 to 10, the union territory saw between 400 to 700 cases daily. The number of patients who were cured in the UT was 777 with active positive cases reaching 17,928. However, of the 4,794 beds dedicated for Covid patients, just over 7 percent or 344 are occupied, indicating that the higher cases are not translating into higher hospital admissions. The authorities have already imposed restrictions over weekends and have stopped non-emergency OPD services at prominent hospitals. The Doctors Association Kashmir (DAK) on Monday said lockdown should be decided on the basis of the number of patients hospitalised with Covid rather than the number of positive cases. “Hospitalisation rates, not case count, should determine curbs and restrictions,” said DAK president and influenza expert Dr Nisar ul Hassan. He said while the Omicron variant causes a lot of infections, most of the infections are mild. “Even though the positivity rate is high, most of the cases do not require hospitalisation,” he said. “We should be shifting our focus on Covid-related hospitalisations, bed occupancy and the number of patients on ventilators. “That should be the major metric and not cases in deciding about imposing severe restrictions, like lockdown,” he added. The officials said 64,017 tests were conducted in the past 24 hours in the UT. The authorities have been conducting between 42,000 and 56,000 average daily tests every month from May to December. The government’s daily health bulletin also said that 55,629 vaccine doses were administered taking overall doses administered in the UT to 1.991 crore. The overall number of people who have recovered reached 3,39,700 prompting the recovery rate to reach 93.78%. Since the pandemic started, the overall cases in J&K have reached 3,62,200 and the death toll has reached 4,572. The Jammu district has the highest number of 1,173 fatalities followed by Srinagar with 886 deaths. Meanwhile, the University of Kashmir on Monday deferred all ongoing and scheduled examinations with effect from January 18, 2022, until further notice in view of the pandemic. Controller of examinations Prof Irshad A Nawchoo said the revised dates for the deferred examinations shall be notified separately in due course of time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jammu-and-kashmir-sees-2-827-covid-cases-five-deaths-srinagar-records-618-infections-101642448864676.html

In its supplementary chargesheet filed before a special NIA court here, the NIA identified the four militants as Mohammad Arman Ali, alias Arman Mansuri, Mohammad Ehsanullah, alias Guddu Ansari of Saran in Bihar, Imran Ahmad Hajam, alias Imran Nabi Hajam of Nathpora, Khanabal, Anantnag, and Irfan Ahmad Dar of Batengoo, Anantnag. The NIA has filed the chargesheet under Sections 120B, 121A and 122 of the IPC, 1860; Section 25 (1AA) of the Arms Act, 1959; Sections 3 & 4 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908 and Sections 18 & 23 of the UA (P) Act, 1967 against them. “The case relates to the hatching of a conspiracy by the operatives of Lashkar-e-Mustafa (LeM) at the behest of proscribed terrorist organisation Jaish-e-Mohammed to carry out terrorist activities in the Jammu area with an intention to threaten the sovereignty, integrity and security of India,” said a spokesman. Earlier, a chargesheet was filed in the case against six persons on August 4 last year by the NIA. “Investigation revealed that the four accused chargesheeted had conspired, procured and transported weapons from Bihar to Jammu and Kashmir via Punjab and Haryana for Lashkar-e-Mustafa (LeM) terrorist group in order to carry out terror activities in the UT of Jammu and Kashmir, especially in the Jammu region,” added the spokesperson. Further investigation in the case continues. The Jammu and Kashmir Police recovered a hand grenade, three cellphones and other incriminating material from Hidyat Ullah Malik, the self-styled chief of LeM, during a search operation in Jammu on February 6 last year. Police had recovered two pistols, three magazines and 28 rounds of ammunition from a house in the Sunjuwan area of Jammu where the terrorist had been living as a tenant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nia-files-supplementary-chargesheet-against-4-lem-militants-101642448804432.html

18-01-2022||Chandigarh||Getting rid of BJP will be bigger than freedom from British rule: PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti||In the run-up to the assembly elections in five states, former chief minister and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti on Monday asked people to “get rid of BJP” and said that “doing so would be bigger than freedom of India from the British rule”. Addressing party’s tribal youth convention here, Mehbooba claimed that Jammu and Kashmir was in dire straits since August 5, 2019, and urged the youth to stand up against BJP’s “divisive politics”. “They have ruined the country…Today one feels insecure and does not know whether he/she will be alive tomorrow or not. The arrests and raids by the ED and other government agencies against the opposition leaders have become a daily affair,” she said. The PDP president urged the youth to read history, take inspiration from it and write their own destiny with pen and paper. “History gives an opportunity to play a role… 70 years ago people of India availed this opportunity and freed India from the British rule. Today, we have another opportunity to get rid of the BJP. If we succeed, this development will be much bigger than India’s freedom from British rule,” she said. Mehbooba said Jammu and Kashmir acceded to Mahatma Gandhi’s India and not Nathuram Godse’s India. “We will not allow this country to become Nathuram Godse’s nation. They pray to Godse but Gandhi was the biggest Hindu, a vegetarian and a secular leader who was not having any hatred against anyone, even those who were non-vegetarians,” she added. She urged the youth to stand up to the onslaught post-revocation of Article 370 and write their own destiny. “Be proactive and face them…Agar dar gaye to smajho mar gaye…Darna nahi hai. And, we have to face them with pen and paper…not with stones and guns because … they want us to indulge in violence and then they get the opportunity to slap the UAPA, PSA and ED, etc,” she added. The former chief minister cautioned the BJP of the serious ramifications of its “communal” politics. “You are not the godfather of Hindus and this country. We have to stand up and face the challenges together, irrespective of our religion, caste and creed and counter them by spreading love and friendship,” she said. She also accused the BJP of harbouring mala fide intentions of finishing the existence of Jammu and Kashmir. “Today, the youth have a responsibility because coming generations will ask you whether you stood up to BJP’s onslaught on our identity and culture or meekly surrendered,” she said. Later, she met women and children of Gujjar families at Roop Nagar, who were recently evicted by the JDA from their houses during an early morning anti-encroachment drive. The JDA had claimed the houses were illegally constructed on government land. The PDP president asked them to stand their ground and do not bow down to pressure tactics. “I urge LG Manoj Sinha to intervene. They (BJP) could do nothing to China that usurped our land in Ladakh but they uprooted you. You people didn’t come from China or Pakistan,” she said. She assured them of every possible help but advised them to stand their ground, the way farmers did against farm laws.

18-01-2022||Chandigarh||Over 400 medics infected with Covid since January 1 in Kashmir||The third wave of Covid-19 has infected over 400 doctors, healthcare workers and medical students in major government hospitals of Kashmir this month, officials said.Experts say that the high number of infections in doctors and paramedics is worrisome but they say that the intensity of the symptoms of the disease has not been that severe.Prof Dr Mohammad Salim Khan, head of the department of community medicine at Government Medical College (GMC), Srinagar, and nodal officer, Covid, said that 405 doctors, MBBS students and paramedics have been infected by novel Coronavirus from January 1 to January 16 in various hospitals of Kashmir controlled by the GMC.“As many as 145 doctors, 130 MBBS students and 130 paramedics tested positive for Covid in GMC, Srinagar, and associated hospitals since January 1, 2022,” Khan said in a post.He said that most of them have mild symptoms and are in isolation. “Almost everyone has received Covid vaccines. No one was hospitalised. However, they are in isolation and hopefully shall report back in a week’s time,” he said.Government Medical College (GMC), Srinagar, leads in contributing a major portion of healthcare manpower to the state. Currently, there are eight hospitals associated with the GMC which include Shri Maharaja Hari Singh (SMHS) tertiary care hospital along with its Super Specialty Hospital, GB Pant Children Hospital, Lal Ded Maternity Hospital, Psychiatric Diseases Hospital, Chest Diseases (CD) Hospital, Barzulla, Bone and Joint Hospital and Kashmir Nursing Home.SMHS, CD hospital and SKIMS-Bemina (not managed by GMC) have been designated as Covid-19 hospitals.Dr Khan urged people to stop visiting hospitals unnecessarily. “Hospitals are mostly frequented by infected persons. Visit hospitals only in case of emergency. There is no need to visit your near and dear ones admitted in hospitals or isolated and quarantined at homes,” he said.He said that even though hospital admissions haven’t been consistent with a surge of positive cases, the mortality is still there. “Six deaths were reported due to Covid on Sunday,” he said.Jammu and Kashmir has been witnessing a major surge of cases since January 5. On Sunday, six Covid-induced deaths and 3,499 infections were recorded, the highest daily surge of cases after May 21. The daily infection count increased by 7.6 percent over Saturday’s 3,251 cases. The last time the UT had recorded six Covid-related deaths was on July 6.However, there is one silver lining that only seven percent of 4,794 beds dedicated to Covid are occupied indicating that the disease is not leading to hospitalisation of a large number of people despite active cases crossing 15,000. Hospitals associated with the GMC have stopped non-emergency out-patient services in view of the surging number of Covid cases and some have issued numbers for teleconsultation. Earlier on Friday, the Valley’s prominent hospital and deemed university, Sheri Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS), Soura, which is not under the control of the health directorate or the GMC, stopped outpatient facilities and will be offering teleconsultation for non-emergency cases.The hospitals associated with the GMC or the SKIMS are beside the hundreds of district hospitals and public health centres operating across the Valley under the directorate of health and the government has not yet issued any data on how many health workers have been affected by Covid in the third wave.Director health of Kashmir Mushtaq Ahmad Rather on Saturday issued a circular saying that both Covid and non-Covid activities, including outpatient facilities (OPDs) and elective surgeries, will continue to function normally till further orders in the government hospitals.Dr Muzaffar Maqbool, associate professor, Internal Medicine at GMC, Srinagar, in a tweet said that people need not throng hospitals for minor ailments and use telemedicine facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/over-400-medics-infected-with-covid-since-january-1-in-kashmir-101642448685100.html

I hope that all the parents will cooperate and over the next 2 days, schools and parents will jointly help in achieving the target of 100% vaccination,” he said. “Maximum vaccinations are the need of the hour. Like other age groups, the 15 years to 18 years age group is also at risk and thus ensuring that our young population remains protected is our duty and responsibility,” he said.Reverse ‘no-fee-hike’ orderThe UPSA has appealed to the additional chief secretary, secondary education, Aradhana Shukla to withdraw the order of preventing private schools from increasing fees.“Schools are under pressure from teachers and nonteaching staff who are demanding salary hike. Without fee hike, school management would find it difficult to manage their affairs,” Agarwal said. “Due to Covid-19, schools have suffered financially and the number of students enrolled with the schools has also declined. There is pressure to increase salaries of all teaching and nonteaching staff. That is why, the state government is expected to reconsider the no-fee-hike decision,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cooperate-in-100-vaccination-of-eligible-students-upsa-to-parents-101642448564498.html
18-01-2022||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | Insurance firm directed to pay ₹10 lakh, interest to accident victim’s wife||The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission directed an insurance company to honour a ₹10 lakh personal accident insurance claim and pay ₹5,500 as compensation for deficient service to the victim’s wife. The complainant, Rajinder Kaur, the widow of Jagtar Singh of Jhamat village, had submitted a complaint against Universal Sompo General Insurance Company Limited and Indian Overseas Bank, Baddowal Cantonment, Ludhiana. She had said that her husband who held an account with the bank was covered under the IOB Suraksha, personal accident insurance policy, which was valid from May 23, 2017 to April 13, 2018.As per terms of the policy, the nominated beneficiary, was to get an assured sum of ₹10 lakh in event of accidental death of the insured person. It so happened that her husband met with a road mishap on December 29, 2017 and succumbed to his injuries on December 31, 2017.However, the insurance company rejected the complainant’s claim on February 9, 2018, on grounds that her husband did not have a valid driving license at the time of the accident. The counsel for the insurance company pleaded that the Ludhiana consumer commission had no territorial jurisdiction to entertain and try the claim. The bank, however, said that it had nothing to do with the rejection of the claim. “Moreover, the claim has been rightly rejected that the deceased was not having a valid driving license at the time of accident and this amounts to breach of condition of the policy”, contended the bank.However, the commission in its order observed that the case studies cited by the counsel of the insurance company, demanding dismissal of the application of the complaint, were cases of vehicle insurance, rather than accidental death. The commission dismissed the complaint against the bank but allowed the complaint against the insurance company. “The insurance company is directed to pay the claim strictly as per terms and conditions of the policy along with a 6% per annum interest from the date of filing the complaint, till actual payment and also to pay ₹5,500 compensation to the complainant”, read the order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-insurance-firm-directed-to-pay-10-lakh-interest-to-accident-victim-s-wife-101642448563127.html

So far, 115 officers and other court staff members have tested positive at the high court in Chandigarh.The data is learnt to have been shared at a meeting which was held on Monday to review the Covid-19 situation, chaired by justice Ajay Tewari. The meeting was held with the members of the Bar Council and high court Bar Association, among others.Earlier on January 5, the high court shifted to virtual mode hearings and from January 10, the HC further curtailed operations and only 50% judges are holding the courts since then. The courts have been functioning with restrictions since March 2020. Limited hearings through physical mode were resumed on February 8, 2021. However, these had to be suspended in April again in view of the second wave. It again started the limited physical hearing on September 6, 2021, and in the following months, cases were taken up through physical as well as virtual mode before fresh decision of opting for virtual mode was taken on January 5.The restrictions that Covid-19 pandemic induced have led to a massive increase in pendency of cases. According to a government data tracking agency, National Judicial Data Grid, pendency of cases in high court on December 31 was 4.48 lakh with 69,000-odd cases added to the list in 2021 alone.

18-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Shoddy garbage management, stray animals Mohali’s biggest bugbears||Amid tall claims of development by the sitting MLA and promises by candidates of other parties, residents say Mohali is still ailing from a number of issues, 15 years after it was declared a district in 2006.While the then deputy chief minister, Sukhbir Singh Badal, had dubbed Mohali as the “future city” in 2007, over the years, persistent civic issues have impeded its progress.To date, Mohali residents continue to wage a lonely battle against poor solid waste management, encroachments and stray animals. Public toilets in markets and CCTV cameras in public places to rein in crime have also failed to see the light of the day.In the upcoming Punjab elections, Mohali, an urban constituency, is once again set to see a multi-cornered contest, with three-time MLA Balbir Singh Sidhu contesting for the fourth time from the Congress, former mayor and real estate baron Kulwant Singh trying his luck from the AAP and former MC councillor Parvinder Singh Sohana being fielded by the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD).Balbir Singh Rajewal, farmer leader and president of a faction of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, has nominated Ravneet Singh Brar as the face of his party, Samyukt Samaj Morcha (SSM). Captain Amarinder Singh’s Punjab Lok Congress is yet to announce its candidate.Tardy waste managementAfter GMADA allotted a 13-acre site in Phase 8-B for dumping solid waste in May 2006, some residents had moved the Punjab and Haryana high court. In May 2012, the Mohali municipal corporation had assured the high court that it would acquire 13 acres at Samgauli village near Dera Bassi for a permanent dumping ground, a promise it failed to keep. Three years later, in 2015, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had directed the corporation to acquire land for the dump by January 2015 and make it fully operational by January 2017. Meanwhile, the civic body was allowed to dump the daily waste temporarily in another ground in Phase 8, but only after segregating it according to the Municipal Solid Wastes (Management and Handling) Rules, 2000. But years later, the corporation has neither been successful in ensuring garbage segregation or an efficient solid waste processing system.No end to stray cattle menaceThe stray cattle menace continues unabated in the city, with herds often visible even opposite the MC office in Sector 68. A number of fatal accidents have taken place due to the presence of the animals on busy roads, claiming 10 lives in the past year alone. But a permanent solution has evaded the city.Encroachments galoreWhile the civic body has identified as many as 4,200 encroachers, it has failed to issue any notice. Most violations are done by VIPs or their security personnel, through illegal occupation of government land, be it parks or road berms. Vendors have also encroached upon corridors, walkways and parking areas, but the MC is sitting tight on conducting an aggressive drive to remove them.City mayor Amarjit Singh Sidhu said since the formation of the new MC House in February last year, several development works had been executed in the city. “Parks have been fully developed, roads have been carpeted and Mohali’s sanitation rank has also improved. A cattle shed outside the city limits is already in the works, so the stray cattle menace will also be sorted out soon.”“Stray cattle and dogs are a major problem in Mohali. Despite requesting the civic body authorities several times, the issue remains unaddressed,” said Mohinder Pal Singh, president, Resident Welfare and Development Committee, Sector 79.Paramjeet Singh, president of the Citizens Welfare and Development Forum, Mohali, added that though Mohali had seen several major development works in the past year, encroachment, poor solid waste management and stray cattle menace still ailed the city.
18-01-2022||Chandigarh||AAP candidates move HC seeking quashing of Chandigarh mayoral elections||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) candidates, who lost the mayor, senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor elections in Chandigarh on January 8, have approached the Punjab and Haryana high court seeking quashing of the elections.The court will take up the plea on January 19.In the January 8 mayoral elections, BJP’s first-time councillor Sarabjit Kaur Dhillon had won after defeating AAP’s Anju Katyal by one vote. While Kaur received 14 votes, Katyal managed 13, as one AAP vote was declared invalid, tipping the election in the former’s favour. In the polls for the senior deputy mayor, the BJP candidate, Dalip Sharma, pipped AAP candidate Prem Lata by two votes. Sharma polled 15 votes, while Lata got 13.For the deputy mayor’s post, after BJP’s Anup Gupta and AAP’s Ram Chander Yadav were tied at 14 votes each, a draw of lot was conducted, which went in Gupta’s favour.The results of the Chandigarh civic body polls, which were declared on December 27 last year, had thrown up a hung House, with the AAP winning 14 of the 35 wards in its first civic body elections. The BJP won 12 seats, the Congress eight and the SAD got one. For the mayoral polls, both the AAP and the BJP had 14 votes, including the MP’s vote, while the Congress and the SAD skipped the poll process.In their plea, the AAP candidates have alleged that the BJP indulged in horse-trading and also levelled allegations against BJP’s Maheshinder Singh Sidhu, who was the presiding officer in the January 8 elections.They said as per the prevailing practice and norms for the mayoral elections, only a nominated councillor could be the presiding officer. But the process to select nominated councillors was delayed and Sidhu was chosen as the presiding officer. They also questioned why one torn vote in the mayor’s election was not declared invalid by the presiding officer, while another with a “tick mark” was. Stating that instead of secret ballot, open voting should have been allowed, they demanded that re-polls be ordered and poll-related record be summoned from the municipal corporation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aap-candidates-move-hc-seeking-quashing-of-chandigarh-mayoral-elections-101642448450014.html

18-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Rajewal-led SSM enters into alliance with Chaduni faction||Chandigarh : The Balbir Singh Rajewal-led political outfit Sanyukt Samaj Morcha (SSM) and Gurnam Singh Chaduni’s Sanyukt Sangharsh Party (SSP) on Monday entered into a pre-poll arrangement for the February 20 Punjab assembly polls. While the candidates of Chaduni-led outfit will contest on 10 seats, Rajewal will field the candidates on the remaining 107 segments. This decision was announced at a joint media briefing by SSM’s parliamentary committee head Prem Singh Bhangu and Punjab president of Chaduni’s SSP Rachpal Singh Joremajra in Ludhiana. Addressing the press conference, both the leaders said the two groups have reached a consensus and would support each other. According to the announcement, candidates of Chaduni’s outfit will contest from Samana, Nabha, Fatehgarh Sahib, Gurdaspur, Dakha, Ajnala, Sangrur, Dirba, Bholath and Shahkot.The decision was reached four days after Chaduni threatened to go solo and contest on all the 117 seats of the state assembly. Both the factions had marathon meetings subsequently. Chaduni earlier was asking for 25 seats which then reduced to 15 by SSM, then to 9 and subsequently to seven, which annoyed Chaduni, who posted a video on social platforms to go contest all alone on all 117 seats in the state. SSM announces candidates on 20 seats The Rajewal-led SSM announced candidates on 20 seats. The candidates are Lakhwinder Singh (Ferozepur City), Kuldeep Singh Wajidpur (Nawanshahr), Balwinder Singh Raju (Batala), Gurpreet Singh Kotli (Gidderbaha), Sukhwinder Kumar (Malout), Anuroop Kaur (Muktsar), Simardeep Singh (Payal), Buta Singh Shadipur (Sanour), Baba Chamkaur Singh (Bucho), Sarabjit Singh Alal (Dhuri), Maura Singh Anjaan (Ferozpur-Rural), Satnam Singh Ajnala (Rajasansi), Surinder Singh Dhadian (Jalalabad), Amarjeet Singh Mann (Sunam), Bhagwant Singh Sumao (Bhadaur), Abhikaran Singh (Barnala), Gurnam Singh Bikhi (Mansa) and Chota Singh Mian (Sardoolgarh).

18-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab assembly polls | Friends-turned-foes to slug it out in Ludhiana West||The Ludhiana West constituency is all set for a no-holds-barred contest with friends-turned-foes – former Congress leader Gurpreet Singh Gogi, who recently joined the Aam Aadmi Party, and incumbent cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu – preparing to slug it out against each other in the upcoming Punjab assembly elections. The west constituency, which has been a Congress bastion, was being considered as the grand old party’s safe seat. However, Gogi’s defection has complicated matters. Gogi and Ashu will also face a tough contest from former cabinet minister and SAD leader Maheshinder Singh Grewal.Earlier, Colonel Iqbal Singh Pannu (retd) and Ahbab Singh Grewal were being seen as front runners for the AAP ticket. However, the induction of Gogi, a councillor from Ward 76 skewed the dynamics. It did not help that Ashu had won the 2017 elections for the second time from the west constituency after defeating AAP candidate Ahbab Singh Grewal with a margin of 36,521 votes.While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is yet to announce its candidate from the Ludhiana west constituency, Sanyukt Samaj Morcha (SSM) has fielded Bhartiya Arthik Party’s (BAP’s) Tarun Jain Bawa from the constituency. Incidentally, both Gogi and Bawa have had a falling out with Ashu, after years of being part of the core group which devised poll strategies for the Cabinet Minister. At one point, Gogi and Bawa had enjoyed a stronghold over the Ludhiana municipal corporation (MC) and the hosiery industry. At the time two factions, one led by Simarjit Singh Bains and the other led by Ashu, Gogi and Sandhu held sway over the House.The rift Over the years, both the leaders – Ashu and Gogi – grew in stature and differences between the two began to simmer. Both wanted a chance to fight the assembly elections on a Congress ticket. However, it was Ashu who got the ticket and won the 2012 elections with an emphatic margin, while Gogi went on to become the president of the District Congress Committee.In 2017, several eyebrows were raised during the 2017 Vidhan Sabha elections when Gogi did not campaign for Ashu in his area, citing poor health. While enmity was brewing between the two leaders, the two refrained from washing dirty laundry in public. The rift between the two heavyweights finally came to the fore after the 2018 municipal corporation elections where Gogi was in the race to become the next mayor. However, Balkar Singh Sandhu, who had Ashu’s backing, got the top seat. Nevertheless, Gogi capitalised on his proximity to former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and became Punjab Small Industries and Export Corporation (PSIEC) chairperson.A similar falling out took place with Bawa joining the BJP. Ashu and Bawa were seen exchanging a heated argument over the setting up of a common effluent treatment plant (CETP) during the MC house meetings. Recently, Bawa quit the BJP in protest over the farm laws and founded his own political outfit. AAP’s calculated gamble Political pundits say pitching Gogi as a candidate from the west constituency was a calculated gamble, though the move has discouraged a few AAP workers hoping to get a ticket. While SAD is increasingly gaining ground in Ashok Nagar, Sham Nagar and Jawahar Nagar area, Gogi also enjoys considerable clout. With Bawa joining the fray, the contest will be all the more intense, especially once the BJP pitches a candidate. Never before has the constituency seen a five-cornered contest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-assembly-polls-friends-turned-foes-to-slug-it-out-in-ludhiana-west-101642448321803.html

18-01-2022||Lucknow||UP Polls: AAP formulates strategy for each region, uses triple ‘C’ formula to vet candidates||Lucknow: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is giving final push to make inroads into electoral politics of Uttar Pradesh and register its presence in the state assembly. The party has formulated a separate strategy for each assembly segment based on caste combinations and local factors, besides giving representation to all. In addition to this, the AAP is also using its Delhi formula for selection of candidates based on triple ‘C’ which stands for crime, corruption and character. “All candidates are being vetted on the triple ‘C’ formula. It is mandatory for them to clear this test. In Delhi, candidates selected on this formula have defeated well established and prominent leaders of BJP and Congress,” said Mahindra Pratap Singh, state media coordinator, AAP. During selection of candidates, the Central and the state leaderships of the party vetted candidates on various counts, including caste combination, winnability factor, qualification and local scenario. The AAP leadership has made it a point that there would be no random selection of candidates just for the sake of it. The party will also focus on such assembly segments across the state from prominent BJP leaders are contesting. AAP will contest almost all 403 assembly seats making the polls a four cornered contest between BJP, Samajwadi Party, BSP and AAP. In its first list of 150 candidates, the AAP has given representation to all caste combinations and the Muslim community. Keeping into consideration local factors of an assembly segment, the AAP’s list of first 150 candidates has 55 OBC candidates, 31 schedule caste, 36 Brahmin, six Kayastha, 14 Muslims and seven businessmen among others. Vishnu Kumar Jaiswal will be party’s candidate from Sirathu assembly seat in Kaushambhi district. Here, he will challenge Keshav Prasad Maurya, deputy CM of the BJP. Rajeev Yadav will challenge Suresh Khanna, senior BJP leader and finance minister in the Yogi Adityanath government, in Shahjahanpur assembly segment. In Noida, a predominantly urban assembly segment in Gautam Buddha Nagar district, Pankaj Awana will be AAP’s candidate. He will challenge sitting MLA of the BJP, Pankaj Singh, who is the son of union defence minister Rajnath Singh. Now, when the Election Commission of India (ECI) has banned election rallies till January 22 due to Covid-19 pandemic, AAP is all out with its social media team to connect with voters across the state. “We have a formidable presence on social media as compared to other parties. Our goal is to make sure that the policies of Arvind Kejriwal government and promises made with electorate of Uttar Pradesh reach every cell phone in the state,” said Singh. When it comes to door-to-door campaigning, it is advantage AAP, claim AAP leaders. “We will reach out to the maximum households through door-to-door campaigning. In every assembly segment 20 teams are being constituted. Each will have five members to carry out the campaign,” said Vaibhav Maheshwari, AAP’s spokesperson, Uttar Pradesh. “In all 403 assembly constituencies across the state, these teams have the task to knock at every door,” Sanjay Singh, state incharge of AAP, had said on Sunday. For the last two years, AAP leader Sanjay Singh has been reaching out to every corner of the state from where any incident or crime has been reported. Be it Hathras gang rape and murder case or the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, Singh has been among the first politician to reach out to aggrieved families. Party’s ‘Tiranga Yatra’ spanning across the state has been successful. Delhi chief minister and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal offered prayers at Ram Janmabhoomi site and Hanumangarhi temple in Ayodhya on October 10 last year. There, he had announced to include the temple town in the Delhi government’s free pilgrimage scheme. Deputy CM of Delhi, Manish Sisodia, had addressed the party’s Tiranga Yatra in Ayodhya on September 14 last year.

18-01-2022||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | Local leaders overlooked in BJP’s star-studded posters||While the Shiromani Akali Dal and Congress have given space to local leaders on party posters ahead of the Punjab assembly elections, the BJP has chosen to highlight its star-studded Central leadership, completely overlooking its local leaders. The Congress is projecting the Jatt-Hindu-Dalit trio – Navot Singh Sindhu, Sunil Jakhar and chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, and SAD its candidates, while BJP’s posters feature Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah, party president JP Nadda, poll campaign in-charge Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, co-incharge for the state Meenakshi Lekhi, Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri and state BJP chief Ashwani Sharma. BJP’s prominent local leaders, including state vice-president Parveen Bansal, district president Pushpinder Singhal and state treasurer Gurdev Sharma Debi, were conspicuous by their absence. While the majority of the political parties have announced their candidates and have already started canvassing in their respective assembly constituencies, the BJP is yet to announce its list of candidates for the upcoming polls.When asked about the hoardings, BJP spokesperson Anil Sareen said, “Like always, the Prime Minister is our star campaigner and the elections will be fought under his leadership.” “This is not to say that the local party leaders are being ignored,” he added. However, those privy to the matter, say the party has refrained from featuring the local leadership on the posters due to factionalism within the local unit of the party.Besides, with former Akali leader Gurdeep Singh Gosha joining the BJP, the power dynamics have shifted within the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-local-leaders-overlooked-in-bjp-s-star-studded-posters-101642447664103.html
18-01-2022||Noida||Locals demand better civic infra, resolution of homebuyer issues in G Noida West||With over 70 high-rise societies and a population nearing about one lakh (100,000), Greater Noida West will play a crucial role in deciding the fortunes of candidates from the Dadri assembly constituency, which will go to polls on February 10, under phase one of the seven-phased assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. Of the total 586,000 registered voters in Dadri, about 100,000 are from Greater Noida West and the constituency, which is one of three assembly constituencies in Gautam Budh Nagar, is currently represented by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s Tejpal Nagar, who defeated his nearest rival, Bahujan Samajwadi Party’s Satveer Singh Gurjar, by a margin of 80,177 votes in the 2017 elections.Dadri, according to several realty surveys, is emerging as a fast growing real estate hub with towering high-rise societies, each housing hundreds of flats. According to residents there, however, the ground realities are far different from brochure pictures of real estate projects -- the area suffers from a lack of several crucial civic infrastructure and, according to residents, is treated by political parties as the “poor country cousin” of the much more urban Noida and Greater Noida. One of the major demands of voters in this area is the speedy resolution of homebuyer issues that include delays in registration and handover of flats. Homebuyers had launched a campaign called “No registry, No vote” last November, which intensified this month with elections approaching. “Builders delay flat registrations by years and our MLA does not come forward in our support. There are at least one lakh homebuyers in Greater Noida West who are awaiting possession and registration of flats. Our first demand to candidates is that they include our demands in their manifestos,” said Abhishek Kumar, president of Noida Extension Flat Owner’s Welfare Association (NEFOWA). Residents say their second demand is a multi-specialty government hospital in the region for want of which they are currently forced to travel a long way to Noida -- the District Hospital is 15km away while Government Institute Of Medical Sciences in Kasna, Greater Noida, is 28km away -- in search of quality medical care. “During the second wave of Covid-19, we realised the importance of a multi-specialty government hospital as residents were unable to find beds and private hospitals continued to cash in on our desperation. Greater Noida West has one community health centre to cater to the population of Bisrakh block but not a single government hospital,” said Manish Kumar, a resident of Supertech EcoVillage-2, Greater Noida West. Residents also said they urgently needed a cremation ground, playground and more government schools.“Greater Noida West has a large population and hence there is a dire need for a hi-tech cremation facility. Currently, we are forced to take our dead to Antim Nivas in Noida’s Sector 94, about 15km away. Moreover, the whole region does not have a single playground for children. This has been a long pending demand of residents,” said Rakesh Ranjan, a member of Gaur City 12th Avenue Apartment Owners’ Association (AOA). Their demand for civic amenities did not stop there; residents have also been demanding Ganga water supply for years now. “As voters, we are not happy with the current MLA as he never helped resolve our issues. People’s representatives are elected so that they represent us and put pressure on developers and authorities to provide us basic amenities,” said Naval Kishore, president of Green Arch AOA, Greater Noida West.When contacted, MLA Nagar refused to comment on the issue. Meanwhile, Congress’s Dadri candidate Deepak Bhati Chotiwala said homebuyer issues were a priority in his upcoming manifesto. “I have assured the residents of Greater Noida West that homebuyer issues, especially regarding delayed registry, is my priority. I will ensure that action is taken against errant developers,” he said, adding that providing basic amenities such as hospitals and playgrounds is also on his agenda. Raj Kumar Bhati, Samajwadi Party’s Dadri candidate, said, “If I am voted to power, I will ensure that the homebuyers awaiting registration are able to do that in six months. I will also ensure basic amenities such as government hospitals, playground and a cremation ground are provided to residents as soon as possible.”Political analysts in Gautam Budh Nagar said anti-incumbency is strong against the Dadri MLA. “The kind of model that was offered to the people in the past five years was based on a ”charity model” wherein the candidates promised benefits in return for votes but that has reached a saturation point as voter demands have not been met in these five years. The pandemic and the economic meltdown induced by it has changed equations and candidates need something new to keep voters engaged. Residents have started understanding this. Secondly, the perceived apathy of the people’s representative has hurt people,” said Hilal Ahmad, associate professor, Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/locals-demand-better-civic-infra-resolution-of-homebuyer-issues-in-g-noida-west-101642447661950.html

The cyber fraudsters are using a new modus operandi where they, posing as army officers, contact the victims after taking their details from the real estate websites where the victims had placed advertisements for renting, police said, adding that over 35 similar complaints have been received since December 20 last year.“The suspects say that they are posted in the army cantonment and have been shifted to Delhi. They need to take house on rent in Gurugram as their wives are teachers in private schools. To build trust, they even share their Aadhaar card, PAN card and fake army ID card,” said KK Rao, commissioner of police.Rao said that the victims trusted defence personnel and followed their instructions and lost money. “To give token money, the suspects ask the victims to share UPI (unified payments interface) details to transfer the amount. To gain confidence, they first credit some money and ask them to scan a QR code for a money transfer. When the victims say that they are aware that the QR code is used to debit money from the account, they explain that the Army has got a different method where the money is sent using the code. The moment the victims scan the QR code, fraudulent transactions take place,” said Rao.A fraud case was registered by Bavya Sharma (36) on Sunday at Cybercrime police station, said police. Sharma, a resident of Sector 65, said that on December 25, she received a call from a man who introduced himself as an army officer. “He said he was being transferred from Ahmedabad to Delhi and had seen our property posted online for rent. He called us twice on the same day and later said that he has transferred some amount into my bank account,” she said. Sharma further said that the suspect also sent copies of an army canteen ID card, PAN card and Aadhaar card which were later found out to be fake. “He initiated two transactions amounting to ₹25,000 each through my digital wallet linked with a bank account. He had details of my PAN card, Aadhaar card and a cancelled cheque of my bank account,” she said. Police said the suspect also sent screenshots of money transferred by him to the victim’s account, which was actually never done. Similarly, another family of Sushant Lok 2 was duped of over ₹3.5 lakh on December 28, followed by a DLF Phase 2 resident who was duped of ₹2 lakh on December 29, said police. Rao said they have written to the banks to get details about the accounts to which the money was credited. “The suspects are using fake ID cards and collecting details of people who have placed ads on various online platforms for renting or selling their flats,” he said. In some cases, the suspects even make video calls after asking real estate agents to connect to gain trust. Police said they are conducting investigation and teams have been formed to arrest the gang members whose location is found to be in Uttar Pradesh and Nuh. 
18-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: AAP takes dig at Cong over ticket denial to Channi’s brother||Chandigarh : Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) Punjab affairs co-in-charge Raghav Chadha accused the Congress of using chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi to woo the SC community. Chadha said the Congress, in its first list of candidates, has fielded the family members and relatives of several big leaders in the state but denied the ticket to the chief minister’s brother. This proves that the Congress applied “use and throw” at Channi for the votes of the SC community, he alleged at a press conference here. Referring to the families of Congress leaders who got tickets, Chadha said that the party has fielded (Fatehgarh Sahib MP) Amar Singh’s son from Raikot, (former minister) Avtar Henry’s son from Jalandhar, (cabinet minister) Brahm Mohindra’s son from Patiala Rural and (former state chief) Sunil Jakhar’s nephew from Abohar, but despite publicly expressing his desire to contest, the CM’s brother did not get the ticket. “This shows that Channi has no say at all in the party. The Congress used him as the chief minister for a few days only to get the votes of the SC community,” he said. Chadha said the Congress has a history of changing the CM after taking votes in the name of OBC-SC leaders. “They pulled something similar in Maharashtra as well. There, the Congress had used Sushil Kumar Shinde like Channi a few days before the election. After the polls, they replaced him. Like Maharashtra, the Congress is now using Channi as a ‘night watchman’ in Punjab,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-aap-takes-dig-at-cong-over-ticket-denial-to-channi-s-brother-101642447541930.html

18-01-2022||Lucknow||UP polls: Left parties to field candidates on a limited number of seats||The Left parties may field candidates on a limited number of seats in Uttar Pradesh to avoid a division in anti-BJP votes as such a split would be to the disadvantage of the Opposition parties, including the Congress and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). The Communist Party of India (CPI) and the Communist Part of India (Marxist), the two main players among the Left components in the state, will meet shortly to shortlist the seats and candidates for the UP polls. In 2017, half-a-dozen Left parties together contested 140 seats in UP and drew a blank. With their efforts to be a part of an anti-BJP alliance led by the Samajwadi Party (SP) not having succeeded, these Left parties have now decided to go it alone with their own tie-ups in the UP polls. CPI state secretary Girish said the Left parties had decided to go it alone after other political parties did not respond to their overtures for the anti-BJP alliance. “We contacted almost all main political parties, including the SP, and even wrote letters to them expressing our willingness to tie up with them to defeat the BJP in UP,” he said. “But they did not respond after which we decided to form an alliance of Left parties and field candidates,” he added. The CPI, he said, was holding a meeting on Tuesday to finalise the seats. CPI (M) leader Heera Lal Yadav said the Left parties had mainly interested in forming an alliance with the SP since it was the only party that looked in a position to take on the BJP, but the efforts did not succeed. “The CPI (M) will hold its internal meeting very soon to decide on candidates,” he said. Heera Lal Yadav indicated that the Left parties, including the All-India Forward Bloc and the Communist Party of Inidia (Marxist-Leninist), may together field candidates from around 35 constituencies where they have some influence. While the CPI (M) may field candidates in districts like Varanasi, Chandauli, Sonbhadra and Mirzapur, the CPI is considering contesting seats in western UP districts too. “Since our main objective is to stop the BJP from coming to power, we have decided to field candidates only on a limited number of seats so that the ant-BJP votes do not go to waste,” Yadav said. The Left movement is said to have become weak in the post “mandal-kamandal’ era and the left parties have ceased to make an electoral mark in the politics of the state since then. They failed to send a single candidate to the Vidhan Sabha in 2007, 2012 and 2017 assembly elections though the Left parties have organisational presence in most of the districts.

Reacting to the meeting of Union minister Sanjeev Balyan with BKU chief Naresh Tikait in Sisauli on Monday, he said, “We welcome everyone. We will extend our best wishes to any candidate (of any party) who comes to meet us. But the question of giving support to anyone does not arise.”On Sunday, Naresh Tikait had appealed for support to Rashtriya Lok Dal-Samajwadi Party alliance in the UP polls. However, he later withdrew his statement. Rakesh Tikait is camping at BKU camp in Magh Mela here for the ongoing three-day ‘Chintan Shivir’ of farmers at Parade Ground that started on Sunday.Interacting with media persons, he said farmers and he had come to Magh Mela to deliberate on the problems of the farmers. “There will be no talk of politics here. Nor will farmers be asked to vote for any party,” he said. Tikait expressed his displeasure against the state government on the question of the amount being sent to the farmers’ accounts under direct benefit transfer scheme and the BJP’s promise doubling their income, which, he alleged remained unfulfilled.“Everything is a lie. The government should get a gold medal in lying. Minimum support price for paddy is not yet available. In many states, farmers are getting electricity free of cost. When we demanded that free electricity be given to farmers in Uttar Pradesh too, the government gave subsidy. Payment of sugarcane farmers is still stuck. There is a resentment among the farmers over all these issues. If leaders go to seek votes, farmers will definitely ask these questions,” he claimed.He said after 13 months of nationwide farmers’ agitation, if the farmers voted on the issues of crops and development, its effect will be very much visible this time around. Tikait, however, praised the government for giving some relief to farmers in the area of mining.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/will-not-support-any-party-in-up-assembly-polls-bku-leader-101642446765844.html
18-01-2022||Chandigarh||In 12 days, 432 health workers test positive for Covid at PGIMS, Rohtak||The third wave of coronavirus (Covid-19) has hit Rohtak’s Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS) staff badly as 423 of its health workers, including 158 resident doctors have tested positive in just 12 days.On Monday, a total of 40 healthcare workers tested positive. As per the health bulletin released by the PGIMS, 39 Covid patients are undergoing treatment – two of them are on oxygen support and four on ventilator.A senior doctor, pleading anonymity, said it is a matter of serious concern that more than 400 employees have tested positive so far.“The infected staff had isolated themselves. Their symptomatic colleagues and contacts were quarantined while the asymptomatic contacts had to continue their work. We are hoping that the situation remains under control,” the doctor added.“Most of my infected colleagues have mild symptoms and are struggling with fever, cold and cough. Cases are soaring among nurses, lab technicians, resident doctors, Class-4 workers and even the administrative staff. No one should lower their guards as the cases are rising. No one had expected that even after getting both the doses of vaccination, such a large number of health workers will be affected,” a resident doctor said.PGIMS official spokesman Dr Varun Arora said many health workers have tested positive at the institution.“So far, our work is not hampered. We are managing the situation with the existing staff. Health workers are taking all precautions but still they have tested positive for the virus. Some of the key staff members have been infected and are in home-isolation. We are asking our health staff to resume services only after fully recovering from the infection. Booster doses are also being given to the workers,” Arora added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/in-12-days-432-health-workers-test-positive-for-covid-at-pgims-rohtak-101642446762960.html
18-01-2022||Chandigarh||Covid: Chandigarh sees drop in cases for third straight day||With 864 people testing positive for Covid-19 on Monday, Chandigarh’s daily tally witnessed a downward trend for the third consecutive day, over 50% drop from the all-time high of 1,834 registered on Friday. On Saturday, 1,795 cases had surfaced, while 1,358 people tested positive on Sunday.Even the tricity saw a dip in daily infections for the first time in five days, as only 2,215 people tested positive, including 702 in Mohali and 649 in Panchkula. The all-time record was set on Sunday with 3,907 cases. Even Mohali recorded a drop in numbers after four days, and Panchkula registered it after three days. Mohali had set a record with 1,831 cases the previous day, while Panchkula hit an all-time high with 734 cases last Wednesday (January 12). “Even though the cases in Chandigarh are falling for three days, it is too early to say that the peak is over. Usually, the graph first flattens among the health workers and then in the community. A the PGIMER, the daily infection count among health workers has been dropping for the past six days. In the community, most people have already got tested and are infected, due to which not many are coming positive these days,” said Dr PVM Lakshmi, professor, Community Medicine and School of Public Health, PGIMER. While cautioning people against lowering their guard, Dr Lakshmi said: “We should observe for another week, and when the positivity rate will drop despite the high number of samples tested, only then can we say that the graph is flattening.”Meanwhile, Dr Suman Singh, director, health services, Chandigarh, said, “We are testing more than 4,000 people daily. Even when 1,358 cases were reported on Sunday, the samples tested were above 6,000. The cases are dropping, as we have reached the herd immunity stage, where more than 60% people in the community are already infected and have antibodies to fight the virus. Also, since most of the people are now fully vaccinated, the graph will drop with the same speed with which it initially rose.”Four fatalities across tricityA day after registering eight deaths, the tricity recorded four more: two each in Chandigarh and Mohali.In Chandigarh, the victims included two women, aged 63 and 65, who were residing in Maloya and Sector 49, respectively. Both were fully vaccinated. While the Maloya woman was a cancer patient undergoing chemotherapy, the other was suffering from renal disease and hypertension.In Mohali district, the victims have been identified as a 78-year-old man from Sector 78 and a 60-year-old woman from Dera Bassi.79% positivity rate in PanchkulaAt 79%, Panchkula recorded the highest positivity rate on Monday. On Sunday, it had stood at 35%. Health officials said the number surged because of limited number of tests done on Sunday, the results of which came on Monday. It means, of every five people sampled the previous day, four were confirmed positive on Monday. Meanwhile, there are 2,891 active cases in Panchkula, but only 21 people are hospitalised. In Mohali, the active caseload has reached 7,834. The tricity’s total stands at 19,829, including 9,104 in Chandigarh. However, only 119 people are hospitalised in Chandigarh, while 8,886 are isolated at their homes and 99 at mini Covid care centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-chandigarh-sees-drop-in-cases-for-third-straight-day-101642446644806.html
18-01-2022||Chandigarh||Omicron: 10 more cases confirmed in Chandigarh||The Omicron variant has been confirmed in 10 more people who had tested positive for Covid-19 between December 21 and January 2 in Chandigarh. As many as nine of them have no travel history, while one had returned from Australia, a low-risk country, confirming community spread of the highly infectious variant of concern in Chandigarh. The samples were among 75 sent for genome sequencing in order to establish the variant. In December, an Italy-returnee and his two family members were found positive for Omicron, which was first detected in South Africa in November last year.Variants of concern in just 27% samples“Of the 75 samples, variants of concern were found in only 20. The Omicron variant was found in 10 people, while the other 10 were infected with the Delta variant. The other samples didn’t have variants of concern or were inconsequential,” said Dr Suman Singh, director, health services, Chandigarh. Dr Singh said the fact that nine out of the 10 Omicron positive people didn’t have any recent international travel history is worrisome. “This indicates that the new variant is highly prevalent in Chandigarh. Since Omicron and Delta variants are spreading in the community, it is believed both of them are leading to the recent Covid-19 surge in the city,” she said.Delta (B.1.617.2) variant is seen as the major reason behind the second wave in Chandigarh last year. Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation has warned that the risk related to Omicron (B.1.1.529) strain is “very high”, and it has been driving the recent pandemic surge across the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/omicron-10-more-cases-confirmed-in-chandigarh-101642446643114.html
18-01-2022||Chandigarh||Covid: Weekly tally goes up threefold in Chandigarh tricity||In a steep surge, the Chandigarh tricity area reported 20,904 fresh Covid-19 cases in the past one week (January 10-16), over threefold rise over the previous week’s tally. Amid the rising infection count, the death toll also recorded over fourfold jump, adding to the worries of the health officials.Amid 17 virus-related deaths in the tricity, health officials said most of the deceased were either co-morbid or aged or not vaccinated. On January 16 alone, eight deaths were reported, highest since the second wave receded in June, besides 3,907 cases, an all-time record. In comparison, in the week ending on January 9, the tricity had reported 6,441 cases and four fatalities.Of the three areas, Chandigarh remained the worst-affected, with 9,207 cases and seven deaths in a week, a significant rise from the previous week’s 2,360 infections and one fatality. In Mohali, the tally was 7,808 cases and eight deaths, up from 2,473 and two, respectively. Panchkula’s case tally rose from 1,608 to 3,889 and death toll from one to two.The second wave had peaked in May, when the tricity recorded 46,245 cases and 790 deaths in just one month. After the weekly cases dipped below 100, a gradual rise was seen in December before a sudden spike this month.Death toll: age, vax, comorbidities factorsAll seven Chandigarh resident who died in the past one week were aged above 38, with six in the 45+ age group. Also, all were suffering from co-morbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, and heart or kidney related illnesses. Three of them had not even taken the first dose of the vaccine. “Only 2% of the infected people are requiring hospitalisation in Chandigarh, as they have one or the other co-morbidity. Only a few patients are requiring oxygen or ventilator support, as vaccination is helping in reducing the severity of the infection. People must monitor their health, and if required, they should inform the health department immediately and get hospitalised,” said Dr Suman Singh, director, health services, Chandigarh.In Panchkula, the deceased were identified as two men, aged 59 and 76, both of whom had comorbidities. In Mohali, six of the eight deceased were above the age of 50, while two were aged below 10. All were co-morbid. The youngest of them, a one-year-old girl from Balongi village, died on January 16.End hesitancy: testing, vax, hospitalisation“We cannot say that people are dying only because of Covid-19, as people have co-morbidities too,” said Dr Mukta Kumar, chief medical officer, Panchkula.Dr Girish Dogra, nodal officer for Covid-19 in Mohali, said: “Despite repeated requests, people are still hesitant to get tested for the virus or to inform the health department about their deteriorating health condition. People must not self-medicate and get hospitalised when required, as it will help in controlling the fatality rate. Since vaccination is the only prevention, people must step forward and get vaccinated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-weekly-tally-goes-up-threefold-in-chandigarh-tricity-101642446641787.html
18-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh colder than Shimla for two days in a row||Even as the maximum temperature rose by a notch — from Sunday’s 11°C to 12°C on Monday — Chandigarh remained colder than Shimla for the second day in a row. With the maximum temperature remaining 9.1°C below normal, the city also recorded second severe cold day in a row, with a third likely on Tuesday, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).In Shimla, the mercury rose up to 13.4°C, while even Dharamshala recorded a maximum of 14°C degrees. However, while Chandigarh’s minimum temperature was 9.5°C (up from 8.2°C the previous day and 3.8°C above normal), it settled at 6.6°C in Shimla and 7.4°C in Dharamshala. IMD, Chandigarh, director Manmohan Singh, who was earlier the regional head of IMD, Shimla, said: “In the plains, the drop in temperature is due to fog, but we don’t see fog like this in the hills. With no sunlight in the day, the temperature stays low, but in Himachal Pradesh, it gets warmer in the day and gets much colder at night.”Severe cold day aheadAccording to the IMD, a severe cold day is declared in the plains when the minimum temperature is below 10°C and the maximum temperature goes more than 6.5°C below normal. Similar conditions are likely to continue in the coming days.However, minimum temperature is likely to rise gradually by two to four degrees in the next few days due to a fresh western disturbance around January 21, said Manmohan Singh. “Some rain can be expected in the city around the weekend and the system will be the strongest around Saturday. The maximum temperature is still likely to stay below normal, though the minimum temperature will rise during this period,” he said.In the next three days, the maximum temperature will remain between 13°C and 15°C, while the minimum will settle around 10-12°C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-colder-than-shimla-for-two-days-in-a-row-101642446588388.html

A clearer picture will be visible in a couple of weeks,” he said.State nodal officer for Covid, Dr Dhruva Chaudhary said in some districts including Gurugram and Rohtak, the infection growth rate seems to be stabilising.“Every district will have a different peak period depending on the point of time when the surge started. The next 10 days are crucial in terms of the number of people hospitalised because of Covid or complications associated with co-morbidities. Also, it’s time to look at patients with co-morbidities who are becoming infected but are reporting to the hospital because of worsening of primary diseases,” he said.12 more people succumb to CovidHaryana on Monday recorded 12 Covid-related deaths, the highest single-day spike in fatalities in the recent months and especially since the beginning of the third wave of the pandemic.According to the health bulletin, four people died in Karnal, two each in Gurugram and Yamunanagar, while Faridabad, Ambala, Kurukshetra and Fatehabad recorded one fatality each.

18-01-2022||Chandigarh||Congress undermined Mohali’s development: SAD candidate||Shiromani Akali Dal candidate Parvinder Singh Sohana has started door-to-door campaign in Mohali assembly segment to highlight public welfare and development works carried out by the party in its previous regimes in Punjab.Addressing voters on Monday, Sohana alleged that Mohali’s development that had taken place during the Akali rule was undermined during the present Congress regime owing to illegal occupations. He also listed the international airport, bus stand and beautiful roads as achievements of the previous Akali government. “SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal’s dream is to make Mohali more beautiful than Chandigarh,” he said. AAP gaining ground in Mohali: Kulwant Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) candidate Kulwant Singh said on Monday that the party is gaining ground in Mohali, as a large number of people from other parties, including the ruling Congress, are joining it.Kulwant Singh, who was speaking at Balongi village, said: I am thankful to the people of Balongi for extending their support and their love, which is making us stronger day by day.”The real estate baron and former mayor said his main aim is to save the people of Mohali from all problems that are hampering the city’s development.AAP, Akalis making hollow claims: Sidhu Three-time sitting MLA and Congress candidate Balbir Singh Sidhu on Monday inaugurated a party election office at Daidi village. Speaking on the occasion, he said that development is the party’s main election issue. Claiming that both Akalis and AAP were just making hollow claims, Sidhu said: “They had claimed to form their respective governments in the last elections as well, and now they are again making these claims.

I not only hope, but have full faith, that this time again the people of Punjab will ensure Congress win with a thumping majority.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/congress-undermined-mohali-s-development-sad-candidate-101642446584671.html
18-01-2022||Noida||Samajwadi Party fielding ‘criminal elements’, says UP CM during Ghaziabad visit||With campaigning by political parties for the upcoming assembly elections gaining momentum, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath trained his guns on Samajwadi Party (SP) on Monday and accused the rival party of giving tickets to “criminal elements” in western Uttar Pradesh. The chief minister was in Ghaziabad on Monday for a review of the Covid-19 situation. The first phase of the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections is scheduled to be held on February 10 and comprises 58 assembly segments in 11 districts, including Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar. Adityanath spoke at length about the work his government had done to combat the pandemic and lashed out at the SP in reply to a question posed by the media. “We all know that during the past five years, our government has cracked down hard and instilled fear among professional criminals and goonda elements and that gave a secure environment to people. The face of the SP has come to fore from Kairana to Bulandshahr, Siyana and Loni where they have fielded candidates involved in the exodus of Hindu traders from Kairana and even those who were behind the Muzaffarnagar riots besides professional history sheeters,” Adityanath said during a media briefing at Santosh Medical College, in response to a query on why SP was not issuing a list and only allotting symbols.Before the 2014 general elections, the riots in August and September of 2013 between Jats and Muslims in Muzaffarnagar had left 60 people dead and displaced nearly 50,000. In 2016, a few BJP leaders alleged that there was an exodus of Hindus from the Muslim-dominated town of Kairana in Shamli district. However, a five-member team of Hindu seers in June 2016 (during the Samajwadi Party government) contradicted the BJP’s claims of an exodus but said there was an atmosphere of fear in the town because of criminals.The issue of exodus was raised by BJP’s Kairana MP, late Hukum Singh, and his daughter Mriganka Singh is the BJP candidate from Kairana this time.Later, during the 2017 state assembly elections, the BJP banked heavily on the issue of rising crime in Uttar Pradesh and promised that it will crack down hard on criminal elements after coming to power. “By giving tickets to these criminal elements, the SP has brought to fore its actual character and its first list has proved it. With this, the party has proved that they are trying to project people who are against social justice, Dalits, the poor, backward classes, traders and the common man. They have not strayed from their inherent habits and such habits don’t improve easily,” Adityanath said. Adityanath’s attack on SP comes on the heels of several prominent OBC (other backward classes) leaders from the BJP jumping ship to the SP. They include former UP ministers Swami Prasad Maurya, Dharam Singh Saini and Dara Singh Chauhan, among others. Responding to Adityanath’s comments, the SP alleged that the chief minister has violated the model code of conduct. “The chief minister was on an official visit to Ghaziabad and should not have made political comments and it amounts to election campaigning. There are lot of people in the BJP with criminal records and the actual standing of the BJP will come to the fore after the first phase of elections. The SP will win the elections with a thumping majority,” said Rashid Malik, Ghaziabad president, Samajwadi Party. The SP has not filed any complaint in the matter as yet. District election officer, RK Singh, who is also district magistrate, did not respond to calls.In Ghaziabad, the BJP as well as the SP along with its ally the Rashtriya Lok Dal have fielded candidates from all five assembly segments of Loni, Muradnagar, Sahibabad, Ghaziabad and Modinagar. The BJP has fielded all five sitting MLAs in Ghaziabad as well as all three incumbent MLAs from seats of Noida, Jewar and Dadri in Gautam Budh Nagar.In 2017, the BJP assumed power in Uttar Pradesh after contesting on 384 seats and winning 312 seats. This led to ouster of the government of the Samajwadi Party which contested on 311 seats and won only on 47. “The BJP primarily won the previous elections on the issue of safety and security in the state. Adityanath in his address today tried to make people realise that his party was tougher on criminals than the previous governments and has brought the issue to the fore once again,” said KK Sharma, associate professor (history) at MM College, Modinagar.

18-01-2022||Other||Dolphins thrive at Ganga-Gomti confluence in Varanasi||The Gangetic Dolphins have increased in the river Ganga near Kaithi village in Varanasi district, the point where the river Gomti merges with the Ganga. This confluence of the Ganga and the Gomti is about 29 kilometers off Varanasi towards the east. Divisional forest officer, Varanasi, Mahavir Kaujalgi says, “As per a survey by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), there were 21 dolphins in Ganga stretch of Varanasi. Now, as per an assessment, dolphins have increased at the Ganga-Gomti confluence point and there should be 35 to 39 dolphins here at present.” “This Ganga-Gomti point provides ideal environment for dolphins due to the depth of the river here. The water is also clean at this point,” he said. “Rise in number of dolphins means that they consider this river stretch safe to live and breed,” he said. “Efforts to clean Ganga have also resulted in the river water being cleaner,” Kaujalgi said. “Efforts for conservation of Gangetic dolphins have also helped in creating a safer environment and thus the rise in the number of dolphins is a very positive development for biodiversity,” he said. Kaujalgi held a series of meetings with the locals in over a dozen villages, including Dakwa village in 2020 and 2021 (excluding Covid-19 period). Then, he apprised the locals about the importance of dolphins and encouraged them to make efforts for conservation of dolphins. He said locals have been asked to inform the officials of the forest department whenever they came across any incident of anyone trying to harm the dolphins. Kaujalgi said hunting of dolphins is banned on the Ganga and violators are liable for punishment. “During awareness drive we tell locals to protect the dolphins to stay happy and joyous as it would earn them the blessings of Maa Ganga. Increase in number of dolphins prove that the Ganga water has become clean as dolphins live only in clean water,” Kaujalgi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dolphins-thrive-at-ganga-gomti-confluence-in-varanasi-101642446221944.html
18-01-2022||Mumbai||City crosses 1 million mark as cases dip below 6,000||Mumbai The city continued to register a drop in daily Covid-19 cases, recording less than 6,000 cases for the first time in 16 days as it logged 5,956 fresh infections on Monday, according to official data. Mondays often see a dip in cases due to lower testing on weekends. The daily test positivity rate dipped to 12.51%, down from 13.7% the previous day.Government officials said they might consider easing the curbs if the Maharashtra capital continued to see a drop in daily infections but advised people against lowering their guard. “There is no doubt that the cases are going down and the hospitalisation rate is also going down, but we will have to monitor the situation till Wednesday. If the trend continues till then, we might put the city in the safe zone. But we will have to remain alert and take all necessary precautions,” additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said. The city also reported 12 deaths in the last 24 hours, taking the overall toll to 16,469. Experts said that genome sequencing should be scaled up in order to help them ascertain which variant is leading to deaths or critical ailment. Dr Madhav Satthe, former microbiology professor at Nair Hospital said, “We need to find out if it is Delta variant or Omicron variant that is causing deaths in critical patients. Hence, positive samples of patients on ventilators or ICU should be sent for genome sequencing.” Meanwhile, experts believe genome sequencing of critical patients should be done to ascertain which variant is leading to deaths or critical ailment. Dr Madhav Satthe, former microbiology professor at Nair Hospital said, “We need to find out if it is Delta variant or Omicron variant that is causing deaths in critical patients. Hence, positive samples of patients on ventilators or ICU should be sent for genome sequencing.” According to the state health department data, the city’s recovery rate is 93.04% with 935,302 recoveries and the mortality rate is 1.63%. There are 50,757 active cases in the city and four Omicron variant Covid-19 cases have been reported on Monday. Further, the hospitalisation rate in the city has come down from 21% (10 days ago) to 14.7% (on Monday). Out of the total 38,140 beds in the city, 5,628 are occupied. “We will continue to conduct around 50,000 to 60,000 tests in the city in the coming days to ensure that testing is not falling drastically in the city,” said Kakani. The city case tally had crossed the 0.5 million mark in April 2021 during the second wave and the 0.1 million mark in July 2020 during the first wave. Currently, the ongoing third wave started December 21, 2021, and is expected to settle down by the end of this month, according to BMC. In the city, overall, 14.6 million tests have been conducted and the overall positivity rate is 6.82%. Meanwhile, on the cases going down in the city, Dr Harish Chafle from Critical Care at Global Hospital in Parel said, “Usually, Wednesday is the day you rely upon and also if the trend of cases is to go down then it has to sustain for a week to say that it is truly going down Also, many are doing self-testing by rapid antigen test at home which would definitely alter the total cases reported daily.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/city-crosses-1-million-mark-as-cases-dip-below-6000-101642446104482.html

18-01-2022||Lucknow||In the name of dharma, saints take active interest in Uttar Pradesh assembly polls||Several organisations of sadhus (Hindu saints), either based in Kashi or other parts of eastern UP, are taking an active interest in the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls, looking to support those who they say worked in the interest of Sanatan Dharma (Hinduism), Indian culture and values.For instance, the Akhil Bharatiya Sant Samiti, one such organisation of sadhus, is holding a series of sant sammelans (conference of saints) at various pilgrim centres. Similarly, Baba Balakdas, mahamandaleshwar (abbot) of the Patalpuri Math of Kashi, has appealed to his disciples to support that party which has worked for protecting the Sanatan Dharma.Then there is Ram Panth chief Dr Rajiv, also known as “Sri Guru Ji”, who has launched a drive among tribals to connect them with the idea of realising Ram Rajya in the true sense.He has held meetings with the tribals of the Musahar community in Sonbhadra in eastern UP in the recent past. Explaining the inter-play of ascetism and politics, he says, “For the last many decades, saints detached themselves from politics in India due to which idealism gradually disappeared from politics, and politics became too polluted. Politics needs to be purified now. Therefore, several sadhus and maths have started guiding politics in the country. It is the need of the hour.”“We worship Lord Ram and follow his ideals. Lord Ram had completed his education under the great sages like Maharishi Vashishtha and Vishwamitra. Maharshi Vashishta had taught him values, ideals, righteousness, sanskars and Brahmarishi Vishwamitra gave him the knowledge of celestial weaponry and politics with idealism. Lord Ram followed all the teachings by his gurus during his rule. His rule is called Ram Rajya. Ram Rajya is an ideal of good governance and inclusive politics. Ram Rajya is the best model of good governance and inclusive politics because it was guided by sages and saints. It means sadhus and sages used to play a significant role in politics,” he says.“In 2022, naturally, sadhus like me will support the people with whose efforts a grand temple of Lord Ram is being built in Ayodhya and who have built a grand Kashi Vishwanath Corridor, both centres of Sanatan Dharma,” he adds.He has already appealed to his over 10,000 followers for the same. Ram Panth is promoting inclusive politics and working to eliminate casteism, he claims. Baba Balakdas appears to have a clear inclination towards the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.“We are not going to support such political parties which used saints as a tool to win the support of our followers for political gains and the parties which ignored the advice given by saints for the cause of Sanatan Dharma. We will support that party, which while in power, paved the way for constructing the grand Ram temple in Ayodhya and built a grand and divine Kashi Vishwanath Corridor here. Our support is for the party which works for protection of sadhus and Sanatan Dharma and takes care of their interests.”Although Baba Balakdas says he has nothing to do with politics, he has appealed to his disciples and followers of Sanatan Dharma to take care of the party and people who took care of the interests of sadhus, saints, the Ganga and cows. For its part, the Akhil Bharatiya Sant Samiti, in association with the Akhada Parishad, has already started organising conferences of saints across the state. The first conference was held at Naimisharanya, a pilgrim centre in Sitapur district, on January 11. Swami Jeetendrananda Saraswati, general secretary of the Samiti, says, “We have planned a series of sant sammelans to expose those who are criticising Hindus and Hindutva. The first Sant Sammelan has already been held at Naimisharanya.”More such conferences will be held in Kashi (Varanasi), Prayagraj, Ayodhya, Chitrakoot, Bithoor, Vrindavan, Shukratal, Brajghat, Garhmukteshwar, Kachla, Soron, Deoria, Orchha and Vindhyachal in UP. “We want to tell such politicians to not attack Hindutva and Hindus for their politics. Such pseudo-socialists and leaders who are continuously making unrestrained statements on Hindus and their traditions will be exposed through the sant sammelans followed by drives in the villages,” he adds. After the sammelans, the saints will go to their respective areas and hold meetings with the villagers to expose the critics of Hindus and Hindutva on various platforms, he adds.The saints will also give a message to work for cleaning the Ganga and cow protection. They will also apprise the people of the grandeur of Kashi Vishwanath Corridor. The temple that is coming up in Ayodhya will also be part of the discussion. He says the saints will hold meetings with locals and discuss the people who are working for Sanatan Dharma, spreading Indian culture and values. Naturally, saints will give their blessings to such people, he adds. Several other saints are also active in their own way. Ashwani Pandey, a resident of Pandeypur area in Varanasi, says, “This is not a new trend in Kashi. Several saints used to take keen interest in politics and used to extend support to the political party of their liking from behind the scenes earlier too. But this time, many saints are openly supporting the BJP.”Political analyst Prof Kaushal Kishore Mishra says, “A grand temple of Lord Ram is being built in Ayodhya, which each and every sadhu and saint wanted for a long time. Their dream has come true during the tenure of the present government. In addition, the grand Kashi Vishwanath Corridor has also been built and the Vindhayachal Corridor is being constructed. Rejuvenation and beautification of various other pilgrim centres have been done. So, many of them are frankly supporting the BJP.”

Of the 38 cities that submitted a pedestrian-friendly proposal, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs announced the top 11 award winners, which include Gurugram, in an online programme on Monday.On March 20 last year, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) had attempted to turn a 600-metre stretch of the main Sadar Bazar market, between Jama Masjid and old post office, into a pedestrian-friendly one. The vehicle-free trial was meant to last for a week, however, heavy protests by shopkeepers led to the MCG making major changes in the trial. Within an hour of the trial, the MCG had reversed its main standout point -- preventing the entry of vehicles into the market area.Despite the trial’s failure, the MCG’s pedestrian-friendly concept for Sadar Bazar market and the adjacent government school area helped Gurugram win the first phase of the challenge, along with the cities such as Kohima, Kochi, Bengaluru, Nagpur, Pune, and Udaipur.“The focus of the challenge was to come up with a proposal, and later, implement it on ground. The success of the implementation was not a primary factor. It was largely limited to the conceptualising of it. Hence, Gurugram was included in the list of awardees despite the trial being unsuccessful,” said a senior MCG official.The MCG additional commissioner, Dr Vaishali Sharma, said that the challenge is aligned with the National Transport Policy 2006 and for this, the civic body conducted a transformation trial of the entire 21 hectares commercial space of Sadar Bazar area by fully pedestrianising the main 600-metre road of the market.The Streets4People Challenge was launched by the central government in 2020. The criteria for the challenge includes formulating designs that can be executed in quick time, are cost-efficient, and address key pedestrian-friendly parameters such as adequate space, safety, comfort, while keeping localised needs in mind.Sharma said that Sadar Bazar, purely a commercial area where 95% of the customers can reach on foot, but only 15 to 20% of the road space is available for them, as it is filled with haphazard parking and vehicular traffic.“The complete pedestrianisation of the market will provide customers with a safer and comfortable shopping experience, along with the provision of seating, lighting, and venue for hosting cultural activities. Our main objective is to redevelop the main road of Sadar Bazar by making it walkable,” said Sharma.MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja said that the civic body will further participate in the second phase of the challenge, which focuses on expanding the idea across the city, with permanent implementation and sustained stakeholder participation.However, Bablu Gupta, president, Sadar Bazar Vyapar Mandal, said that giving the award to Gurugram for Sadar Bazar pedestrian-friendly trial is a complete mistake on behalf of the central government.“The MCG’s trial was a mere eyewash. They only placed some barricades at entry and exit points, placed a few benches, set up some streetlights, and painted footmarks on road. This does not warrant an award,” said Gupta.Road safety experts said that replicating a similar concept in other parts of the city cannot be done, as the design of Sadar Bazar is one of its kind in Gurugram. “Instead, using the learnings from the trial, MCG can transform a few streets across the city by integrating pedestrian-friendly measures such as cycle tracks, footpaths along popular public spaces and ensuring equitable share is provided to all road users,” said Sarika Panda Bhatt, a city-based urban planner and road safety expert.

18-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi schools hope to hold exams offline||With the continued closure of schools amid the pandemic, school administrations said they’d hold online assessments for students in junior classes but were still hoping to hold in-person exams for students in senior classes (9-12) by March. Many schools are of the view that they could reopen for classes 9-11 gradually by February-March if curbs are lifted amid a decline in Covid cases. Sudha Acharya, chairperson of the National Progressive School Conference (NPSC), a consortium of 122 Delhi schools, including Sardar Patel Vidyalaya, Bal Bharati Public School, Springdales School, Sanskriti School, Delhi Public Schools, Ahlcon International School, and Amity International School, said that while assessments for students in Class 8 and below could be conducted online, schools were still hopeful of holding in-person exams for students in senior classes. “For students in classes 9 to 12, we will not hold online exams. We will wait for the Covid situation to improve. We think that the situation might improve by February-end, and we will be able to reopen schools and conduct exams offline,” said Acharya, who is also the principal of ITL Public School. She said that the school was keeping all possibilities in mind, but would prefer holding offline exams. Acharya said that while online classes were taking place, the school would focus on the completion of practical exams and revision of the syllabus as and when schools reopened. “Physical classes cannot be replaced. The World Bank, WHO, and other global experts have said that schools should not remain closed, but we are not learning from global practices,” she said. Tanya Joshi, principal of Indian School, said that while the school’s decision would depend on the evolving Covid situation, it aimed to conduct classes for students in classes 10 and 12 in March. Joshi said that the experience from the CBSE Term 1 examination had shown them that students needed to work on various fronts. “Students are not ready. We saw the challenges that arose during the first term and need to resolve them,” said Joshi. While outlining the learning gap and the changing nature of the teaching-learning process due to the pandemic, Joshi said that a sense of fatigue was bogging down stakeholders. “Now, parents themselves are asking us to ensure that their child attends classes attentively while keeping the web camera on. They can sense that the children’s interest levels are waning with time,” said Joshi. Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in Rohini, said that the school was hopeful that it would be able to conduct end of term exams offline by the end of February or beginning of March. “We are confident that we will be able to hold exams offline as the situation continues to improve. The assessment and subsequent doubt clearing sessions that take place offline are extremely crucial,” said Arora. She said that it was crucial for schools to reopen to bridge the learning gap, which had widened in the past few years. “We will not be able to fulfil the gap if schools don’t reopen now. For two years, learning has been taking place remotely and its impact will be far-reaching. Even parents are beginning to understand that schools need to reopen,” said Arora.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-schools-hope-to-hold-exams-offline-101642445561496.html
18-01-2022||Gurugram||Leachate from Bandhwari site forming ponds in Aravallis: Green activists||Environmentalists on Monday alleged that leachate from the Bandhwari landfill had formed ponds in the Aravalli forest area over the past few weeks, posing an environment hazard and a threat to the wildlife in the area. They said small mining pits in the area were also found to be filled with leachate. When contacted, the concessionaire looking after the Bandhwari plant said they are looking into the matter.Sunil Harsana,a resident of Mangar village, which in the vicinity of the landfill, said, “There are at least three leachate ponds in this area that were formed in the past six months and leachate is also being discharged into old mining pits near the Bandhwari village. This area, which is a continuation of the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary, has frequent wildlife movement and studies have found the presence of leopards, jackals, nilgai and smaller mammals here.The leachate is destroying the natural watering holes of these animals.”On visiting the spot on Saturday, HT found a dark oily liquid flowing on to on the road nearby the landfill, where around 1,800 tonnes of waste is dumped daily from from Gurugram and Faridabad. The landfill also has about 2.5 million tonnes of legacy waste, according to environmentalists and Municipal Corporation of Gurugram.Vaishali Rana, a city-based environmentalist, who has been raising this issue of leachate with the authorities, said, “We have reported at least eight times in the past three years about leachate being discharged into the surrounding Aravalli forests, which is a crucial wildlife movement area. This has become a regular affair by the authorities concerned, thereby destroying the sensitive wildlife habitat and the Aravalli forests. Last year, the pollution control board had tested samples from these ponds and found high levels of toxins in it, but no action has been taken till now.” A report released by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board in August last year found that the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), zinc, chloride, fluoride were all found to be significantly higher than permissible norms, indicating heavy level of contamination. During Saturday’s visit, the HT team also spotted droppings, believed to be that of nilgai, at four to five spots near the leachate pond, as well as pug marks of what appeared to be golden jackal, indicating a healthy wildlife movement in the area. Residents said an animal carcass was also sighted last week near the leachate pond, which is situated around 200m inside the forest from the Gurugram-Faridabad highway. Jyoti Raghavan, a member of Aravalli Bachao citizens movement, working for the protection of the Aravalli forests, said, “Pools of leachate created in the forest are a huge threat to the wildlife that roam around the jungles. A survey of the Aravalli forests of Gurugram, Faridabad and Delhi, conducted in 2019 by the Centre for Ecology Development and Research (CEDAR) revealed that these forests are home to a rich diversity of wildlife especially rare native species such as honey badger, Indian fox, ruddy mongoose, hyena, and grey langur, among others. Wild animals as well as cattle from nearby villages have been dying after drinking the poisoned water. The ground water in the region is also getting contaminated by to leachate.” Meanwhile, officials of Ecogreen Energy, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram’s concessionaire for waste management at the Bandhwari landfill, said that rainwater mixed with leachate spilt outside the landfill and accumulated.Sanjeev Sharma, the spokesperson for Ecogreen Energy, said, “A wall that is being built by the MCG on the outskirts of the landfill had breached due to rain last week because of which rainwater mixed with leachate spilt outside and got accumulated. The work for the wall got delayed due to extreme weather, but we are helping them and the water is being cleared out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/leachate-from-bandhwari-site-forming-ponds-in-aravallis-green-activists-101642445441754.html
18-01-2022||Delhi||Timer, RDX used in bomb found in Ghazipur, NSG tells Delhi Police||The improvised explosive device (IED) found at Ghazipur wholesale flower market last Friday was destroyed just one and half hours before it could go off, according to the reading on the a time device attached to it, the National Security Guard (NSG) has said in a forensic examination report submitted to the Delhi Police, officials aware of the matter said on Monday.The bomb experts from the elite force destroyed the explosive device in a controlled explosion at the market by burying it in a pit, and collected samples of explosives from the site for examination.According to the officials, the IED found in an unclaimed bag at the entrance of the flower market contained RDX and ammonium nitrate apart from the timer device, NSG said in its report.The NSG on Friday indicated to the presence of RDX, ammonium nitrate and shrapnels in the IED that was stuffed inside a steel tiffin, and kept in a black bag. It was spotted around 10am outside gate number 1 of the market by a shopper. There were 4,000 to 5,000 people inside the market when the explosives were found.Delhi Police investigators have said that the black bag, which contained the bomb, did not have any identification marks such as the manufacturing company’s tag or sticker.“Investigators were hoping to get some clues from the bag, as the manufacturing company’s tag found in a laptop bag containing the low-intensity IED that had exploded at Rohini courtroom on December 9 last year helped the investigating team identify the suspect and crack the case. However, in the Ghazipur IED case, the bag did not have any identification marks,” said a police officer associated with the probe.On Sunday, the police said that Mujahideen Ghazwat-ul-Hind (MGH), an al Qaeda-affiliated terrorist group active in Kashmir, has claimed responsibility for planting the IED at the Ghazipur market. They said the group made the claim on a Telegram group, where it also claimed that “the IED did not explode due to technical glitches”. The Telegram message was spotted by the central agencies during the social media monitoring, and the information was shared with the Delhi Police special cell, a second police officer said.“Our special cell sleuths are trying to ascertain the source of that Telegram message and establish the authenticity of the claim. It’s a tedious task because the message came through an encrypted channel,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/timer-rdx-used-in-bomb-found-in-ghazipur-nsg-tells-delhi-police-101642445381975.html

According to Bharadwaj, he does not know the amount lost in the fraud. Management officials of the company did not comment on the matter yet. Elamaran G, additional deputy commissioner of police, Noida Central, said that a case has been registered against unidentified persons under Indian Penal Code (IPC) Section 420 (cheating) and Section 66 of the IT Act. “The case needs technical expertise for investigation. The cyber cell is investigating the matter. We are also seeking help from external investigators in the case,” he said. Anuj Agarwal, cyber and privacy law expert, said that people should deal in cryptocurrencies only if they have proper knowledge in this field. “The investors should also have a computer system with anti-virus software to make it hack proof. The cryptocurrencies do not have any serial number... and there is no centralised agency to regulate those. The stolen cryptocurrencies can be reclaimed, but it is technically a difficult task,” he said.At present, there is no particular law in India, which prohibits or allows trading in cryptocurrency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-it-company-s-cryptocurrency-account-hacked-case-filed-101642445263039.html
18-01-2022||Mumbai||Maha to SC: Recall order de-notifying OBC seats||Mumbai: A month after the Supreme Court ordered the state election commission (SEC) to re-notify the seats reserved for Other Backward Class (OBC) candidates in local bodies as general category seats, the Maharashtra government on Monday filed an interim application in the apex court asking it to recall its December 15 order. The bench comprising justices A M Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheswari and C T Ravikumar informed senior advocate Shekhar Naphade, who appeared in the matter on behalf of the state government that the matter would be taken up for consideration on January 19.The top court had ordered the SEC to re-notify the seats reserved for OBC candidates in the local bodies as general category seats following which, on December 21, elections were held in the district councils of Bhandara and Gondia, 105 nagar panchayats across various other districts and bypolls were conducted in 4,500 gram panchayats — all as general category seats.The SC was scheduled to hear a clutch of petitions on the issue of OBC quota for political reservations on Monday, but Maharashtra’s fresh application led to the hearing being pushed to January 19. The state government has already requested the SC to postpone upcoming local body polls — scheduled to be held between February and April 2022 — by some months and promised to submit fresh empirical data on OBC communities within three months. As many as 15 out of 27 municipal corporations, 25 out of 34 district councils and more than 320 municipal councils and nagar panchyats are due for elections in the next three months. This is slated to take place across Maharashtra, including in cities like Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Nagpur, and Aurangabad.“Election to 34 out of 37 zIlla parishads, 313 out of 351 panchayat samitis and 9000 village panchayats are due up to March 2022. The OBC candidates will not get representation in the local bodies in the state for the next five years,” the state said in its application. Food and civil supplies minister and OBC leader Chhagan Bhujbal, said the state made recall application and the court would take up the matter on Wednesday as “the court did not get the copy of the application” which was filed electronically.The court directed the state counsel to also supply a copy of the application to the poll panel, which is yet to announce the polling schedule for the local body elections scheduled to start next month.“The Centre’s application supports our stand, though it is actually related to the SC ruling on local body polls in Madya Pradesh. We have also assured the top court to provide the data on OBC communities in three months. [On Wednesday] we will also argue that the polls be postponed due to the rising Covid-19 cases in the state,” a senior government official who did not wish to be named, said. The decision to file the recall application was taken after the Centre moved one on December 26, the official said. The Centre’s recall application suggested that the bodies be governed by administrators as a stop gap arrangement. “Any intervention at this stage would deprive the OBC representatives for five long years, which is not a short period,” it stated.On December 17, the SC had asked the Madhya Pradesh SEC to re-notify the OBC-reserved seats (27% of all seats) to general category in its upcoming panchayat polls. The MP government filed an application to recall this order, following which, in the last week of December, the Central government filed an application seeking suspension of local body polls in MP for four months.The SC has been dealing with the issue of political reservation in Maharashtra since the start of 2021. In March, it ordered Maharashtra to conduct a rigorous empirical survey to ascertain the exact nature of the socio-economic backwardness of OBC communities before deciding on the quantum of reservation. It said that the legal provisions in place failed the triple test of reservation — one of which is that it exceeded the 50% ceiling on reservation when taken together with other constitutionally-mandated reservations to persons from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.In December, it struck down an Ordinance, promulgated by the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in September, which granted up to 27% political reservation to OBC communities. The state passed the Ordinance after the top court’s March ruling, which had also struck down provisions in a state law which governed local body elections and granted full 27% reservation to OBC candidates. “In other words, the SEC must immediately issue a fresh notification for the 27 per cent seats reserved for OBCs as general category seats and initiate the election process for these seats along with the election process already on its way for the remaining 73 per cent of seats in the concerned local bodies,” the apex court said in its December order.Following the SC’s March ruling, in June 2021, the state constituted a 10-member State Backward Class Commission and in its winter session in December, the state cabinet presented a supplementary demand of ₹435 crore to conduct the survey. Members of the Commission met last week to finalize the questionnaire that would be used to collect relevant information. “We will map the proportion of OBCs in the population,” Govind Kale, a member of the Commission, had said last week, and added that the survey would be completed by April-end, contingent on the pandemic. “We can submit the interim data. A complete report may take a few more months. The state government wasted too much time since June, first asking the Centre for data and then to release the funds required [for our survey]. The SBCC is however firm on its stand that it would not compromise on authenticity and accountability of the report. We do no want to face any strictures by the courts like the ones passed against the earlier report by the Commission on Maratha reservation,” another member of the Commission, who did not wish to be named, said.Former state minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule, who is a senior OBC leader from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said that the state should have filed its application earlier. “The recall application made on Monday could have been done earlier. The Maharashtra government is not serious over the issue of reservation to OBCs. The state BJP unit and even the Centre has been supporting the state government’s stand of availing empirical data within three months, but we expect it to be honest in its intention,” he said.Sachin Rajurkar, general secretary, national OBC federation, said that Central government’s intervention was key. “Even if the SC admitted to hold the elections with OBC quota or even if the quota is restored after the submission of empirical data, it would still be up to 27% and not completely 27%. The Centre has moved the SC with its own recall application. We urge it to make the necessary amendment in article 243 (T) and (D) [of the Indian Constitution] to make way for OBC reservation,” he said.
18-01-2022||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: GRP asked to expedite disposal of unclaimed vehicles||A local court has directed the Government Railway Police (GRP) to immediately submit the list of unclaimed vehicles which have been lying in the backyard of the police station for many years and expedite their disposal.Harsimranjit Singh, additional chief judicial magistrate, Ludhiana, while writing to the station house officers of , GRP and Division 5 police station, cited an order passed by the Punjab and Haryana high court dated November 22, 2021. HC had issued directions to constitute a committee in each sessions division for disposal of unclaimed vehicles lying in the police stations for more than one year as of November 1,2021.The railway police are currently in custody of 165 unclaimed vehicles, of which 110 will be auctioned, including four cars, 42 scooters, four auto rickshaws and 60 motorcycles. The auction was supposed to be held in October, but due to a strike of the ministerial staff, the meeting of the committee was postponed.Reserve Price fixedAfter receiving the court order, a five-member committee comprising the GRP deputy superintendent of police, an inspector, the work manager of Punjab Roadways, an official from the district transport office and another transport official on Monday fixed the reserve/base price of each vehicle to be auctioned.According to the officials, the base price of two cars have been fixed at ₹18,000 each, and the other two for ₹12,000 and 19,000, considering their model and condition.For three autos, it has been fixed at ₹12,000 each, and for one at ₹13,000.Also, the reserve price for two bullet motorcycles is ₹20,000 and for two Bajaj bikes, it is ₹7,000.

As many as eight Covid-19 deaths have been reported in the district this month so far. Health officials said that two fully vaccinated male Covid-19 patients -- one was 60-year-old and the other 80-year-old -- died due to comorbidities. Dr Jai Prakash, district surveillance officer, said, “Both these patients were undergoing treatment at private hospitals where they tested positive for Covid-19. The 60-year-old male was suffering from chronic liver disease, while the 80-year-old was a chronic hypertensive patient. The district at present has 284 patients hospitalised, including non-residents of Gurugram, of which 16 are in ICU and 22 on ventilator.” On Monday, the active case tally reached 22,118, of which 154 patients are hospitalised in the district and the rest are in home isolation. According to the official data, 2,457 people also recovered in the district. On Monday, the health department collected 12,083 samples for testing. With cases increasing, the district health department has increased testing and are also using mobile testing vans in public places with heavy footfall. A mobile testing van was sent to Sadar Bazar on Monday for random testing of people. On Monday, Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, also visited three urban primary health centres in the city and inspected the Covid-19 management system and vaccination process. The CMO also directed officials to visit different health centres so that issues faced by citizens and health care workers can be resolved at the earliest. He also conducted a meeting with health care workers managing patients under home isolation. The workers apprised him that many resident welfare associations (RWAs) do not let them enter the housing societies due to which they face problems in home visits of patients and are unable to provide home isolation kits. “I appeal to all the RWAs in Gurugram to allow the health workers and home isolation teams to examine all those patients who are in isolation, by checking their identity cards,” said Yadav. From Tuesday onwards, the district health department will start vaccination for children falling under the category of persons without identification . A total of 300 slots are available for this category and three vaccinations sites would be set up under primary health centres of Badshahpur, Laxman Vihar and Palra. On Monday, a total of 14,861 doses were administered, including 5,817 first doses, 7,321 second doses and 1,723 precautionary doses. With this, over 4.65 million doses have been administered in the district till now. On Monday, 2,100 children were vaccinated in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugram-reports-two-covid-19-deaths-over-3-400-fresh-cases-101642444904489.html
18-01-2022||Delhi||Finalise demolition plan in two weeks, Supreme Court tells Supertech||The Supreme Court on Monday fast-tracked the demolition of Supertech’s 40-storey twin towers at Noida’s Emerald Court project by directing the real estate builder to ensure all formalities for beginning the demolition of the towers is completed within two weeks. The apex court declared the towers illegal on August 31, 2021, and set a deadline of three months to demolish them.The order came on a day when the Noida Authority informed the Supreme Court that the Central Building Research Institute (CBRI), Roorkee, the agency engaged as an expert by Noida authority to oversee the process, on January 14 approved the demolition plan submitted by Edifice Engineering, a firm suggested by Supertech.According to this plan mentioned in the Supertech’s affidavit, Edifice will carry out the demolition in three months, remove debris in another three months and conclude the entire process in less than seven months.However, Supertech told the top court on Monday that the contract cannot be signed with Edifice without receiving no objection certificate (NOC) from various government bodies, including permit to store explosives needed for demolition.A bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant said, “Irrespective of NOCs, the contract should commence….We direct that the contract (with Edifice) be executed within a week.” The court posted the matter after two weeks informing the builder to comply with all formalities (of NOCs) by then.Senior advocate Ravindra Kumar, who represented the Noida authority, told the court that the timeline for demolition kicks in from the date of signing of contract, and Supertech cannot be permitted to delay signing of contract for need of NOCs. Even the bench agreed and said, “You (Supertech) will get NOC within a week. The demolition is as per the Supreme Court judgment.”On January 12, the court took serious exception to its order not being complied with by Supertech as neither had the demolition process been finalized nor the residents who invested in the two towers got their refunds, as ordered on August 31. The court said, “We are going to send your directors to jail. You are playing truant with the Supreme Court.”Senior advocate S Ganesh, appearing for Supertech, told the court that calculations of refund were made and cheques prepared. He was willing to transfer the amounts digitally to the bank accounts of the buyers. However, amicus curiae Gaurav Agrawal prepared a note showing stark difference in the amounts calculated by him and those prepared by Supertech for paying homebuyers.The homebuyers represented by advocate Abraham Mathews requested the court to allow the cheques prepared by Supertech to be encashed while reserving their right to get additional payment. The court accepted the request and said, “The cheques (presented by Supertech) can be encashed by homebuyers subject to further proceedings.”Some of the homebuyers complained to court that the builder was not heeding to their requests for repayment as they had not filed contempt petitions against the real estate company in the top court. The bench decided to hear the contempt petitions on Friday in order to settle the payment dues.Over 250 homebuyers sought refund of their money invested in the two towers having 915 flats of which 633 were booked. The order to demolish the towers came on a petition moved by the Emerald Court Owner Resident Welfare Association for reclaiming the green space earmarked in the original plan. The court noted the connivance between the builder and Noida authority that allowed further construction of these towers in violation of the 16 metre minimum distance norm between two towers as per the National Building Code 2005.After the judgment, Supertech came with a proposal to slice one of its towers, but the application was dismissed by the top court on October 4. Supertech has subsequently filed a review petition against the August 31 ruling that is yet to be heard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/finalise-demolition-plan-in-two-weeks-supreme-court-tells-supertech-101642444903232.html
18-01-2022||Pune||Pune consumer commission directs telecom operator to pay ₹1.50 lakh to consumer||Pune: The Pune District Consumer Redressal Commission has directed telecom operator Tata Teleservices Ltd to pay to the complainant Rs.1.50 lakh by way of compensation towards physical and mental agony and financial loss. The complainant identified as advocate Siddhartha Sharma in his complaint had sought relief that Tata Teleservices be directed to pay compensation of ₹5 lakh to him for the damages suffered by him for the unsolicited telemarketing calls made by the company for four years. The forum in its order stated “The company must severally and jointly shall pay to the complainant an amount of ₹1.50 lakh as compensation towards physical and mental agony and financial loss. It shall jointly pay to the complainant ₹30,000 by way of costs of complaint. The opposite parties are hereby directed to comply with foregoing order within a period of six weeks from the receipt of this order failing which the opposite parties shall also be liable to pay to the complainant interest at 9% per year, on the entire awarded amounts as per forgoing order as from the date of expiry of stipulated period of six weeks till the realisation of the amount by the complainant.” Advocate Sharma had sought relief that the company be directed to pay compensation of ₹5 lakh, for the damages suffered by him for the unsolicited telemarketing calls made by the opposite parties for four years. The second prayer of Sharma was that the company be directed to pay him a compensation of ₹5lakh for damages suffered by him for illegal deactivation of his SIM card by the company for the mala-fide and vindictive purpose. Sharma also sought relief that the company be directed to pay him ₹5 lakh towards compensation for the damages suffered by him for poor, degrading and no network connectivity. Besides compensation of ₹2 lakh for damages suffered by him for unfair and illegal balance deductions from the SIM card of the complainant. The complainant was a subscriber with the mobile firm from 2012 to November 2016. The company denied allegations mentioned in the complaint against them. According to the company, the present complaint is barred by limitation and the complainant has mixed many separate and different causes of action. The complainant has grievances about the telemarketing calls which at no length of imagination can get covered under “deficiency of service” and “unfair trade practice”. The complainant can allege that he suffered mental agony due to such clauses but for that, the complainant needs to approach TRAI or civil court and not consumer forum. The claim of the complainant relates to August 2014 as it alleges that the SIM was deactivated on August 14, 2014 and the complaint regarding the same is made 2017 which is admittedly barred by law of limitation. After perusal of the contents there is allegation of illegal balance deductions from the main account of the complainant in 2012 but after the complainant made complaints, the same were refunded. The said submission of the complainant itself suggests two things, firstly, the claim is time barred as it relates to 2012 and for the same it is again asking for compensation which is again exclusive domain of the civil court and not consumer forum. Secondly, without prejudice to the above contents the cause of action does not survive as the balance was refunded immediately, the company stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-consumer-commission-directs-telecom-operator-to-pay-rs-1-50-lakh-to-consumer-101642444841565.html
18-01-2022||Mumbai||BMC, BPCL set up 2 oxygen refilling plant||Mumbai Amid surging Covid-19 cases, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Monday started two oxygen refilling plants at Mahalaxmi Race Course and Mahul. During the second wave between April and June last year, Mumbai faced an acute shortage of medical oxygen.The oxygen refilling plants have been set up as part of joint efforts between the BMC and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL). The BMC said that BPCL will supply the oxygen on a chargeable basis.Inaugurating the plants via video conferencing, the state environment minister, Aaditya Thackeray, said that BMC is the first civic body in India to have its own oxygen refilling plant.P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects), said that these new oxygen filling plants will be cost-effective, saving ₹1.5-2 crore for BMC every year. As many as 112 oxygen cylinders could be filled at a time at the Mahul plant.“During the second wave we were heavily dependent on private suppliers and other municipal corporations were getting priority over the BMC as these plants and the suppliers were based in their area. It was necessary for us to have our own oxygen plants and minimise dependency on private vendors,” said Velrasu.The BMC also said that the pressure of oxygen filling has been increased to 150kg/cm² from 1.5kg/cm². The Mahul plant has been built over an area of over 850 square meters and is equipped to fill 1,500 jumbo cylinders per day, while the Mahalaxmi plant can refill 100-150 dura cylinders per day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-bpcl-set-up-2-oxygen-refilling-plant-101642444607562.html
18-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi civic bodies say they spent ₹11,750 crore on sanitation over last 5 years||The three municipal corporations of Delhi have spent over ₹11,750 crore on sanitation and cleaning services in the Capital over the last five years, said the three civic bodies in an official reply to a question in the Delhi Assembly.The data submitted by the respective departments of environment management services (sanitation departments) claims that the South MCD spent ₹6,284.6 crore, the North MCD spent ₹4,998.12 crore, while the East corporation spent ₹476.6 crore on refuse removal, cleaning of drains and other cleaning operations from 2016-17 to 2020-21. While the three civic bodies continue to fare poorly in the sanitation markers and annual Swachh Surveskhan (cleanliness survey) rankings, the last five-year period witnessed heavy mechanisation of the garbage collection mechanism with the introduction of fixed/mobile compactors, auto-tippers and loaders as garbage transportation was outsourced to private concessionaires at the zonal level.Of the 48 assessed urban local bodies in Swachh Survekshan 2021, two of the three municipal corporations in Delhi finished in the bottom 10. The rankings declared in November last year show that the East MCD ranked 40th, South MCD 31st and North MCD 45th--fourth-last from the bottom.In the 2020 survey, the East, South and North corporations were ranked 46th, 31st and 43rd, respectively. The civic bodies oversee the housekeeping work of 272 municipal wards that house around 96% of the Capital’s population.A break-up of the expenditure shows that a large component of the expenditure on sanitation is spent on refuse removal, salaries and motor workshops or transportation vehicles. In the case of North corporation, for instance, ₹4,768 crore was spent on the DEMS department, ₹119 crore on refuse removal, ₹66.5 crore on motor workshop and ₹7.6 crore on compost plans during this period. The civic body also procured 26 tipper trucks each at a cost of ₹20.31 lakh for the Narela zone.The East civic body bought 20 trucks and a loader for its fleet. However, the data does not include details of the vehicles deployed by private concessionaires. A senior municipal official from the sanitation department said that the cost should be taken into context. “We are talking about daily collection and transportation of over 12,350 tonnes of municipal solid waste every day. The overall cost should be seen in terms of managing waste for a city with a population of over 20 million and severe space constraints,” the official said, requesting anonymity.Currently, around 85% of the city’s garbage is collected by municipal corporations and much of it — 55% — ends up in the three overexploited landfills in Okhla, Ghazipur and Bhalswa.Experts argue that the focus on municipal sanitation expenditure should shift from garbage transportation incentivisation to decentralised systems, resource recovery and segregation.Chitra Mukherjee, a consultant on circular economy and sustainable livelihood said Delhi’s civic bodies continue to collect unsegregated waste from households and dump it in open dumpyards mostly within the city.“Waste recycling and resource recovery are not prioritised even though 15-20% of the waste can be recovered. Three-fourths of the municipal budget goes to collection and transportation, leaving very little for resource recovery and disposal. Processing waste rather than landfilling is the solution. Delhi relies on a largely informal sector of waste pickers to collect, segregate and recycle waste. Yet they remain unacknowledged and unrewarded,” she said.Mukherjee added that civic bodies need to follow Solid Waste Management Rules. Waste segregation, decentralised treatment and incorporation of the informal sector in waste collection have also been mandated in the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 and Delhi bye-laws but their implementation has been an uphill task.Mayor of East corporation Shyam Sunder Aggarwal said that bio-mining of landfill sites, the introduction of fixed/mobile compactors and closing of dhalaos (garbage receptacle points) have been the key achievements of the civic body.“We are also operating 40 sprinklers for pollution control and 10 mechanical road sweepers for dust control on PWD roads. Money spent should be put in context. EDMC areas alone have a population of 8 million, with some wards housing over 120,000 inhabitants,” he said.Aggarwal said the East corporation has also started the door-to-door collection of garbage through private concessionaires last year. “During cleanliness surveys, we are compared to cities with a population of 1 million, but our challenges and scale are entirely different. Delhi does not have the luxury of space for waste management and our population is at a different scale,” he said.With the addition of Shahadra South and North zones, nine out of 12 administrative zones now have private concessionaires handing waste collection while the North MCD is also in the middle of the process of covering the three remaining zones-- Narela, Karol Bagh and City Sadar-Paharganj--under a similar system.Leader of the Opposition in the North corporation Vikas Goyal said that sanitation is the primary job of the corporation and it has been a complete failure.“We have mounds of garbage at all entry points of the city, our lanes are not cleaned on time, the workers are not paid salaries on time, and the MCD has failed in its primary role. While the population of city has expanded, no new posts for sanitation staff have been created in the last two decades. A large chunk of funds are wasted in corruption,” he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-civic-bodies-say-they-spent-11-750-crore-on-sanitation-over-last-5-years-101642444605415.html
18-01-2022||Delhi||Marital rape: HC seeks to know precedence of courts striking down a statute||The Delhi high court on Monday, while hearing a clutch of petitions seeking to criminalise marital rape, sought to know from the amicus curiae whether there was any precedence of a constitutional court striking down a statute, especially a criminal offence, so that it could look up some guidelines while deciding on the matter.A bench of justices Rajiv Shakdher and C Hari Shankar told the amicus curiae senior advocate Rajshekhar Rao, “…till today there has not been even a single argument, except in your arguments to some extent, or the judgments of the Supreme Court which lay down principles on which a statute can be declared unconstitutional, especially a statute dealing with criminal offence. Are there any decisions in the past where a statute which has said that an act is not an offence, has been quashed or struck down by any court, either by the Supreme Court or the high court?” Justice Shankar also said it is not enough to say that the “act” inside a marital sphere is not rape or sexual assault and outside the sphere it is.The bench is hearing PILs filed by NGOs RIT Foundation, All India Democratic Women’s Association, a man and a woman seeking striking down of the exception granted to husbands under the Indian rape law.“When a man is married, there is a social, moral and legal right for each partner to expect meaningful conjugal relations with the other. There is an expectation of accommodating the partner. If we have to say no then we have to make out a case that the marital relations are totally irrelevant,” the judge said.Meanwhile, the Centre told the high court that it would require “reasonable” and “considerable” time to formulate its stand on the issue.Solicitor general (SG) Tushar Mehta said the government is in talks with the various stakeholders and it would not be appropriate to file a response without proper consultations. While seeking a couple of weeks to file its response, the SG said “nothing imminent is going to happen”.He said the petitions have been filed in 2015 and hence requires consideration on the part of the Union government.To this, the court said whatever consultations are ongoing, it is the Union government that has to finally take a stand. It said the Centre can take time to file its stand, but the arguments by the other parties will continue in the meanwhile.“However much you deliberate, but you have to say a ”yes” or a ”no”.They (Centre) have to take a decision. There are some matters, for whatever reasons, I think the court ultimately decides one way or the other and that’s how it gets resolved. You take your time,” the court said.Earlier, on January 13, the Union government had told the high court that it was considering a “constructive approach” on the issue and had sought suggestions from several stakeholders and authorities so as to make comprehensive amendments to the criminal law, which includes Section 375 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code.In an additional affidavit, the Centre asserted that it is “already seized of the matter” and that the marital rape exception in Section 375 -- it exempts forceful sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife from the offence of rape -- could not be struck down only at the instance of the petitioners as the principles of natural justice required a “larger hearing of all stakeholders”. Senior advocate Rao has submitted that there was no reason to preserve the exception. The amicus argued that a married woman cannot be denied the right to prosecute her husband if she believed that she was raped. In case of denial of conjugal relationship, the remedy before the spouse is to file a plea for restitution and “not force himself upon her”.The hearing will continue on Tuesday.
18-01-2022||Mumbai||Four decades later, mill workers still wait for redemption||MUMBAI: On January 18, 1982 – exactly 40 years ago – more than a quarter of a million workers from nearly 60 textile mills in Mumbai struck work, demanding better wages and bonuses. What started out as a labour strike would go onto change the economics, politics, and socio-cultural structure of a city that had made its mark in the world of global commerce partly due to its massive textile mill network, considered one of primary engines of Mumbai’s growth. Regarded as one of the longest industrial strikes in history – it lasted over a year and was, technically, never withdrawn – rendered tens of thousands of workers jobless, thanks to an adamant stand taken by their union led by a doctor-turned-trade-union-leader named Datta Samant as well as mill owners, and the Central and state governments. Apart from a rise in wages, the union also demanded the scrapping of the Bombay Industrial Relations Act, a law that allowed only one trade union – Rashtriya Mill Mazdoor Sangh (RMMS) – to function. For long, industrial workers had accused RMMS of being hand in glove with owners. The long-drawn high-stakes tussle meant that the strike eventually fizzled out with workers never getting any of their demands met. Rambhau Kadam (now 75) worked at Jupiter mills at Parel at the time. He recalls the day workers assembled at the mill’s gates. “We started sloganeering against the owners demanding our rightful dues,” Patil recollected. “However, after some months, we lost all steam. Even in the normal course, our salary would suffice us only a few days, and here we were, without wages for months. First, we sold our jewellery and then even our utensils to get our daily food. My children starved and my elder son dropped out of school.”Raghoba Dhondu Bait who now lives in India United Mills chawl at Lalbaug in central Mumbai says his entire family was jobless. “My father and we four brothers worked in the mills and had no income for more than six months. We did odd jobs to support our family,” said Bait.Dr Arvind Ganachari, former head of the history department at Mumbai university, was a close observer of the strike and its repercussions. “It destroyed the labour movement in Mumbai,” he said. “Workers’ lives were destroyed as industrialists began shifting their factories and mills out of Mumbai. It was not just the labour class that suffered, but also the literary class. The city’s cultural scene, dominated by Girangaon in central Mumbai, lost its primacy.” Some trade unionists are of the opinion that Samant did not know when to stop, and it was this approach that turned the strike into a failure. He had even rejected a wage hike proposed by the state government. Communist leader Vithal Ghag, then a worker at Swan mills in Sewri, said: “Samant should have understood that the mill workers could not remain jobless for years and should have tactfully negotiated, but he was adamant. He was caught in the trap set by the owners who anyway wanted to wind up their operations and commercially exploit their land. The Communist Party was trying to make him understand this, but he refused to listen to us.” Former state minister Sachin Ahir and current RMMS chief said, “The whole atmosphere was tense and the workers were carried away by Dr Samant’s rhetoric. We were pleading that such a strike would deal a death blow to the textile mills and that was what precisely happened.” Ahir said that a year after the strike began, eight mills shut down, while 20 others were taken over by the National Textile Corporation (NTC). “We never recovered,” he said. Meanwhile, as the strike became a distant memory for a city progressing as a services hub, large swaths of land in central Mumbai occupied by these mills were replaced by huge skyscrapers following a decision by the Maharashtra government that allowed mill owners to sell their land, provided they allocated two-thirds of it to government agencies for civic amenities and mass housing. In 2003, the state government tweaked rules in favour of the mill owners, giving them back 340 acres of prime land that would otherwise have been demarcated for affordable housing and open spaces. Mill workers, on the other hand, never recovered. Unable to sustain even a modest lifestyle in their original houses in chawls, they began moving to the city’s outskirts. Some, like Arun Gawli, took to crime and joined the underworld. Datta Samant, meanwhile, was killed on January 16, 1997. Samant was travelling from Powai to Ghatkopar in a jeep when four unknown people obstructed his vehicle and fired at him. It was alleged that a trade union dispute was the motive behind the murder and that underworld don Chhota Rajan was connected to this killing. The case was later handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation. Pravin Ghag, who heads the Girni Kamgar Sangharsh Samiti, an outfit that fights for the rights of mill workers, says the mill-worker community that played an important role in the development of Mumbai, is now greatly marginalised. “A majority of the workers had to leave Mumbai and even now we have to agitate to get our rightful houses,” Ghag said. “These textile mills ran due to our sweat and blood, but in the revamp, we were made to beg for our share.” Forty years later, according to government documents, only 24,000 workers have received tenements promised to them. Bhushan Samant, son of Datta Samant and the person who heads Kamgar Aghadi defends his father, and blames the then ruling Congress party for this state of affairs. “My father was reluctant to lead the mill workers but for four months, these workers regularly came to our office and pleaded with him,” he said. “It was a do or die battle. My father tried to meet the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to solve this tangle but the local Congressmen thwarted his efforts fearing he would emerge powerful and challenge them. My father collected ₹30 crore at that time and distributed to the agitating workers so that they can buy their ration. Which leader does so much? The strike is continuing and we will not call it off until every mill worker gets his rightful house.”

So, keep your preparations complete. Keeping in mind the current situation of rising Covid-19 cases, assess what could be the situation of the infection in future and manage accordingly,” Kaushal said during a meeting with officials from the district administration.In the meeting held in Gurugram, the chief secretary also said that the instructions of the state government should be strictly followed to control the infection.Presenting a report on the status of Covid-19 infection in Gurugram district and the arrangements made to deal with the situation, deputy commissioner Yash Garg apprised the chief secretary of the current situation and said that despite high number of cases, less than 1% of the infected patients are hospitalised in the ongoing third wave of the pandemic.“Around 6,000 beds are available in various hospitals for Covid-19 patients in Gurugram. At present, only 152 patients are under treatment in various hospitals. The availability of oxygen has also been increased in the district with 4,150 litres per minute capacity of oxygen production,” said Garg.In the meeting, the deputy commissioner also said that a meeting was convened with all the private hospitals of the district directing them to avoid unnecessary admission of patients with mild symptoms.Health department warns against fraud messages regarding booster doseThe health department on Monday issued a statement warning people against rise in fraud emails and messages where fraudsters posing as officials from the department are asking people to get their booster dose and duping residents. The officials said that the health department does not call people asking them to get vaccinated.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram, said that cases of fraud calls in the name of vaccination campaign are being reported from different parts of the country and people are being cheated financially by cyber frauds.“At present no such case has been reported in Gurugram, but we all need to be cautious. In such cases, cyber frauds, posing as health department officials, send emails and messages advising people to take the booster dose and for this, a link for registration is sent. Once the beneficiary fills in their details, an OTP is sent and after he/she gives that OTP to the frauds, money is debited from their accounts. No such mails/messages are made by the health department and registration on the CoWIN portal is mandatory for taking the booster dose,” said the CMO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/top-haryana-official-takes-stock-of-covid-situation-in-gurugram-101642444362933.html
18-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi CM flags off city’s first e-bus, 300 more by April 2023||The Delhi government on Monday pressed into service its first ever electric public transport bus that will run on a designated circular route, E-44, from the Indraprastha Depot and covering central and south Delhi locations.Launching the bus service, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the Delhi government aims to procure at least 2,000 electric buses in the next few years, and termed it the beginning of a new era in public transport. By April next year, the city will have at least 300 more e-buses, the government said.“Today, the Delhi government has dedicated the state’s first electric bus to the public. This marks the beginning of a new era in the transport sector of Delhi. Now, we will see a revolution where as and when older buses go of service, new electric buses will be onboarded. This is a very important step in combating the problem of pollution. This is a zero emission bus and there’s barely any noise,” Kejriwal said while inspecting the bus at the Indraprastha (IP) Depot.In July 2018, the Delhi government first announced that it would induct 1,000 electric buses into the city bus fleet, after the Delhi cabinet approved the scheme. The government then claimed that it would be the first state to roll out e-buses on such a large scale. Three and a half years later, cities such as Pune, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Ahmedabad and Kolkata already have functional e-buses, while Delhi kickstarted its first e-bus on Monday.This e-bus will be operated by the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) on route number E-44, which has been designed as a “circular bus service” -- starting from IP Depot via ITO, AGCR, Tilak Marg, Mandi House, Barakhamba Road, Connaught Place, Janpath, Rajesh Pilot Marg, Prithviraj Road, Aurobindo Marg, AIIMS, Ring Road, South Extension, Ashram, Bhogal, Jangpura, India Gate, Delhi high court, Pragati Maidan and back to IP Depot. The service will be available between 5.30am and 8.20pm.Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot said this is also the first time that DTC has managed to procure a bus since 2011. On July 26 last year, HT first reported how the entire fleet of 3,760 buses run by DTC was officially declared “overage”, a first in the history of the state transport utility, which was set up in 1971. To meet the demand of public transport in the city, the DTC had to seek special permission from the state transport authority to allow all its buses to operate till the age of 15 years instead of 12, which is the usual norm.Delhi now has about 6,900 buses which is also the highest number of buses the city has ever had. Talking about the e-buses that will start coming in the city, Gahlot said, “The bus can be charged within one to one and a half hours on a fast charger. It can run for a minimum of 120 kilometres in one charge. All our depots are being made electric charging friendly.”The e-buses will have kneeling ramps for the disabled and elderly passengers, and special pink seats for women. Each bus will be equipped with CCTV cameras, connected to a two-way Central Command and Control Centre (CCC) at Kashmere Gate,10 panic buttons and a hooter.

In a unique initiative taken by ministries of culture and defence, the scrolls have been painted by over 500 artists at workshops held in Odisha and Chandigarh, and reflect traditional art forms such as Madhubani, Pattachitra, Talapatra Chitra, Manjusha and Patua.In a statement, Adwaita Garanayak, Director General of the National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA), said, “The NGMA has organised these workshops with the aim of amalgamating varied forms of visual and performing arts of the country to represent the true essence of unity and diversity in India. I believe that the gigantic scrolls when displayed at Rajpath will garner the interest of each individual to delve deep into the history of the unsung heroes of India’s freedom struggle and would also draw attention towards the unified visual aspects of modern, indigenous and contemporary arts of India.”The scrolls will be put up behind the seating arrangement for the public, said a senior CPWD official.“Major work at the Avenue for the parade is over and final touches are being given. This time, 10 huge LED screens, including four near the presidential dais, for the public. Live visuals of the parade will be telecasted,” said a senior CPWD official asking not to be named.The agency is also making arrangements for parking cars of visitors. “Parking space for close to 4,000 vehicles will be provided at the site. The work is almost complete,” a senior official said.However, a senior Delhi traffic police official said that parking space for around 7,000 vehicles will be needed. “The parking space at the venue has slightly been reduced due to the construction of amenity blocks and underpasses. We have been provided alternate parking sites at Jawahar Bhawan (on Raisina Road) and Vanijya Bhawan (on Akbar Road). This is for the first time we have been provided parking sites at these locations,” said a senior traffic police official, aware of the development.Due to the Covid situation in the Capital, a senior traffic official said that the parade will terminate at the National Stadium but the tableaux will be proceed till Red Fort.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/scrolls-on-freedom-movement-10-led-screens-on-rajpath-for-r-day-parade-101642444181944.html
18-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi: Minor girl, woman raped in separate cases, suspects nabbed||An eight-year-old girl and a 30-year-old woman were raped in Delhi in two separate incidents reported on Friday and Saturday last week, the police said on Monday informing that the suspects in both the cases have been arrested.Police said the first incident was reported from outer Delhi’s Nihal Vihar where a woman was allegedly gang-raped by two men on January 14. According to the statement given by the victim to the police, a neighbour invited her on the occasion of Makar Sankranti on Friday and gave her sweets that were allegedly laced with an intoxicant. As soon as the victim had it, she said, she lost consciousness.She told the police that two men, who were already present at her neighbour’s house she went there, gang-raped her.Police said after the woman regained consciousness, and became aware of the assault, she returned home and told her husband about it. The husband took her to the police, and got a complaint registered.Investigators said a was immediately registered, and the woman was taken to a hospital for a medical examination that confirmed rape. The police reached her neighbour’s house, and arrested the two suspects, said Parvinder Singh, DCP (outer). The woman is on the run.In the second incident reported on Saturday evening, an eight-year-old girl was raped by a neighbour in north Delhi’s Alipur area.According to the police, the girl went to a nearby temple with her elder sister around 6pm on Saturday. The neighbour approached the girl in the temple, and lured her to an isolated spot nearby where he raped her.The girl’s sister raised an alarm when she did not find her.

18-01-2022||Delhi||As chill persists, IMD says maximum temperature in Delhi may rise||Parts of the national capital saw ‘cold day’ conditions for the fifth straight day on Monday, as low clouds over Delhi kept the sun at bay.While Safdarjung, Delhi’s base station recorded a maximum temperature of 16.1 degrees Celsius (°C), Jafarpur was even colder at 13.2°C.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said it expects the maximum temperature to rise to around 18°C from Tuesday, but added that there is still a chance that isolated parts of Delhi could record cold day conditions, officials said.Delhi is also expected to receive a spell of rain from January 21 till January 23, the weather office said.The IMD classifies it a ‘cold’ day when the maximum temperature is 4.5 degrees or more below normal, while the minimum is below 10 degrees Celsius. It is classified as a ‘severe’ cold day when the maximum is 6.5 degrees or more below normal.Delhi’s maximum temperature on Monday dipped, compared to the previous day, when it was 17.2°C, while it touched a season’s low of 14.8°C on Saturday.RK Jenamani, scientist at IMD, said the last time Delhi saw such an extended spell of cold days was in December 2019. At the time, a seven-day spell of cold days extended into the first week of January 2020 as well.Parts of Delhi also saw shallow fog on Monday, he said.“Delhi recorded shallow fog at both Safdarjung and Palam, with visibility dropping to a low of 800 metres in the morning. However, upper-level fog still persisted and its impact could remain intact over Delhi on Tuesday as well. From Wednesday, the maximum should rise further and provide some respite,” Jenamani said.He said Delhi is also expected to receive more rain before the month ends, with a drizzle expected on January 21 and 23, and a forecast of light rain on January 22.“Another western disturbance will start to influence Delhi from January 20. We will see some drizzle on January 21 night, with light showers expected the next day. During this spell, the maximum temperature could drop again,” he said.The overcast conditions have also led to a deterioration in air quality in the past 24 hours, with Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) plummeting into the ‘very poor’ zone on Monday. According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s 4pm bulletin, Delhi logged an AQI of 327 (very poor), worse than 264 (poor) on Sunday.According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), Delhi’s air quality is likely to improve in the next three days as wind speeds pick up.“Maximum temperature and wind speed are likely to increase gradually for the next three days, enhancing ventilation of pollutants and leading to improvement in air quality. From January 21, the wind speed will pick up even more,” said Safar on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/as-chill-persists-imd-says-maximum-temperature-in-delhi-may-rise-101642443522794.html
18-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi govt pays ₹93.8 crore to kin of 18,766 Covid victims||The Delhi government has paid an additional ₹93.8 crore to the kin of 18,766 Covid-19 victims as one-time ex-gratia payment, according to documents seen by HT.Government officials confirmed that these 18,766 people who lost a family member to Covid-19 have already received ₹50,000 as ex gratia under the Mukhyamantri Covid-19 Pariwar Aarthik Sahayata Yojna, and have now been given an additional ₹50,000 each under the Delhi Disaster Response Fund.According to a Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) order for disbursal of compensation dated January 6,2022, over 20,000 people who lost a family member to Covid-19 and have already received ₹50,000 as ex gratia under the Mukhyamantri Covid-19 Pariwar Aarthik Sahayata Yojna, will now be given an additional ₹50,000 each under the Delhi Disaster Response Fund.A total of 22,131 people have so far received ₹50,000 as ex-gratia under the Mukhyamantri Covid-19 Pariwar Aarthik Sahayata Yojna, of whom 18,766 received an additional ₹50,000. The highest number of applications has been sanctioned in the South West district (3,479), followed by West (3,044), North West (2,768), Shahdara (2,043) and lowest from North (277), according to the government documents.A DDMA official said the ex-gratia amount will be released to the remaining eligible families without them having to submit an application, as the credentials and bank details of the beneficiaries who were provided with financial assistance were already verified.The new scheme also allows any Delhi resident who loses a family member or has lost a family member to Covid and is yet to get the ex-gratia to submit an application.A DDMA official, who asked not to be named, said all new claims will be settled within 30 days of submission of required documents and disbursed through Aadhaar-linked direct benefit transfer. “The Central government contributes 75% to the Delhi Disaster Response Fund and the Delhi government contributes 25%. It is a standing fund,” the official said.Now, Delhi has two Covid compensation schemes -- the chief minister’s scheme and the other under Delhi Disaster Response Fund, each for a sum of ₹50,000.Applicants can submit applications via https://edistrict.delhigovt.nic.in/. The district magistrate offices will also accept hard copies of applications from those who are unable to apply on the portal.“Applicants who have not yet applied for the ex-gratia for Covid deaths are required to apply directly to the concerned district magistrate. The DDMA will release funds directly to the beneficiary in accordance with detailed guidelines about eligibility,” a DDMA official said.The guidelines state that deaths taking place within 30 days from the date of testing or from the date of being clinically determined as a Covid-19 case shall be treated as “death due to Covid-19”, even if the death takes place outside the hospital or in-patient facility.A family member of a person who died by suicide within 30 days of being diagnosed as Covid-19 positive shall also be entitled to avail the ex-gratia assistance. “People who have lost a family member during the current wave can also apply for the ex-gratia,” said an official.In June 2021, the Supreme Court directed the National Disaster Management Authority to recommend guidelines for ex-gratia assistance to the kin of those who lost their lives due to Covid-19. The order came in response to petitions seeking directions to the Central and state governments to provide ex-gratia compensation under the Disaster Management Act for Covid deaths.In December, the Supreme Court sought information from the Delhi government and many other states on the progress of processing applications and releasing payments under the scheme.
18-01-2022||Lucknow||UP poll battle goes musical, campaign songs create a buzz online||The UP poll battle is turning musical with a Bhojpuri flavour and catching the attention of people on the social media ahead of the seven-phase state assembly elections that will begin on February 10.These songs are creating a buzz online when the Election Commission (EC) is yet to allow any physical campaigns for the polls. More such songs praising or targeting political parties may be heard in the coming weeks.Bhojpuri singer Neha Singh Rathore has come out with the number “UP Mein Ka Ba? (What is there in UP?)” in an apparent response to BJP MP Ravi Kishan’s song “UP Mein Sab Ba” (UP has everything) that chief minister Yogi Adityanath released in Gorakhpur on January 15.Ravi Kishan, in this campaign song, has listed the achievements of the Yogi Adityanath government with the lyrics: “Yogi ki sarkar ba, vikas ki bahar ba.. sadkan ke jaal ba, kaam bemisal ba, je kabau na rehal u ab baa. UP mein sab ba (A spring of development is flowing during the tenure of the Yogi government. A network of roads has been laid. Unmatched work has been done. UP has all that was never there before).”“Yes, chief minister Yogi Adityanath released the song on ‘khichri’ on January 15. It’s got a very good response. It’s getting viral,” said Ravi Kishan.Ravi Kishan’s song got an immediate response with Bhojpuri folk singer Neha Singh Rathore, who is said to have brought out campaign songs during the Bihar assembly elections as well.Her song appears to question chief minister Yogi Adityanath for his achievements, handling of Hathras incident and Covid-19. The song also raised the issue of mowing down of farmers by a vehicle in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3, 2021. Ashish Mishra, the son of union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra Teni, is the main accused in the case.Without naming the chief minister or anyone else, Neha Rathore is heard singing, “Baba ke darbar ba, khatm rozgar ba. Hathras ke nirnaya jo hat, ladki ke parivar ba, arrey ka ba, UP mein ka ba, corona se lakhan mar gai le, lashan se Ganga bhar gai le (No jobs have been left in Baba’s darbar. What decision was taken with regard to Hathras incident? Lakhs died of Covid-19 and their bodies floated in the Ganga. What is there in UP?)”“Mantri ke bitwa badi rangatdar ba, mantri ke bitwa badi rangatdar ba, kisanan ke chhati pe raundat motor car ba. E chowkidar bolo ke jimmedar bar ba, ka ba, UP mein ka ba,” (The minister’s son had lot of influence and he mowed farmers down under his car. Chowkidar! Who is responsible. What is there in UP?).“Ram raj ke jhanki ba, Kashi Mathura baaki ba (Kashi and Mathura are yet to be achieved in their trailer of Ram Rajya),” she also sang.“Mandir masjid, mandir masjid main thanal gai rar ba, arey ka ba, UP mein ka ba. (There has been a dispute of temple and mosque. What is there in UP?),”the song went.Neha Rathore shared the song on her Twitter handle and YouTube channel on Sunday, a day after Ravi Kishan released his song.The Samajwadi Party, too, has come out with campaign songs to reach out to the people of Uttar Pradesh.“Jhan jhanan man baaje man mai, aasha ka o ek tara” (There is a twinkle of hope. UP is calling Samajwadi Party)” are the opening lines of one of the SP’s campaign songs. Another SP campaign song speaks about how the party has never indulged in politics of hatred or caste and instead has worked for the development of Uttar Pradesh.“Besides going door to door, we are coming out with campaign songs focusing on the Samajwadi Party’s work. The people of UP are liking our campaign that includes the Vijay Yatras and other such yatras led by SP chief Akhilesh Yadav,” said Samajwadi Party spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary.The Congress, too, has come out with a campaign song to support its slogan “Ladki Hoon, Lad Sakti Hoon (I am a girl, I can fight).”“The Congress campaign song is being considered an instant hit,” said Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) vice-president Pankaj Srivastava.The campaign song that begins with “stuti” (hymn) of Goddess Durga speaks about how the women who have been running their home and working in fields are also at ease fighting on the borders.“This idea for the campaign song came from Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and we worked on the song,” said Tejendra, who goes by one name.“It is campaign time and every party is trying to influence voters. This is an interesting way to reach out to the people. This is just the beginning and film actors may also hold meetings to campaign in favour of political parties if the EC so permits. This kind of campaign catches the attention of voters and, to some extent, may also influence them. By and large such songs may make the campaigns of political parties interesting but may not influence voters to a large extent,” said Professor SK Dwivedi, former head of the department of political science, Lucknow University.

18-01-2022||Delhi||Weekend curfew helping reduce Covid caseload, no lockdown in Delhi: Jain||Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said that the Covid-19 has been consisting on a decline over the last few days and this was an indication that the weekend curfew imposed by the government was working.“The weekend curfew is proving to be beneficial, as fewer and fewer people are venturing outside, limiting the spread of coronavirus. The number of reported cases is decreasing, but the government is keeping an eye on the trend,” Jain said on Monday.The minister said, “The cases in Delhi have been declining for the past four days. On January 14, Delhi recorded 24,383 cases, while on January 15, Delhi recorded 20,178 new cases, and on January 16, Delhi logged 18,286 cases. Weekend curfews have played a significant role in this decline.”Jain also said that Delhi was focusing on vaccinating maximum people.Delhi over the last year has administered over 28 million vaccine doses. Out of all eligible people, 100% have received their first dose and around 80% have received their second dose. The government has also administered 127,000 precautionary doses.“The vaccination process is running smoothly in Delhi, and the Delhi government has an adequate supply of vaccines. No prescription is required to get yourself tested if you have any symptoms. The health system in Delhi is in a good shape and we are fully prepared to deal with even the most serious of situations,” he said.Jain also hit back at his Haryana counterpart Anil Vij, who on Sunday claimed that three Haryana districts situated close to Delhi were behind the surge in Covid cases in the state.“This is a political gimmick. Delhi everyday reports over 1000 cases of patients who are not local residents. This is the time to focus on managing Covid and its spread and not point fingers at each other,” he said.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also rubbished the allegations levelled by Vij, and said they do not deserve a response. “Blaming each other won’t kill the virus. I won’t get involved in this mess. The virus is there all across the country. It’s there in Haryana as well as in Delhi and other states. We should just work towards eradicating the pandemic. Blaming each other is not going to help,” he told reporters on Monday.On Sunday, Vij said Haryana was “adversely affected” due to its vicinity to Delhi, and claimed that “more than half” of the around 9,000 new Covid-19 cases in Haryana were coming from Gurugram, Faridabad and Sonepat districts.“Haryana reports around 9,000 Covid-19 cases every day, of which over 50% are from Gurugram, Faridabad and Sonepat. Delhi’s infection rate is having an impact on the state,” Vij said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/weekend-curfew-helping-reduce-covid-caseload-no-lockdown-in-delhijain-101642441901161.html
18-01-2022||Delhi||Most of Capital’s forest cover loss was in N-W, S-W Delhi: ISFR 2021||Delhi lost just about 0.44 sq km of forest cover in the past two years, findings of the latest India State of Forest Report 2021 revealed, much of it in the northwest and southwest parts of the city. An expert, however, said data using satellite imagery could sometimes be misleading. While 0.51 sq km of forest was lost in northwest Delhi, southwest Delhi lost 0.38 sq km of forest, the report said. There was an increase of 0.15 sq km of forest in northeast Delhi, followed by 0.13 sq km in north Delhi.While “necessary” construction projects led to a slight decline in the two districts, saplings planted in the past are likely to have matured in both east and northeast Delhi, adding to overall forest cover, a Delhi forest department official said.Among the districts, New Delhi had the most forest cover, with 47.06% (16.47sq km) of its 35 sq km area under some form of canopy. This included 1.69 sq km of very dense forest. The other two districts to have very dense forests were south Delhi (2.59 sq km) and southwest Delhi (2.35 sq km). The south Delhi district had a total forest cover of 34.27% at 84.64 of its 247 sq km area. Tree canopy density is more than 70% in a very dense forest, according to the Forest Survey of India.“If permission has to be given to fell trees for a construction project, for example Phase-4 of the Delhi metro, it will sometimes pass through a deemed forest, or a notified forest,” the forest official said, requesting anonymity. “In such cases, permission was given where the project was beneficial to the city and compensatory saplings were planted elsewhere.” Delhi gained 18 sq km of tree cover in the last two years, according to the report. “Over the last 4 to 6 years, large-scale plantation has taken place and a number of trees have matured now, adding to the existing forest cover,” the forest official said. However, prosopis juliflora (vilayati kikar), an invasive species, was the most dominant tree within Delhi’s reserved forests, the report found, followed by acacia lenticularis (babool). Outside Delhi’s forest areas, one in every 10 tree was found to be a neem (azadirachta indica) in urban Delhi, while vilayati kikar (29.52%) was the most dominant tree in Delhi’s rural areas. Using satellite imagery may be misleading at times because the report, for instance, classified an area between the Safdarjung Tomb and Rajghat to have both a moderately dense forest and an open forest, pointed out Raj Bhagat, senior program manager, Geo Analytics for Sustainable Cities & Transport program at World Resources Institute India, a research organisation.“Based on the density of the plantation, the area has a forest as per the definition, when in reality, this stretch of land does not have a forest,” bhagat said. “This leads to a fundamental question as to what constitutes a forest and whether ornamental and plantation trees can be called forests.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/most-of-capital-s-forest-cover-loss-was-in-n-w-s-w-delhi-isfr-2021-101642441481574.html
18-01-2022||Delhi||Unusual winter trend: Delhi sees 7 dengue cases last week||Delhi reported seven more dengue cases over the past week, taking the number of the vector borne disease in the Capital to 15 this year. This has sparked fears that the aedes aegypti mosquito -- which spreads the dengue virus -- may be adapting to cold conditions.No dengue cases were reported in the first 15 days of January in 2021, 2020 and 2019.Public health experts said the corporations should ensure anti-mosquito drives are not limited to the post monsoon period.Noting that dengue cases used to flatten out during extreme summer and peak winters till a few years ago, Dr BK Tripathi, professor in the department of medicine at Safdarjung Hospital, said that mosquitoes are now adapting to harsh climatic conditions. “The civic bodies need to ensure that preparations and drives against controlling mosquito population should be carried out all through the year,” Dr Tripathi said.A senior municipal official from public health department said changes in the behaviour of adult mosquitoes needs to be studied more, but added that the increase in reportage may also be due to the disease being notified as notifiable disease in October last year. “The 36 hospitals under the ‘sentinel surveillance system’ used to share weekly data with us but now, corporations are getting data from 180 health care facilities of the city,” the official said.Delhi recorded 9,613 dengue cases and 23 fatalities in 2021, making it the second worst annual outbreak on record.Of the 15 cases reported in January so far, three each have been reported in areas under the north corporation and two in East Delhi, while addresses of the remaining seven could not be traced, the report said. Additionally, seven other cases showed that the infections were acquired from other states.A report by civic bodies shows that 187 cases of mosquito breeding have been detected in this period, as against 46 and 44 in the corresponding periods of 2021 and 2020 respectively.A senior municipal official from public health official said that 210 legal notices have been issued to property owners for negligence leading to mosquitogenic conditions and prosecution has been launched in 17 cases.On Friday last week, while hearing a case on the dengue outbreak in the city, the Delhi high court said mosquito infestation and spread of vector-borne diseases are not merely seasonal.“No doubt they may get heightened during the monsoon period. However, that does not mean other factors are not responsible for mosquito breeding and the spread of vector-borne diseases… It is for the municipal authorities to undertake a campaign to deal with such situations on a daily basis and the menace cannot be addressed only by addressing the problem in particular months of the year,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/unusual-winter-trend-delhi-sees-7-dengue-cases-last-week-101642441240947.html
18-01-2022||Delhi||Excessive groundwater extraction causing parts of Delhi-NCR to sink: Study||The alarming rate of groundwater depletion in the capital may be leading to a different kind of slow evolving crisis – parts of the surface in the city is sinking, a phenomenon known as land subsidence, potentially affecting the international airport.Around 100 sq km of area in the national capital region has high risk of ground displacement, with the largest of these, of around 12.5 sq km, is in southwest Delhi’s Kapashera, barely 800m away from the airport, researchers have found using satellite data.The rate of “sinking of land” in the neighbourhood near the airport is accelerating and the subsidence feature is rapidly expanding towards the airport, potentially threatening it, the researchers from IIT Bombay, German Research Centre for Geosciences, Cambridge and the Southern Methodist University, US said in a study titled Tracking hidden crisis in India’s capital from space: implications of unsustainable groundwater use, which was published in the peer-reviewed Nature journal.“During the years 2014–2016, the subsidence velocity was found to be approximately 11 cm/year which rose significantly by almost 50% over the next two years to around 17 cm/year. The trend remained almost same during 2018–2019,” the study said.Of all the areas that are under threat, Kapashera near the airport was the most vulnerable because the subsidence rate is extremely high, said Shagun Garg, a doctoral researcher from the University of Cambridge, who was part of the team that studied these land deformations.“Airport requires stable ground because of the risk of major disruption if there’s significant ground movement,” Garg said. “Kuala Lumpur airport is an example to understand the implications of land subsidence where cracks on taxiways, and waterlogging emerged due to soil settlement. Continuous monitoring of IGI IIndira Gandhi International) airport and its connecting roads is therefore crucial.”The study found another deformation in Mahipalpur, just 500m away from the airport where deformation of 15mm per year were observed in 2014-16, 30mm a year in 2016-18 and 50mm per year in 2018-19.A widespread global problem, land subsidence occurs when large amounts of groundwater are withdrawn from some types of rocks and underground soil. When water is extracted from aquifers, the clay between pockets of water collapse gradually, leading to deflation of the land beneath. It isn’t like a sinkhole or a cave in, whose impacts are sudden, but occurs over a very large area in a gradual manner.With a projected demand of 1,236 million gallons per day (MGD ), water-stressed Delhi has a 300 MGD demand-supply gap. According to the draft Master Plan 2041 , this demand is likely to increase to 1,746 MGD by 2031.A large part of unmet demands are met through groundwater extraction. At certain locations in southwest Delhi, the water table is available at a depth of 80 m and this continues to deplete at the rate of 3-4 m a year. More than 80% of land subsidence across the world is caused due to excessive groundwater extraction, according to the US Geological Survey.The study has found that an area of approximately 100 sq km in the national capital region is under “high risk of ground displacement.” The areas that require immediate attention include Bijwasan, Samalkha, Kapashera, Sadh Nagar, Bindapur, and Mahavir enclave in Delhi; Dundahera, Sector 22A, and Block C in Gurgaon; and pocket A, B, C of Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Nagar in Faridabad.Despite its slow pace, land subsidence is known to cause losses worth billions of dollars all over world due to damage to infrastructure, roads, pavements, and underground utilities such as drainage system. The sinking also leads to aggravated flood risk and more frequent waterlogging.The researchers also suspect that land subsidence may be responsible for poor condition of the 7.5 km stretch of the Delhi-Gurgaon road, which has subsided by more than 70 cm in the past five years.All precautions were taken before construction of the airport, a Delhi airport official said.“Studies have been done before carrying out construction work in and around the airport premises, with no impact of any land subsidence noted,” the official said, requesting anonymity. “All due checks are carried out before any construction work and, at the airport in particular, no impact of the groundwater table reducing has been seen.”The Central Ground Water Board is studying the impact of land subsidence, an official of the agency said. “We have been looking at the land subsidence aspect and have also initiated a project on land subsidence with IIRS Dehradun,” he said, declining to be named. “Once the findings are clearer, we can comment on the ground reality.” IIRS is short for Indian Institute of Remote Sensing.The matter needs further investigation, according to Shashank Shekhar, water expert and professor of geology at Delhi University.“The research correlates minor land subsidence with water level decline. It may be that water level decline have triggered minor adjustments in the surface topography, and if so, then it should be visible in other similar localities,” Shekhar said. “However, in geology there is continuous landscape evolution, mostly linked to tectonic activity. As the area mentioned are on flanks of the Delhi ridge, which is also a fault zone, it will be good to additionally factor in the neo-tectonic activity for accounting the minor adjustments in the land surface.”Land sinking is possible due to excessive groundwater extraction, said Vikram Soni, conservationist and emeritus professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, who has been working on issues related to water sector in Delhi.The study also highlights an “uplift trend” in Dwarka which has been attributed to a rise in the groundwater table and the consequent reduction of effective stress in the soil.“The sub-city region was undergoing subsidence with an approximate rate of 3.5 cm/year in 2014-16 which changed to uplift of 0.5cm/year in 2016-18 and 1.2cm/year in 2018-20,” the study said. “The main reason for this change in the behaviour of subsidence pattern can be associated with the swelling behaviour of soil. Delhi government introduced several strict policies to improve the groundwater condition in the area.”Can subsidence be reversed? Garg said that a detailed hydro-geological study is required to understand aquifer properties, and available data are limited.“The Central Ground Water Board, the Geological Survey of India, and the Ministry of Urban Affairs need to investigate whether these trends are reversible,” he said. “We suggest the government and policymakers should have a detailed understanding of the geophysical properties of the areas undergoing subsidence, and incentivize rainwater harvesting while ensuring strict implementation of laws against illegal mining of groundwater. The building conditions in hazard zones should be evaluated and proper measures should be taken.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/excessive-groundwater-extraction-causing-parts-of-delhi-ncr-to-sink-study-101642441000326.html
18-01-2022||Pune||Tundra Bean Goose, a new winged visitor at Bhigwan||PUNE It’s that time of year when migratory birds stop over in the city on their southward journey. This year, however, the turnout of the number of winged visitors has been good according to bird watchers and Ornithologist from the city. Tundra bean goose, a new visitor was sighted at Bhigwan this year which is popular for its migratory bird visitors.Ornithologist Dharmaraj Patil said that over 60 species of birds were sighted in January. “This year we spotted a new specie, the Tundra Bean Goose. This bird does not usually take this route; however, some birds lose their way and land here.Usually, there is a 10 per cent deviation in the path of the birds. In this case, the birds can survive. But if they deviate more, they can die. This is a common phenomenon,” said Patil.“We also sighted Black-winged stilt,Red-wattled lapwing, Little ringed plover and many other species. However, the Tundra Bean goose was sighted at one end of the wetland. Tourists were seen clicking photographs of this new specie. This resulted in scaring the bird, which may affect the number of this bird being sighted,” added Patil.Speaking about the overall turnout of birds, Girish Jathar, an Ornithologist with the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) said that at least 370 species come to India for migration. “In Maharashtra, three types of bird species visit. First are the birds from the coastline like gulls, sand pipers. Second are the type of birds which visit the wetlands like ducks, crane and the third type of birds are the landbirds. The numbers usually go up in November and December and they disperse in January. And again, in March and April when the birds are going back to the breeding spots,” said Jathar.He added that Tundra Bean Goose is not a regular visitor. “The bird might have deviated from its path.Usually, the trend is that as there is more rainfall, there are more wetlands, and the number of birds seen are less. However, if the rainfall is scanty, the wetlands are limited and the birds can be seen in flocks at one wetland itself thus increasing their numbers,” added Jathar.Birds that were sightedNorthern shoveler, Greater flamingo, Rock pigeon, Laughing dove, Black-winged stilt, Red-wattled lapwing, Little ringed plover, Common sandpiper, Wood sandpiper, Brown-headed gull, Whiskered tern, River tern, Painted stork, Little cormorant, Indian cormorant, Gray heron, Great egret, Indian pond-heron, Glossy ibis, Black-headed ibis, Eurasian marsh-harrier, Black kite, Eurasian hoopoe, White-throated kingfisher, Green bee-eater, Black drongo, Long-tailed shrike, House crow, Ashy prinia, Red-vented bulbul, Indian robin, Pied bushchat, Purple-rumped Sunbird, Western yellow wagtail||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/tundra-bean-goose-a-new-winged-visitor-at-bhigwan-101642440405410.html
18-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Welfare Trust launched to help city regain old glory||Chandigarh University chancellor Satnam Singh Sandhu on Monday launched a non-government organisation (NGO) — Chandigarh Welfare Trust — dedicated to the development and welfare of the city in alignment with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including education, gender equality, health and well-being, economic growth, peace, justice, strong institutions, poverty and climate action.Besides Sandhu, who is the Trust founder, Chandigarh Group of Colleges chairman Rashpal Singh Dhaliwal and chartered accountants and Trust’s governing body members Sunil Kumar and Rampal Dhiman were also present.Sandhu said that Chandigarh was the first modern city of the country and is among very few such cities across the world to have succeeded in terms of combining monumental architecture, cultural growth, and modernisation. “However, with passing times, things have changed, with growing population and considerable stagnancy in corresponding resources. This NGO is an attempt to restore and promote its glory, and to restitute Chandigarh as a model of development for other cities in India and elevating its standing among the cities of the world,” he said.Sandhu said the Trust aims to work for community well-being and sustainable welfare, besides making the Chandigarh city a leader in all aspects, including sanitation, education, cleanliness, quality of life and health, and will bring together 127 NGOs in the Union Territory, thousands of individual social workers, UT administration and municipal corporation in this mission.He said the Trust has identified two projects that required immediate attention and has started working on these already. These are improving the ranking of Chandigarh in Swachh Bharat survey and establishing it as the cleanest city of the country, and improving the positioning of Chandigarh in Ease of Living Index.“With such diverse population and culture, Chandigarh is a contemporary metropolis. With 86% literacy rate and 53% of its population working and 38% young, the people of Chandigarh will play a deciding role in providing the impetus in making this City Beautiful recognised at the global map.”It was also informed that Chandigarh Welfare Trust is exploring the possibility of associating with the QS World Merit Charity, and start its own QS World Merit Chapter. This will enable the Trust to gain the support of the prestigious philanthropic organisation in raising awareness, energy and capacity of young people to take local actions that tackle the most pressing community-specific issues of the 21st Century, with UN’s SDGs at its core.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-welfare-trust-launched-aims-to-re-establish-city-as-model-of-development-101642423899099.html
18-01-2022||Lucknow||JD (U) to contest UP polls on Bihar model of social justice: Tyagi||The Janata Dal (United), any ally of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), has decided to go solo in the Uttar Pradesh assembly election. The party will contest the election on Bihar model of governance—social justice as well as share of the OBC and Dalits in governance.Addressing a press conference in the party state unit office here on Tuesday, JD (U) national general secretary and party’s Uttar Pradesh in-charge KC Tyagi said, “Recently several ministers and MLAs deserted the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and resigned from the government over sidelining of the weaker section in the society. Whereas the Bihar government is working with social justice and development motto. Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar belongs to OBC community whereas two deputy CMs Renu Devi and Tarkishore Prasad belong to extremely backward community. All the sections have representation in the government in Bihar.”The JD (U) will raise the demand of caste census in Uttar Pradesh. Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar had led an all-party delegation to Delhi in August last year to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi to demand a caste-based census, he said. JD (U) is an allay of the NDA in Bihar as well as in the central government. Playing the eastern UP card, Tyagi said, “The eastern region of Uttar Pradesh is the most backward area in UP as there is no industry in the region. The JD (U) will demand the central government to set up a special economic zone the region and give limited state status to eastern UP.”Tyagi also said senior JD (U) leader and Union steel minister RCP Singh had held several rounds of talks with Union home minister Amit Shah; defence minister Rajnath Singh; BJP national president JP Nadda and BJP UP incharge Dharmendra Pradhan but there was no positive response from the BJP leadership. “JD (U) central leadership will meet at Delhi on Wednesday to finalise the candidates for UP assembly election,” he said. The JD (U) will contest the assembly election over the legal guarantee for minimum support price (MSP) of the crop, withdrawal of the cases lodged against farmers during agitation, ban on the sale of profit-making public sector units, ban on hate speeches during election campaign, he said added the party will call upon other parties to not field candidates against Unnao rape victim’s mother. “Mauryan Emperor Ashoka is pride of the country and the government should withdraw Padma Shri awarded Daya Prakash Sinha for making a controversial statement. JD (U) will not field candidate against UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath and deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya,” he said.
18-01-2022||Chandigarh||Kidney scam: HC stays sentence of two Amritsar doctors||The Punjab and Haryana high court has stayed sentencing of two Amritsar doctors, Bhupinder Singh and Bhushan Aggarwal, in two different FIRs related to the infamous 2002 kidney scam. One FIR pertained to allegations that the duo along with Dr PK Sareen and his colleagues at Kakkar Hospital, Amritsar, were managing the donations of kidneys illegally and performing the operations. In one case, a woman had died. They were awarded 10-year jail term by an Amritsar court on December 21, 2021. Their counsel, Bipan Ghai, had told court that during the pendency of the trial, Dr PK Sareen and Dr PK Jain, who both were surgeons and had performed the surgeries, have died. But the applicants were held guilty for offence under Section 19 of the Transplantation of Human Organs Act with Section 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) even as they were not surgeons and merely associated for pre- and post-operative care. It was also argued that, at the maximum, the charge could have been framed under Section 304A of the IPC with regard to criminal medical negligence due to a donor’s death, but there is no evidence on record to substantiate the charge under Section 304 IPC Part II (there is knowledge that death may be caused by the act) for which the appellants stand convicted. It was also argued that they had no role in granting permission by the authorisation committee to Dr Jain and Dr Sareen, who performed operation of the donor and recipient and were the responsible doctors. The bench of justice Arvind Sangwan considering the facts that both the appellants are first offenders and they are qualified doctors, allowed the application for suspension of sentence during the pendency of the appeal before the high court and admitted their appeals for the hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kidney-scam-hc-stays-sentence-of-two-amritsar-doctors-101642523811722.html

CR collected a fine of ₹2.94 crore from passengers between January 1 and January 15. As many as 715 passengers were also detained for travelling without masks on the suburban railway stations and ₹1.43 lakh was fined. Passengers are mandated by the state government to wear facial masks while travelling by local trains. Maximum passengers were penalised in three major stations of CR including Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) where 3997 passengers were fined, 2564 passengers at Dadar and 1133 passengers at Kalyan railway station.The zonal railway has formed special teams to check people travelling without tickets and facial masks on the local train network. 3529 cases of people travelling without facial masks were penalised between April 2021 and January 2021. “Between April 1, 2021 and January 15, 2022 a total of 10.12 lakh passengers were caught travelling without tickets and ₹51.31 crore as penalty was realised. We appeal to the passengers to travel with proper and valid railway tickets in order to avoid inconvenience and travel with dignity and follow all norms mandated for coronavirus,” shared Anil Kumar Jain, senior public relations officer, Central Railway. Further, the zonal railway also registered 188 cases on 23 male hawkers for travelling in women’s compartments of local trains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cr-fines-58-3k-passengers-for-travelling-without-tickets-in-local-trains-101642515230176.html
18-01-2022||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh to give 2 rescued tigers, 4 leopard cubs to Jamnagar’s new zoo||BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh’s forest department has decided to send two tigers and four leopards rescued from forest to a zoological park in Jamnagar, Gujarat, officials said, even though the state has two centres to keep the rescued animals.On January 13, the state forest department sought approval of the Central Zoo Authority to translocate the big cats to Greens Zoological Rescue and Rehabilitation Kingdom in Jamnagar, one of Gujarat’s 13 zoos.The Central Zoo Authority under environment ministry is the regulatory body for zoos in the country. According to MP forest department officials, the decision of give cats was taken on the request of Jamnagar Zoo.In the letter to PCCF, wildlife, MP, the Jamnagar Zoological Centre wrote, “The satellite rescue centre is now operational in Jamnagar and it is housing presently more than 130 leopards received from the state of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Himachal Pradesh and Nagaland. The centre has rescued lguanas, Siamese crocodiles, Asiatic black bears, sloth beras, jungle cats, slow loris, hornbills, malay porcupines, muggers and various species of turtles and tortoises.” “The centre is willing to acquire rescued animals from MP to house them in the centre which will have a large naturalistic enclosure, said the letter. In a letter to the authority, Madhya Pradesh’s principal chief conservator of forest (PCCF) Alok Kumar said, “Greens Zoological, Rescue and Rehabilitation centre in Jamnagar district of Gujarat showed a willingness to keep rescued wild animals of MP. As of now, MP have two facilities- Van Vihar in Bhopal and Mukundpur Tiger Safari in Satna where rescued animals have been kept on a temporary and permanent basis as per requirement. But recently, the rescue cases of wild animals have increased and in future, we will require the support of this organisation” The forest department sought permission from Central Zoo Authority to send tigers and leopards from Van Vihar National Park and Mukundpur Zoo to Jamnagar. “Further action will be taken after getting permission of authority, said Alok Kumar. Mukundpur Zoo director Sanjay Raykhere said, “We have limited space to keep rescue animals or treat them at the centre. We can shift those animals which can’t live in the wild and are fit for travel to Jamnagar.”However, a senior forest officer, who didn’t wish to be named, said, “Gujarat government is not ready to give us lion but they want tigers from us. MP forest department shouldn’t have agreed to it especially when two tiger safaris are going to start in MP in Shivpuri and Panchmarhi. This decision was taken under pressure because the PCCF himself wrote that as of now there is no dearth of space but in future, there will be.”Officials also said that there is already a proposal to translocate tigers to proposed Madhav National Park, which the government wants to convert into a tiger reserve. Many of the rescued tigers and leopards can be sent there also, an official said.A wildlife activist from MP, Ajay Dubey said, “It is strange that the MP forest department has taken this decision in just 15 days. Everything is looking fixed. The forest department should evaluate the condition and habitat for tiger before taking this decision.” Another environmentalist Kartikeya Singh said, “If both states follow all the guidelines of NTCA, this exchange programme is good for conservation. The forest departments should go for it for the animals which can’t live in wild.”
18-01-2022||Chandigarh||Panjab University students protest closure of reading halls at AC Joshi library||A number of Panjab University (PU) students on Monday held a protest march from the AC Joshi library to the vice-chancellor’s office, demanding reopening of the library’s reading halls.The reading halls on the first and third floors were closed by the varsity last week from January 13 to 16 amid the surge in Covid-19 cases in the city. However, students said on Monday another notice was put up, announcing that the reading halls were closed till further orders. Only the outer reading hall is open and is to be used at 50% capacity.The protesting students and research scholars said closure of the reading halls and 50% seating limit in the outer reading hall was affecting their studies.“It is exam time and students need to access the library. Students are following the safety protocols. When we reached the V-C office, no university official came to receive our memorandum, so we just hung it on the barricade,” said Aman of Punjab Students’ Union (PSU-Lalkaar).Shopkeepers’ protest enters Day 4Meanwhile, the Panjab University Traders’ Welfare Association kept shops closed for the fourth consecutive day in protest. They are demanding that in case of lease deed transfer, rent should remain as per the deed. The shopkeepers are also demanding that as classes are suspended at the varsity amid the pandemic, they should get at least 50% rebate on the lines of other universities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panjab-university-students-protest-closure-of-reading-halls-at-ac-joshi-library-101642448447130.html
18-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Miffed SAD leaders give ultimatum over Mohali ticket allocation||Upset over the decision to allot the assembly election ticket from Mohali to Parvinder Singh Sohana, around 25 local leaders of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Monday gave a two-day ultimatum to party president Sukhbir Singh Badal to either change the candidate or face “severe consequences”. The assembly elections are scheduled for February 20, while nominations are to be filed by February 2. The disgruntled Akali leaders, who include zila parishad members, block samiti members and sarpanches, addressed mediapersons after holding a meeting at a hotel in Sohana.Avtar Singh Mauli, who is a block samiti member from Mauli Baidwan, said: “There are around 25 local leaders, who are opposing Sohana’s candidature. We have given a two-day ultimatum to party president Sukhbir Singh Badal to change the candidate, failing which we will campaign against him.”Another SAD leader, Kanwaljit Singh Badi, who was also eyeing the party ticket from Mohali, said: “How could the party give the ticket to a person who ditched it twice? It seems, there are some people who have misguided the party president and we strongly oppose this.”“The party should have consulted the local leadership before declaring the candidate. There are more leaders who are unhappy, but they are not coming upfront. We will not be leaving the party, but will oppose Sohana’s candidature,” said former Mohali truck union president Sukhwinder Singh Shindi.Will sort out issues with disgruntled leaders: SohanaMeanwhile, Parvinder Singh Sohana said that he would soon hold a meeting with disgruntled leaders, and “we will sort out all issues”. “They all are hard-core members of the party, and all will work unitedly to win the seat,” he said. A former Labourfed chairman, Sohana, who was holding the post of Youth Akali Dal (Mohali) president, left the SAD in January last year before the municipal corporation elections, owing to differences with former MP Prem Singh Chandumajra.He joined hands with the Azad group, led by former mayor Kulwant Singh, following which the SAD expelled him from the party. In the elections, the Azad group won 11 seats, with Sohana’s wife Harjinder Kaur being one of the winning candidates. While 37 seats went to the Congress, the SAD drew a blank.Later in October, Sohana, along with his wife and supporters, returned to the SAD fold in the presence of Sukhbir Singh Badal, who assured him and his team members due honour and recognition in the party.

The district reported 12,705 Covid cases on Monday. According to official records of the district health department, the highest single-day spike was 2,230 cases on January 12 this year, the second highest was 1,873 on January 15 this year, and the third highest was 1,822 cases on May 5, 2021. The total number of Covid cases reported in January 2022 alone is 18,400, nearly as much as the tally in May 2021 -- 18,729 -- which was the highest ever.The positivity rate on Monday stood at 20%, the same as the past few days, despite a continuous rise in the number of Covid cases.The district has recorded nearly 2,500 recoveries till Monday, with no hospitalisation in the past 24 hours.This is for the first time in nearly a month that the active Covid cases recorded on Monday are less than the previous day, and more than 2,000 people recovered within 24 hours.“It seems like there is a decline in the number of cases. Additionally, another relief is that we still don’t have critical Covid patients who need hospitalisation. Most of the hospitalised patients have comorbidities... People can continue with their daily work along with following Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate. So far, a total of 82,323 cases have been reported in the district and 1,841,317 tests have been conducted. Also, 3,545,000 vaccination doses have been administered to the beneficiaries in Noida so far, including 2,081,000 first doses, 1,451,000 second doses and 12,710 precautionary doses. BJP campaign in Noida hits Covid roadblockSitting MLA and BJP’s candidate for the Noida assembly elections, Pankaj Singh, tested positive for Covid on Sunday. Singh said he has mild symptoms and has isolated himself. “I request all those who have come in contact with me to isolate themselves and get tested. I will constantly be in touch with the people and party workers online and hope to come back soon in the field,” he tweeted.

18-01-2022||Lucknow||SP gave tickets to criminal elements: Yogi||GHAZIABAD Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday accused Samajwadi Party (SP) leaders of giving tickets to “criminal elements” on different seats of western Uttar Pradesh and slammed the party for not announcing its candidate list publicly. Lashing out at the SP for its candidates from Kairana, Bulandshahr, and Loni, Adityanath said, “By announcing criminals responsible for the exodus of traders from Kairana, the criminals of the Muzaffarnagar riots and professional history-sheeters as its candidates, the Samajwadi Party has once again shown its true character.”“The SP has proved that it is trying to project people who are against social justice, Dalits, poor, backward classes, traders and common man. They have not strayed from their actual habits and such habits don’t improve easily,” said the CM who was in Ghaziabad to review the Covid situation and was likely to flag off the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) election campaign vehicles on Tuesday. As many as 58 Assembly segments in 11 districts, including Ghaziabad and Gautam Buddh Nagar, will go to polls in the first phase of UP elections scheduled to begin on February 10. The CM highlighted the works of his government during the pandemic situation, but later lashed out at the SP in reply to a question from the media. “We all know that during five years, our government cracked down hard and instilled fear among goonda elements and gave a secure environment to the people,” the CM said during a media briefing held at Santosh Medical College, a Covid facility. During the 2017 Assembly elections, the BJP banked heavily on the issue of rising crime in UP and promised that it would crack down on criminal elements. The UP CM also took pot shots at the Samajwadi Party for not announcing its candidate list publicly and alleged that the party was “giving symbols under the table” for the UP polls. “They are abstaining from making their candidate list public and have again started practices of doing things ‘under the table.’ But I wish to assure people of UP that with their blessings, we will form the majority government on March 10 and bring all criminals to justice,” added the CM. Adityanath’s attack on SP comes after recent developments where several OBC faces from the BJP switched sides to the SP. The names included former minister Swami Prasad Maurya, Dharam Singh Saini and Dara Singh Chauhan among others. The BJP assumed power in UP while contesting on 384 seats in 2017 Assembly elections and emerged winner from 312 seats. This led to the ouster of the government of Samajwadi Party, which contested on 311 seats and secured win only on 47. Office-bearers of the SP, however, accused the UP CM of allegedly violating the code of conduct, which is already in place. “The CM was on an official visit to Ghaziabad and should not have made political comments. It amounts to election campaign. There are lot of people in the BJP with criminal records and the actual standing of the party will come to fore after the first phase of the elections. The SP will win the elections in a thumping manner,” said Rashid Malik, district president of Samajwadi Party. In Ghaziabad, the BJP as well as the SP, along with its ally - the Rashtriya Lok Dal, have fielded five candidates on as many assembly seats so far. The district has five assembly segments of Loni, Muradnagar, Sahibabad, Ghaziabad and Modinagar with all five seats won by BJP candidates. Last week, the BJP announced their list and fielded all the five sitting MLAs from their respective seats in Ghaziabad while they also gave tickets to all the three sitting MLAs from three seats of Noida, Jewar and Dadri in Gautam Buddh Nagar.
