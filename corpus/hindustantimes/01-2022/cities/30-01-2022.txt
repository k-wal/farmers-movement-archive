30-01-2022||Lucknow||BJP women teams, panna pramukhs reaching out to voters in Ayodhya||Lucknow: After announcing candidates on all five assembly segments in Ayodhya, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is trying to reach out to voters with the help of women workers and panna pramukhs, along with others. The BJP has constituted 35 teams of women workers of the party for door-to-door campaigning in the five assembly segments. Each team will have five members to fulfill Covid-19 guidelines of the Election Commission of India (ECI). A separate team of 700 panna pramukhs has also been activated in the temple town to contact every voter personally or on phone. Out of 35 teams of women workers, maximum 10 are active in Ayodhya (Sadar) assembly segment which is considered a VIP constituency. Ram Janmabhoomi is a part of this assembly segment. The remaining 25 teams are campaigning in the rest of the four assembly seats. “From Ayodhya (Sadar) to rural pockets of the district, these teams are reaching out to voters with the list of development projects executed by the Centre and the state governments in Ayodhya,” said Ashoka Dwivedi, former district president of the BJP Mahila Morcha, Ayodhya. The ongoing construction of Ram temple tops the list of promises fulfilled by the BJP in Ayodhya with which these workers are trying to convince voters to vote for the BJP. “All assembly seats are important for us. But extra attention is being given to Ayodhya assembly seat due to its VIP status,” said Bindu Singh, district vice president, Mahila Morcha, BJP, Ayodhya. “Traders and locals in this constituency are upset with the BJP due to the proposed road widening project that will displace a large number of shops and commercial establishments,” said another BJP Mahila Morcha leader. “The Samajwadi Party is trying to cash in on this resentment. We all are aware of this situation. In the 2012 assembly polls, the Samajwadi Party had won this seat (Ayodhya assembly). So special emphasis is being given to this constituency,” she added. As many as 700 panna pramukhs of the BJP are also active in temple town. A panna pramukh is in charge of a page of voters’ list. He is the first point of contact for most voters in the BJP’s election management machinery. Importance of a panna pramukh in BJP can be gauged by the fact that the party has appointed CM Yogi Adityanath as panna pramukh for booth number 246 of Gorakhpur Urban assembly seat from where he is contesting assembly poll. Ayodhya Sadar, Rudauli, Gosaiganj, Bikapur and Milkipur are the five seats in Ayodhya district. Polling in Ayodhya will be held on March 3 which is the sixth and penultimate phase of polling in Uttar Pradesh assembly polls. In the 2012 assembly polls, the Samajwadi Party had won four out of five assembly seats in the district. 
30-01-2022||Lucknow||Boost to BJP as SP’s Dalit leader joins Apna Dal (S)||LUCKNOW: In a boost to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Sirathu assembly segment of Kaushambi from where deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya is contesting, two-time lawmaker from the seat Vachaspati joined the Apna Dal (S) on Sunday. Apna Dal (S) is a BJP ally and Vachaspati is a Dalit, a community which dominates Sirathu assembly segment. More important, Vachaspati was with the Samajwadi Party and BJP leaders feel that his joining the Apna Dal (S) is a blow to the main opposition party. Vachaspati was first elected lawmaker from the seat on a BSP ticket in 2007 and subsequently won the assembly by-poll in 2014 on a Samajwadi Party ticket. The by-poll took place after Keshav Prasad Maurya quit the seat on getting elected to the Lok Sabha from Phulpur. “Vachaspati owns several educational institutions in Prayagraj and his wife Madhupati has twice been a zila panchayat president from Kaushambi,” Apna Dal (S) spokesman Rajesh Patel said. Sirathu is Keshav Prasad Maurya’s birth place from where he won his first assembly election in 2012. Apna Dal (S) also announced Jai Kumar Singh Patel ‘Jacky’ as its candidate from Bindki assembly segment of Fatehpur. Bindki was with the BJP in the 2017 UP polls. Jai, a minister of state in the Yogi Adityanath government, is currently a lawmaker from Jahanabad assembly segment that is also in Fatehpur. The Apna Dal and BJP have been discussing each seat and have been fielding candidates strategically. This is the fourth list of Apna Dal (S) which has been announcing candidates in phases and has so far named six candidates, five of them on seats that were held by the BJP in the 2017 UP polls. It had earlier declared former lawmaker Rashmi Arya as its candidate from Mauranipur assembly segment in Bundelkhand, Haider Ali Khan for the Swar Tanda seat in Rampur against SP veteran Azam Khan’s son Abdullah Azam, Dr Saroj Kureel for Ghatampur in Kanpur Nagar district, Ram Niwas Verma for Nanpara in Bahraich district and Dr Surbhi in Farrukhabad district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/boost-to-bjp-as-sp-s-dalit-leader-joins-apna-dal-s-101643566765106.html

However, the switch wasn’t easy. She found it discomforting and difficult to breathe during the initial few days. The mask often triggered headaches. “For people with asthma, there is a kind of insecurity associated with breathing. Using a mask triggers that insecurity,” shared Kanga, adding, “In the pandemic I was able to gradually condition myself to use an N95 and settled for the design that fits me well.”Masks help in trapping tiny respiratory droplets expelled into the air while breathing, talking, coughing and sneezing. Masks not only protect a person from coming in contact with such droplets, but they also prevent letting the droplets expelled by people out in the air. As the Covid-19 infection spread through these droplets, masks became a mainstay. But for patients with asthma, like Kanga, adapting to the use of masks has not been an easy journey. “Patients who have not been taking proper medications and who don’t have their asthma in control, face the most difficulties adapting to masks,” said chest physician Dr Prashant Chhajed from Santacruz based Lung Care and Sleep Centre, who has been treating Kanga for the past few years. “Patients like Kanga, who have been on proper and regular medication adapt well,” he said. According to Chhajed, the use of masks has benefited patients with upper airway allergies triggered by smog, dust particles and other pollutants, but those with advanced lung diseases have had to grapple with discomfort. Researchers at the University of Illinois Chicago conducted an online survey of 501 adults with asthma and found that 84% experienced discomfort, and 75% reported trouble breathing or shortness of breath at least a little of the time while wearing a mask. The researchers also found an association between poor asthma control and breathing issues after wearing a mask. “This finding is likely due to the fact that those with uncontrolled asthma are more likely to experience shortness of breath and trouble breathing even without a mask,” Dr Sharmilee Nyenhuis, a co-author of the study was quoted in a media release. The study was published in the January issue of The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice. While a well fitted N95, or double masking is considered the most effective way of preventing Covid-19, some doctors allowed their asthma patients to use a simple cloth mask or a surgical mask to improve the wearability. “It becomes a question of having some protection, instead of nothing at all,” said physician Dr Jalil Parker from Lilavati Hospital, who has had many of his asthma patients reaching out with frantic complaints about uneasiness due to masks. “Many of them had worsened allergic manifestations. At times, the fibres in the masks also cause irritation in the nasal mucosa (the tissue lining the nasal cavity) triggering sneezes,” he said, adding that some of his patients had to use the bronchodilators more frequently than before. “I strictly asked my patients to avoid crowds or stepping out in case they could not adapt to wearing a mask. But cloth masks and surgical masks have been most convenient for them,” said Parkar. The University of Illinois Chicago study team highlighted the need of taking mask breaks, as they found more symptoms associated with a longer duration of wearing masks. “Mask breaks allow one with an opportunity to take large, deep breaths and do some breathing techniques,” Nyenhuis said. The team also recommended that employers should consider making accommodations for those with asthma to take safe mask breaks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/experts-insist-on-finding-right-fit-taking-safe-mask-breaks-to-asthma-patients-101643565624403.html

The late ND Patil was a founding member and chairperson of the Samiti up until his death on January 17. Avinash Patil, who worked closely with primary founder Narendra Dabholkar, has been an office bearer and a vocal critic of the working style of Dabholkar’s children - Mukta Dabholkar and Hamid Dabholkar. Dabholkar was shot dead by two two bike-borne assailants on August 20, 2013, near Omkareshwar bridge while he was on a morning walk.“Even after multiple discussions with the Hamid– Mukta led group, the democratic and working style of MANS that was established through the 30 years’ worth of the organisation’s work, was not acceptable to them. This faction started by them took over the mouthpiece of the organisation that has been operational for almost 30 years… for the financial dealings of Mans, a trust was formed in 1993 and registered in Satara. Prataprao Pawar is the founding chairman of the trust. After the death of Narendra Dabholkar the position of founding executive president was given to his wife Sheila Dabholkar. The account of the trust of the organisation has Rs7crore that was gathered over the past 25 years by the continuous work of members and workers of the organisation. The family dominated faction has taken over the trust with its accounts,” reads a part of the statement issued by Patil.Members of the Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti, who have remained tight-lipped about the comments made by Patil over the past year, have also issued a statement refuting all the claims made by him.“Avinash Patil, Who was asked to leave the organisation last year, has started his own organisation called Vivek Jagar, and he has been repeatedly told to not use the organisation’s name, as we do not have any operational or financial relation with him anymore. We further state that Hamid and Mukta Dabholkar are not trustees of the MANS’ trust. The two along with all the other trustees have never drawn money from the trust accounts. On the contrary they have found donations for the trust on multiple occasions. In fact, the MANS’ trust functions in a space that was given to the trust by the Dabholkar family for free and the newspaper is also published from there,” reads a statement from Deepak Girme, secretary, MANS trust.“These blatantly false allegations have been made out of personal malice. We are not trustees of the MANS trust. We have never taken money in form of salary or even travel expense from the trust. We are common workers of the MANS initiative and will remain so. When the time is right we will make a detailed statement of our side,” read a statement by Mukta and Hamid Dabholkar.The development comes at a time when Narendra Dabholkar’s murder trial has begun in the court of special judge SR Navander. The defence lawyers of the five accused in the case have long been raising the issue of financial misgivings with the trust. However, Hamid Dabholkar, who was examined as a prosecution witness during the trial, has refuted all the claims made by the defence in the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/dispute-arises-between-trust-members-of-dabholkar-s-andhashradha-nirmoolan-samiti-101643565143549.html

It is not the same coalition it used to be when all allies were given weightage. All constituents of NDA should have got a share in seat adjustment for the upcoming polls,” Sahani told the media. Speaking to ANI, Sahani said, “The government in Bihar stands because of Manjhi-Sahani. JDU-BJP thinks they’re powerful and have taken the right decision. This is like Hitlershahi.”The VIP chief, however, stated categorically that he would continue to stay in the NDA government as the people of Bihar have given the ruling coalition to run the government.On Saturday, the ruling JD(U) and BJP agreed on seat-sharing formula in which BJP would contest 12 seats, JD(U) 11 while one seat has been allotted to Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party (RLJP) led by Pasupati Kumar Paras.In the last one week, the VIP chief has been vocal against the BJP by accusing the saffron party of not following the ‘coalition dharma’ after failing to get some seats in alliance with the national party in Uttar Pradesh polls.Sahani, who is contesting the UP polls alone in a sizable number of seats, had even dropped hints of switching sides by stating he would not mind working with the leader of the opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav in the future if they reach an understanding on common issues.The state BJP leaders including environment and forest minister Neeraj Kumar Singh had hit back at Sahani stating that the exit of VIP from the ruling coalition would not affect the stability of the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/vip-to-contest-24-seats-of-council-on-its-own-sahani-says-will-continue-in-nda-101643565023656.html

Exam halls will be sanitised daily”, said an official of BSEB.In an effort to ease the difficulty of students due to Covid-19 triggered academic disturbance, the board has doubled the questions giving students an alternative option for each question.“Of the 100 marks exam, 50 objective-type questions carrying one mark will be asked while the rest 50 marks will comprise subjective questions. In both sections, students will have alternative question options. The change in question pattern has been done in view of students’ welfare”, said an official.The board will provide OMR sheets and answer sheets carrying a pre-printed photograph of the student along with other details including name, roll number, roll code, subject code, and date of the examination for eliminating imposters.Elaborating on the arrangements for conducting a free and fair examination, Anand Kishor, chairman of BSEB, said, “CCTV cameras have been installed at all examination centres. For every 25 candidates, one invigilator will be appointed and one videographer for every 500 examinees will be deployed for strict surveillance. Two-step frisking of students, first at the entrance gate of the exam centre and second at the exam hall, will be done to ensure no unfair element is being carried by the examinees.”The board has also issued direction to invoke CrPC Section 144 within radius of 200-meter of every examination centre prohibiting entrance of any person other than concerned officials.“In case of printing error or mismatch of the photograph, the examinee can provide any of the six ID proofs including Aadhaar card, PAN card, voter ID, passport, driving license, and photo attached bank passbook.

30-01-2022||Lucknow||No appointment in excess of 69,000 teachers in UP: HC||The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court has directed the state government to not make any appointment of assistant primary teachers except for 69,000 posts that were advertised in December 2018. On January 5 this year, the state government had released an additional list of 6,800 selected candidates for the assistant primary teachers’ post. This list was in addition to 69,000 posts filled by the government. The government took the decision after certain reserved category candidates secured more marks than the cut-off marks for general category candidates. One Bharti Patel and five others had challenged this list in the high court. A single judge bench of Justice Rajan Roy in its recent order observed: “Now, it is for the State to decide what it has to do in the matter as it has created this situation, but one thing is clear that persons cannot be appointed beyond 69000 vacancies.” The court further observed that once all the advertised 69,000 posts of assistant primary teachers were filled, a new list of more candidates cannot be issued without conducing fresh selection for excess seats or removing same number of selected candidates who had fewer marks than these 6,800 candidates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/no-appointment-in-excess-of-69-000-teachers-in-up-hc-101643564783547.html

We don’t go by media reports,” said Jha, adding that Congress has also decided to go ahead with its plan to contest all 24 Council seats in the absence of an invitation from the RJD on seat-sharing. “We have submitted the panel of contestants to party in-charge Bhakta Charan Das. The final decision will be taken by the party high command,” Jha added.Reacting on Tejashwi’s statement, AICC media panelist Prem Chandra Mishra said that Tejashwi must clarify which party RJD is aligned within Bihar, if not the Congress. “By stating that the RJD is with the Congress at the Centre, Yadav is acknowledging the party’s strength. It would have been better to attack the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) rather than criticizing the Congress,” said Mishra.BPCC’s chief spokesman Rajesh Rathore said that the party has prepared a panel of 22-23 strong candidates to contest from 12-13 seats, out of the 24. “We are ready to field capable leaders from seven-eight seats in case there is no seat-sharing deal with the RJD and left parties,” said Rathore.Meanwhile, the RJD has finalized its nominees for 23 seats to contest the Council elections, leaving the Bhagalpur seat for the CPI. “All the candidates have been asked to start campaigning in their respective local bodies constituencies,” said RJD spokesman Mrityunjay Tiwari.

30-01-2022||Mumbai||ME/MTech courses lose sheen, seat vacancy at 60-65% for last three years||Mumbai: A trend reversal seems to be in process in technical postgraduate degrees. Once sought-after courses for engineering graduates, the seat vacancy in Masters of Engineering (ME/MTech) has remained between 60 and 65 percent in the last three years. Figures released by the state common entrance test (CET) cell reveal that nearly 70 percent of seats in these courses had no takers in the 2021-22 academic year, meaning 7 out of 10 seats remained vacant across the state.Experts have attributed this decline to multiple reasons, including lack of jobs for ME/MTech graduates and absence of curriculum updation.“ME/MTech graduates have realised that their skillset remains almost similar in comparison to undergraduate engineering courses even after completing a 2-year PG course. Students now prefer to get work experience and then apply to a B-school for a Masters in Business Administration (MBA) program with the hope of upgrading their curriculum vitae, thus attracting better job offers,” said the director of a city-based engineering institute.Hiring trend across sectors has also played a big part in decline for the demand of MTech courses, said experts. “Most companies prefer a BTech graduate over an MTech graduate because their skills are not very different and BTech graduates agree to work for less salary,” said SS Mantha, former chairman of the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE).Besides, more and more companies are seeking graduates with knowledge beyond just engineering, so many opt for BTech with a Master’s in business or financial management with the hope for better employment opportunities, Mantha added.Over the last few years, several engineering institutes in Maharashtra have shut down some divisions or the ME/MTech course altogether due to falling demand. This year, while the intake for BE/BTech stood at 1.39 lakh, the total intake for ME/MTech was a mere 13,095, less than 10 percent of the total seats in the undergraduate course.“Masters in Engineering has been a course picked by those who wish to take up teaching. However, engineering institutes stagnated and therefore hiring of new teachers has also reduced over the years. Many institutions, including ours, dropped the course altogether due to falling numbers,” said Gopakumaran Thampi, principal of Thadomal Shahani Engineering College, Bandra.Placements across undergraduate engineering institutes in the country ended on a high note this academic year with a higher number of students securing placements with better packages in comparison to the last two years. However, the trend does not reflect on ME/MTech placements.As per figures shared on the AICTE website, placements for ME/MTech stood at 24.27 percent of the total enrollment in the 2020-21 academic year.Talent acquisition experts say that over the years, employers have stopped mentioning ME/MTech as an eligibility criteria in job descriptions.“It is very rare for employers to seek students with MTech qualifications because many have realised that curriculum for BTech and MTech is not very different, so they would rather hire postgrads from management and finance fields,” said Ratna Pathak, a talent acquisition specialist.Experts also feel it is time to update the engineering curriculum keeping specialisations in mind. “The authorities have introduced newer concepts like Artificial Intelligence and Data Science in undergraduate engineering courses but the basic concepts of several forms of engineering seem to be missing from the curriculum. Instead of simply adding new subjects, we need to focus on the overall development of the existing syllabus for UG and PG engineering courses which will ultimately attract more students,” added former AICTE chairman Mantha.

It has been noticed that students have become rather comfortable about online exams and for the sake of their future career, it has become necessary to conduct offline exams at least for final year students. Rajesh Pande, SPPU management council member, said, “Despite the Covid cases rising in the state, the board examination of Class 10 and 12 students is going to be held offline this year. So considering this decision of the state government and for the benefit of the students, our demand is that at least the examinations of final year students should be taken offline and we are going to raise that demand in the meeting.”Another member Sanjay Chakane said, “Many students are getting rather comfortable as there are online examinations to be held this semester but it is not right for the future career of the students. While getting admission for further courses and even for job opportunities, it is going to be difficult for final year students. So, our demand is that the exams be held offline for them.”For the last one month, the SPPU senior officials and deans have been discussing about conducting the examination. The decision was expected to be taken in January and now colleges from all three districts – Pune, Nashik and Ahmednagar are about to start from February 1.One of the senior SPPU officials on condition of anonymity said, “The SPPU first semester exams are going to be held in the month of February and discussions on how to conduct them are underway. For final year students, it will be offline exams and for the rest of the students, it will be both online and offline.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/demand-to-hold-offline-exams-for-final-year-students-at-pune-varsity-101643564305006.html

Surprisingly, the number of chain pulling incidents has increased while trains are standing at platforms and not while they are running. The Pune railway division has collected nearly Rs141,000 in fines from these offenders.Pune railway spokesperson Manoj Jhawar said, “It has become a tendency for passengers to simply pull the chain for silly reasons such as luggage left outside, family members having stepped out of the train to get snacks or water, ticket left at home or elsewhere or wanting to catch the train despite being late. Especially during peak season when the railway is trying to maintain the punctuality of trains and chain pulling takes place, it becomes difficult for railway operations. Passengers should understand and pull the chain only in case of a real emergency.”“When the chain is pulled whilst the train is standing at the station, our RPF staff has to find out from which bogey it has been pulled and then search for the person who has done it. A lot of time is wasted and ultimately, it impacts the other trains arriving at the station,” Jhawar said. If a person is found guilty of pulling the chain without any valid reason, he or she will be fined Rs1,000 or jailed for a year or both under the Indian Railways Act.A senior RPF official said on condition of anonymity, “We have appointed our two constables especially for checking chain pulling incidents at the station. Passengers should also understand and use the chain only if necessary. Many times when we catch people for chain pulling, they give false reasons and we have to then investigate them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/929-chain-pulling-cases-in-pune-railway-division-in-2021-101643563944280.html

30-01-2022||Mumbai||Congress leader Nana Patole’s statement on Gandhi sparks fresh row||Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) president Nana Patole has sparked a row after he referred to Mahatma Gandhi’s assassination as a ‘vadh’ instead of ‘hatya.’ The term ‘vadh’ refers to the slaying of evil while ‘hatya’ is assassination or murder. The party was quick to term the incident as a slip of term.Speaking at Congress event to mark Mahatma’s death anniversary on Sunday, Patole said, “Today, the first terrorist in the country came forth in the form of Mahatma Gandhi’s assassin Nathuram Godse when he killed Gandhi (Aajchya divshi Mahatma Gandhincha vadh Nathuram Godse hyanni kela).” Hindu right-wingers usually refer to Gandhi’s killing as a vadh, thus justifying his killing.Atul Londhe, spokesperson, MPCC, said that this was a slip of the tongue and added that Patole had referred to Godse as India’s first terrorist for assassinating Mahatma Gandhi.Meanwhile, Leader of Opposition in the state legislative council Praveen Darekar sought Patole’s apology saying that he has often lost control over his words while speaking. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former minister Chandrashekhar Bavankule also said Patole was maligning the image of Congress.Patole’s statements have often landed him in the eye of controversy. From claiming that he was under police surveillance, ruffling allies Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Shiv Sena by stating that the Congress would fight elections on its own, and complaining of irregularities in the allocation of a coal washing tender, which was seen as an attack on party colleague and energy minister Nitin Raut, Patole’s utterances have left the Congress red-faced.Earlier this month, Patole, who was in Bhandara district, claimed that he could beat and abuse Modi. When the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) took umbrage, Patole claimed he was referring to a local goon who was the namesake of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/congress-leader-nana-patole-s-statement-on-gandhi-sparks-fresh-row-101643561603747.html
30-01-2022||Pune||Fatal quirk of Covid curve in Pune: High vax rate, high new case nos, high death count||PUNE Districts that have been reporting a major chunk of the new Covid-19 cases in the state for the past two weeks,despite having a high vaccination rate, are also reporting a higher number of Covid-19 related deaths. Although there is a declining trend of new Covid-19 cases in most districts over the past week, between January 23 and 30, districts that have reported the most deaths are Mumbai (80), Pune city (25), Nashik (15), Solapur (12) and Satara (47). The state reported a total of 451 deaths in the said period. In the week between January 21 and 27, districts with highest positivity rate were Aurangabad with 36.2%, Gadchiroli with 44.8%, Nagpur with 45%, Nashik 38.7%, Pune at 40% and Washim at 38.7% all of which is much higher than the weekly state positivity rate, which stood at 22.2%. According to the state health department the vaccination rate for districts reporting Covid-related deaths and new cases are Mumbai, which has a fully vaccinated sate of 87.60%, Pune, which is at 79.21%, Bhandara at 80.08%, Sindhudurg at 76.40%, and Nagpur at 63.17%. However, the vaccinations rate for Nashik is 51.54% and Thane is at 65.93%. Districts with the least fully vaccinated percentage, namely are Nandurbar (41.98%), Beed (44.06%), Nanded (46.25%), Akola (43.56%) are not reporting as many deaths or new cases, as the metros or cities neighbouring the metros. The state average stands at 61.86% for fully vaccinated beneficiares. Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer said, “with a large number of breakthrough infections and re-infections being reported, it does not guarantee that cities which did report a large number of new cases in the first two waves would be safer this wave. However, in the second wave we did see districts in Konkan region with a slower rise and a slower fall compared to metro cities. The curve has its own geographical leaning specific to the region. We are only trying to boost vaccination in the most remote parts because as of now we know for sure that vaccination helps reduce severity and thereby deaths.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/fatal-quirk-of-covid-curve-in-pune-high-vax-rate-high-new-case-nos-high-death-count-101643561483589.html

Covid cases will be monitored closely till February 15 and a decision will be taken subsequently after that regarding offline board examination,” said Gaikwad The proposal was sent to the government after an online meeting with education officials and minister of state for education, Bacchu Kadu. Officials from the education department said Kadu emphasised postponing the examination on the grounds of syllabus not being completed on time in many schools. Sharad Gosavi, chairman of Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) said that last week, an online meeting was conducted regarding the offline examination. “The meeting was conducted with minister of state for education, Bacchu Kadu, after which we have sent a proposal to the education minister about postponing the examination due to the increase in Covid cases. The education minister will take a call in the next few days,” said Gosavi. “We understand that students are in the exam mindset and we do not want any confusion pertaining to the examination. And so the decision will be taken in the next few days,” said Gosavi. As per the timetable declared in December, the HSC exam is scheduled from March 4 to March 30 and for SSC, the examination dates are between March 15 and April 4. The Principal’s Association of Maharashtra State Secondary and Higher secondary school has also urged the board to conduct the exam as scheduled saying many schools have already finished their syllabus. An official letter issued by the association noted that the schools in rural parts of Maharashtra started from July 15 last year and schools in many urban parts started from October last year. “Schools have conducted online and offline classes and made an effort to finish the syllabus of Class 10 and Class 12 at the earliest. There are many schools who have conducted revision tests for students. We urge you to clear the confusion surrounding the offline board exam and conduct the exam as scheduled,” said JK Patil, president, Maharashtra state principals’ association. Last year, due to the second Covid wave, the offline examination was postponed several times. And was later cancelled as other boards cancelled their offline examinations. A senior board official on the condition of anonymity maintained that the exam should be conducted as scheduled. “Students are taking vaccinations. And by the exam schedule, both their doses will be over. Fully vaccinated students will be safe to attend the paper offline. Moreover, conducting online examinations for all students across Maharashtra is not a feasible plan as infrastructure is limited for online mode,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ssc-hsc-exams-govt-to-take-postponement-decision-in-feb-principals-oppose-move-101643560163418.html
30-01-2022||Mumbai||MVA here for next 25 years, Sena-BJP reunion not possible: Sanjay Raut||Chief Minister and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray’s frontal attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) indicates that the party has shut its doors on any possible reconciliation with the former ally, said senior Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut.“His speech gave one message that the grand alliance between Congress, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Shiv Sena is the political future of Maharashtra,” Raut said referring to Thackeray’s address to the party cadre on the birth anniversary of party supremo Bal Thackeray.“The speculations about under-the-table dealings and discussions with the BJP have been scotched. In his speech on 23 January, Uddhav Thackeray made a strong attack on the BJP. Thackeray had never exposed the BJP’s pretentiousness and fake Hindutva to this extent,” Raut wrote in his weekly column in the party mouthpiece Saamna.He also pointed to Thackeray’s statement that the alliance with the BJP since 1989 had hindered the Shiv Sena’s growth.“Uddhav Thackeray’s speech and Devendra Fadnavis’ reply to it has cleared the air of confusion that was prevailing in Maharashtra’s politics. The doubts about Thackeray and some leaders being secretly in touch with the BJP, and the present government being a temporary arrangement, have been cleared. Now, coming together is not possible, and Fadnavis’ reply in stern language, shows that the window (of rapprochement) is not open,” said Raut.“The politics of Maharashtra has changed completely. The picture suggests that this change (the MVA government) will stay for the next 25 years,” he claimed.Raut further said that while Hindutva could not be the monopoly of any political party, it was only Sena supremo Bal Thackeray who had espoused an aggressive form of the ideology.Reacting to the column, BJP MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar attacked Raut for claiming the longevity of the MVA and pointed to how the Shiv Sena’s performance in the recent local body elections was sub-par. “They were eager to ally with us for the past two years, but the BJP spurned these overtures. The day Shiv Sena compromised on Hindutva, BJP had decided that it would not ally with them again. Raut has realised this after two years,” he claimed.Shiv Sena was traditionally the senior and dominant partner in the saffron alliance with the BJP. However, BJP parted ways with Sena on the eve of the 2014 assembly elections and emerged as the single-largest party. Though the Shiv Sena joined the Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP government later, it was forced to play a second fiddle to the BJP.The two parties contested the 2019 assembly elections together. However, they parted ways following a dispute over sharing of the chief minister’s post. Sena later joined hands with traditional rivals NCP and Congress to form a government under Thackeray.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mva-here-for-next-25-years-sena-bjp-reunion-not-possible-sanjay-raut-101643559988856.html
30-01-2022||Pune||Ex-Pune police chief submits affidavit to Bhima Koregaon commission; hearings from Jan 31||PUNE Senior IPS officer and former police commissioner Rashmi Shukla has claimed in her affidavit submitted before the Bhima Koregaon inquiry commission that the city police handled the situation “tactfully” during the 2018 Bhima Koregaon clashes, preventing a major untoward incident in the city. Shukla, who was Pune police commissioner when the riots broke out, submitted a detailed affidavit on January 25 before the two-member commission headed by Justice (retd) J N Patel, which is conducting a probe into the violence. Hindustan Times has seen the copy of the affidavit. In her affidavit, she said the city police had anticipated that a large number of visitors would arrive from all over the state on that day, and had taken adequate precautions and preventive measures. “....due to said effective deployment of man power/police force, there was negligible incidence of stone pelting within my jurisdiction or violence in the limits of Pune city,” the affidavit stated. “There was neither any loss of human life nor any major outbreak of violence in the city. Also there was no untoward incident in Pune (district) after the evening of January 3, 2018,” Shukla added. Earlier, the commission’s lawyer Ashish Satpute had filed an application seeking that Shukla -- now deputed to the CRPF -- be directed to file an affidavit. Meanwhile, hearings of the Bhima Koregaon inquiry commission will resume at its Pune office on Monday, with Shukla and former additional superintendent of Pune rural police Tejashwi Satpute, among five people scheduled to record their statements before the commission, officials said. The scheduled hearings were suspended in the second week of January owing to a rise in Covid-19 infections. Others on the current list of witnesses to be examined include Sambhaji Shivale, Balasaheb Jamadar, and ACP Ramesh Galande. The commission that was formed on February 19, 2018, by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government led by the then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, has been granted nine extensions since. The current extension was granted in December 2021 and will last till June 30, 2022. During the riots that ensued in January 2018 during the 200th anniversary of the battle of Bhima Koregaon, one person died while scores were injured including some police officials. The commission was formed and tasked with finding out who was responsible for the violence while also suggesting policy changes to avoid such incidents in the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/bhima-koregaon-commission-to-resume-hearings-from-jan-31-in-pune-101643559983504.html

This is contradictory to the stand by several ministers in MVA including Ajit Pawar who vehemently argued that to consider wine as liquor will be mistake. “Let me make it clear that wine is not a liuor. The opposition may say whatever they want to,” Pawar had said while replying to the allegations of BJP which accused the government saying MVA wants to turn Maharashtra into “liquor state”. According to an official in the State excise, the rules for Indian made foreign liquor, wine and beer consumption are the same, and will require a license to stock and to serve. “Though there are different categories as to how much a person can buy or keep in his possession,” the official said.. According to Ajay Deshmukh, secretary Pune district Wine Merchant’s Association, “Those who wish to buy wines or any liquor off the counter require a drinking permit or license which are available on the Excise website.” According to Excise department, “There are around 1,685 wine shops in the state. The wine industry has a turnover of around ₹1,000 crore in India, of which 65% in Maharashtra. Most wineries are located in Nashik, which produces around 80% of India’s wine, and is referred to as the wine and grape capital of India, followed by Sangli, Pune, Solapur, Buldhana and Ahmednagar. As per the figures shared by state excise department, wine consumption in the state during the financial year for 2020-21 was just around 70 lakh litres. The beer consumption on the other hand stood at 30 crore litres, country liquor 32 crore litres and Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) at 20 crore litres.

Even the peak stage that came in early January only lasted for one week, following which cases started to decline steadily,” Kakani said on Sunday.He also mentioned that owing to the less severity of this variant, more than 70 per cent of the beds remained vacant throughout the third wave and most of the patients that required hospital admissions were either senior citizens with serious co-morbidities or unvaccinated or partially vaccinated citizens.Kakani also said that considering the fall in numbers, the BMC is set to take a call on issuing relaxations on some of the ongoing restrictions this week.“We may take a decision on relaxing a few curbs this week including extending operational hours of restaurants and allowing Mumbaikars in some of the open spaces,” he said.Meanwhile, experts said that while the Covid graph in Mumbai has started to show a downward trend, citizens should not become complacent and should continue to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour.Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state and national Covid task force, said that as migration and reverse migration happen through Mumbai regularly, one shouldn’t get complacent even though the number of cases has started to fall steadily. “This is because Mumbai as a city may have reached the plateau stage and is on the verge of decline, there are still many districts which are yet to reach their peak,” he added. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state Covid task force, said that the doubling rate of Mumbai is 375 days now.“Now that cases have started to go down, our primary objective should be bringing down the mortality rate. Treating serious patients and giving special attention to patients under oxygen and ventilation should be our priority,” said Dr Joshi.Out of the total cases that were reported on Thursday, 87% are asymptomatic and at present, there are 16,612 active cases in the city and the recovery rate of Mumbai is 97%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/tpr-on-decline-but-citizens-shouldn-t-get-complacent-101643558003461.html

The public hearing for which should be completed by February 28 and the expert committee should submit suggestions by March 2 to the SEC, which will then declare the final map of delimitation for the forthcoming civic elections. While the current tenure of the PMC’s general body ends on March 15, the notification has accelerated the process of holding polls to various civic bodies across Maharashtra, including Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. The SEC’s notification also makes it clear that the representation of women in the PMC post-election will be more than men after the strength of the house has been increased from 164 to 173 considering the 23 villages merged with the PMC and the rise in the city’s population.As per the notification, there will be a total 58 wards with 57 of them to elect three members while the remaining one ward will elect two members. As the state government legislation mandates that 50% of the seats in civic bodies be reserved for women, there will be in all 87 out of 173 seats reserved for women in the PMC.The battle for PMC will be crucial for all parties including the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Nationalist Congress Party, Congress, Shiv Sena and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena. Currently, the BJP controls the civic body with 98 corporators. After coming to power in the state in 2019, the NCP is looking to regain its control over the PMC, which has an annual budget of Rs6,700 crore. The SEC has considered Pune’s population at 3,556,824, including 480,017 SCs and 41,561 STs, based on the 2011 census. Thus, the maximum population for a ward is 71,390 and the minimum is 37,589.

30-01-2022||Mumbai||Malwani police search for two bullets misplaced during mob control||Mumbai The officers of Malwani police station in Malad are desperately searching for two bullets for the last four days, which was misplaced by an officer when his holster came off while detaining members of protesting political parties on Republic Day.According to the police, on January 26, police inspector (PI) Mahendra Suryavanshi along with police sub-inspector (PSI) Sandeep Gadde were on bandobast duty near Charkop Naka. At around 3.45 pm, members of the Bajrang Dal, Vishwa Hindu Parishad namely Vivek Singh, Hagman Thakur, Arvind Dubey, Umesh Pandey and Pradeep Gaud and 250 more men had gathered at the spot shouting slogans, protesting the naming of a ground after erstwhile Mysuru ruler Tipu Sultan. As there were chances of the protest turning violent, at least 300 officials from Malwani and other police stations across the North region were present. The protest took place near the cemetery in the Charkop Naka signal till the Marve Road, where the Tipu Sultan ground is situated.Gadde said that when the protesters refused to calm down after repeated reasoning, the police officers decided to detain the crowd and started to herd the protestors in police vans. While Suryavanshi was escorting the protestors into the van, they unbuckled his belt. As a result, his service pistol dropped and a part of the magazine, along with five bullets, were scattered on the ground. With the help of the officers present at the spot, the area was searched but the police team only recovered three bullets. “Suryavanshi immediately informed his superiors about the missing bullets,” said Gadde in his statement. The Malwani police registered an FIR against the protestors and also about the misplaced bullets. They are searching in a radius of 500 mts from the cemetery to the bridge connecting Malwani to Uncles Kitchen signal.The police said that the search is intended to ensure that the bullets are not misused. The loss of a firearm or ammunition by a police officer while on duty can attract a departmental inquiry and hence, they are searching high and low. The police officers said that they have been checking CCTV footage of the area and also conducting a thorough manual search of the spot where the bullets fell. They have also taken down the statement of about 100 protesters. “Shopkeepers around the area have been asked to be alert. The ragpickers and auto drivers who frequent the spot have been told to be on a lookout for the bullets or person who may find them and try to pocket them,” said a police officer from Malwani police station. The officers also said that the incident was mentioned in the FIR. So far, the police are yet to get a response from the locals but they are of the opinion that the bullets might have rolled into one of the drains in the area. When contacted, Pravin Padwal, additional commissioner of police North Region, said that there could be a departmental enquiry in the matter. “The officer misplaced the bullets while controlling the crowd and as reported by the official, it is possible that the buckle of his holster broke due to the shoving and pushing,” he said. Gadde was not reachable for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malwani-police-search-for-two-bullets-misplaced-during-mob-control-101643554823151.html
30-01-2022||Mumbai||HC asks Spicejet to maintain status quo on employment of 463 staff||Mumbai The Bombay high court (HC) last week directed the management of Spicejet airlines to provide the list of fixed-term contractual employees who can be offered work after it was informed that the Industrial court had directed the airline to provide employment to 463 employees whose contract had come to an end on December 31, 2021, and were not guilty of misconduct. The HC held that as these employees had been with the company on two-year contracts for 8-9 years, they could not be retrenched as per the relevant provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act (IDA) and posted a hearing of the petition filed by the Spicejet management challenging the Industrial court order on February 8. The single-judge bench of justice Ravindra Ghuge, which was hearing the petition of the Chairman & Managing Director of Spice Jet Ltd. and another represented by advocates Mahesh Shukla and Niraj Prajapati, was informed that the members of the India Spice Jet Staff & Employees Association had not been retrenched as per the IDA and as their contracts had expired on December 31, 2021, the company had exercised its choice of not renewing their contracts. The advocates submitted that the members were employed on Fixed Term Contract basis and it was not a case of termination of their services. However, advocate Jai Prakash Sawant for the Association argued that the Industrial court had held that as there were no allegations of misconduct as per the IDA against any of the 463 members, hence, the company should provide employment to them as an interim arrangement. Advocate Sawant referred to the observation of presiding officer Shyam Garg of the Central Government Industrial Tribunal-2 wherein it was observed, “...prima facie case is in favour of 463 workers” and submitted that the act of the airline company of not renewing the contract was bad in law and against principles of natural justice. After hearing the submissions for some time, the bench of justice Ghuge observed, “It would be appropriate for the petitioner-management to tender a list of their workmen, who have been termed as fixed-term contractual employees, who can be offered work today.” The bench also noted that the arguments of the airline management that relevant provisions of IDA regarding non-renewal of contracts would be applicable to the employees was not valid. The court further directed the airline management and the members’ union to maintain the status quo and restrained the deployment of new contractual employees or personnel by any agency till the date of the next hearing on February 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-asks-spicejet-to-maintain-status-quo-on-employment-of-463-staff-101643554283318.html

30-01-2022||Pune||PMC lodged FIRs against 45 bogus doctors since 2013||PUNE The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) since 2013 has lodged 46 FIRs against 45 bogus doctors on various charges, and the health department of the corporation has been directed to go all out against quacks through a health ministry order during the second week of January this year. The ministry has ordered all health departments across Maharashtra to ensure strict action against such practitioners.The 45 doctors stand accused of various charges including practising without bonafide degrees, practising without licenses, practising by seeking registration with the state medical council, and practising in domains other than their subject of expertise. The PMC administration said that they have found malpractices related to practising without registration and holding degrees from states other than Maharashtra.Assistant medical officer Kalpana Baliwant said, “Till date, criminal cases have been lodged against 45 doctors in 46 different FIRs in the city. There is a case where a medical practitioner faces two FIRs. The ‘Bogus Doctor Finding and Action Committee’ meets every three months and recently a meeting was held where the issue was analysed and introspected in detail. Once we complete our verification, the details are sent to the legal department which examines the case and then an FIR is lodged.”The Bogus Doctor Finding and Action Committee has been constituted under PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar, PMC health officer, assistant health officer, and members of non-government organisations (NGOs) to delve deep into various complaints received by the civic body about malpractices and irregularities on the part of the accused medical practitioners (having questionable credentials). In the last three years alone, 10 FIRs have been lodged against bogus doctors found operating without valid registration and qualifications under the guidance of assistant medical officer Kalpana Baliwant.Pune mayor Muralidhar Mohol said, “As per government orders, the committee has been formed and we are taking very strong action against those found engaged in malpractices. As per the order of the health department, action has been taken and more action will be taken soon.”The PMC health department has also listed out challenges such as the lack of awareness among the police regarding how to register an FIR against bogus doctors. The health department has faced critical situations at police chowkies and police stations where the officers had no idea under which sections of the IPC charges could be lodged against the accused. The department has drawn the police’s attention to videos on social media where unqualified persons are peddling medical cure prescriptions and cheating citizens.Past incidentsMeanwhile, in December 2021 the Pune city police busted an illegal hair treatment and transplant clinic in Vimannagar, where three bogus doctors were arrested for cheating over 300 customers. According to the police, the accused were operating the Hair Magica Hair Transplant and Aesthetic Studio at the Sky Max Mall in Vimannagar without medical qualifications. Pune Municipal Corporation’s zonal medical officer Dr Rekha Galande lodged an FIR against Shahrukh Haider Shah and Chaitali Mhaske, both residents of Vadgaonsheri; and Panchshila Shendge, a resident of Ramwadi. Police Inspector Jayant Rajurkar said, “The accused pretended to be hair transplant expert doctors and duped customers of lakhs of rupees by playing with their lives. They did not have a valid license to conduct the business,” she said.Committee constitutedAs per the directives of the state government’s department of medical education and drugs, the municipal corporation level committee has been constituted. The chairman of the said committee is the municipal commissioner, the member-secretary is a medical officer of health; other members are the assistant medical officer of health, a legal expert, an information and public relations officer, and zonal medical officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-lodged-firs-against-45-bogus-doctors-since-2013-101643546722537.html

30-01-2022||Pune||Your Space: Pune civic body should provide water supply to merged villages||PMC is unable to provide tanker water to 23 merged villages and infrastructure work is underway for piped supply to reach these areas. With summer around the corner when the water crisis deepens, the tanker lobby raises the stakes. Our readers suggest steps to address the issueResponsibility lies with the civic administration It is the responsibility of the civic body to supply the villages with water. These 23 villages are now a part of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). We reside in Sus gaon, and we get hard water. It is not fit to drink or use. However, we are using it as it is. We are forced to use this water because the pipeline has not been operational yet. The PMC water that we get is treated and is not fit to drink directly. Because of the poor quality of water, the children in my family fall sick very often. I feel that the respective ward office will finish the work before summer approaches. It is not possible for every household to get water from tankers. If the groundwater has hard water, then the civic body should complete the work sooner to provide water to these villages. The issue of the merged villages has been dragging on for a very long time. It must be resolved soon to give relief to citizens in these parts of the city. -Sarika GaikwadNot everyone can afford water tankersI had rented a room in Dhayari area earlier as I was attending some coaching classes in the peth area. However, there was frequent water shortage which forced me to relocate to another area in the city. I would not be home during most part of the day due to my classes. I was forced to find a way to manage the water crisis. The water crisis has to be resolved by the PMC before summer begins. There are many societies where tankers supply water, but individual and small homes have to manage on their own. Water from the bore well is hard and is not fit for drinking. Many citizens have raised their voices against the crisis but the complainants have fallen on deaf ears. PMC should understand that citizens continue to suffer even when it is not summer. If the infrastructure was not in place then why has the PMC included these villages in its limits in the first place.-Nandini WaghmareProvide basic needs without extra costPune Municipal Corporation is responsible for providing the basic needs such as water to the citizens. If the water pipeline work is underway, they should make some other arrangements to help the residents in these areas. Citizens should not have to pay for the basic needs while also paying taxes for the same. The tanker mafia may cost an exorbitant amount when summer starts and the water crisis continues. Instead of the citizens having to pay for the tanker, the municipality should pay for it. Meanwhile, PMC can take as much time as they need to get the pipeline ready. The concern and focus should be that the citizens should not suffer.-Amruta DeshpandeDo not aid the water mafiaLast year the PMC decreased the quantity of water supplied per tanker. Many activists have raised concerns that this might aid the water mafia. If the water supply to these 23 merged villages is not in place, the water mafia may seek to benefit from this opportunity by charging many residents higher prices especially during the summer. Many big societies have made their own provisions to solve the water crisis issue. But as a tax paying citizen it is imperative for the civic body to help out citizens by providing basic infrastructure like pipelines. All across the city, we can see that potholes have been dug for the pipeline work. This work should be accelerated in order to finish it before summer season begins.-Niranjan Vaidya||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/your-space-pune-civic-body-should-provide-water-supply-to-merged-villages-101643539342408.html
30-01-2022||Delhi||No relaxation yet for gyms, owners worry about losses||The new order by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has no mention of reopening of gyms and fitness centres in the Capital, despite plenty of appeals and symbolic demonstrations. Several owners feel it is discriminatory that bars, restaurants and cinema halls are allowed to operate at 50% capacity but fitness establishments are still not allowed to function. They also staged another symbolic protest near Trauma Center, Civil Lines, on Saturday to demand for the reopening. “Government is not thinking about the five lakh families who depend on the fitness industry in Delhi. Everything else is open except gyms in the city. No study across the world has shown any Covid-19 transmission from gyms. We are always the first to close and the last to open. We condemn this decision by the DDMA to let everything function in Delhi, except gyms,” says Bhupender Sharma, president, Delhi Gym Association, who was at the protest. Some are struggling to clear outstanding payments and get rent waived off. Omesh Chandna, owner, Anytime Fitness, South Ex, says, “We have almost ₹20-25 lakhs outstanding which includes rentals, taxation and staff salary plus their incentives. And we don’t know when our situation will improve. It is suicidal for our business. The landlords are preferring other businesses over giving the place for rent to fitness centres.”Harnek Ghabri, owner, DNA Fitness, Janakpuri feels that this is an added stress in the times of pandemic. He says, “For some, it is tough to pay rent which can go up to two lakhs a month. So ever since 2020, the business is affected as gyms have been getting shut for longer duration. This is a mental torture as gyms are targeted everytime. More physical contact happens at salons, which didn’t even shut this time.”So, do online classes help in generating revenue? “It’s difficult to motivate clients to take the virtual mode; and then they ask to pause the membership and say that they will resume once the gyms are open. So our source of income gets impacted but we still have to pay the instructors as they’re full-time employed,” says Harpreet Singh, owner, Steppers Do The Step, Rajinder Nagar. Fitness enthusiasts also have concerns. Anam Qureshi, a south-Delhi resident, says, “If restaurants and bars can work with 50% capacity, then why not gyms? Is looking after one’s health not an essential service? How come bars fall under the essential category? Clearly, there is no rationale behind restraining gyms from operating. There is no science or logic behind this decision of the government, nor it has been proved yet.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-relaxation-yet-for-gyms-owners-worry-about-losses-101643530821867.html

30-01-2022||Chandigarh||Covid’s third wave deals blow to tourism in J&K||The third wave of Covid has impacted tourism in Jammu and Kashmir in January after it had made an encouraging comeback till the end of last year. From a record 1.4 lakh tourist arrivals in December 2021, the numbers this month have come down to less than half with just over 60,000 visitors till January 27. Officials of the tourism department said owing to escalating Covid cases this month, the tourist arrivals have come down, but not stopped. “The pandemic has an effect on the arrivals, but they have not plunged as well. People are still arriving while taking precautions. We had 60,000 to 65,000 arrivals in January so far, which is still a good number,” said Zeeshan Khan, assistant director, tourism department, publicity.Covid-induced global restrictions, early snowfall in Kashmir and a vigorous campaign by administration had triggered more inflow of tourists into the Valley in the last half of 2021 as the UT started opening more offbeat and virgin destinations to keep the sector thriving throughout the year. Over 1.27 lakh visitors toured places in the Himalayan valley in November 2021, which was a seven-year high for the month. October had witnessed a footfall of 91,000.Around 6.65 lakh tourists visited the Valley in 2021. In the few years before that, the numbers could hardly cross 2.5 lakh, excluding the pilgrims. The decrease in footfall has an obvious effect on those dependent on tourism.Manzoor Ahmad, a tourist cab driver in Srinagar, was busy throughout November and December, but had mostly been idle in January. “This month, I could just make a single trip to Gulmarg while in the past few months, I had not stopped for a single day. The pandemic and the associated lockdown affected our work a lot,” he added. Mostly, tourists in winters would rush to Gulmarg, located in the Pir Panjal mountain range in the western Himalayas, some 50km from Srinagar.Mukhtar Shah, president of Hoteliers Club Gulmarg, said the hotel occupancy has come down to 50%-60% from full bookings in December. Tourism players and tour operators are, however, hopeful that the new wave will be over by the middle of February and the sector will revive in time for the peak season in spring and summer.Shah said if Covid cases kept on reducing like they were currently across many Indian states, they expect a revival of the sector soon.“We expect a good summer season. People are not able to go out of India so they head to hill stations and Kashmir is their first preference. If Covid situation gets better like it appears currently, undoubtedly we will again have good arrivals,” he added. Farooq Ahmad Kuthoo, president, Travel Agents’ Association of Kashmir, said tour operators have started getting queries from prospective visitors. “People are waiting for the third wave to get over. We are already receiving calls from Maharashtra and Gujarat. We are hopeful that by February 15 , we will again have a good footfall of tourists,” he said.Tourism players have already started pushing for the revival of arrivals. A special FAM (familiarisation) tour of all leading tour and travel operators of Maharashtra and Pune was organised by local tour operators in collaboration with the tourism department from January 23 to 27 to promote Kashmir as the most preferred tourism destination.“Despite the pandemic, 16 leading tour and travel operators of Maharashtra and Pune arrived in Srinagar to see the real beauty of Kashmir and enjoy the cultural heritage, handicraft, food and hospitality measures during the tour,” said Nayeem Nazir, owner of Wayn Tours & Travels. Covid cases on a decline in J&KSrinagar: Covid cases have been on a decline in Jammu and Kashmir for the past four days with Saturday witnessing 4,175 infections and five deaths, prompting the health authorities to conclude that the third wave of the pandemic has reached its peak phase in the UT.Covid cases had breached all records since the pandemic started with 6,570 infections on January 25 (Tuesday). After that, the cases have slowly declined with 5,606 infections on Wednesday, 4,959 infections on Thursday, 4,354 infections on Friday and 4,175 cases on Saturday.“We are around the peak. The only question now is whether we have crossed it or about to cross it. It will take a few more days to say that with certainty,” said Dr Rouf Hussain Rather, community medicine specialist and in-charge, data analysis, divisional Covid control room in Kashmir.“In Srinagar, cases are plateauing, but in some other districts they are still around the peak,” he added.On Saturday, Kashmir valley saw almost 67% of the infections with 2,812 cases and two deaths while 1,363 cases and three deaths were reported in the Jammu division.As many as 7,107 patients recovered and again, the number of recoveries was more than fresh infections.The month of January so far has contributed 86,970 cases and 124 deaths to UT’s tally.The active cases in the union territory were at 42,219, decreasing from the highest such cases (47,969) on Wednesday (January 26).Officials said 76,507 tests were conducted in the past 24 hours in the UT, taking Saturday’s daily test positivity rate (TPR) to 5.45%However, of the 5,038 beds dedicated for Covid patients, just over 10.79% (544) are occupied in J&K.The total number of people who have recovered reached 3,81,389, while the recovery rate was at 89.05%. Since the pandemic started, the overall cases in J&K have mounted to 4,28,260 and the death toll stands at 4,652.Himachal logs 1,714 infectionsHimachal Pradesh recorded 1,714 fresh Covid infections on Saturday, taking the state’s total case tally to 2,69,291 while the death toll mounted to 3,969 after eight patients died of the viral infection.Highest 402 cases were reported from Shimla, 349 from Kangra, 224 from Shimla, 163 from Hamirpur, 144 from Solan, 111 from Bilaspur, 101 from Una, 82 from Sirmaur, 63 from Chamba, 51 from Kullu, 20 from Kinnaur and four from Lahaul-Spiti.Two fatalities each were reported from Chamba, Kangra and Kullu and one each from Kullu and Una.Active cases have come down to 9,453 after 2,005 people recuperated, taking the total recoveries to 2,55,848.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covids-third-wave-deals-blow-to-tourism-in-jk-101643494989422.html

30-01-2022||Chandigarh||Possibilities can never be ruled out: Jai Ram on HP cabinet reshuffle||A day after he called on Bharatiya Janata Party’s national chief JP Nadda in Delhi, Himachal Pradesh chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Saturday hinted towards a long-waited cabinet rejig. “Possibilities can never be ruled out,” Jai Ram told reporters in Shimla on the sidelines of a prize distribution function at Gaiety Theatre. He had met several Union ministers in Delhi during his two-day tour. “The leadership is busy with elections in five states. I have discussed the issue with them. The matter will be discussed again after elections are over,” Jai Ram said when asked about the cabinet reshuffle. Speculation of cabinet reshuffle had been rife after the party suffered electoral reverses in the bypolls to three assemblies – Arki, Jubbal-Kotkhai, Fatehpur – and Mandi parliamentary seat from where former chief minister Virbhadra Singh’s widow Pratibha Singh trounced Kargil war hero Khushal Thakur. Neither party chief Suresh Kashyap nor chief minister Jai Ram Thakur owned direct responsibility of the defeat. Rather, the party blamed a wave of sympathy for the late former chief minister Virbhadra Singh for the BJP’s defeat in Mandi. Infighting and inflation had cost the BJP the four seats in Himachal Pradesh. The BJP had made its ministers in-charge of the elections in three assemblies and one parliamentary segment.Jai Ram in 2017 had left two vacancies in his 11-member cabinet. BJP’s Mandi legislator Anil Sharma, who took the oath with nine other ministers on The Ridge, was made to give up his cabinet berth after the Congress fielded his son Ashray Sharma against sitting Lok Sabha member Ramswaroop Sharma in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Ramswaroop Sharma was found dead at his official residence in New Delhi in March last year. His death necessitated the by-election to the Mandi Lok Sabha seat.It was in July 2020 that Jai Ram inducted into his cabinet three ministers — Nurpur legislator Rakesh Pathania, Ghumarwein legislator Rajendra Garg and Paonta legislator Sukhram Chaudhary. He had also changed the portfolios of his cabinet colleagues then. Health minister Vipin Parmar gave up his cabinet berth in February 2020. He was appointed Speaker of Himachal Pradesh Vidhan Sabha. In January 2020, Speaker Rajeev Bindal resigned from the post and was later appointed as the state’s party chief. He was later removed from the post after his name cropped up in medical equipment purchase scam. Shikhar samman conferred Jai Ram Thakur on Saturday said his government was committed to conserving the rich culture, heritage and literature of the state. He conferred Shikhar Samman, Kala Samman, Sahitya Purskar, Swaichchhik Sanstha Samman, and Chamba Rumal Pahari Chiktrakala Samman at an event at Gaiety Theatre. Jai Ram honoured Acharya Keshav Sharma with Bharat Ratan Atal Bihari Vajpayee Shikhar Sahitya Samman-2017 and OC Handa with Bharat Ratan Atal Bihari Vajpayee Shikhar Sahitya Samman-2018 for their outstanding contribution in the field of literature. Similarly, Mohan Rathore was given Maharaja Sansar Chand Shikhar Kala Samman-2017 while Dinesh Kumari was given this award for the year 2018 for their outstanding contribution in the field of art and promotion of Chamba rumal, respectively. They were given cash prize of ₹1 lakh each and a citation. Jai Ram Thakur gave away Sardar Sobha Singh Lalit Kala Award for the year 2016 to Prof Him Chatterji. Education and language, art and culture minister Govind Singh Thakur presented Sardar Sobha Singh Lalit Kala Award for 2017 to Nand Lal Thakur and for 2018 to Khimi Ram for their contributions in their respective fields. Jwala Prasad Sharma was awarded Manohar Singh Nishpadan Kala Samman for 2016, Sanjay Sood for the year 2017 and SD Kashyap was awarded this award for the year, 2018. They were awarded cash prize of ₹51,000 each and a citation.

The victim -- Narender Saini, 33 -- succumbed to his head injuries during treatment at a private hospital in Gurugram Sector 66, on the Sohna road, around 4pm on Friday.According to the police, Narender was unmarried, and worked at a private firm.Police said the body was handed over to the victim’s family for his last rites, following an autopsy, on Saturday.Narender was returning home at Kanhai Mor in Sector 45 on a motorcycle with his elder brother Himmat Saini around 10pm on Thursday, when a speeding car allegedly rammed into them from behind. They had gone to visit their sister and brother-in-law, who live in Gurugram’s Badshahpur.Himmat, who managed to remember the registration number of the speeding car which rammed into them, shared the information with the police. “Both the brothers had fallen on the road, but Narender received severe injuries in his face and head.

30-01-2022||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz | In waters of snows, war of the fish||‘Discarding the colonial past’ has found favour in contemporary controversies over eternal flames and war memorials. Yet, in our lofty Himalayan rivers tumbling from the eternal snows and glaciers, a native species, the snow trout (ST), is struggling to ward off a monster introduced in the British era, the brown trout (BT). Ever since the rivers were dammed for hydro-power, the exotic, invasive native shipped from Europe, the BT, has grown in numbers and savaged the ST by predating on its young ones. “This has forced ST to ‘live fast and die young’, so as to raise more soldiers for this war with BT. We found that ST is investing so much energy into raising egg numbers, that, post egg-laying, majority of adult ST die. Never, ever, has ST shown such a maturity-mortality trade-off. ST are taking slow poison by opting for this survival strategy,” Aashna Sharma, an intrepid field researcher and an alumnus of Panjab University, told this writer.Research carried out by Sharma and her colleagues from the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun, revealed a pathway of hope for the proverbial return of the natives. That is, if we do not dam our rivers because altered, homogenous ecology favours invasive species. That is where hyper-nationalist governments, keen to ameliorate the colonial imprint, must not stop at vote-fetching, eyeball-grabbing war memorial makeovers.“Our research established that following a flash flood in the Asiganga tributary upstream of Uttarkashi, the BT were completely wiped out while ST survived. This is because the native fish sensed the impending flash floods and found safe havens. Since the Asiganga has not been dammed, the unaltered flow and flash floods selectively weeded out the progeny of British colonialism,” said Sharma.On wings of desireSome great literary figures share a common trait: a deep interest in birds and their use as complex metaphors and illustrative analogies in their plots. If Shakespeare was peerless when weaving the imagery of falconry into his plays, the 19th century writer of Wuthering Heights, Emily Bronte, used the cuckoo’s brood parasitism as the central analogy of her classic, with the lapwing and the Hedge sparrow also intervening in the guise of apt comparisons to illuminate human predicaments.In her novel, the central characters, Heathcliff and Catherine, are compared to cuckoo chicks who as interlopers displace the rightful progeny from their pride of place in two families of landed gentry. The novel situates a bizarre moment of ornithology when a frenzied Catherine tears open with her teeth her fluffy pillow and precisely identifies species of birds from its stuffing of diverse feathers: turkey, wild duck, pigeon, moorcock, lapwing! She goes on to examine if a lapwing’s feather was red, it meant the bird had been shot.What is lesser known is Bronte’s startling, life-evoking painting of a Merlin, a smaller species of falcon. In medieval England, a Peregrine / Gyrfalcon was considered worthy of possession by the high nobility while a Merlin was reckoned as ‘a falcon for a lady’. Mary, Queen of Scots and Catherine the Great were eminent female falconers to fly Merlins.The subject of Bronte’s finely-executed watercolour painting of 1841 was an injured Merlin rescued by her from the moors. She named the Merlin, ‘Nero’, presumably after the tyrannical emperor.Bronte’s multi-creative sensibilities also sparked poetic effervescence and she was a passionate pianist revelling in the repertoire of George F Handel, J Haydn, WA Mozart and LV Beethoven. Unlike falconers who are paranoid about losing their captive bird, Bronte was empathetic to freedom’s soar,which was so innate to her captive Merlin. Her soul kindled these kind, thoughtful verses: “Ah could my hand unlock its chain, How gladly would I watch it soar, And ne’er regret and ne’er complain, To see its shining eyes no more”.vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzz-in-waters-of-snows-war-of-the-fish-101643491393621.html
30-01-2022||Chandigarh||Guest Column| Waltzing with the law||Penning a magnum opus of the glorious guardian of legal fraternity, a distinguished jurist and the keeper of Eden Garden of law, who has taught, practised and educated law enforcers, is a daunting task. In four parts, Balram K Gupta, describes waltzing with the law for six decades in his book, My Journey With Law And Justice. Married to law, for his family law is not a jealous mistress. Late Justice JL Gupta was the umbrella of the family, his son Shireesh, a bright lawyer, daughter Shruti,an erudite law professor and son-in-law, justice Jasjit Bedi,youngest on the Bench. His wife, Shashi, a homemaker, encourages the law indulgences, but the mistress has seeped into the crevices of the Gupta House, and the book penned, is an illustration of this. From 1980 onwards, as a fledgling,I have learnt law from him and have inculcated his vibrant energy. His book is curtain raiser to the inner workings and moorings of his legal, ethical and moral compass. He defected to the legal profession after a ripe tenure of teaching law, and scored centuries in a successful law practice. After 22 years he returned to academics,his first love, and of this, his book speaks. His vivid accounts as a lifelong student and teacher of law in the opening part narrate his elocution of law at global centres aimed to re-imagine law. He discusses his legal innings played with diligence, honesty and respect. Money for him was never a consideration.For him, his impressions reveal that the teacher was more overpowering than the lawyer in him.The book divulges his endeavours at national and Chandigarh judicial academies, resulting in an overhaul of teaching concepts. He was and continues to be the Mozart of law. His name will be enshrined in legal and social studies for time immemorial. And of this, I speak, with authority. As a resource person to the academies,I have been privy of enlightenment, just like the prisoners in Plato’s Allegory of the Cave. Sparkling Ruth Bader Ginsburg till 87, served the US Supreme Court. At 78, our distinguished jurist under Indian Constitution too deserves the Supreme Court Bench, dehors the age bar. The professor Emeritus, senior counsel, parliamentary fellow, judicial administrator,and Rotarian, in his commentary narrates a journey down memory lane. He can be best described as a philanthropist. He invested thought which is more valuable than material wealth. Gupta family is a reincarnation of the bygone Medici Family. The Guptas have invested in society all in name of progressive and consistent development of law for society. The 325 pages of the book are replete with anecdotes and perceptions of justice. Gupta may never have penned a judgment, but has trained minds to read, learn and write. His writings reveal sharp insights, which make him a leading educator and judicial laureate. His pioneer writings share leaves from the lives of legal giants. His writings on constitutional and administrative law launch readers into a contemporary legal world, captivating till an enticing finish. He writes in short and crisp sentences, a rarity in law. Calling law and literature Siamese twins, he weaves webs his webs. Alive to grim realities perpetuated in a fundamentalist and pandemic driven generation battling constitutional values, his writings are like the pied piper of law. In essays remembering Sir Robert Jennings, professor Vaughan Lowe quotes, “A lawyer without history of literature is a mechanic, a mere working mason; if he possesses some knowledge of these he may venture to call himself an architect”. Gupta, like an architect and non-conformist, orchestrates blueprints of judicial education designed to rethink justice in all its hues. As chapters unfold, productive, creative and thought-provoking writings of law reveal that he is still bubbling with judicial energy and can again relive his life. His unparalleled work and thoughts as a legal craftsman require that his book must be read by every law pupil, lawyer, legal commentator and judge. His words of wisdom are rich treasures and learning curves for every student of law. The judicial brotherhood and legal community remains beholden to him.

30-01-2022||Chandigarh||Covid snuffs out 11 more lives in Chandigarh tricity, highest since second wave||In tricity’s highest daily death toll since the second wave, 11 people succumbed to Covid-19 on Saturday.Mohali alone recorded five deaths, the third time during the ongoing third wave, while Chandigarh and Panchkula lost three residents each. Their cumulative toll was tricity’s highest since June 2, 2021, when 14 people had died.All five deceased in Mohali were senior citizens, including three women and two men.The eldest among them, a 78-year-old man from Sector 61, died at Indus Hospital in Phase 3B2. Three patients, a 61-year-old man from Zirakpur, and two women, aged 65 and 60, from Kharar, were admitted at Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, Chandigarh.The fifth patient, a 62-year-old woman from Kharar, breathed her last at PGIMER, Chandigarh.According to Dr Girish Dogra, nodal officer for Covid-19 in Mohali, most of these patients had other health complications.Two of the three deceased in Chandigarh were also senior citizens. Among them, a 74-year-old man, from Sector 38, was fully vaccinated, while a 76-year-old woman, from Sector 20, had received only the first dose. Both were also suffering from diabetes, hypertension and respiratory distress, and breathed their last at PGIMER.The third victim, a 27-year-old woman, who lived in Dhanas, was brought dead at Government Multi-Specialty Hospital, Sector 16, and later found positive for Covid. She had also received only the first jab.Those who died in Panchkula were two senior citizens, a 99-year-old man from Sector 20 and a 65-year-old woman from Sector 12, and a 58-year-old man from Mansa Devi Complex.While the elderly patients had diabetes, hypertension and chronic kidney disease, the third patient was suffering from chronic inflammatory lung disease.With this, tricity’s toll in January has reached 101, nearly 15 times higher than the seven deaths in December last.At 47, Mohali has recorded the highest deaths in this period, followed by 35 in Chandigarh and 19 in Panchkula.Dr Sanjeev Palta, nodal officer, ICU management, Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, said, “People are not dying primarily due to Covid infection. Their comorbidities worsen their complications, which are the main cause of death. Also, most victims are elderly.”Dr Suman Singh, director, health services, Chandigarh, added that around 40% of people dying in the city were not vaccinated against Covid. “Despite door-to-door drive and awareness camps, people are still hesitant in getting jabbed. Its due to vaccination that the severity of infections has lowered in the third wave, which has further contributed to lesser fatalities, compared to the second wave. Hence, people must get fully vaccinated at the earliest.”Tricity’s daily cases dip to 1,168Tricity’s daily Covid-19 cases continued to recede for the ninth consecutive day, as 1,168 people tested positive for the virus, against 1,451 the day before.After peaking to 3,907 on January 16, the daily tally had remained around 3,000 till January 22.

A total of 321 were found infected in Chandigarh, compared to 399 a day before, while the tally dropped from 359 to 242 in Panchkula in the same period.The decline in cases also helped lower tricity’s active caseload, which now stands at 11,074.At 5,880, Mohali has the highest number of positive patients, followed by Chandigarh with 3,819 and Panchkula with 1,375.However, the positivity rate didn’t record a significant decline. From 8.6% on Friday, it came down to 7.3% in Chandigarh. In Panchkula, it was still hovering around 18% and in Mohali, too, only a 1% change was seen from 21% a day ago.36 people on ventilator support in UT hospitalsAccording to the health bulletin, of the total 1,274 oxygen beds in Chandigarh’s government and private hospitals, 317 are currently occupied by locals and residents of other states.

The DUTA executive has already met and finalised an outline of our response to the framework, and the sub-committee will submit its final representation by Monday or Tuesday,” DUTA president AK Bhagi said.Bhagi said that the DUTA was of the view that “credit dilution and loss of academic content” of any kind was not acceptable. “We want the three-year honours degree to continue with the same number of credits as before. We will oppose any loss of any teaching position in any department of any college,” said Bhagi.The new draft reduces the number of credits to 176 from 196 outlined in the first draft of the framework, which was approved by the academic council last year.“In three years, students should be able to secure the same degree as before without any loss of academic content,” said Bhagi.He said that while DUTA representatives had already met vice-chancellor Yogesh Singh once, one or two more meetings were likely in the coming week to deliberate on the representation that the body will be submitting.DU registrar Vikas Gupta earlier told HT the university will place the draft before the academic council and executive committee after feedback was collected from all stakeholders..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/draft-ug-curriculum-duta-s-suggestions-to-be-sent-next-week-101643490115967.html
30-01-2022||Chandigarh||Random Forays | The unflagging zeal of the Mamarazzi||In the relatively short expanse of time that cellphones have existed, the one constant has been the human zeal for sharing pictures. Before the advent of digital photography, rare was the enthusiast who had the time, capacity, wherewithal and patience to click 36 photographs and get them developed. But roughly since the turn of the century, the sheer number of avid, not-so-capable photo persons have multiplied in geometric progression.The eagle-eyed and ever eager smartphone photo expert never lets his or her enthusiasm flag. At least a dozen pictures per day are a par for the course, with the number of selfies taken often exceeding Virat Kohli’s score! The ladies, of course, are more skilled, more prolific and more record-breaking in their selfie feats, even if their feet may not always be steadily planted on the ground while clicking away. A potentially dangerous scenario!But the ‘mamarazzi’ are the most obvious and perhaps most in-the-face champions of the bubbling, over-the-top, ‘clickerati’ brigade. Not for these motherly versions of the paparazzi is the easy-going style of moms and grandmoms of yore, who hardly clicked a ‘pic’ or two of their progeny in their growing up years.As soon as a baby is born in this era, he makes his way, or she makes her way to Instagram, the same day, or perhaps the next day. The oodles of oooohs and aaaahs that result on social media platforms make for an elevation in the general feel-good factor of the world. These moms don’t know just how much joy they bring to the hearts of the population at large by posting such cuddly pics.The life-long mamarazzi bandwagon takes off from there and never quite abates in intensity or gusto. Pictures of the first this and the first that, and of all sorts of landmarks that the baby, now a toddler, scales, make their way into our hapless screens.The only one who doesn’t seem too chuffed about the prospect of living a nascent life almost exclusively on Instagram is the subject. The toddler in question is usually moody, even recalcitrant, and generally disenchanted by the whole idea of being on camera all the time. There are of course exceptions and they love all the attention they can get from their gushing mamarazzi. A subtle hint in the form of a candy or a new plaything does wonders to the receptivity of the camera-shy ones!And as life rolls one, which it inexorably does, the young ones become a little more difficult to appease in order for them to pose for pics. They are hard to catch once they start running away, and the slightly older mamarazzi probably spend their free time fondly gazing at portraits of the good old days, when their babies were actually babies. But who can say when the next one will come along to enable their click-happy mom to venture into a series of encores? Only the stork knows. There are many websites which advise young mothers on how to click excellent pictures of their infants. Dads too are able learners in most cases, and they merrily click away, while the mom-child duo pose with winsome smiles. It is only when fathers have had enough that they will make their excuses and slip away.Men also frequently overutilise the camera function of their smartphones, but this write-up is about the mamarazzi so we will stick to them. Once the kids are all grown up, the femmes turn their attention to their hubbies. There is no one else available for sundry awkward poses, with the teenagers having gone off on some outing or having left home for higher education. It is then that the tiffs begin!Husbands can be the grumpiest of photo species. They can usually be found watching cricket, or whatsapping their friends, or even actually working, at any moment when the mamarazzi want to click pics. And they don’t look as great in the mornings, with bleary eyes and stubbles, as do their wives, who miraculously retain the ability to smile gloriously into their cameras, even at the oddest of hours!vivek.atray@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/random-forays-the-unflagging-zeal-of-the-mamarazzi-101643490669223.html
30-01-2022||Chandigarh||Roundabout | Bengal’s Binodini resurrected in a Punjabi play||Punjabi playwright Shabdeesh has been best described as a poet at heart. It is this mix of the head and the heart that has gone into writing the play, Nati Binodini, inspired by the remarkable story of Bengal’s pioneering actor Binodini Dasi. The dramatist creates the life and times of a girl brought up in the red-light area of Kolkata, who entered the world of theatre when she was just 11 or 12. Instead of following the profession of her mother and grandmother, Binodini (1862-1941) made history through her talent, dedication and sacrifice, and yet for polite Bengali society (bhadralok) she always featured in the roster of fallen women.The crowning glory of her remarkable career on stage came in one of her last performances in Chaitanyaleela, in which she brought alive the story of the 16th century Vaishnava saint of the Bhakti movement in Bengal and Orissa. Such was the grace of the performance that she reached the summit of fame. It is on record that on October 7, 1885, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, the great Vaishnava saint of 19th century Bengal, came to see the performance. Lore has it that the saint was so moved that he went on stage, put his hand on her head and blessed her. She earned praise for the performance from the likes of philosopher Swami Vivekananda and writer Bankim Chandra Chatterjee who penned Vande Mataram, the national song of India. However, at the age of 23, she walked away from Star Theatre, which she had built, paying a heavy price.Journey of the playwrightBefore getting lost in the lanes of 19th century Kolkata, a city celebrated in a 20th century, let us return to the 21st century, and take a trip to a rural area in the Majha region of Punjab – Kallah village near Tarn Taran – where the playwright Shabdeesh began his journey. Coming of age in the 1980s when the influence of the Naxalbari movement had dwindled and the rise of Sikh terrorism had started, a young Jagdeesh, who would become famous as Shabdeesh, started dabbling in poetry. At the time, mainstream Punjabi literature was progressive and still left-of-the-road. His song, Tainu hasean te zhakham dikhavan, Je saade pind aanvein mitra’(I will show you the wounds over laughter, If you come to our village, my friend) became wildly successful. His first play was published in 1996 and the same year he married Anita, a talented actor working with the theatre legend, Gursharan Singh.With the head and heart in place, Shamdeesh (which literally means ‘the lord of words’) continued to pen poetry and plays besides writing in newspapers and journals. However, he published very little and most of his books have been brought out by friends. The play, ‘Nati Binodini’ was published by his better half and friends as an anniversary gift, recently. Shabdeesh laughs, “My pen name may be the Lord of Words but there is nothing lordly about me. Publishing a book in Punjabi is a cumbersome and costly affair. This turned out to be a pleasant surprise nevertheless.” How did the play happen? Shabdeesh recounts, “It was Anita who first discovered a copy of a Hindi play, translated from Bengali, with the same title. She was so keen to enact the character of the legendary actor that I first thought of translating it into Punjabi. But I felt it would have to be done in the metaphor of the Punjabi language. Fortunately, I came across the autobiographical accounts by Binodini Dasi herself and it was then that I decided to write a fresh play by including them.” He says he sees the play as a gift from Punjab to Bengal who gave the country an actor as talented as Binodini. For Anita it was a sheer joy to enact the role of Nati Binodini and she says it remains relevant as the prejudice of the 19th century against women can be found in the present times too.Angst of a woman as an actorThe first acquaintance one made with this legend of 19th century public theatre that came into being under the British colonial influence was through the translation of the autobiography of Binodini Dasi: Amar Katha (My Life) and Amar Abhinetri Jibon (My Life as an Actress) by scholar and writer Rimli Bhattacharya. The book, which was brought out by Kali for Women in 1998, included a translation of her poems, and reached far and wide to the English readership home and abroad. In an insightful and elaborate introduction to her writings, Bhattacharya says: “Her autobiographical writings along with her poems speak of a woman who wanted much more than contemporary society was willing to give her. Although a star in her own right and founder member of the first actor-owned theatre, Binodini was never allowed to forget her origin or her status”.Today too, some writers make the mistake of calling her ‘the actor who was a prostitute’. Raised in the red-light area, she had no choice but to take in male patrons: the first one for love, and the second one for theatre at the instance of her Guru, the celebrated actor and director Girish Chandra Gosh, to use the money he gave her for a theatre owned by artistes, which would be given her name. But when the time came, the men decided it could not be named after a fallen woman and named the theatre built over the flesh and soul of Binodini, Star Theatre. She wrote with pain of the betrayals and whenever she calls herself ‘a fallen woman’ it with the same disdain that a contemporary woman poet may have for the phoney world around her when she calls herself ‘a wicked woman’ or a ‘buri aurat’.nirudutt@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/roundabout-bengal-s-binodini-resurrected-in-a-punjabi-play-101643490310270.html

30-01-2022||Gurugram||Gurugram: 2-year-old leopard allegedly hit by speeding vehicle rescued in Tauru||A two-year-old male leopard was found critically injured in the wee hours of Saturday after allegedly getting hit by a speeding vehicle near the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) expressway in Padheni village in Tauru, some 43 kilometres from Gurugram. According to wildlife officials, they received a call from the villagers around 5am, after they spotted the leopard lying injured in a field. Rajender Parsad Dangi, divisional wildlife officer, Gurugram, said that they sent their local team and police to the spot and rescued the leopard within an hour. “It was unable to move and it seemed that the wild animal met with an accident on the KMP expressway three days ago. It managed to enter the field to take shelter and could not move further due to the grave injuries. It is not in a condition to survive by itself in the forest and will take at least two months to recover,” he said. The leopard was sent to a veterinary hospital in Rohtak zoo and is undergoing treatment. Hospital sources said the animal suffered severe injuries and fractures. Dangi said the leopard suffered a fracture in its left leg and spinal cord due to which it was unable to move. “There has been excessive internal bleeding after the accident. In such cases, leopards are tranquilised and then taken to hospital. But in this case, tranquiliser was not required as the condition of the big cat was serious and there were thin chances of its survival,” he said. Wildlife officials will keep the leopard under observation until reported fit. “Under normal conditions, any captured wild animal has to be kept under observation for 48 hours, but in this case, it will take time and the next three days are critical. We are using heaters to keep the room warm for its quick healing,” said a senior wildlife official. Anil Gandas, a wildlife expert, who led the rescue operation, said that cops cordoned off the area, but said crowd management is still a challenge. “People wanted to record the movement of the rescue operation and were not ready to leave. Though we were ready with the tranquilisers, it was not required and there was no challenge as it was critically injured. When we reached the spot, villagers were seen attempting to take pictures and make videos,” he said. Cops are also conducting an investigation to identify the vehicle that hit the leopard. Teams from Tauru police station are questioning villagers and KMP expressway staff to gather leads into the incident.

He was initially admitted to the Civil Hospital in Gurugram, and later taken to Safdarjung hospital in Delhi as his condition deteriorated.A case was registered against the suspect under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) on the basis of a statement by the mother at the Shivaji Nagar police station late Friday night.The woman, her husband (in his early 60s) -- a peanut wholesale trader, and their three daughters aged 30 years, 28 years and 26 years live in a three-storey house in Gandhi Nagar, police said, adding that the suspect lived separately with his wife and three minor daughters (two-and-a-half, four and eight years) in a rented accommodation in Gandhi Nagar for a year amid differences with his parents. According to the family, the wedding of the eldest daughter, 30, was scheduled to take place on February 11.

Our youngest sister, who was at home that time, called both of us to the office to inform them about the incident,” she alleged. “After we took our mother to the hospital, our brother also reached there. He consumed poison at the entrance, probably fearing he would be arrested as we had informed the police about the incident,” she claimed.

Police said that PCR vans and patrolling bikes are the first to reach the spots after receiving information regarding an accident. They are being directed to prepare a detailed report and mention the area of the accident, cite reasons for the mishap, road condition, number of accidents, and nearest police deployment. Earlier, police personnel reaching the accident spots used to record basic facts such as where did the accident take place, reason of accident, how many were killed or injured, but details such as condition of the roads, potholed roads, under-construction stretches and police deployment will have to be documented now. KK Rao, commissioner of police, said that they are working on several methods to curb accidents across the city and majorly focusing on ‘black spots’ from where maximum accidents are reported. “This exercise will give clarity on the cause of accidents and what measures can be taken to curb them. If an accident is taking place due to poor road condition, then we will write to the civic agency concerned and get it repaired at the earliest and if it is due to speeding, then barricades will be placed to control speed on the concerned stretch,” Rao said. Cops have already identified 40 ‘black spots’ that reported most of the accidents. Rao said they have identified the accident-prone stretches over the last three years and analysed the reasons for accidents. In most of the cases, accidents took place due to speeding, stationary vehicles on roads, wrong-side driving and jaywalking. Police said the maximum number of accidents were reported from Golf Course Extension Road, Southern Peripheral Road (SPR), Shankar Chowk, Ghata Crossing, Bilaspur Crossing and IMT, Manesar. Also, Hero Honda Chowk has emerged as a “dangerous spot” along with the crossing at Sidhrawali, where speeding caused most fatal accidents. Traffic police in the city also roped in 200 homeguards and 50 personnel from the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) for traffic management. Sanjeev Balhara, assistant commissioner of police (ACP) (traffic), said that teams visit the ‘black spots’ after an accident is reported and an evaluation report is prepared and submitted to the DCP (traffic), following which the next plan of action is prepared. “If a team in its analysis finds that more measures are needed to curb accidents, action is taken then and there. After each evaluation, changes are made. We also inform the MCG officials if their help is required to fill potholes or any repair in the road structure”, Balhara said. There were six accidents reported on the Golf Course Extension Road this week and as many as three of them were due to speeding, while the rest were due to potholes where drivers lost balance and toppled. Cops have set up barricades at two spots and patrolling vehicles are taking rounds at night. Also, commuters are charged hefty fines if they are found speeding their vehicles, said police. Police said they have also prepared a list of solutions required to reduce accidents. They have written to the civic body and urged it to install proper signage at various intersections, warning boards before merging traffic, speed-breakers and properly constructed central verges, officials said. There are around 700 traffic personnel deployed across the city and to keep them safer during night duty, they are being provided with reflective lights, jackets and hand gloves. In July last year, a six-member accident response team (ART) was formed to revisit ‘black spots’ in hit-and-run cases and to identify drivers who fled after hitting motorists and pedestrians. Cops said that the team solved more than 50 blind cases in four months in 2021.

Head of the department, Prof Om Shankar, who led the doctors’ team, said that the woman, a resident of Azamgarh, was referred to him on Thursday after an angiography of her was done in a private hospital. “The young lady never consumed tobacco. She had no hypertension, diabetes and takayasu disease. She had even not any family history of cardiac disease. But her angiography revealed that the main artery of her left side of heart was narrowed like the thread-like structure, which was a complicated condition,” said Prof Shankar. He said, this type of heart disease is considered to be the most serious and such people can die of sudden death due to cardiac arrest any time. “However, we decided to do angioplasty on her, which was a challenging task. The condition of the artery was very difficult to negotiate through the wires. Then the position and alignments of the blood vessels was so complex that it was complicated to determine where to place the stent? Even slight mistake in this procedure could lead to death of the patient within minutes,” said Prof Shankar.

The agenda was placed before the panel during a meeting which was held a few days ago, where the members reiterated that the reservation policy should be framed and implemented. However, no final recommendation has been made yet.The members also deliberated on the relevant reservation policies of several universities including Kurukshetra University. However, the panel decided that the reservation policy related to house allotment for persons with disabilities of Punjab and Chandigarh should be placed before committee in the next meeting before any decision is taken.The estate branch of the university has also been asked to present the guidelines or policy document of Punjab and UT in the next meeting. A member of the panel on condition of anonymity, said, “We have agreed to its immediate implementation in the university. There are variations in the policies adopted by some other universities and we cannot implement it in bits and pieces.

30-01-2022||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | Burglars decamp with ₹35,000 from sweetmeat shop on Gill road||A gang of burglars struck at a sweetmeat shop-cum-bakery on Gill Road and decamped with ₹35,000 in the wee hours of Thursday. Closed-circuit television cameras (CCTV) installed at the shop captured two men on a bike breaking into the shop and fleeing with the cash box and another electronic device, which they seemed to have mistaken for the DVR of the CCTV. The CCTV clipping of the incident is now doing the rounds of social media. Bakery owner Gurpreet Singh, who lives in Model Town, said that on the night of January 26, he locked his shop and went home. Around 5.15 the next morning, he received a call from the area watchman that the shutter of his shop was found broken. Gurpreet immediately rushed to the shop and found that the burglars had taken away ₹35,000 kept in his cash drawer.Later, on examining the CCTV footage, he found that two men had come on a motorcycle and tried to break open the locks of the bakery. After failing to do so, they pulled up the shutter, and one of them sneaked in through the gap, and took away the cash box and another electronic device. The bakery owner alleged that he had filed a police complaint soon after he got to know about the crime, but no action was taken. Fed up of waiting for a response from the police, he circulated the CCTV footage from the shop on social media.Assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Sukhdev Singh, the investigating officer, refuted the claims and said that it was the complainant who was delaying the FIR as he thought he could trace the accused through the CCTV footage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-burglars-decamp-with-35-000-from-sweetmeat-shop-on-gill-road-101643482568757.html

30-01-2022||Gurugram||Gurugram: Man forges document to get new electricity line, arrested||Police arrested a stamp paper vendor from his shop at Wazirabad on Friday evening for allegedly creating a forged document of the Union ministry of home affairs and submitting it to the Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam to get a new electricity connection for his rented flat in D-block of Ardee city in Sector-52. Police said the accused, Sanjay Kumar Singh (45), a native of Basarikpur village in Ghazipur, Uttar Pradesh, was living in the flat without paying rent to the owner for seven years and was also not paying electricity bills, following which the power supply to his residence was disconnected in October last year.According to police, Singh started living in the flat from December 2014. “The tenure to vacate the flat ended in November 2015 but he is yet to vacate it. An eviction suit filed by the complainant is pending before a Gurugram court,” said a senior police officer. Police said the cheating came to light when colonel (retired) Rajendra Singh, owner of Singh’s flat, reached Gurugram from Bikaner and visited officials of the state power utility on December 23 last year to know how Singh was getting power supply when the electricity connection to his residence was already snapped. It was then that the officials showed him the application made by his tenant along with the forged documents. On December 24, the retired army officer submitted a complaint alleging that Singh had forged his signatures to prepare a no-objection certificate for getting the electricity connection in his name as it was disconnected due to non-payment of bills.Police said an FIR was registered against Singh soon after they received a reply from the Union ministry of home affairs on Friday stating that the document submitted with the ministry’s letterhead to the state power utility was forged. Police said Singh allegedly forged a letter in the name of one K P Singh, showing him as an officer on special duty to the Union home minister and submitted it to the DHBVN executive engineer for treating his application for a new electricity connection favourably.“MHA in its reply informed police that no such officer named K P Singh actually exists in the ministry,” said a senior police officer. An FIR was registered against Singh at Sector 53 police station on Friday evening under Sections 419 (punishment for cheating by personation), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 465 (punishment for forgery), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will etc), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (punishment for forging documents or electronic records) and 472 (making or counterfeiting seals, plates for purpose of committing forgery) of the Indian Penal Code. Singh was produced before court on Saturday, which granted one-day police remand for his interrogation.Subhash Chand, station house officer of Sector-53 police station, said, “We are currently interrogating Singh. Investigation is on.” Chand said the state power utility had slapped penalty to the tune of ₹1.15 lakh on Singh for electricity theft after his power supply was disconnected. DHBVN officials said Singh is yet to clear the dues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-man-forges-document-to-get-new-electricity-line-arrested-101643481848818.html

30-01-2022||Lucknow||UP polls: Past hints postal ballots may play vital role in close fights||PRAYAGRAJ: Even as candidates for the upcoming assembly elections are trying hard to woo voters, past records show that along with votes cast on the electronic voting machines (EVMs), postal ballots also play a vital role in close fights in some assembly seats of Prayagraj. Postal ballots assume more importance as from this year, not only voters in service and posted outside but even senior citizens (above the age of 80 years) and differently-abled can cast their votes through postal ballots. Hence, candidates of 22 seats of Prayagraj region, comprising Prayagraj, Pratapgrah and Kaushambi districts are formulating their strategy keeping in mind the large number of postal ballots which could be decisive on some seats. As per the revised voter list, there are 67,028 senior citizen voters in Prayagraj who can use postal ballot on 12 assembly seats. Likewise, there are 7,828 voters who are in defence services and posted outside. In Pratapgrah, which has seven seats, there are 37,330 senior citizen voters and 4,697 servicemen. In Kaushambi, 12,639 voters are senior citizens who can elect their representatives for the district’s three assembly seats. The importance of postal ballots can be gauged by the results on some seats of these three districts in the 2012 assembly elections. In 2012, Deepak Patel of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) had defeated Samajwadi Party candidate Ujjwal Raman Singh by a margin of just 404 votes. Even in 2007 elections, Anand Kumar of BSP had defeated Singh by a margin of just 345 votes. Likewise, in 2012 elections, SP candidate Haji Parvez Ahmed had defeated Nand Gopal Gupta ‘Nandi’, who was contesting as a BSP candidate, by 414 votes. In 2002 elections, Udaybhan Karwariya had defeated Ram Sevak Singh Patel of BSP by just 65 votes to win Bara assembly seat. In terms of the last assembly elections of 2017, the maximum number of postal ballots were cast for Allahabad North seat where BJP candidate Harshvardhan Bajpai won. He had got 425 votes through postal ballot, the highest among the 12 assembly seats of the district. At number two was Sidharth Nath Singh, the BJP candidate from Allahabad West who got 217 postal ballot votes. Nand Gopal Gupta had bagged 192 postal ballot votes in Allahabad South. In the 2017 elections, a total of 5,472 postal ballots were counted. The maximum number of votes (848) were polled in Allahabad North, 717 in Phulpur, 495 in Pratappur, 485 in Handia, 419 in Allahabad West, 397 in Soraon, 395 in Meja, 383 in Karchana, 378 in Phaphamau, 357 in Allahabad South and 337 in Bara. With 261 postal ballots, Koraon was at the bottom. When the counting of votes starts in the election, the postal ballots are counted first, followed by votes of the EVMs. In Pratapgrah, Rajendra Pratap Singh aka “Moti Singh” of BJP had got the maximum number of postal ballots (583) and had won Patti assembly seat. Apna Dal candidate from Pratapgarh Sangam Lal Gupta and Congress candidate from Rampur Khas Aradhana Mishra had got 515 postal ballot votes each and won their respective seats. In Kaushambi district, a total of 644 postal ballots were polled out of which Indrajeet Singh Saroj of BSP had got 320 votes and had won the Manjhanpur seat. “Although previously postal ballots were not considered as a factor which could influence the victory of a candidate, now that the senior citizens and differently-abled too are included among those who can cast their votes through postal ballots, candidates in fray need to make sure that they do not lose these votes”, said Prof MP Dube, political analyst and former vice-chancellor of Uttar Pradesh Rajarshi Tandon Open University (UPRTOU).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-polls-past-hints-postal-ballots-may-play-vital-role-in-close-fights-101643481550502.html
30-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Setback to Amarinder, two PLC candidates opt out||In a setback to former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, two nominees fielded by his Punjab Lok Congress (PLC) — former Indian Hockey team captain Ajit Pal Singh and Nawanshahr unit president Satvir Singh Palli Jhikki — have given up their candidature while four others have opted to contest on the senior ally Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s lotus symbol. While hockey Olympian Ajit Pal was declared the candidate from Nakodar, Palli Jhikki was in the fray from Nawanshahr. In the fresh list of PLC candidates announced on Saturday, Ajit Pal was replaced by Shammi Kumar Kalyan, while the party is likely to give the Nawanshahr seat to the BJP. According to senior PLC leaders, Ajit Pal has cited “personal reasons” behind not contesting from Nakodar. In the case of Palli Jhikki, there are talks of him being hopeful of getting the Congress ticket from Nawanshahr. “It’s a totally new field for me while the PLC needs more time for its organisational set up,” said Ajit Pal. “I am not aware of rules of politics. Moreover, my village is Sansarpur near Jalandhar but I am settled in Delhi and don’t have vote in Punjab, which is mandatory to contest the elections. That is why I opted out.”Palli Jhikki, who was the district planning board chairman in the Congress government, was named the PLC district president after joining Capt Amarinder’s party. He confirmed to the HT that he has refused to contest as a PLC candidate. Leaders close to him said that if the Congress doesn’t give the ticket to sitting Nawanshahr MLA Angad Saini, it hardly has any replacement other than Palli Jhikki, as he belongs to the Saini community that holds sway in the segment. Four to contest on BJP symbol Meanwhile, four PLC candidates from Bathinda, Kharar, Ludhiana South and Atam Nagar (Ludhiana) have decided to contest on the BJP’s lotus symbol. At least three more are seeking the BJP’s symbol, it is learnt. According to one of the candidates from Ludhiana, voters are still not aware of the PLC’s symbol of hockey stick and ball, the reason behind his decision to go for the BJP symbol. “As we are contesting polls from urban segments, having a large presence of Hindu voters, we got feedback from our supporters that if we take the BJP’s symbol, it would add to our votes,” said the candidate cited above, while requesting not to be named. In Kharar, where PLC’s general secretary in-charge Kamaldeep Singh Saini is the candidate, the saffron party is learnt to have pushed for making him contest on its symbol, keeping in mind the large migrant population from Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.“When we are contesting as alliance partners, there is hardly any difference in who contests from which symbol. We all are candidates of the alliance,” said Saini. A senior BJP leader at the helm of affairs said the saffron party has agreed to allot its symbol to the four candidates, and has handed over official letters of their candidature to the PLC. Seven more candidates declared The PLC on Saturday declared seven more candidates, including Jaskaran Singh Sandhu from Patti, Shammi Kumar Kalyan from Nakodar, Jagdish Rai Jassal from Adampur (reserved), Karanveer Singh Indora from Malout (reserved), and Jiwan Dass Bawa from Mansa. In a faux pas, the party included the name of Maya Devi, who is the wife of former MLA Makhan Singh, from Bathinda Rural. Her son Savera Singh had already been announced as the candidate in the first list. Later in the evening, the party once again named him as the candidate from Bathinda Rural. So far, the PLC has declared 32 candidates out of the 37 seats allotted to it in alliance with the BJP and Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt).

30-01-2022||Lucknow||Covid: Fresh cases dip, but deaths, vaccination of leftover population pose challenge in UP||Although the number of daily fresh Covid cases is receding in Uttar Pradesh (UP), the deaths during the third wave of infections and vaccination of the leftover eligible population remain a challenge for the state health and family welfare department. After a surge in late December, the trajectory of the third wave of Covid in UP reached its peak on January 17 when 1,06,616 active cases were reported in the state. The number of fresh cases started declining from then onwards indicating that Covid-19 cases have started to plateau. On Saturday, 59,610 active cases were reported in the state, according to the data released by the state health and family welfare department. During the third wave, a majority of the infected people remained in home isolation. Out of the 59,610 active cases, merely 1,200 people are currently undergoing treatment in health facilities in various districts. A total of 2,93,260 Covid cases were reported in the state between January 1 and January 29, according to health department data. Also, 249 deaths were reported within 29 days. This is at least eight deaths per day on average. The death rate between January 1 and 29 was 0.084%. After the decline of the second wave of the Covid-19 infection in UP, no deaths were reported in November and December. Dr Amresh Singh, head of the microbiology department at Baba Raghav Das (BRD) Medical College (Gorakhpur) said the death audit of the Covid-19 patients who succumbed shows that majority of the fatalities during the third wave is due to co-morbidity. During the second wave of Covid infection, even the patients who did not have any disease, as well as the middle-aged patients whose immunity is strong, died, he said. In the third wave, the patients suffering with uncontrolled diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma, those whose lungs were compromised or infected with other diseases have died. About 90% of the Covid deaths in the third wave are due to co-morbidity, he said. Dr Singh said the patients who had taken both doses of the Covid vaccine recovered fast. Though the vaccine did not check infection, it built strong antibodies and the condition of vaccinated people did not become serious even after infection. The state government should ensure that maximum number of people get vaccine coverage, he said. Among eligible beneficiaries above 18 years of age in Uttar Pradesh, 14,62,08,498 first doses of the Covid vaccine has been administered, which is 99.18% of the eligible population. Among the beneficiaries, 10,05,20,497 people have got their second dose, which is 68.18% of the eligible population. The state health and family welfare department has launched a statewide drive to identify the people who have not taken the first dose, as well as the people who did not turn up for the second one after taking the first dose, said a health department officer. Till January 1, a total 12,80,30,367 first doses were administered and the number went up to 14,62,08,498 on January 29.“A total 99.18% eligible beneficiaries above 18-years have got their first dose and 68.18% got their second dose also. The state has administered a total 25,68,04,944 Covid-19 vaccine doses,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, additional chief secretary, in a press statement on Saturday.“It has been observed that those who are vaccinated have mild symptoms even if they get infected with the Covid-19 virus,” said Prasad.Experts said that vaccination is the safety shield against the virus. “Getting vaccinated is just like having a preventive dose against the virus. If the virus attacks, the vaccinated person will have the least impact,” said Dr PK Gupta, the former president of the Indian Medical Association, Lucknow and a microbiologist.The Election Commission of India has called upon the poll-bound states, including UP, to ramp up the Covid vaccination as well as to ensure that the eligible population gets vaccine cover when UP goes for first phase of polling on February 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/covid-fresh-cases-dip-but-deaths-vaccination-of-leftover-population-pose-challenge-in-up-101643479748853.html
