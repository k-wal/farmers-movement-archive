17-01-2022||Lucknow||UP polls: BJP launches video of campaign song on lines of Manike Mage Hithe||For the UP polls, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has launched the video of a new promotional campaign song, made on the lines of the viral Sri Lankan ditty “Manike Mage Hithe”. The new song shows the BJP, besides OBC and dalit leaders of its allies in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh talking about various schemes of the Narendra Modi and Yogi Adityanath governments. It reminds voters of “goondaraj aur bhrastachar (crime and corruption)” in previous regimes. The reference to “goondaraj aur bhrastachar” is tactical as it features in almost all of BJP campaigns. These were the major themes during the party’s 2017 campaign when it replaced the Samajwadi Party (SP) and came to power with its biggest-ever haul of 312 assembly seats in the 403-member UP assembly.The BJP’s latest campaign song, being widely shared by party leaders, opens to foot-tapping music and lyrics that start with “janata hai janardan (people are gods)”. It goads the voters to remember the party’s symbol “lotus” while going to vote. The seven-phase UP assembly polls will begin on February 10. In the absence of rallies, road shows and rath yatras that have been banned by the election commission to check the spread of Covid-19, all political parties have fallen back on virtual campaigns and door-to-door campaigning. “Our latest promotional video is a virtually like an entire campaign condensed into a two- minute song. So, this song provides a quick recap and campaign focus,” said Manish Dixit, BJP’s media in-charge in UP. Showing video clips of Prime Minister Narendra Modi washing the feet of sanitation workers in Kumbh and greeting them with a flower shower during the inauguration of the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor in Kashi, the campaign song appeals to the voter with “bhool nahi jaana re (don’t forget us)” line. Through montages, recent happenings like income tax raid on politicians and recovery of big cash, that led to BJP and SP sparring at each other over, are established. The song has reference to backwards, dalits, farmers and women and BJP leaders state that more such songs would be launched soon. “Usually, allies don’t feature in such videos. But, here BJP’s OBC allies Anupriya Patel and Sanjay Nishad of Apna Dal (Sonelal) and Nishad Party, respectively, figure in the video. That is one novelty and maybe it is to balance the recent mini exodus of OBC leaders away from BJP. But irrespective of the reasons, I am personally happy at the fact that all parties are now using music videos to connect with voters. This musical outreach is soothing to the ears,” says Irshad Ilmi, a political expert. “This song virtually says everything that we are telling the voters, including reminding them to not fall into the trap of opposition parties who are out to mislead the voters,” says Dixit. The BJP and its supporters have so far launched several musical video campaigns. There are a few that are personality based like “Yogi bahut zaroori hai (Yogi is quite necessary)” and “Ujiyara hai charon taraf andher na koi, Yogi jaisa UP mein sher na koi (It is all lit up everywhere and there is no darkness anywhere. Yogi ji is a lion and there is none like him).”One of them is a six-minute song “Aayenge to Yogi hi (Yogi will come for sure)” sung by prominent Bhojpuri singer Dinesh Lal Yadav aka ‘Nirahua’ who had unsuccessfully contested the 2019 Lok Sabha polls on the BJP ticket against Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav. This song has garnered millions of hits. Now, as the polling dates near and opposition steps up the heat, the campaign songs are becoming more issue-based, say party leaders.
17-01-2022||Noida||Malicious campaign against Covid vaccine fell flat, says UP CM Yogi Adityanath||After reviewing Covid preparedness in Ghaziabad during a visit to the district on Monday, chief minister Yogi Adityanath lauded the efforts of the government to ensure better “Covid management” during the first and second waves and said a “malicious campaign” against the Covid-19 vaccine by those opposing it had fallen flat. Assembly elections will be held in Uttar Pradesh in seven phases, starting on February 10 when voting will be held in western UP. The CM on Monday inspected the L3 category facility of Santosh Medical College in Ghaziabad and also a nearby vaccination camp where he interacted with children (15-18 years). “As part of our Covid management, we have been able to save the lives and means of livelihood of people. I visited Ghaziabad during the first and second Covid waves and I am here during the present third wave as well. There was a malicious campaign against the vaccine by people and it was a campaign against humanity. Such campaigns have fallen flat and everyone now recognises that the vaccine made in India is one of the finest,” Adityanath told reporters at Santosh Medical College. He said the government has done its best in saving lives and also livelihoods. “We imposed the night curfew from 10pm to 6am while schools and colleges have been shut till January 23. During this period, we have a target to complete the first dose vaccination of children as well as all other categories. Besides, we also plan to complete the precautionary dose for eligible beneficiaries. At present, Uttar Pradesh administers the highest number of vaccines,” Adityanath said. He also said the first dose coverage in Ghaziabad is currently 98% (with a revised target) while the second dose coverage was about 69%. “The patients admitted to hospitals during this wave is less than 1% of active cases. The third wave is less harmful as compared to the second wave. But it is a disease and we have to save children, women and senior citizens. For that, we have also installed 5,500 public address systems to give out public awareness messages. People should avoid going to crowded places. We are hopeful that we will be successful in controlling and saving lives and livelihoods during this third wave too,” the chief minister said. On the other hand, the members of the opposition parties took a jibe over the “Covid management” of the BJP government and said the debacle over Covid will be a major factor in the elections. The Congress leaders said the hardships people faced during the pandemic are still fresh in the minds of everyone. “It is for the first time that people saw dead bodies floating in river Ganga and people even died on roads. There were tokens issued for cremation of dead bodies while people were running helter-skelter for oxygen. The migrant workers were out on roads, walking to their native places. So, everyone has seen how things were dealt with by the UP government during the pandemic,” said Dolly Sharma, member of All India Congress Committee and spokesperson of UP Congress Committee. Others said almost every family suffered during the pandemic one way or the other. “We have seen how people were lined up and running pillar to post for oxygen for their family and loved ones. During the past two waves, the people of UP suffered a lot and almost everyone has a tale of loss to tell. All these difficulties are fresh in the minds of people and their suffering will play a major role in these elections,” said Rashid Malik, district president, Samajwadi Party. Adityanath, during his press briefing, also said the government, after the second wave, added about 550 new oxygen plants. Eleven of these plants are in Ghaziabad, he said. According to the state control room figures, on Monday, the state had a total of 1,849,665 Covid-19 cases and 22,972 deaths. A total of 1,720,077 patients have been discharged after treatment while the number of active cases is 106,616. The Ghaziabad district on Monday registered 1,301 fresh cases of Covid-19 which took the overall tally to 72,201. The number of active cases is 10,493, the district figures showed. The total cases in the month of January is at 16,287 which is the highest for any month since the start of the pandemic, the data showed.
17-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi: New cases dip to 12-day low amid testing drop, positivity up slightly||The Capital continued to record a dip in the number of daily Covid-19 infections, with cases on Monday dropping to a 12-day low of 12,527, even as tests fell below the 45,000 mark for the first time in 50 days, showed data released by the Delhi government. Hospitalisations, meanwhile continue to remain low, with 2,784 patients occupying beds in Delhi’s health care facilities, up from 2,711 a day ago. Of Delhi’s 15, 505 dedicated Covid-19 beds, over 82% were still vacant as on Monday, showed the state government’s health bulletin. Compared to nearly 65,000 tests conducted on Sunday, Delhi, on Monday conducted only 44,762, of which 27.99% samples returned positive results. This number, known as the test positivity rate, went up marginally from 27.87% on Sunday. Delhi last added fewer cases on January 5, when the city recorded 10,665 fresh infections. Data released on Monday also showed that 24 people succumbed to the virus. While the government has said the consistent decline in cases could be an indication of the easing of the current Covid-19 wave, it is important to note that the reduction in infections over the last four days came on the back of lower than usual testing. From over 105,000 tests on January 12, to 98,832 tests the day after that, then 79,758 on Friday, 67,624 on Saturday, 65,621 on Sunday and finally 44,726 tests on Monday - tests have dipped consistently in the city, a fall that the state government has attributed to a change in testing protocol by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Monday clarified that who wanted to get tested was being tested and added that no doctors’ prescription is required to get checked for Covid-19 in the Capital. “We are following the testing protocol set by the Centre, and everyone who wants to get tested is being tested. There was also a rumour that people need doctors’ prescription for tests now, but that is not true,” Jain said. As on Monday, just fewer than 84,000 people in Delhi were battling Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhinew-cases-dip-to-12-day-low-amid-testing-drop-positivity-up-slightly-101642443102904.html
17-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi Police bust betting syndicate, arrest mastermind||The Delhi Police crime branch on Monday said they have arrested a 39-year-old fugitive who was one of the masterminds of an organised betting syndicate busted in northeast Delhi’s Bhajanpura in 2015. Police said the accused, Lalit Verma alias Neetu, was operating another betting racket from a hideout in Himachal Pradesh and was arrested when he came to his home in east Delhi’s Uttam Nagar to visit. He carried a reward on ₹50,000 on his arrest.“On Sunday, our team learnt about Verma’s arrival at his home in east Uttam Nagar. A raid was conducted and he was arrested. His name in the Bhajanpura case had surfaced during the interrogation of his arrested father and other accused ,” said deputy commissioner of police (crime) Monika Bhardwaj.Verma’s father was among several associates arrested after the 2015 racket bust. Later in July 2016, the northeast district police arrested former Uttar Pradesh minister DP Yadav, who at that time was already serving a life term in a prison in Dehradun for a murder, on alleged charges of accepting protection money from members of the gang, police said.“They were doing the illegal activities without any difficulty because they were getting protection from former cabinet minister of Uttar Pradesh DP Yadav. The mafia don DP Yadav used to provide them shelter and harboured this syndicate,” said the DCP.Two of the key accusedarrested in 2015 had claimed that they used to send ₹2 lakh per day as protection money to Yadav and his family members, the then deputy commissioner of police (northeast) Ajit Kumar Singla had said on July 26, 2016, after arresting Yadav.Verma was last arrested in 2010 in Ludhiana by the Punjab Police for running an organised betting racket. His interrogation had then revealed that he had earned over ₹100 crores using which bought a number of vehicles and properties across the country, said DCP Bhardwaj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-bust-betting-syndicate-arrest-mastermind-101642442501322.html

17-01-2022||Mumbai||BMC likely to send redrawn ward boundaries to SEC today||Mumbai Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will send revised electoral ward boundaries for all 236 wards in the limits of Greater Mumbai to the state election commissioner for approval on Tuesday, according to civic authorities. In November this year, the Maharashtra government decided to increase nine seats in the BMC from the present 227 to 236. Following this, BMC was tasked with redrawing the boundaries of the existing 227 wards, on the basis of the population of each ward. Suresh Kakani, the additional municipal commissioner in charge of handling the preparations for BMC polls 2022, said on Monday, “The state government wanted to conduct elections for 14 to 15 municipal corporations together. Some municipal corporators had not completed their procedure, and hence, we were waiting to send out the ward boundaries to the EC. We will send it mostly by tomorrow itself.”Following this, reservations for each of these seats will be decided, Kakani said and added that the documents will be made public for suggestions and objections from citizens. “Reservations such as an electoral ward seat reserved for female candidates, or for scheduled caste candidates, are decided by drawing of chits. It is likely that chits will be drawn first, after which the election commission will invite suggestions and objections,” Kakani said.According to BMC officials, five electoral wards will be added in the western suburbs, three in the eastern suburbs, and one in the island city. BMC has redrawn these boundaries by dividing the total population of Mumbai with 236 to determine the population requirement per ward before boundaries are redrawn. A 10%+/- difference in this figure will be accepted as the number of voters per ward. If any electoral ward has a population above that figure, its geographical parts are to be extracted to add to a new ward. This is likely to have a ripple effect on all or neighbouring electoral wards as well, hence the boundaries of several wards will change.The current composition of the civic body has remained unchanged since 2001. The state government did not increase the number of corporators in 2011 even when the population increase was 3.87% between 2001 and 2011. The BMC has also maintained that in the past 20 years, many people who were residing in the island city has relocated to the western and eastern suburbs. The officials said that this intra-city migration has also affected the population density of Mumbai According to senior civic officials, the population at present has increased by 4 per cent in the past 20 years which is why it is now important to increase the number of wards to maintain a uniform voter-councillor ratio.Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar said that she welcomed the decision of the Bombay HC. “The Election Commission and state government have the ultimate say on this and they have taken this decision in the larger interest of the people. The decision to increase wards did not happen in a day as there were discussions before also about increasing the number of wards so that the civic administration can govern the city smoothly,” said Pednekar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-likely-to-send-redrawn-ward-boundaries-to-sec-today-101642442082411.html
17-01-2022||Mumbai||HC dismisses petition challenging increase in BMC seats||Mumbai: The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday dismissed the petition challenging the November 30, 2021 ordinance by which the number of seats in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) for the forthcoming elections were increased from 227 to 236.Detailed and reasoned order will be made available in the evening or tomorrow. The division bench of justice A A Sayed and justice Abhay Ahuja which was hearing the petition filed by BJP councillors Abhijit Samant and Rajshree Shirwadkar had been informed by senior advocate Dr Veerendra Tulzapurkar and advocate Nikhil Sakhardande that the increase of seats was not valid as it was not based on a fresh census. They had argued that as the census of 2011 was used to redraw the ward boundaries for the 2017 BMC elections, so, the same census figures could not be used to increase seats in the 2022 elections.On Monday, the court sought clarity from the Election Commission as to whether the increase of seats was based on the 2011 census and whether any reservations were being implemented through the November 30 ordinance to which the counsel for the EC replied in the negative. Thereafter the bench sought to know whether the petitioners were seeking a stay on the conduction of elections. After advocate Sakhardande responded that the petitioners were not seeking stay on the elections, the court said that it was dismissing the petition and would pass a detailed and reasoned order in due course.Reacting to the order, Bhalchandra Shirsat, senior BJP corporator and spokesperson of the party in BMC said, “We have not yet decided if we want to approach the Supreme Court or not. The petition was filed because the number of seats were being increased to provide political advantage to the ruling Shiv Sena. According to the government of Maharashtra there has been 3.87 percent increase in the population of the city, but these numbers are based as per the census data of 2011. There has been no census conducted since then and if the delimitation was so necessary then why it was not done before the 2017 elections?”Earlier in December 2020, the Congress in BMC had written to the state government demanding fresh delimitation of civic wards. Ravi Raja, Congress corporator and leader of opposition had written to the CM saying that certain ward boundaries were redrawn during the 2017 elections to favour the BJP.“We welcome the Court’s decision and the state government has the power to change the number of seats if they want to. Increasing the ward boundaries will make governance easier and will help in maintaining an uniform voter-corporator ratio in many wards,” said Raja.Yashwant Jadhav, Shiv Sena corporator and chairperson of the BMC standing committee, said, “Moving the court in every trivial issue is part of a pressure tactics of the BJP. We welcome the court order because considering the change in demography, population and infrastructure in the city of Mumbai fresh delimitation of wards was very much necessary in the city.”The councillors had also argued that the Supreme Court had stayed the ordinance promulgated by the Maharashtra government for the Other Backward Class (OBC) category for local body elections across the state as it was not based on any empirical data in the 2011 census and hence the November 30 ordinance allowing increase of nine seats in BMC should also be set aside.However, the state government represented by advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni had argued that the Ordinance had the status of a legislation and hence the court could not interfere. Kumbhakoni had further stated that as the census for 2021 was not conducted due to the pandemic, hence there was no restriction on basing the increase of nine seats for the 2022 BMC elections on the 2011 census as such an exercise had not been undertaken during the 2012 or 2017 BMC elections.AG Kumbhakoni had also argued that the stay by the Supreme Court was for OBC reservation as the 2011 census did not have any empirical data of the persons belonging to such a category, however, there was no such condition for increasing seats for the general population and hence the apex court order could not be applied for the November 30 ordinance.Senior advocate Anil Sakhare for the BMC had adopted the arguments of the state government and had added that as the population had increased it was imperative to increase the seats so that there was a proportionate representation of citizens in the jurisdiction of the civic authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-dismisses-petition-challenging-increase-in-bmc-seats-101642441961298.html

17-01-2022||Mumbai||HC refuses anticipatory bail to Nitesh Rane||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday rejected the anticipatory bail application (ABA) of BJP MLA and union minister Narayan Rane’s son Nitesh Rane, who has been booked by Kankavali police station in Sindhudurg district in connection with an attempt to murder case of December 18. The state government however will continue with its statement of no coercive action against Nitesh Rane till January 27. On December 18, Parab, a Sena functionary from Kankavali in Sindhudurg, was allegedly assaulted in the backdrop of the Sindhudurg District Cooperative Bank election scheduled to take place on December 30. Parab is a close associate of chairperson Satish Sawant, who was defeated by Nitesh Rane in the 2019 assembly polls for the Kankavali seat. Parab told the police that while he was on his bike on the Kankavali-Nardave road at around 11am, an Innova car without a number plate hit his vehicle. A person alighted from the car and told Parab that since Parab worked for Sena leader Satish Sawant, he would ‘deal with him’ after which the assailant stabbed Parab in the chest. The complaint stated that Parab heard the assailant tell another occupant in the car to inform Nitesh Rane about the incident. Senior advocate Niteen Pradhan submitted that his client, Nitesh Rane, had cooperated with the investigators and given a written statement on December 24 but the criminal proceedings against him were being pursued due to the cat calls made by him on December 23 against Aaditya Thackeray outside Vidhan Bhavan. Special public prosecutor Sudeep Pasbola submitted that Nitesh Rane’s claim that the FIR was an act of vendetta due to the December 23 incident was not valid as the attempt to murder case happened on December 18 and Rane was issued notice on December 21. The state government said that there was no political vendetta involved and that it had evidence of a conspiracy wherein Nitesh Rane’s involvement came to light after the arrest of another accused. Hence, Nitesh Rane’s application should be rejected. In its order the bench observed that while the persons who allegedly hired people from Pune had been arrested, custody of Rane was not being sought by the investigators only for the purpose of recovery of any article but also for interrogation. “The court in such a case is required to balance the conflicting considerations of personal liberty and a need for proper investigation in a larger societal interest. At this stage, proper investigation is the paramount consideration,” said the court in its order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-refuses-anticipatory-bail-to-nitesh-rane-101642441661232.html

17-01-2022||Lucknow||UP polls: Keshav Prasad Maurya targets SP over selection, replacement of Kairana candidate||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya on Monday targeted the Samajwadi Party (SP) for replacing Nahid Hasan, the SP candidate from the Kairana assembly seat in west UP, with his sister Iqra.Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya also hit out at SP chief Akhilesh Yadav for taking a pledge with grain in hand about working for the welfare of the farmers, if voted to power. “I have heard that under severe criticism, the SP has now replaced its tainted candidate from Kairana with his sister. This is unacceptable as the BJP believes that fielding a tainted individual or any of their family members is equally wrong,” Keshav Prasad Maurya said, addressing media persons at the BJP headquarters in Lucknow on Monday. Nahid Hasan was arrested under the Gangsters Act on Saturday. Immediately after that, top BJP leaders, including chief minister Yogi Adityanath, had targeted the SP for fielding ‘tainted’ candidates. Union information and broadcasting minister Anurag Thakur had also hit out at the SP on the issue. He said while the BJP was drawing honest leaders and professionals, the SP was fielding those lawmakers who were either on jail or just out on bail. “As for Akhileshji’s pledge to work for farmers, all I can say is that it is just a political stunt. What did the SP do for farmers when it was in power? They should have then provided MSP to farmers for their produce, cleared dues of sugarcane farmers,” Keshav Prasad Maurya said. “Yeh koi nayi sapa nahin, wahi sapa hai (this is no new SP, it’s the same old SP),” Keshav Prasad Maurya said. This remark was made in the context of a SP campaign theme – ‘nayi sapa hai, nayi hawa hai .. (it’s a new SP and welcome winds of change are blowing). Several political leaders joined the BJP on the occasion. The new joinees included former lawmaker and state vice-president of the Congress Daljit Singh, Rashmi Arya, former Samajwadi Party lawmaker from Mauranipur in Bundelkhand, Brajmohan Singh Kushwaha, a former zonal coordinator who held a position equivalent to a minister of state, Dr Surbhi, who had earlier contested the elections on the Samajwadi Party ticket, and Satendra Chauhan, former state chief of the Janwadi Party in Azamgarh.“Virtually daily, someone or the other is joining us and the list of those eyeing entry into the BJP from across parties is huge,” BJP co media-incharge Himanshu Dubey said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-polls-keshav-prasad-maurya-targets-sp-over-selection-replacement-of-kairana-candidate-101642441360942.html
17-01-2022||Mumbai||Cannot rule out further surge in Maha, say experts as Mumbai breaches 1 million mark||Mumbai Maharashtra on Monday added 31,111 new Covid-19 cases, the drop can be attributed to a lower number of tests done in the last 24 hours. Between January 12 and January 16, Maharashtra clocked over 40,000 cases daily, with over 2,00,000 tests conducted every day. Experts said the next two weeks will be crucial in the state’s battle against the third wave of Covid-19 as the state could see a rise in cases due to the spread of the Omicron variant.In the last 24 hours, the state tested 1,50,489 samples and had a positivity rate of 20.67 percent. The state’s active case count stood at 2,67,334 on Monday. Meanwhile, Mumbai breached the million mark in terms of cumulative Covid-19 cases on Monday with the addition of 5,956 fresh cases. Mumbai’s active case count was 50,757. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the State Covid task force, said that Mumbai is likely to see a decline in cases now and it could follow the pattern of the wave in South Africa. “Mumbai’s Covid-19 cases were at their peak last week, and the curve is flattening now. Cities like Mumbai which are past their peak will see cases declining. But that doesn’t mean that we should relax. It appears that we are following the South African pattern where there was a rapid rise and a quick fall,” Dr Joshi said.State Covid task force members said that Maharashtra’s numbers were primarily driven by the surge in Covid cases in Mumbai. The Delta strain is present to a considerable degree in other parts of the state, if Omicron replaces it, there could be a rise. However, the experts also pointed out that numbers could remain low due to a change in the Centre’s testing protocol, which now mandates Covid tests of only symptomatic and senior citizens.Joshi said it would be “difficult to predict numbers”. Maharashtra’s numbers were driven mainly by Mumbai and the next two weeks are going to be crucial, he said, adding that “We cannot rule out a similar surge (like Mumbai) in the rest of Maharashtra.”Joshi said it would be “difficult to predict numbers” and added, “Maharashtra numbers were driven mainly by Mumbai. And the next two weeks are going to be crucial.” He further added, “Maharashtra is on an upswing. We cannot rule out a similar surge (like Mumbai) in the rest of Maharashtra.”A senior health department official said it would be early to say that the wave was stabilising in Maharashtra. “It has been only 12 days to a week that we have seen an increase [in daily cases]. The numbers need to remain consistent for a period with enough daily tests to know if it was stabilising. Mumbai Covid cases drove the numbers for Maharashtra, but now Mumbai seems to be stabilising. The district administration and civic bodies need to remain vigilant for the next two weeks as well,” he said, requesting anonymity.Dr Joshi said that the testing guidelines which were revised recently could show low numbers. “The testing guidelines have changed. Nearly 80 percent of positive cases are asymptomatic. Now, only symptomatic people are tested so the numbers may remain low due to the change in the testing strategy.”The task force member added that those contracting the infection must not take it lightly. “We are still getting a proportion of the [infected] population with the Delta variant. Many are getting hospitalised. So people should not dismiss as mild and remain in touch with their doctors, check their saturation, and follow the Covid timetable. Even if people are asymptomatic and they step out of isolation after seven days, they must wear double-mask so that others are not affected.”Maharashtra on Monday also reported 122 new cases of Omicron variant, taking the total tally to 1,860. Out of these, 959 have been discharged following a negative RT-PCR test. Of the new cases reported on Monday, 40 were from Pune city, 29 from Mira-Bhayander, 26 from Nagpur, 14 from Aurangabad, seven from Amravati, four from Mumbai, and one each from Bhandara, Thane city and Pimpri-Chinchwad.The Omicron cases are largely concentrated in Mumbai (656), Pune (742), Nagpur (116), Thane (114) districts. Rural and semi-urban centres such as Amravati, Satara, Kolhapur, Aurangabad, Osmanabad, Akola, Ahmednagar, Jalna, Wardha, and Bhandara also have reported Omicron variant cases. The spread of the heavily mutated variant in these parts need to be contained to keep the spread of covid in control, officials said.

There should be availability of masks, sanitisers, infrared thermometers at every centre,” Yogi said in a Covid review meeting with “Team 9” on Monday.UPTET-2021 was cancelled on November 28 last year after a paper leak came to fore following which several people were arrested. Some senior officials of the examination regulatory body in Prayagraj were also found guilty in a subsequent probe by the state government. In order to maintain the integrity of the examination, the additional chief secretary, home, additional director general, law and order, the principal secretary, basic education, along with district magistrates, basic education officers and other officers concerned have been asked to look into the arrangements through videoconferencing.The chief minister also instructed the officials that past record of institutes must be taken into account before making them exam centre. He said the institutions with dubious image must not be made exam centres at all. The result of UPTET-2021 will be declared on February 25. The examination would be conducted in two shifts: 10am to 12:30pm for primary level teachers and from 2:30pm to 5pm for upper primary level teachers.The Examination Regulatory Authority (ERA), Prayagraj, will release the answer key of the examination on January 27 and aspirants will have the opportunity to register their online objections to it by February 1. A special committee will go through the objections on February 21 and publish the final answer keys on February 23, an official said.After evaluation of the answer sheet based on the amended answer keys, the result will then be declared on February 25. UPTET is a state-level exam conducted once a year to enable candidates to gain eligibility to teach primary (classes 1-5) and upper primary (classes 6-8) in schools of the Uttar Pradesh government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/check-past-records-of-exam-centres-ensure-covid-norms-cm-yogi-on-uptet2021-101642441062174.html

17-01-2022||Pune||Social media crime recorded 100% rise in 2021 in Pune||PUNE Technology has been a silver lining during the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic as communication, business and personal interactions moved online. But cybercrime remains a problem for citizens and the police in Pune.The number of cybercrime complaints reported based on misuse of social networking sites doubled in 2021 compared to 2020. The overall number of complaints have seen an exponential increase since 2018. The city cybercrime cell received 19,023 total complaints in 2021 that belong to various categories, such as monetary frauds, sending vulgar messages on phones, email hacking, stealing online data and defaming people by posting morphed pictures in social media and many more. According to Pune cybercrime police data, 14,950 such complaints were reported in 2020 and 7,795 in 2019.The methods of defrauding people have become innovative, according to Bhagyashree Navatake, deputy commissioner of police, cybercrime and Economic offence wing of Pune police. “There were innovative ways of defrauding people every 8-10 days. When Covid began, the number of cases of calling up positive patients and duping them increased. This happened in addition to the casual approach of people who click on links and share OTP. The use of e-commerce and various kinds of software also increased . These factors contributed to the rise in cases,” said DCP Navatake.Among social media-related cybercrime, the cases from popular platforms Facebook and Instagram are the highest. The city police introduced a new section for its records for “sextortion” and “friendship fraud”, on Facebook and Instagram, which consist of cases of using sexual images or videos for extortion. The highest number of cases were of defamation and posts by making fake profiles or making vulgar comments on posts or through messages. The number of cases doubled from 791 in 2020, to 1,518 in 2021.On other platforms including Twitter, the new section added for record was of posting vulgar comments on Zoom meetings and uploading of videos on social media sites other than Facebook and Instagram. The trend has seen a worrying rise among minor victims and adults equally. Children were exposed to added screentime owing to the online schooling necessitated by the lockdown, said officials.While social media cases rose exponentially, the highest contributor of cybercrime complaints was online banking fraud. The cases of online banking fraud include bank cards, third party payment options, QR code scan, lottery fraud, job fraud, matrimonial fraud, loan fraud, and KYC update fraud. Among the cases of online banking fraud, the number of cases of misuse of bank cards was the highest contributor followed by job fraud, loan fraud, money transfer using third party methods. The new entrant in this list is Fastag cheating which took up pace when the central government made use of Fastag mandatory.The police have managed to get a refund of the money lost in some of the cases. The total amount refunded in 2021 by the cybercrime cell, however, has seen a record low in the past four years. The cyber cell refunded ₹37,902,535 in 2021 compared to ₹ 96,090,893 in 2020, ₹113,935,459 in 2019, and ₹41,855,975 in 2018, according to police records.“In 2020 as well as 2019, there was a major chunk of refund from cases like Cosmos bank fraud and Bitcoin case. That way, the recovery in multiple smaller cases is much more this year compared to earlier years,” said DCP Navatake.In the final quarter 2021 year, the cybercrime cell has registered five major cases related to malpractices in exams including Teacher eligibility test (TET) 2018, TET 2020, health department recruitment exam Group D, Group C, and Maharashtra housing and area development authority (MHADA) recruitment exam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/social-media-crime-recorded-100-rise-in-2021-in-pune-101642440822471.html
17-01-2022||Lucknow||Interests of youth, OBCs, women security overlooked in UP: Rewati Raman||Veteran Samajwadi Party (SP) leader and Rajya Sabha MP Kunwar Rewati Raman Singh on Monday expressed his displeasure on the way the “interests of the youth, Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and women security had been overlooked by the incumbent BJP government in UP”. Addressing party workers via online medium, he alleged that there had been rampant corruption in the recruitment process of all government jobs. He also alleged that the UP government had deliberately sidelined the OBC youth from getting selected.Singh further alleged that on one hand both the state and the central governments had failed to create jobs for the youth, multiple leakages of question papers of exams had rubbed salt on their wounds on the other. “In 2017, the BJP leadership lured the OBCs with promises and did not deliver on them by which OBCs, which constitute nearly 55-60 percent of the electorate, feel cheated,” he said while expressing confidence that SP will wrest power from the BJP in the upcoming UP assembly polls. On women safety, he alleged that in last five years there had been large number of incidents of brutal atrocities and rape in most districts of UP in which the government did not take necessary action. The government lacked the genuine intention to provide a safe and secured environment to the women of UP, the SP leader alleged. “The skyrocketing rise in prices of edible oils, petrol, cooking gas has disturbed the household expenditure of the poor and they are infuriated,” claimed Singh while urging party workers to motivate people to vote for the SP. He urged the party workers to visit door to door and ensure a thumping victory of all SP candidates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/interests-of-youth-obcs-women-security-overlooked-in-up-rewati-raman-101642440700852.html
17-01-2022||Pune||This is the end of Kathak: Prabha Marathe remembers her guru Pandit Birju Maharaj||Pune: Looking at a life-size painting of Pandit Birju Maharaj at her dance studio, Kala Chaya, frail yet strong 85-year-old Kathak dancer Prabha Marathe paid respect to her guru by bending forward with folded hands. “This is the end of Kathak,” she said, remembering her guru who taught her the finer nuances of the dance representing his Lucknowi Gharana, “his style, his passion is gone with him.” Pandit Birju Maharaj breathed his last in Delhi in the early hours of Monday after suffering a heart attack on January 17, 2022. He was 83. “My guruji Padma Vibhushan Birju Maharaj was born Brij Mohan Nath Mishra on February 4, 1937, in a well-known family of Kathak dancers. I first saw him perform in Mumbai at Birla Matoshree and simply knew then that I wanted to train under his tutelage; I found my calling,” said Marathe, who was then a disciple of Rohini Bhate for ten years. According to Marathe, his dance had so much impact on her that she was ready to move to Delhi. “I was 22 then and once he realised I was serious, he called me to be part of his dance ballets and train under his guidance. I used to get paid ₹100 a month then and learned a lot. He is all about being graceful and his ‘kalai mod’ (wrist movements) bring magic in every dance. His form, well-balanced proportionate style of dancing and grace made him stand out,” she said. Marathe set up Kala Chaya first at Prabhat road in 1965 and until 2017, Pandit Birju Maharaj has visited it every year, to be part of the annual dance recitals. This also encouraged Marathe to set up a chair in Panditji’s name for advanced studies in dance. It was an honour to establish a chair in his name on his 73rd birthday on February 4, in 2010, Marathe stated saying his special scholarship helped facilitate yearly workshops on Indian classical dance by established artists for the advanced level dance students of the organisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/this-is-the-end-of-kathak-prabha-marathe-remembers-her-guru-pandit-birju-maharaj-101642440640758.html

The corporation made this admission during the virtual hearing of the case by the commission and urged it to cut the capital cost under different heads by ₹4,642 crore because the cost, as claimed by the company, was ₹5.50 crore per mw, which the corporation’s lawyer argued was too high. “The capital cost of the 1980 mw Lalitpur plan should not be allowed to be more than ₹10,890 crore,” he demanded. The commission asked the petitioners to submit their objections by January 25 and asked Bajaj Group to submit their response to the same. “The same UPPCL, which today admitted the plant’s capital cost to be inflated once used to justify the cost and defend the developer when the UPERC would hear our petition,” said UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Parishad chairman Avadhesh Kumar Verma who participated in the hearing as a petitioner. “The UPPCL is buying power from the Lalitpur plant at high tariff because of very high capital cost,” said Verma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uppcl-takes-u-turn-on-lalitpur-thermal-plant-s-capital-cost-101642440580801.html

However, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders raised objection to Pawar’s metro ride before the inauguration of the project. The NCP chief was accompanied by the party office-bearers and Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (Maha-Metro) managing director Brijesh Dixit. Pune Metro plans to start commercial operations of two priority stretches —Phugewadi to Pimpri-Chinchwad and Vanaz to Garware college — by January end or February this year. Dixit shared with Pawar the ticket system and other details of the project during the trial run. With the BJP ruling Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal corporations, the party plans to invite Prime Minister Narendra Modi to inaugurate the Pune metro rail. Deputy chief minister and Pune district guardian minister Ajit Pawar has also kickstarted the metro trials in the city in the past. BJP state unit president Chandrakant Patil said, “Pawar is not holding any constitutional post and yet the Maha-Metro officials offered him a trial ride before the inauguration of the project. I am going to raise this issue in the assembly. Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad have 11 MLAs and MP Girish Bapat. Pawar is a Rajya Sabha MP. If Maha-Metro wants to offer trials to political leaders, they should invite all MPs and MLAs from the city.” Patil said the credit for Pune Metro project goes to the prime minister while the then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis took up the plan on priority. “However, others having no contribution to the metro project are trying to take the credit,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sharad-pawar-takes-pune-metro-trial-ride-draws-flak-from-bjp-101642439986000.html

PMC did not utilise these funds. As per the available information 12 toilets are not working.”The MNS also said that these toilets were constructed on footpaths and near existing public toilets.

The completion work has reached its final stages. While the initial deadline was June 2021, the project was delayed due to Covid-19 pandemic and traffic congestion on the road.Maha-Metro PRO Hemant Sonawane said, “The flyover work is nearly complete. The finishing and painting work is going on. Major work has been completed. It will take three to four weeks more.”The project is jointly executed by Pune Municipal Corporation and Maha-Metro. “It can also get completed early; however, we are expecting it by mid-February. Traffic flow was the main concern as we cannot block the complete road while working on the flyover. We can block only one side of the road. Even at night the majority of work was carried by blocking one side of the road. During the first wave many workers left for their hometowns which slowed down the work. Now it is on track,” said an official requesting anonymity.Commuters are also hoping for the flyover to commence operations. ““There should be no more delays from PMC to begin the operations, the traffic has increased now like it was in pre-Covid days,” said Pradeep Deshmukh, resident of Pratiknagar.Work almost completeFlyover is 572 metres in length and 6.1 metres wide.PMC contributed ₹30 crore and Maha-Metro will add ₹26 crore to construct this flyover.It has 13 pillars with three of them in the middle of Nal Stop square.The top tier of the flyover will be for the metro rail while the lower tier will cater to vehicular traffic.Flyover starts after SNDT chowk on Karve road and passes over Nal Stop chowk and will descend just before the next square.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/nal-stop-flyover-gains-pace-maha-metro-eyes-feb-finish-101642439203613.html
17-01-2022||Mumbai||Use Molnupiravir with “abundant caution”: State||Mumbai The state government asked all districts and corporations to use the new antiviral drug Molnupiravir with “abundant caution” on Monday. A letter issued by the additional chief secretary Pradeep Vyas stated that the drug must not be prescribed to Covid patients below 18 years and pregnant women. It also stated that the drug should be avoided for women in the reproductive age group. “The biggest concern with Molnupiravir is its potential for adverse effects such as induced mutations on the reproductive cells, such as males and female gametes,” Vyas said in his letter. “Secondly, the fast-dividing cells may accumulate mutations in bone and cartilages. Most importantly, Molnupiravir, when taken in suboptimal doses, is likely to cause sublethal mutations and perpetuate further variants. Hence, it is very very important to take a full course, once the medicine is started,” he said. Molnupiravir was granted emergency use approval by the Indian drug regulator at the end of December. However, the Centre’s latest treatment protocol issued on Monday does not include the drug. Recently, Odisha stopped the use of the drug. In his letter, Vyas said that the drug should be prescribed to Covid patients who have mild illness and does not require oxygen in the first five days of the illness. “If prescribed to patients in the reproductive age group, women with childbearing potential are advised to use a reliable method of birth control correctly and consistently during treatment with Molnupiravir and for three months after the final dose. Men with reproductive potential who are sexually active with women of childbearing potential should also be advised to use a reliable method of birth control correctly and consistently during treatment with Molnupiravir and for at least three months after the final dose as the drug impacts the sperm cells,” the letter said. Doctors across the state have been widely prescribing the drug since it hit the market. A doctor said that many patients who don’t fit the criteria have also been prescribed the drug. In a media briefing held on January 5, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) head Dr Balaram Bhargava has said that Molnupiravir was not included in the Covid treatment protocol because of its safety concerns such as teratogenicity (ability to cause defects in a developing fetus), mutagenicity, risk of cartilage and muscle damage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/use-molnupiravir-with-abundant-caution-state-101642439140599.html

Both the parties wanted Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) type, a three-party coalition along with Congress in Goa as well but Congress leaders are reluctant to join hands with any of the parties for assembly polls.“We wanted to contest assembly polls along with Congress but it is not happening because of local Congress leaders. Even if Congress wants to go solo, senior NCP leader Praful Patel and housing minister Jitendra Awhad will hold a meeting with Shiv Sena leaders to finalize the alliance in Goa. Patel will also be making the announcement after the meeting,” said Nawab Malik, chief spokesperson and NCP minister on Monday.Patel is in-charge of the Goa NCP unit. Malik said that the three-party coalition comprising Congress, NCP and Sena would have helped in ousting BJP from power. He also accused Goa Congress leader and former chief minister Digambar Kamat of obstructing the alliance between the old allies.“If Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena would have come together, it would have helped a lot. But a few Congress leaders who had taken a stand (against alliance with NCP) five years ago, especially Digambar Kamat, who had imposed several conditions then, it is because of them that BJP has been in power in Goa for the last five years. The same set of people is creating trouble (for alliance) even now,” he said.The Congress-NCP alliance had ruled the coastal state in 2007-2012. NCP had alliance with Congress during 2012 polls and had contested on seven seats but could not win a single seat. In 2017, their talks with Congress for a pre-poll alliance failed and both the parties contested on their own.NCP contested on 14 seats and managed to win one seat. Its lone MLA Churchill Alemao joined the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in December last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ncpsena-to-finalise-alliance-for-goa-polls-on-tuesday-101642438480599.html
17-01-2022||Lucknow||Seers of two Akhadas at loggerheads over control of Prayagraj’s Veni Madhav Temple||Two factions of seers belonging to Shripanchayati Akhada Mahanirwani and Juna Akhada are at loggerheads over the control of the ancient and revered Veni Madhav Temple located in Daraganj area of Prayagraj. Akhadas are the Hindu monastic orders. The tussle started following the recent death of the temple priest, and both the factions tried to take control of the temple, dedicated to Lord Vishnu and his consort Goddess Lakshmi, on Saturday night. The district police and administration were forced to intervene following a face-off and for the time being, the temple, located close to Sangam, has been closed. Both the factions have been asked to present documents in support of their demand to the authorties. The tussle began when a group of seers belonging to Shripanchayati Akhada Mahanirwani entered the temple premises on Saturday night and demanded the removal of temple mahant Vibhuti Narayan Tripathi, who belongs to Juna Akhada. Soon seers of the other group also assembled at the temple resulting in a brawl. Daraganj police intervened after receiving information and managed to restore peace. Senior officials including ADM City Madan Kumar, ACM fourth Kanchan and CO Astha Jaiswal also reached the spot. The temple premises were evacuated, and both factions were called to the police station for discussion. Daraganj circle officer Astha Jaiswal said police intervened to maintain peace and order on the temple premises. Both factions have been asked to arrive with relevant documents and resolve their dispute in presence of administrative officials on January 18, she added. The seers belonging to Mahanirwani Akhada under mahant Raghuraj Giri said after the death of temple mahant Omkar Giri, he was given ‘Bhu Samadhi’ by Uma Shankar Giri, Prabhat Giri, Abhishek Dubey, Vibhuti Narayan Tripathi and Vivek Tiwari during the lockdown period without informing him. Later they came to know that except for Umashankar Giri and Prabhat Giri, all other seers have been ousted from the temple. Vibhuti Narayan Tripathi proclaimed himself as mahant “illegally” and used funds worth ₹97 lakh received during Kumbh for the renovation of the temple premises. Raghuraj Giri said that Shripanchayati Akhada Mahanirwani has been traditionally taking care of the temple and performing puja. The seers also obstructed the Aarti. After the intervention of the police, Aarti was performed, and force has been deployed on the temple premises. Guru Parampara has been followed at Veni Madhav Temple traditionally which included mahant Kailash Giri, mahant Saryu Giri, mahant Madhav Giri, mahant Ramgiri, mahant Omkar Giri, mahant Satyanand Giri and Purushottam Giri heading it from time to time. Mahant Purushottam Giri was guru of Raghuraj Giri and made Omkar Giri the mahant of Veni Madhav Temple. Before 2013, Veni Madhav Temple was taken care of by Mahanirwani Akhada, but later Juna Akhada anointed Omkar Giri as mahamandaleshwar. After his death, Vibhuti Narayan Tripathi was given the responsibility of the temple, which triggered the dispute of control of the temple between seers of Mahanirwani and Juna Akhada, informed a senior seer aware of the developments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/seers-of-two-akhadas-at-loggerheads-over-control-of-prayagraj-s-veni-madhav-temple-101642438242829.html
17-01-2022||Lucknow||Union minister Sanjeev Balyan meets BKU chief Naresh Tikait in Sisauli||Union minister of state Sanjeev Balyan met Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) chief Naresh Tikait at the latter’s residence in Sisauli in Muzaffarnagar district on Monday, less than a month before the seven-phase Uttar Pradesh assembly elections begin on February 10. Sanjeev Balyan is also the BJP MP from Muzaffarnagar.Bhartiya Kisan Union media incharge Dharmendra Malik said it was a courtesy visit by the minister to enquire about Naresh Tikait’s health after he underwent shoulder surgery last week.Sanjeev Balyan said to the news agency ANI after his meeting, “We are like a family. We keep meeting often. As of now, I came here to know about his health. He is recovering well. We had a good meeting.”Dharmendra Malik said it was the minister’s first meeting with Naresh Tikait after withdrawal of the farmers’ protest at Delhi borders.Before this, Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) chief Jayant Chaudhary had visited the BKU chief in hospital.Naresh Tikait had sustained a shoulder injury after he slipped in the bathroom last week and was operated upon in a Noida hospital, the BKU media incharge further said.Sanjeev Balyan remained with Naresh Tikait for over half an hour along with a few associates.This courtesy meeting, however, is being seen as a significant move by Balyan who arrived in Sisauli after a long time. At the height of the farmers’ agitation, Naresh Tikait had earlier cautioned BJP leaders against entering Sisauli, the BKU headquarters, and said if they came it would be at their own risk.Sanjeev Balyan interacted with Naresh Tikait a day after the latter blessed three RLD candidates Rajpal Balyan (Budhana), Chandan Chauhan (Meerapur) and Pankaj Malik (Charthawal), who met the BKU chief.Malik further said Naresh Tikait has clarified that his blessings are for all who visit him but being a member of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), he can’t get involved with any political party or their candidates.So far, both Samyukt Kisan Morcha, which is the umbrella body of several farmer unions, and BKU has refrained from promoting any political party.Last year, Naresh Tikait, while addressing a mahapanchayat in Muzaffarnagar, had said supporting the BJP was a “mistake” and farmers will correct it.The BJP won all the six seats in Muzaffarnagar in the 2017 assembly elections in which the Hindutva plank worked well after the Muzaffarnagar riots of September 2013.The BJP broke the RLD’s winning combination of Jats and Muslims, resulting in the defeat of the then RLD chief Ajit Singh and his son Jayant Chaudhary on their home turf in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha polls.The farmers’ movement, however, succeeded in reviving the unity of Jats and Muslims, which gave a new lease of life to RLD and BKU chief Naresh Tikait’s blessings to its candidates have further strengthened its hopes.Shiv Sena Rajy Sabha MP Sanjay Raut had met BKU leader Rakesh Tikait, Naresh Tikait’s brother, on January 13.Rakesh Tikait is scheduled to go to Lakhimpur Kheri on January 21. He said to reporters on Saturday that he will meet the farmers there and decide upon the future course of farmers’ agitation.The polling in Uttar Pradesh will be held on February 10, 14, 20, 23, 27 and March 3 and 7 in seven phases. The counting of votes will take place on March 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/union-minister-sanjeev-balyan-meets-bku-chief-naresh-tikait-in-sisauli-101642437940492.html

In all, 33 migrant workers from Giridih and Hazaribag districts are stuck in Mali’s capital district Bamako. They claim they haven’t been paid for the last three months and the contractor who hired them for the project has fled from Mali with their passports. “The contractor, Ramesh Chakravarty, fled to India on January 6 this year. He didn’t inform us and he also took away our passports. We have not been paid for past three months. We are hardly left with any money. In the next 2-3 days, even our ration would exhaust. We don’t even know if the contractor has paid the rent for our present accommodation. We want authorities to help us in getting back home and also ensure our pending salaries are cleared,” Dilip Mahto, one of the workers stuck in Mali, said over phone. Dilip Mahto belongs to Tirla village under Bagodar police station in Giridih district. Other workers also belong to Giridih and neighbouring Hazaribag district. Topeshwar Mahto, whose father Chhedilal Mahto is also among those stuck in Mali, said the contractor had been exploiting the workers ever since he took them there in January 2021. “My father informed us the contractor never paid them on time. Moreover, they were not paid the salary as promised,” said 25-year-old Topeshwar, who does odd jobs in his village Murma in Hazaribag while preparing for government job examinations. The whole issue was raised by Sikander Ali, a local rights activist in Giridih, on different platforms, including social media.State’s education minister Jagarnath Mahto, in a tweet, urged union external affairs minister S Jaishankar to intervene in the matter, besides requesting state’s labour minister Satyanand Bhokta to follow up.Bhokta said he was monitoring the situation and has directed the state migrant workers’ control room to the needful. Convener of the control room, Johnson Topon, said they have established contact with the stuck workers and speaking to authorities for their safe return. “We are lining up a virtual meeting with the management of the Hyderabad-based company at the work site in Mali. We will also soon be in touch with the Indian embassy there. We are also getting the exact details of the contractor so that we can ensure a case is registered against him and penal action taken as per law,” said Topno.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jkhand-workers-stuck-in-mali-seek-help-for-return-home-101642437100404.html

In Ghaziabad to review Covid preparedness, the CM on Monday inspected the L3 category facility of Santosh Medical College here and nearby vaccination camps where he interacted with children in the 15-18 age group. “As part of our Covid management, we have been able to save lives and means of livelihood of people. I visited Ghaziabad during the first and second Covid waves and I am here too during the third wave. There was a malicious campaign against the vaccine by people and it was a campaign against humanity. It fell flat and everyone became aware that the vaccines made in India are one of the finest,” CM Yogi said at Santosh Medical College. “We imposed night curfew from 10pm to 6am while schools and colleges have been closed till January 23. During this period, we have a target to complete the first dose vaccination for children as well as first dose for all other categories. We also plan to complete the precaution dose for beneficiaries. At present, UP has the highest number vaccine doses given to people,” he added. “During this wave, the number of patients in hospitals is less than 1% of the active cases. The third wave is less harmful in comparison to the second. But it is a disease and we have to save children, women and senior citizens. For this, we have also installed 5,500 public address systems for awareness,” the CM said. Office-bearers of the Congress said that the hardships people faced during the previous waves of the pandemic were still fresh in minds of people. “It is for the first time that people saw dead bodies floating in river Ganga and people even died on roads. Tokens issued for cremation of bodies while people were running here and there for oxygen supplies. Migrant workers were out on roads headed to their native places. So, everyone has seen how things were dealt with in UP during the pandemic,” said Dolly Sharma, member of All India Congress Committee and spokesperson of UP Congress Committee. “We have seen people running from pillar to post for oxygen supplies for their friends, family and relatives. During the past two waves, the people of UP suffered a lot. All the difficulties are fresh in the minds of people and the sufferings will also play a major role in the elections,” said Rashid Malik, district president of the Samajwadi Party. During his address, the CM also mentioned that the UP government, after the second wave, added about 550 new oxygen plants. Eleven of these plants had come up in Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/malicious-campaign-against-covid-vaccine-fell-flat-says-up-cm-101642437043455.html
17-01-2022||Patna||NDA crossfire in Bihar flares up with state BJP chief’s FB post||PATNA The ongoing crossfire between the two key constituents of the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar flared up on Monday when Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) state unit president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal warned ally Janata Dal (United) of chief minister Nitish Kumar that “76 lakh party workers know how to answer” if JD(U) leaders continue to tag Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Twitter. BJP in Bihar has been increasingly assertive against JD(U) since it outperformed the ally in the 2020 assembly polls, picking 74 seats against 45 won by the latter.In a hard-hitting post on Facebook on Monday, Jaiswal wrote, “To keep the NDA strong, we all will need to follow the basic decorum. It cannot be one sided. The first step in that direction is to stop playing Twitter-Twitter with PM, as he is the pride of every BJP leader and worker. If anything has to be said to him, the talks should be direct. If one plays Twitter-Twitter, the 76 lakh BJP workers know how to answer. I hope we all will take note of this.” Jaiswal was alluding to tweets by JD(U) leaders like its national president Rajiv Ranjan alias Lalan Singh and parliamentary board chief Upendra Kushwaha ssues like special status for Bihar, special assistance and withdrawal of award from the writer for objectionable portrayal of Emperor Ashok.Jaiswal, who represents West Champaran in the Lok Sabha, further said there could not be anything more absurd than asking the PM to withdraw an award given by the President. JD(U) leaders like Kushwaha have been demanding that the awards given to Dayal Prakash Sinha, recipient of Padma Award and Sahitya Akademi Award, should be withdrawn after his controversial portrayal of Emperor Ashok, whose empire’s capital was Patliputra, the present day Patna.“We are 100 times more critical of Sinha than you. For you, it is an issue just like your campaign for educational improvement in Bihar (Kushwaha had launched it when he was not in JD-U), but Jan Sangh and BJP were born out of cultural nationalism. We cannot tolerate any tampering with our culture and golden legacy, but we also want the coming generations to be made aware of the deeds of Bakhtiar Khilji (Nitish Kumar’s ancestral place is Bakhtiarpur named after him and the BJP has been demanding renaming it) and Aurangzeb. In the last 74 years, there has been not even one instance when Padma Shri was returned. Wrestler Sushil Kumar has been convicted in murder. case, but the President has not withdrawn his medal, as there is no established yardstick for that. But the government has not been hesitant in cracking down on wrongdoers — be it in relation of hate speech or Dharm Sansad,” wrote Jaiswal, who had filed a police case against Sinha last week. He said the Bihar government should first act on his FIR against Sinha, get him arrested and ensure punishment through speedy trial. “After that, a delegation of the Bihar government should meet President and press for withdrawal of award to a convict,” he wrote. In an apparent reference to opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal, which has been attacking the government, he wrote, “We certainly don’t want the CM house to become a place for extracting ransom for murder and kidnapping, like it happened before 2005.”Jaiswal was referring to the 15-year RJD rule in Bihar that ended in 2005, when Nitish Kumar first became the chief minister.The state BJP chief has often taken to Facebook to express his views. Of late, his attacks on ally JD(U) have been getting more direct.In an earlier post on Sunday on the hooch deaths in Nitish Kumar’s home district of Nalanda, he had asked “if all the members of the 11 deceased families would be sent to jail”.Asked to respond, JD(U)’s Kushwaha said on Monday. “A party does not take action. Action is taken by the government of which the BJP is also part. Any body found guilty in such incidents will not be spared by the Nitish government, ” he said, adding that the NDA was united as ever. “We raised the issue of disparaging comments against Emperor Ashok, and that is a separate issue. Everything that Jaiswal has written in his post need not be answered,” he said.Kushwaha said he was with Jaiswal on the need to ensure that the NDA ran smoothly in state’s interest and it was the duty of all the constituents. “But our opposition on the issue of emperor Ashol will continue till withdrawal of award from Sinha, whether it is done at the level of President or PM. Please make it clear if you are with us on award withdrawal or not,” he tweeted. Social analyst professor Nawal Kishore Choudhary said both BJP and JD-U were trying to appear bigger to each other, but none was in a position to dictate terms. “So, both will keep sparring, just keeping the opposition interested. Both know their limitations in Bihar and they will not cross the line unless it becomes impossible to continue,” he said.

17-01-2022||Mumbai||Yogi’s meal at Dalit household for publicity, BJP playing vote bank politics: Shiv Sena||MUMBAI: Days after Uttar Pradesh (UP) chief minister Yogi Adityanath enjoyed a meal at a dalit household in Gorakhpur, the Shiv Sena on Monday took on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) saying that the party is playing vote bank politics. An editorial in the Sena mouthpiece Saamana targeted Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi calling it a ‘publicity’ event. Sena leader and chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut questioned as to when the BJP would forget the caste divide.Saamana slammed the BJP saying that the caste divide is in the minds of the BJP leaders. The editorial taunted the BJP saying that a party which cannot let go of the caste divide is out to bring about a social transformation.“BJP leaders still organise lunch in a dalit household and need to publicise it. This clearly shows that caste is in their minds and they are not ready to let go of it. The country has been divided on the basis of caste for political gains. So the caste eradication programmes are a mere sham... Even today, tickets to contest elections are distributed based on caste arithmetic. The chief minister and Prime Minister give importance to caste and organise meals. They can’t let go of caste and are out to bring about social transformation,” it said.The editorial said that for the past few years, the BJP has used caste as a ‘formula for social transformation’. Referring to the PM who washed the feet of five sanitation workers in UP’s Prayagraj in February 2019, Raut said, “Modi took a dip in the river Ganga and then washed the feet of the dalits. Now BJP leaders are going to their homes. When will you forget caste? We are all human beings and there should not be any caste divide. But you go to a dalit household for meals, this is all pretense. Stop this vote bank politics otherwise the country will once again be divided on caste lines.”As a policy, the Maharashtra unit of the BJP does not respond to criticism in the Sena mouthpiece.Meanwhile, Raut said that the Congress, Samajwadi Party and other non-BJP parties in UP can bring about a change of guard in the largest state of the country. Uttar Pradesh goes to polls in February. Raut also dismissed BJP’s claims that it will win 300 seats. “The manner in which people have seen dead bodies in the Ganga and still they think they will win 300 seats? Will the bodies from the Ganga vote for them? Certainly those who suffered will not vote for them. Akhilesh (Yadav) must completely focus on the election and must take everyone together. People are looking at Akhilesh with a lot of expectations. We are contesting in UP but the power to bring about a change of guard is with the Samajwadi Party and Congress,” Raut said.

In the shadow of Covid-19 and strict vigil of authorities, there are less numbers of Kalpwasis this time but those present have braved the intense cold and pandemic and arrived for the camping that would end on February 16 on the occasion of Maghi Purnima.“Till 4pm, around 3 lakh devotees had taken holy dip in Sangam. The entire bathing festival passed off peacefully,” said Mela Adhikari Sheshmani Pandey. Although the numbers of devotees arriving in the mela area was thin during the wee hours because of the chilly conditions but as the bright sunshine dominated the blue sky later in the day the footfall gradually increased. By around 11 am, 1.25 lakh devotees had taken dip and by 4pm the figures crossed 3 lakh, he said. The official said arrival of Kalpavasis in the mela area had continued on Saturday and Sunday. Almost all the Kalpwasis are associated with some seer and stay in the camps arranged by their ‘gurus’. Although some of the seers and Kalpwasis complained about incomplete work pertaining to facilities like tap water, electricity, toilets and tin-sheds in sector 5A, but for a chunk of Kalpwasis, it was the devotion and religious belief that overshadowed the threat of Coronavirus, extreme cold or amenities. From Monday onwards, thousands of Kalpvasis from different parts of the state and country, started their month-long religious practice of restrained and disciplined life. With the desire to be freed from the shackles of life and death, as it is believed that by practising Kalpavas, the door of heaven opens for the devotees after their demise. Along with spiritual, scientific outlook is also important in Kalpavas. “According to religious beliefs, one receives virtuous results in the month of Magh on the bank of Sangam at Tirtharaj Prayag. Taking a dip in the holy waters during Kalpavas bears the same fruit as donating crores of cows daily,” said noted astrologer Hemant Bhaduri. Further, inspired by a feeling of detachment with hard austerity, Kalpwasis attain self-purification, he added. Diwakar Tripathi Purvanchali, director of Utthan Jyotish Sansthan, Prayagraj said there are 21 rules of Kalpavas as per scriptures. These include not telling lies, staying free from household worries, bathing in the Ganges thrice a day, planting a Tulsi plant in the camp, following celibacy, taking food prepared by oneself or wife, attending sermons, sleeping on the ground. Not wearing gold, not consuming sweets or fruits, freedom from worldly worries, restraint on the senses, pind daan for ancestors, following non-violence, renunciation of luxury are some of the rules that are followed by Kalpwasis. The noted astrologer also informed about another interesting aspect pertaining to Kalpwas. “The month-long Kalpwas for Dandi Sanyasi and those coming from Mithila region of the country starts from Makar Sankranti itself whereas for others, it began from Monday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/magh-mela-over-3-lakh-take-dip-on-paush-purnima-at-sangam-as-kalpwas-begins-101642436444995.html

Her horror starts||BHOPAL: A builder In Madhya Pradesh’s Indore has been arrested after his wife complained that she was locked up in his farmhouse for nearly two years, sodomised, tortured with cigarette butts and repeatedly gang-raped by his friends. The main accused, Rajesh Vishwakarma’s employee, and two friends have also been arrested.Police said Rajesh Vishwakarma finally let her go home in north Chhattisgarh’s Bemtara late last year. The 32-year-old woman, a school teacher before her marriage, however, returned to Indore city about a week ago to file a police complaint against her husband because, she said, she had come to believe that she and her family could be killed. On Sunday, the woman filed a formal complaint at the city’s Shipra police station.District collector Manish Singh ordered officials to demolish the farmhouse where she was locked up after collecting the evidence. The illegal structure was razed to the ground by a joint team of police, district administration and municipal corporation by Monday evening, police said.Vishwakarma’s lawyer Neeraj Soni said the builder is being framed. “The woman was demanding ₹1 crore and also threatened to implicate him in a false gang-rape case. He is innocent,” Neeraj Soni said.The woman, a school teacher from Chhattisgarh, told the police that Rajesh Vishwakarma approached her via a matrimonial website in 2019.“The woman, who works as a school teacher, met the builder Rajesh Vishwakarma through a matrimonial site in 2019. They got married in November 2019… No family members of Vishwakarma attended the marriage. Later, the woman shifted to Indore with Vishwakarma and started living in a farmhouse in the Shipra area. For 15 days, they were living like a normal couple but later, the accused started torturing her,” said city superintendent of police (CSP), Pankaj Dixit said, “He took away all the clothes of her and forced her to live naked. The woman was raped, sodomised and singed with cigarettes several times. He used to arrange doctors for her treatment at the farmhouse as she was injured badly. In November 2021, the accused let the woman go on the condition that she will not speak about this to anyone,” said the police officer. Dixit said the police have also arrested Rajesh’s employee, Ankesh Baghel, and his two friends, Vivek Vishwakarma and Vipin Bhadoriya.The woman told local news outlets that she didn’t speak about her torture after marriage. The accused, she said, had made multiple video clips of her when she was raped by him and his friends, and she had reconciled to her past. “But I recently came to know that he has sent two men to kill me and my family,” she alleged.The accused, who were arrested under section 376 d (gang-rape), 377 (unnatural sex), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC, were produced before the court on Monday and sent to jail.Police said Rajesh Vishwakarma’s family ended relations with him in 2018 because of his past conduct.
17-01-2022||Mumbai||Mumbai vaccinated just 24% teens, half of state’s average||Mumbai A fortnight after the vaccination drive to inoculate the age group of 15 to 17 years started, Mumbai has managed to cover just about 24% of its target. The city’s first dose coverage in this category is much below the state’s average at 43% and some other districts like Thane (45%) and Pune (44%), that have administered double the number of doses compared to Mumbai. Maharashtra’s target population is over six million and the state had administered over two million doses to beneficiaries between 15 to 17 years by Monday evening. Thane with a target of 5,00,000 had administered 2,27,566 doses while Pune with a target of 5,53,190 had administered 2,44,510 doses. Mumbai’s civic body had first estimated its target as 9,00,000. It revised its target based on the numbers given by the state government to 6,12,000. As of Monday evening, Mumbai had administered 146,618 doses. “Two factors are driving the younger crowd to vaccination centres- awareness and anxiety among parents,” said the state’s immunisation officer Dr Sachin Desai. “Some districts like Pune and Thane opened their vaccination drive for minors with over 100 centres, while Mumbai started with less than 10 centres in the beginning. Also, other districts had tied up with schools and colleges to conduct the drives, which proved beneficial,” he said. FOr instance in Thane, the health authorities had tied up with schools and colleges much in advance before the vaccination drive started on January 3. “We had taken the authorities and parents in confidence before rolling out the drive,” said Thane collector Rajesh Narvekar. “Even as the schools and colleges are not fully operational, special sessions are being organised in smaller groups,” he said. According to Narvekar, the drive for minors started at a time when the adult vaccination had hit saturation levels. “We could direct all our focus on the 15 to 17 age group,” he said. The Centre has approved Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin for the 15 to 17 age group. “Initially, we only had the jumbo centres where the minors could get vaccinated, but now we have increased the number of centres to 139,” said Mumbai’s executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare, adding that the pace of the drive will pick up in the coming days. “We have asked for more centres to hold camps at ward level so that youngsters don’t have to travel much to get the jabs,” she said. The state currently has a stock of over two million Covaxin doses, including 1,75,000 in Mumbai. State health officials said that this stock will suffice for a week and more is anticipated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-vaccinated-just-24-teens-half-of-state-s-average-101642435240130.html

Dhindsa, who was campaigning in the Lehra segment on Monday, said, “Leaders see their interests and change parties during elections. Defection has become a fashion and political parties honour such leaders with tickets. I feel that politicians should play a responsible role. People are not showing faith in political leaders amid defection.” “We respect political differences, but when politicians change parties for not getting a ticket, it is not a good sign in democracy. Leaders, who work with personal interests, are responsible for voters losing confidence in all politicians. It is the need of the hour to win the confidence of the people,” he said, adding that his party will announce candidates in a couple of days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/defection-a-fashion-today-says-dhinda-junior-101642433320058.html

These patients across different age groups were admitted to the hospital and have been confirmed to be infected with the Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.While the perception of Omicron being mild is leading to people ignoring Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, the study will help establish the exact severity of the symptoms and the cause of it by studying the patient’s case history and other factors.Dr Rajesh Karyakarte, head of the microbiology department at BJ Medical College and Sassoon General Hospital, said, “We have reported over 100 Omicron positive patients in our hospital who were admitted due to moderate to severe symptoms of Covid-19. After genome sequencing, we have been able to confirm the new variant infection in all these patients. This is an extension study and would require inter-departmental coordination so that the study could be done extensively. The symptoms in these patients would be assessed and monitored.”“It is a good thing that BJ Medical College sequencing lab is a part of Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG -approved laboratory for genome sequencing and RT-PCR testing as well and so the work can start faster. These are not random samples but of patients who had to be admitted and are confirmed omicron patients,” he said.Currently, the symptoms of Omicron have been identified as body ache, fatigue, headache, weakness, runny nose and cough as described by the World Health Organization (WHO). However, the study will access the symptoms in all age groups and whether or not it differs in those with comorbidity. The detailed study will also help understand the oxygen consumption and also D-dimer levels in the patients.The results of the same would be released to the government and help strategise in case of admissions due to Omicron increases in the near future as Omicron is soon replacing the deadly Delta variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/punes-bj-medical-college-to-study-symptoms-in-omicron-patients-101642431879846.html

17-01-2022||Pune||State has over 23,500 qualified, trained doctors, most concentrated in Pune, Mumbai||The Centre has asked the state government to plan and judiciously use the healthcare staff as more breakthrough infections are being reported and more staff is reporting infection in the third Covid-19 wave.The Centre’s notification issued by the central health ministry secretary Dr Rajesh Bhushan on January 10 to ensure that the medical staff and faculty from the medical colleges are conserved.Out of the close to two lakhs qualified and trained doctors in the colleges registered under National Medical Commission (NMC), in the country, Maharashtra has a lion’s share with over 23,500. However, the staff is not equally distributed in the state with 23 of the 64 medical colleges located in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and Pune Metropolitan Area (PMR) region.Most districts do not have even a single medical college and are dependent on neighbouring districts. Such districts include; Buldhana, Washim, Beed, Osmanabad, Parbhani, Hingoli, Raigad, Bhandara, Gadchiroli, Nandurbar and Satara.Dr Dilip Mhaiskar, director of directorate of Medical Education (DMER), said, “We already have plans to set up three more medical colleges at Sindhudurg, Alibaug and Satara and more are in pipeline as and when we get approval from NMC. Earlier the medical education minister had said that every district will have a medical college. As of now we do not have any shortage of health care workers and most of them are recovering within one-three days.”The state has asked the district to utilise the services of final year MBBS students, interns, senior residents, junior residents as well as B.Sc nursing students (third and fourth year), M.Sc Nursing students (first and second year). As most districts are coming up with the establishment of jumbo hospitals, field hospitals, temporary hospitals, etc. the human resources required for the same should also be managed.The Central government in its earlier issued guidelines stated that the service of interns, being provisionally registered as doctors and MBBS students must also be trained in the clinical management of Covid-19 cases under the supervision of their faculties in Covid-19 health facilities.The NMC had also issued directions to medical colleges earlier that the final year MBBS students may also be taught about Covid-19 management in theory and practice under the supervision of faculties in Covid-19 health facilities, but they cannot be assigned clinical duties.As more healthcare workers report infections, the risk of shortage of staff or even those with mild symptoms spreading the infection to the immuno-compromised patients looms large and so the resident doctors and interns could be a great help in relieving the doctors who are either infected or stressed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/state-has-over-23-500-qualified-trained-doctors-most-concentrated-in-pune-mumbai-101642429719730.html

In an attempt to break even, gym owners are putting forth a host of offers to gain membership, one such being a refund clause, in case of imposition of any curbs or a lockdown. “We’ve got no bookings at all this new year, virtual or physical. We are requesting people to book memberships and assuring them that we will refund the money for the period of the lockdown, when they couldn’t visit the gym. We are also giving major discounts so that we get some bookings at least and can pay our fixed expenses,” says Tavdeep Singh from Deep Gym in South Extension I.Ankur Sehgal from Strength Gym in Tilak Nagar also has a set of similar offers in place. “We’ve lowered prices by more than half and have promised to refund the money during the lockdown, when we would be holding virtual classes,” he says.With curbs being imposed on an industry that’s already struggling to make ends meet, the situation is now worse than ever. “We have no funds left. Aisi situation ho gayi hai ki now, after two waves, we have no capacity to survive. Kisi ko bandh nai karna apna kaam, lekin ab kya karein nahi samajh aa raha. We are even open to having discussions with people where we are negotiating membership prices and also refunding money for the time they can’t come to the gym,” says Kapil Chand from Health 2 Offer Gym in Ashok Vihar, hoping the refund clause will help bring customers. “Paise vapis dene ka promise karenge toh farak toh zaroor padega, plus humein bhi acha lagega. Humein customer ka nuksaan nahi karana,” he adds.And that’s not all. Gym owners are coming up with a wide variety of virtual workout options for their customers to choose from. “To enhance sales, we have started an online group course twice a day, wherein we give aerobics and Bhangra workout sessions for one hour,” shares Singh.

17-01-2022||Mumbai||Bombay HC rejects plea against increasing BMC seats: What it means in 5 points||MUMBAI: The Bombay High court on Monday dismissed a plea by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), challenging the Maharashtra government’s decision to increase the number of electoral seats in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). The state government on December 3 last year increased the number of electoral seats in the BMC from 227 to 236 ahead of the civic elections of 2022.Here is a look at why this decision is significant, and how it is set to impact Mumbai.Change came after 2 decadesThe BMC seats are being increased after nearly two decades. The government last increased the number of electoral wards in the city in 2001 when their number went up from 221 to 227. This change was made after 10 years. Ahead of the 1992 civic polls, the city’s electoral wards were increased from 170 to 221.Addresses the change in Mumbai’s populationThe current composition of the civic body has been unchanged since 2001. The state government did not increase the number of corporators in 2011 even when the population increased by 3.87% between 2001 and 2011. BMC has maintained that in the past 20 years, many people residing in the island city have relocated to the western and eastern suburbs. Officials said that this intra-city migration has also affected the population density of Mumbai as the rate of population in the island city has fallen while the population in the suburban belt has seen massive growth. According to senior officials of BMC’s election department, it was important to increase the number of wards to maintain a uniform voter-councillor ratio since the city’s population has risen by 4% in 20 years.Boundaries of many electoral wards will changeAccording to BMC officials, five electoral wards will be added in the western suburbs, three in the eastern suburbs, and one in the island city. BMC will divide the projected population of Mumbai by 236 to determine the ideal population per ward. A 10% variation difference from this average figure will be considered acceptable. If any electoral ward has a population above that figure, a part of the ward will be added to a new ward. This is likely to have a ripple effect on many wards.Will impact local political calculationsPresently, the Shiv Sena has 97 corporators in BMC, the BJP has 83 corporators, Congress has 29 and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has nine (one of them was disqualified in a court case on reservation), and the Samajwadi Party (SP) has seven (one of them was disqualified in a court case). With the change in boundaries of multiple wards, the political arithmetic in electoral wards is likely to change and thus may have an impact on the plans of political parties.Upholds state election commission’s powers The high court order upholds the right of the state election commission, a statutory body, to change the number of electoral seats. This decision by the state government to increase the number of seats from 227 to 236 in BMC has received the state election commission’s (SEC) nod.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-rejects-plea-against-increasing-bmc-seats-what-it-means-in-5-points-101642427860976.html

The note also regretted that confusing signals were being circulated about the fate of the CM, when he was leading from the front and that too when elections have already been announced. “When you already have a CM, who is doing a great job, why put a question mark about his continuing after winning the elections?” he asked, while asserting, it will be unfair to Channi to make him lead the party into elections, and keep suspense about his own position in future.“It will not only be political unwise, but suicidal to raise question marks about his continuation as the Punjab CM, after winning the elections under his leadership,” he claimed, adding, “When you have ‘tried-and-tested’ the CM, who proved his mettle in a brief period of three months, why do you want to experiment with someone unknown and untested?” he asked, requesting the party high command to set all speculation to rest by making Channi’s position clear. “It is in the interest of the party,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/questioning-channi-s-position-as-punjab-cm-after-polls-suicidal-rana-gurjeet-101642427859561.html
17-01-2022||Mumbai||Bulli Bai accused also involved in Sulli Deals: Police||Mumbai The Mumbai Police Cyber Cell on Monday opposed the bail pleas of the three arrested in the Bulli Bai app case, stating that their investigation suggested that the accused were also involved in Sulli deals case. They said that further investigation needs to be conducted to ascertain their roles.The Cyber Cell of the Mumbai Crime Branch filed a reply before the Metropolitan Magistrate Court at Bandra. The court has now posted the matter for hearing on Tuesday.In its reply filed opposing the bail pleas of Vishal Kumar Jha, Shweta Singh and Mayank Rawat, the police said that preliminary investigation has revealed that the accused committed the crime with the help of Niraj Bishnoi, the person arrested by the Delhi police.A team of Mumbai Police is already in Delhi to take custody of Bishnoi, who is alleged to be the creator of the ‘Bulli Bai’ app, and Omkareshwar Thakur who is believed to be the creator of ‘Sulli Deals’ app wherein photos of prominent Muslim women were used for auction. The bail applications of Thakur and Bishnoi were already rejected by the Delhi Court, the Mumbai police informed the court.“The accused have targeted women from a particular community. It needs to be investigated if anybody has inspired them and also if there are more accused involved in the matter. We need to find if they were paid to commit such crimes.”They further added that the accused used names of people from the Sikh community to mislead people.“Rawat operated eight Twitter accounts, one Instagram account and five Gmail accounts and Singh had seven Twitter accounts, one Instagram and Gmail account. The investigations regarding the same are pending,” said the reply of Cyber Cell police filed before the court. It further said that some of these accounts have already been deactivated, deleted or suspended. So, to analyse the data further, the accused will be needed. “The investigation is at a primary stage as the process is complicated and lengthy,” it added.Rawat, a resident of Uttarakhand, filed his bail plea through Sandeep Sherkhane, who argued on Monday for the bail. Sherkhane told the court, “Rawat was an innocent student, he had a very limited role. He had just followed a link and he was misguided and brainwashed. He is falsely implicated and made a scapegoat in the matter. He is a student whose whole career will be destroyed if he is kept with habitual criminals as his exams are also approaching.” Meanwhile, Shivam Deshmukh and Aarti Deshmukh, who argued bail plea of Jha, a resident of Bihar who was studying in Bengaluru, said, “The main accused in the case is someone else from Delhi and the other accused are of different states and in no manner connected to them. He has been falsely implicated in the case and denies committing any such offence as alleged. He is from a respectable family and such overt acts are beyond imagination.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bulli-bai-accused-also-involved-in-sulli-deals-police-101642426899400.html

He was arrested on Monday, said officials.Fate in his video said, “It is being said that I am involved in a ₹200 crore scam, this is untrue. Why would a person with such a big sum stay in India. This was not pre-planned. I do not have any plans to flee. Who will flee keeping ₹2 crore in the bank. I can stay in any five star hotel in the country with this amount of money. I had never promised 28 per cent returns on investment and written agreements were signed with the customers. I had even given blank cheques to them. Police must get my bank account statements to validate this. I am ready to face legal action. My family is not connected to this business.”Fate’s father and brother are currently in police custody. According to the police, the scam runs around ₹15 crore wherein Fate promised thrice the invested amount in the stock market to his victims but never paid them. Among his victims are politicians, media persons and also women who trusted his words and invested large sums in three of the companies owned by him expecting unprecedented returns.Additional superintendent of police, Himmat Jadhav said, “We have received around 80 complaints and the fraud amount is in the range of ₹17- ₹18 crore till now.

17-01-2022||Chandigarh||Overcoming development challenges before Punjab economy||The people of Punjab will vote next month to elect the 16th assembly that will provide governance for the next five years. The experience of the past six assembly elections has shown that Punjabis have given a decisive mandate to a political party for fulfilling their expectations. Except once (2012-17), the state’s electorate has expressed its dissatisfaction and changed the government for a better performance. In the past 30 years, which coincide with three decades of liberalisation, privatisation and the globalisation policy of India, the two dominant parties, the Shiromani Akali Dal and the Congress, ruled the state for an equal period. An important achievement of the past 30 years is the peaceful completion of the terms of each democratically elected government headed alternately by the two political parties of Punjab. But a big disappointment is on the development front. Both the parties failed to match the economic challenges and could not meet the expectations of Punjabis. On broad social and economic indicators, Punjab has been consistently lagging behind. Its per capita income ranking across Indian states has fallen from first to 10th rank. But the less known qualitative indicators such as governance institutions, services and employment quality and opportunities have also deteriorated compared to other states of India. The educated youth is facing the highest unemployment rates in the country and those who are serving the state they are highly dissatisfied with their service conditions. That explains the scramble among youngsters to migrate overseas for better opportunities. They feel the future is hopeless if they continue to stay in the state. When we look at the development situation of each sector of the economy (agriculture, industry and services), the economy is facing a multidimensional crisis. Capital, brain drain from Punjab At the root of this crisis is the low social overhead capital formation in the state (GFCF/GSDP is 15.75 in 2018-19 and share of agriculture is 5.8%). The GFCF is the capability or capacity of the economy to produce output and given the capital-output ratio, the low GFCF results into slow growth of Punjab’s economy. An important fact of Punjab economy needs to be noted here is that it is a highly private/individual enterprise-based economy among the Indian states. The low investment in the Punjab state indicates that private enterprises have a limited capacity to address to the challenges faced by the Punjab economy. Therefore, the role of the state government to disentangle the multidimensional crisis and induce the dynamism in various sectors of the economy is crucial. But political consensus on the economic policy of liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation has also limited the capacity of the state to intervene in economic affairs. Instead to accept and face the current challenges of the Punjab economy, the political leadership has changed its character and turned from statesmen political leaders to business-oriented leaders. They have indulged in competitive populism to capture power and using power to enhance their own narrow interests/businesses. This has also limited the dynamic role of the private sector in development and that is why the private players prefer to invest either in other states or abroad. Most of the well to-do parents of the migrants have been investing to establish businesses abroad. This has led to both capital and brain drain from Punjab. Breaking two vicious circles Can the grand challenges faced by Punjab economy be resolved to generate a hope? The answer is affirmative. No challenge is big enough that humanity cannot resolve provided it is willing to recognise and find an alternative holistic approach to resolve it. Punjabis are famous to take risks and have philosophy of supreme sacrifice and thus have a capacity to accept and resolve the challenges. For this, two vicious circles, that is, self-serving politician-bureaucratic-police gridlock and competitive populism-fiscal profligacy needs to be broken. Only a dynamic and progressive state economy can provide hope to all the stake holders. The revival and rejuvenation of Punjab’s economy is also required to involve non-state actors, while ensuring the participation of the people in the economic decision-making through a decentralised development process. The restoration of the functioning of the defunct top institutions such as state planning board and revenue generating and collection machinery can play a catalytic role. Given the level of high consumption in Punjab, the taxable capacity is also high provided the tax revenue should go to the public exchequer. It is possible to harness this revenue along with controlling the multipronged mafia that is plundering the resources and revenue of the state. The suggested strategy probably can sow the seeds of revival of Punjab’s economy if subsidies are rationalised and targeted rather than allowed to develop vested interest. This will enable the state to raise adequate revenue resources for developmental needs. Tap diaspora, open land route Punjab can harness two important resources while generating a development-oriented environment. One, Punjabi diaspora has a strong presence in the western developed countries. They have adequate financial, intellectual and technological resources. They can be tapped for organisation practices and developmental resources to make the Punjab economy dynamic. Moreover, the government can develop long-tenure bonds so that accumulated debt burden of the state can be shared by the diaspora. Two, Punjab is landlocked and needs opening up of the land route to access the markets of neighbouring countries. This will give a boost to investment in Punjab and adjoining north Indian states. On top of it, there is a dire need to change the course of development that is environment-friendly. New technological revolution can be harnessed for ensuring development with social justice. Punjab cannot afford to be bypassed by the fourth industrial revolution. For this, the electorate has to ensure two things: One, elect a political leadership that has the will to face the grand development challenges; and two, stay vigilant in the post-election scenario to keep the rulers focused on the agenda. Punjab cannot afford to waste this chance of turning the tide. lakhwindergill@pbi.ac.in The writer is former professor-head of economics department at Punjabi University, Patiala.

She was 74. Mitra was the daughter of legendary theatre personalities Shambhu Mitra and Tripti Mitra. Nobody got to know of Mitra’s death in the afternoon because, like her father, she had made a will in 2019, saying the news of her demise should be made public only after cremation. She also wished to die at home and among very close relatives. She received the Sangeet Natak Akademi award in 2003, the Padma Shree in 2009 and the Bengal government’s Banga Bibhushan Award in 2012. Mitra wrote, directed and acted in the famous play Naathavati Anaathavat, which is considered one of her finest creations. It was also produced in Hindi. Some of her other famous plays include Katha Amitrasaman, Chandali, Pagla Ghora and Dakghar. Mitra also acted in Ritwik Ghatak’s landmark 1977 movie Jukti Takko Aar Gappo alongside her mother. “With her, an era has ended. Shaoli Mitra was an example if you spoke of education and skills. But above all that, she was an exceptional human being. Her life is a lesson for us,” theatre personality Debesh Chattopadhyay told the media on Sunday night when the news became public. Thespian Rudraprasad Sengupta said, “She had a lot more to give us but successful people never die. They live forever in our thoughts and culture.”Offstage, Mitra maintained a low profile all her life but took a strong stand on the Left Front government’s move to acquire farmland for the Tata small car factory at Singur in Hooghly district. Mamata Banerjee, then the state’s opposition leader, started a movement that forced the government to shelve the project. Banerjee offered her condolences to Mitra’s family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/actor-playwright-shaoli-mitra-dies-in-kolkata-at-74-101642425279293.html

17-01-2022||Lucknow||MSP for all crops, cane arrears in 15 days: Akhilesh promises farmers||LUCKNOW Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav on Monday made several promises to the farmers of Uttar Pradesh, including MSP (minimum statutory price) for every crop, payment of arrears to cane growers in 15 days, free irrigation facilities, interest-free loans, insurance and pension.Yadav, along with farm leader Tejinder Singh Virk, 48, took a pledge to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the forthcoming UP Assembly elections. Virk was one of the farm leaders who led the Lakhimpur Kheri farmers’ protest and he too was severely injured in the Lakhimpur violence on October 3.“With grains in our hands (wheat and rice from Lakhinpur Kheri), we take ‘ann sankalp’ (pledge) to defeat and remove those who unleashed atrocities on farmers,” said Yadav, Virk, and all the SP leaders present at an event at the SP state headquarters in Lucknow.“Apart from free power to farmers for irrigation, the SP also promises that on forming the government, we will introduce MSP on all crops, clear dues to cane farmers within 15 days, and make provisions for interest-free loans, insurance and pension for farmers. If need be, we will create a farmers’ revolving fund to ensure timely payments to them,” said Yadav, adding that these promises will be included in the SP’s manifesto. The SP chief reiterated his earlier promise of ₹25 lakh aid from the government to the family of farmers who died in the farm struggle.When asked how would all this be possible, he said: “It’s possible. We fulfill all promises we make. But did anyone ask those (Prime minister Narendra Modi) when they had said they will make India a $5-trillion economy and when the UP chief minster too made similar projections.”Talking about Virk, Yadav said: “When the Lakhimpur incident happened on October 3, and I learned that Tajinder Singh Virk was badly injured and was in a hospital, I spoke to him and also the doctor on duty. I asked the doctors to do their best to save his life, and if needed, shift him to any other hospital. God saved his life.”Akhilesh Yadav said the farmers’ struggle made the government relent and the farmers succeeded in making the government withdraw the “three black farm laws.” But the BJP actually withdrew the farm laws for votes,” he added.Will SP field Virk in polls?When asked if the Samajwadi Party will field farm leader Tajinder Singh Virk from Nighasan (a Lakhimpur Kheri assembly seat) or any other, Akhilesh said: “We will accord him full respect.” The comment fuelled speculations that the SP might field Virk from Nighasan. The area where the Lakhimpur violence took place on October 3 falls in the Nighasan assembly constituency. Reacting to Yadav’s ‘Ann Sankalp’, UP minister Suresh Rana said: “It was during the SP government’s tenure that rioters were flown in aircraft and given feast of biryani. Farmers were troubled and used to hold dharnas all over the state over cane dues.”

The detailed order, which will have the reasoning of the judges, is not available yet.The Maharashtra government represented by advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, however, insisted that since the 2021 census has not been conducted due to the pandemic, there was no restriction on using the 2011 census to increase the number of BMC seats for the 2022 elections. He also pointed out that the government did not increase the number of seats ahead of the 2012 or 2017 BMC elections.Senior lawyer Anil Sakhare, appearing for the BMC, added that there was a need to increase the number of seats so that there was a proportionate representation of citizens in the jurisdiction of the civic authority in view of the increase in the population.On Monday, the court asked the state election commission if the increase of seats was based on the 2011 census and whether any reservation was being implemented through the November 30 Ordinance. When the court was told that the ordinance merely increased the number of seats and did not get into the reservation of seats, the bench inquired from the petitioners if they were seeking a stay on the BMC elections.After the petitioners made it clear that they were not seeking a stay on the elections, the court said that it was dismissing the petition and will pass a detailed and reasoned order in due course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/plea-by-2-bjp-councillors-against-bmc-seat-increase-dismissed-by-bombay-hc-101642421738880.html

Harak Singh Rawat is a member of the assembly from Kotdwar while former chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat represents Doiwala.Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said the demand for two tickets was totally against the BJP’s principle of one ticket, one family, which the party conveyed to him. “But he remained adamant, leading to this decision (expulsion).” Dhami said there will be no impact of the expulsion on the party. “There is no crack in the organisation. The party is united in the upcoming elections. But those who are not working as per the party norms will have to face such action as the discipline is foremost.”Also Read | Uttarakhand elections: BJP may not field up to 12 sitting MLAsBJP state in-charge Dushyant Kumar Gautam echoed Dhami. “The party has a clear principle of one ticket to one family. But Rawat despite being a senior leader of the party was adamant about two tickets. We clearly said it is not possible.” Gautam said the demand for another ticket apart from his own was also unacceptable. “He also approached the rivals. Hence, he was shown the door,” said Gautam.Harak Singh Rawat denied having asked for two tickets. “The BJP leadership believed some social media reports of me joining Congress and expelled me in haste without verifying.” He added after taking the decision in haste, BJP was levelling false and baseless allegations. “I said that my daughter-in-law is doing good work in her constituency and if the leadership wants, it can give her ticket. When they cited the one ticket, one family principle, I said that I do not want to contest.”He added he always sought development projects in his constituency. “I demanded a medical college for Kotdwar, a central school, good pay for nnganwadi workers, grade pay for police personnel which they never paid heed to. I never thought of my personal interests but party’s.”He added he was in touch with Congress leaders. “(Congress) state president Ganesh Godiyal and leader of Opposition Pritam Singh called me up and asked about my future plans. But as of now, there are no talks about joining the party. Having said that, now after I am not in the BJP, if Congress wants, then I will work for it and help bring it to power.”Godiyal said it was up to the Congress’s senior leadership to induct Harak Singh Rawat. “Even as we did not have a political relationship for the last five years but we have a personal one. He has not joined Congress but despite that, he was expelled by BJP whom he supported when it needed the most. He left Congress in 2016. He has now confessed that it was mistake,” said Godiyal.

These are some of the profundities explored by former director general of police and author P Lal in his latest book Gift Of Life.The book, which also discusses the seven levels of human consciousness and a yoga regimen, was released by Punjab governor and Chandigarh administrator Banwarilal Purohit at the Raj Bhawan.On what readers can learn from the book, Lal says, “ The pursuit of happiness, health and developing a scientific temper are very important.”Controversial subjects such as the existence of UFOs, aliens, near-death experiences and out-of-body experiences and reincarnation have also been explored in the book.Lal points out the limitations of man’s sensory perceptions, hinting at the possibility of reality being different from what is perceived.In the foreword, former Punjab and Haryana high court judge NC Jain says, “ Though he (Lal) has brought out religious and spiritual aspects of the matter (life and its myriad shades) also, his emphasis remains on ‘logical deduction’ which is what is required for the development of the self.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/book-launch-revel-in-the-gift-of-life-101642417958022.html
17-01-2022||Pune||Monday Musings: Lavasa, from dream city to ghost town... now what?||Lavasa, some 60 kilometres from Pune, was once touted as a hilltop paradise, modelled on the cotton-candy harbour of Italy’s Portofino. It would be India’s first privately built and managed city. Curious tourists and locals looking for a break from city life often flocked to the streets of Dasve village, where the hill city has come up. In the process, many restaurants and coffee shops came up on the promenade facing the lake situated in the middle of the city.Through its journey, it faced flak for many wrong reasons. The result: it resembled a ghost town with incomplete structures, sporadic garbage collection and non-existing maintenance. Slowly, the number of visitors dropped and the roads started looking deserted.Last month, there was some positive news. A Mumbai-based firm Darwin Platform Infrastructure Limited (DPIL) won the bid for Lavasa hill city, offering hopes that there will be an improvement of the essential services like roads, street lights and water have brightened up for the residents who had been at the receiving end of infrastructural bottlenecks for the past one decade. At the same time, small investors who purchased properties, which couldn’t be built, have expressed hope for completing the project. These are hundreds of people who have put down their life savings or borrowed money to buy property here, only to fear it may never get built.More than two decades ago, then-billionaire Ajit Gulabchand envisioned something different after Sharad Pawar floated the idea of developing Lavasa hill city while travelling in a helicopter. Later, at a programme in Pune during 2014, Pawar even said Maharashtra has 26 sites with waterbodies that can be developed as hill cities, on the lines of Lavasa.Gulabchand and his Hindustan Construction Company (HCC), known for building roads, power plants, tunnels and more than 300 bridges around the country, made attempts for the retreat through a possible IPO during 2010 when the national environment and forests ministry halted construction for about a year, alleging rule violations. Its cash flow quickly dried up. Efforts to tap equity markets fell through with investors nervous of further government intervention.About a year later, construction resumed after approvals came through to build on 21 square kilometres—almost the size of Macau. But by that point the project was cursedThe hill township project Lavasa construction and development were started as per Maharashtra’s government policy and regulations for new hill stations as India’s first privately built smart city. Lavasa corporation was accused of defaulting on bank loans. The company on its website admitted claims of Rs5,561 crores from financial creditors.After almost a decade there is hope. The DPIL has won the ₹1864 crore bid to acquire Lavasa Corporation through the insolvency process which was approved by the debt-ridden firm’s lenders. The resolution plan submitted by Darwin Platform bagged 97 per cent votes of the Committee of Creditors (CoC). At least 66 per cent of votes are required for bid approval. After CoC approval, the bid has to be cleared by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).The DPIL taking over Lavasa is also good news for local villagers, who had lost employment in the process. Initially wary of the large size project, the villagers were unsupportive, and at times, confrontational. As the project began acquiring shape, many found employment, something Dasve village had never thought of.Yogesh Joshi can be reached at yogesh.joshi@htlive.com
17-01-2022||Punjab||Punjab polls pushed back to February 20 to avoid clash with Guru Ravidas Jayanti||NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Monday rescheduled the assembly polls in Punjab to February 20 after political parties requested the poll panel to slot it until after the festival of Guru Ravidas Jayanti, which will be celebrated on February 16.Polling in Punjab was earlier scheduled for February 14. Political parties had told the EC that many voters could miss polling if it were held just two days before Guru Ravidas Jayanti.”They have brought to notice that a large number of devotees start moving for Varanasi around a week before the day of the celebration, and keeping the poll day on February 14, 2022 will deprive a large number of electors from voting,” the EC said in a statement. “[Following] inputs from the state government and the chief electoral officer, past precedence, and [considering] all facts and circumstances in the matter, the commission has decided to reschedule [the polls].”Guru Ravidas Jayanti is a festival that is popular among the Dalit community, which makes up more than 30% of Punjab’s electorate at the coming elections.A senior official said that initially the EC felt that scheduling the polls two days before the festival would be appropriate, but Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi pointed out that many devotees would be travelling to Varanasi just before polling day.Channi sent across a letter, requesting the national electoral body to postpone the assembly polls “for enabling around 2,000,000 SC devotees to utilise their right to vote” in Punjab.The Punjab CM’s plea was followed by similiar requests by the Shiromani Akali Dal, the Bhartiya Janata Party, the Bahujan Samaj Party and other parties contesting the elections in the state.The counting day for the Punjab polls remains the same for all, which is March 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-pushed-back-to-february-20-to-avoid-clash-with-guru-ravidas-jayanti-101642413217613.html

Sanjay Jaiswal, the BJP state chief, asked JD (U) if all the members of the families of those killed in the tragedy would be sent to jail.JD (U) leader Upendra Kushwaha responded saying a party does not take action. “Action is taken by the government of which the BJP is also part.” He added chief minister Nitish Kumar’s government will not spare anybody found guilty even as he maintained the ruling alliance remained strong.Kushwaha said the talks about an alliance for Uttar Pradesh polls were not over as the BJP has said anything in this regard so far. “We hope some solution will emerge.” He earlier said JD (U) will contest the polls with the BJP even as the number of seats was yet to be decided.Also Read | Toll in Nalanda hooch tragedy climbs to 13, SIT to probe caseJaiswal said to keep the NDA strong, they need to follow the basic decorum. “It cannot be one-sided.” He added there could not be anything more absurd than asking the Prime Minister to withdraw awards given by the President to writer Daya Prakash Sinha for his remarks against emperor Ashoka. JD (U) leaders including Kushwaha have been demanding that the awards be withdrawn.Jaiswal said the Bihar government should first act on his FIR against Sinha, get him arrested, and ensure punishment through speedy trial. “After that, a delegation of the Bihar government should meet President and present our viewpoint about withdrawal of award to a convict. It is our collective responsibility to peacefully run the government and any issue can be amicably resolved through discussions. If any matter has to be taken up with BJP central leadership, that should also be direct.”Former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, whose party is also a part of the NDA, also wondered why Nitish Kumar has made prohibition a prestigious issue. “When Prime Minister can withdraw agriculture laws, why cannot Nitish Kumar review it? This time hooch tragedy struck in Nalanda. Earlier it happened in Gopalganj.”Analyst Nawal Kishore Choudhary said the trend was apparent that both BJP and the JD (U) were trying to have an upper hand while none is in a position to dictate terms. “So, both will keep rubbing the other the wrong way on any given opportunity and carry on... Both BJP and JD (U) know their limitations in Bihar and they will not cross the line...”

17-01-2022||Lucknow||UP polls: AIMIM releases list of 9 candidates||The All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul- Muslimeen (AIMIM) led by Hyderabad Lok Sabha MP Asaduddin Owaisi on Sunday released the first list of the nine candidates for the upcoming Uttar Pradesh assembly election. AIMIM launched its election campaign demanding a share in power for the Muslim community in the state.The party is working to expand its base in the Muslim dominated West UP and the Rohilkhand region and all nine candidates have been fielded on the Muslim dominated seats, including Behat, Dhaulana, Loni, Kithore, Sardhana, Siwal Khas, Garh Mukteshwar and Bareilly. AIMIM had decided to contest assembly election on 100 seats after joining Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha (BSM) led by the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) chief Om Prakash Rajbhar.After Rajbhar joined the Samajwadi party alliance, Owaisi also proposed to join hands with the SP. But with no offer forthcoming from SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, the AIMIM decided to contest the assembly election on its own.Owaisi launched an extensive election campaign in the Muslim dominated seats.Fearing division in Muslim votes, Maulana Khalil-ur- Rahman Sajjad Nomani, a senior member of All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), has shot off an open letter to Owaisi on Thursday urging him to check the division in the Muslim votes by fielding candidates only on those seats on which AIMIM is sure of winning.Reacting to the letter, the national spokesperson of AIMIM and Uttar Pradesh in-charge, Syed Asim Waqar said, Nomani is not a political person and should not interfere in politics as AIMIM does not meddle in the working of the AIMPLB. AIMIM chief will also take the final call on two alliance offers in the coming days., the spokesperson said. The Rashtriya Ulama Council led by Maulana Aamir Rashadi that has a base in Azamgarh, Mau and Ghazipur districts and Peace Party led by Dr Mohammad Ayub that has a base in Gorakhpur and Basti division in East UP, have offered Owaisi to form a coalition for the elections.The AIMIM spokesperson said Owaisi would take a final decision over the alliance with both parties. AIMIM had fielded candidates on 38 seats in the 2017 assembly election but failed to open its account. The only consolation was that party candidate Zia-ur-Rehman was runner-up on the Sambhal assembly seat. 
17-01-2022||Mumbai||Shiv Sena hits out at BJP over ‘vote bank’ politics||MUMBAI: Days after Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath had lunch at a Dalit worker’s home in Gorakhpur, Shiv Sena on Monday hit out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over “vote bank politics”.In an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana, the Sena said the BJP leaders still organise lunches in Dalits households and need to publicise them. “This clearly shows that caste is in their minds and they are not ready to let go of it. The country has been divided on caste for political gains. So, the caste eradication programmes are a mere sham... Even today tickets to contest elections are distributed based on caste arithmetic.”The Sena criticised Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi over such “publicity” events and for allegedly giving importance to caste and organising such meals.Referring to Modi, who washed the feet of sanitation workers in Uttar Pradesh’s Prayagraj in February 2019, Sena leader Sanjay Raut said, “Modi took a dip in the River Ganga and then washed the feet of Dalits. Now, BJP leaders are going to their homes. When will you forget caste? We are all humans and there should not be any caste divide. But you go to Dalit household for meals, this is all pretense. Stop this vote bank politics otherwise, the country will once again be divided into caste lines.”As a policy, the Maharashtra unit of BJP does not respond to criticism in the Sena mouthpiece.Raut also said Congress, Samajwadi Party (SP), and other non-BJP parties in Uttar Pradesh can replace BJP in power after the February-March assembly polls. “[SP leader] Akhilesh [Yadav] must completely focus on the election and must take everyone together. People are looking at Akhilesh with a lot of expectations. We are contesting in Uttar Pradesh but the power to bring about a change is with Samajwadi Party and Congress.”

Also read: AAP to announce Punjab CM candidate tomorrow, says party chief Arvind KejriwalThe CM also announced that Banger would be fielded from Ferozepur Rural assembly segment.Channi made the announcement at a press conference in Chandigarh after inducting Banger into the party.Earlier, Banger told reporters that he was being “humiliated and pressurised by the AAP leadership to spend more on electioneering.” Banger, who is contesting the assembly elections for the first time, said he would consult his supporters on the next plan. “But I won’t contest on the AAP ticket,” he said. Banger took objection to the AAP’s charge that the Balbir Singh Rajewal-led Samyukt Samaj Morcha is in league with Bharatiya Janata Party. “This is a baseless and defamatory charge on the farmer leaders and Punjabis,” he said. Like the BJP, he said, the AAP leadership was also trying to create a rift in the farmer leadership. Banger said it was the AAP leadership that had first encouraged Bharti Kisan Union (Rajewal) leader Balbir Singh Rajewal to contest the Punjab elections. “The party had even tried to make Rajewal the CM face but when the farmers got united as a political front, they were betrayed by the AAP,” he said. Banger said the AAP is working as a company where Punjab volunteers have no say. He charged state party affairs co-incharge Raghav Chadha of issuing diktats and deciding without taking the Punjab leadership into confidence. Chadha alleges conspiracy to hurt AAPResponding to question during a press conference in Chandigarh, Chadha said that the party is gathering information about the development. He alleged that a senior Congress leader had called up Banger. “There is a conspiracy to hurt the AAP and I’m told that a senior leader of the Congress had called up the Ferozepur candidate (Banger) and put pressure on him to quit the party,” Chadha added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-elections-ferozepur-rural-candidate-quits-aam-aadmi-party-101642408957262.html

In his resignation letter, Lourenco said he was resigning from TMC’s primary membership without specifying any reasons for it.TMC’s Goa in-charge Mahua Moitra said they have received the letter. “We had welcomed him into the party as we have countless others. Now that he wishes to leave, we wish him well.”Lourenco quit the Congress in December saying the TMC was better placed to defeat the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in the February 14 elections. He said he was joining the TMC to be on the “ruling side” after the elections.Former minister Michael Lobo, who joined the Congress this month, asked Lourenco to re-join the party. “To strengthen the @INCGoa and to boost our purpose of forming [a] Congress government in 2022, I request Reginaldo to join us back,” Lobo tweeted.Also Read | Former Goa lawmaker quits TMC months after joining itCongress said it was “stunned and betrayed” after Lourenco quit the party but vowed to put the “betrayal” behind it and take the party forward.Lourenco hit out at the Congress leadership last month calling it indecisive and slow in taking decisions.

It said access to the website may be prevented till the content is removed.The NCPCR, in a letter, to the district magistrate of Saharanpur, which has also been sent to the chief secretary of Uttar Pradesh, on Saturday said it has received a complaint alleging the website carries a list of fatwas that are against the country’s law related to the adoption of children and their rights.“Taking cognizance of the complaint u/s 13 (1) (j) of the Commissions for Protection of Child Rights Act, after pursuing the complaint and examining the website, it was observed that the explanation and answers provided in response to issues raised by the individuals do not align with the Laws and Acts in the country,” the commission said in the letter.It said such statements were contrary to the rights of children and open access to the website was harmful. “Therefore, it is requested that the website of this organization may be thoroughly examined, investigated and any such content should be immediately removed.

In fact, on a given issue, the scholars often have differing opinions and none of them carry any legal sanctity or institutional approval.

The ceremony will take place at DTC’s Indraprastha’s depot at 12 noon.Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot will be present on the occasion. The electric buses are being rolled out to combat air pollution in the national capital.The prototype bus, which arrived earlier this month, will run on 27-kilometre-long Route E44 (Pragati Maidan to IP Depot via ITO, Safdarjung, Ashram). It has been manufactured by JBM Auto Limited.Fifty more e-buses are expected to be inducted into the DTC fleet next month, when the roll out for mass public transport begins.There are 2,300 total electric buses in the pipeline. Out of these, 1,300 will be procured by the DTC and the rest 1,000 will operate under the cluster scheme.According to Gahlot, e-buses will be added in batches of about 50 every month after the first roll out in February.The Delhi government will equip bus depots with charging stations for these e-buses. This will be done in phases.Further, the DTC will build four “hybrid” bus depots, which will be a combination of electric and CNG buses. These will be the Subhash Place depot, Rajghat depot, Hasanpur depot and Bawana.The plan to induct e-buses in Delhi was first announced in July, 2018. In the future, the Delhi government will procure only electric buses.Meanwhile, in a bid to further enhance public mobility, Kejriwal on Friday flagged off 100 low-floor AC CNG buses, taking the public transport bus fleet size to 6,900.Before this, Delhi saw 6,000 buses in the fleet of Delhi transport department during the 2010 Commonwealth Games.The new AC CNG buses will run from Ghumanhera depot in outer Delhi to cater to Delhi’s rural areas, on nine cluster bus routes in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/arvind-kejriwal-to-flag-off-delhi-s-first-dtc-electric-bus-today-101642383295819.html
17-01-2022||Real||Noida twin towers: SC deadline given to Supertech to refund homebuyers ends today||The deadline for real estate company Supertech to return money to the homebuyers of the illegal twin tower ends on Monday, failing which the Supreme Court could send its directors to jail over non-compliance.The apex court had earlier warned the builders to adhere to the decided time frame for demolishing the 40-storey twin towers of its Emerald Court project in Uttar Pradesh's Noida.More than 250 homebuyers are yet to get their refund with interest after over four months having lapsed.In view of the same, the top court took a stringent view and asked the Mumbai-based builders last week to pay back or face jail.“We are going to send your directors to jail. You are playing truant with the Supreme Court.” a bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and AS Bopanna said reviewing its order last Wednesday.On Sunday, Supertech said that it awarded a letter of intent related to demolition of its illegal twin towers, which has sought pollution and environment-related clearances from the Noida Authority."The selection of the demolition agency was done jointly by the Noida Authority as well as the CBRI. As per the analysis by the Noida Authority, the firm is technically sound to carry out the demolition safely," Supertech chairman RK Arora said in a statement.Arora clarified that the demolition firm has sought no objection certificates (NOCs) from different agencies with regard to transportation, storage and use of explosives, environment and pollution control agencies, traffic diversion plans etc, all of which are to be provided by the Noida Authority."On providing the required NOCs by the Noida Authority, the demolition agency will soon chart out schedules for demolition and carry out the same according to directions from the Noida Authority," he had added.The twin towers 'Apex and Ceyane' in Noida Sector 93A were declared illegal by the Supreme Court on August 31, 2021, and the apex court had given three months to the company to demolish and default on refunding the money to the affected homebuyers under the supervision of officials of the Noida Authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/real-estate/noida-twin-towers-sc-deadline-given-to-supertech-to-refund-homebuyers-ends-today-101642379315808.html
17-01-2022||Delhi||Daily tally dips to 10-day low of 18k, positivity at 27.9%||The Covid-19 test positivity rate in Delhi fell for the first time in nearly four weeks on Sunday, as fresh infections in the city dipped for the third straight day, showed data released by the state government.Delhi on Sunday added 18,286 cases of Covid-19, down from 20,718 the previous day, and the fewest in a day since January 7, when the city recorded 17,335 infections.The data showed that 28 people also died of the infection.The case spike on Sunday came on the back of just over 65,000 tests, of which 27.87% samples returned positive results. This number, known as the test positivity rate, dipped from 30.6% on Friday and Saturday, and, on a day-to-day basis, fell for the first time since December 23 last year. Since then, this number has either increased or remained the same every day.To be sure, testing has also dipped in Delhi over the past few days, dipping from over 105,000 tests on January 12, to 98,832 tests the day after that, then 79,758 on Friday, 67,624 on Saturday, and finally 65,621 on Sunday. State health minister Satyendar Jain, however, said that everyone in the city who needs to get a test is being tested.These numbers come even as hospitalisation numbers in the Capital remain a fraction of all infections, with over 82% of all beds free in the city’s medical facilities.According to the government’s Sunday bulletin, just over 2,700 Covid-19 patients are hospitalised, leaving 12,788 of the city’s 15,499 beds free.Of those in hospital, 738 are in intensive care units and 835 others need medical oxygen support, of whom 123 are on ventilators.Jain said most hospitalised Covid-19 patients are either unvaccinated, or have comorbidities.“The trend indicates that the number of cases in Delhi is decreasing, but the government is still keeping a close eye on the Covid cases, and it will take some time to understand the trend. Most of those affected by Covid and admitted in the hospital are either unvaccinated or have comorbid conditions,” said Jain in a media briefing.The minister said Delhi government is prepared to operationalise a total of 37,000 Covid-19 beds. “We can double the number of beds overnight if necessary, but because the number of hospitalised patients is currently so low, the need to increase the number of beds doesn’t look like arising,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/daily-tally-dips-to-10-day-low-of-18k-positivity-at-279-101642371641600.html

17-01-2022||Chandigarh||At 11°C, Sunday was Chandigarh’s coldest January day since 2016||The city’s maximum temperature dropped to 11°C on Sunday, 10.1 degrees below normal, making it the coldest January day since 2016, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Similar weather conditions are likely to continue through the week and rain is also on the cards towards the weekend.As per IMD records, Chandigarh had last recorded a maximum temperature of 11°C only on January 21, 2016. Interestingly, Sunday’s day temperature was equivalent to the 11°C minimum temperature recorded on Friday.Several hill stations in Himachal Pradesh were warmer than the city. While Shimla’s maximum temperature was 14.5°C, the mercury was 13.1°C in Dalhousie and 19°C in Dharamshala. IMD Chandigarh director Manmohan Singh said the city’s maximum temperature stayed so low on Sunday primarily due to fog, while the weather was clear in the hills. “We have not had any sun for the past few days, so mercury has been going down steadily,” he added. Visibility stayed between 500-1,000 metres (moderate fog) through the day.IMD also classified Sunday as a “severe cold day”. It is declared in the plains when the minimum temperature is below 10°C and the maximum temperature goes over 6.5 degrees below normal. Chances for cold days and severe cold days will continue in the coming days. “While a fresh western disturbance will affect the region from Friday and bring along some rain, it is unlikely to have any effect on the day temperature and cold days will continue,” Singh said.Meanwhile, though Sunday’s day temperature was 2.6 notches lower than Saturday’s 13.6°C, the minimum temperature rose slightly from 8.1°C to 8.2°C in the past 24 hours and was 2.5 degrees above normal. In the next three days, the maximum temperature may rise to around 15°C, but the minimum temperature will remain around 9°C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/at-11-c-sunday-was-chandigarh-s-coldest-january-day-since-2016-101642365938581.html
17-01-2022||Chandigarh||Two years on, Ambala man held for assaulting CTU conductor||Almost two years after a CTU bus conductor was assaulted during an argument over ticket fare, police have arrested the accused passenger. The accused, Sunil Kumar, hails from Ambala. He was arrested on the complaint of Kuldeep Singh, a conductor with the Chandigarh Transport Undertaking (CTU). Singh had alleged that on February 2, 2020, Sunil had boarded the bus from Sector 22 to visit PGIMER. As the bus reached his destination, Sunil told Singh that he neither gave him a ticket nor returned his balance money. As Singh claimed that he had already handed him the ticket and balance, an argument ensued. Singh alleged that during the altercation, Sunil hurled abuses at him and hit him with his tiffin box. He also hit him on the head and face, and tore his uniform. He was admitted at PGIMER for his injuries and after recovering, lodged a complaint at the public window. Following preliminary investigation and legal opinion, police registered a case under Sections 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty) and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of the Indian Penal Code at the Sector 11 police station, and arrested Sunil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/two-years-on-ambala-man-held-for-assaulting-ctu-conductor-101642365936788.html
17-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Local SAD leaders up in arms against Mohali ticket to Sohana||Shiromani Akali Dal’s (SAD) decision to pick Parvinder Singh Sohana, 41, as its candidate from Mohali for the upcoming state assembly elections has not gone down well with the local leaders.Strongly opposing Sohana’s candidature, they said the party did not take their views before giving him a ticket and they will hold a meeting on Monday to decide the further course of action.Avtar Singh Mauli, SAD leader and block samiti member from Mauli Baidwan, said the party allotted the ticket without consulting any member. “Sohana is not acceptable to us, we oppose his candidature,” he said.Stating that all local leaders were upset with the decision, Gurmeet Singh Shampur, senior vice-president of SAD’s BC cell, Mohali, said on Monday, around 30 leaders, including sarpanches, block samiti and zila parishad members, will hold a meeting regarding this, followed by a media interaction.Another senior Akali leader, on the condition of anonymity, said several senior leaders met on Sunday as well and decided to convey their dejection to party chief Sukhbir Singh Badal. “How can the party give the ticket to a traitor, who deserted the party?” he questioned.On the other hand, speaking to HT, Sohana said there can be differences in a family, but these will be sorted out. “SAD will put up a united face and win the elections with a thumping majority,” he said.A former Labourfed chairman, Sohana, who was holding the post of Youth Akali Dal (Mohali) president, left the SAD in January last year before the municipal corporation elections, owing to differences with former member of Parliament Prem Singh Chandumajra.He joined hands with the Azad group, led by former mayor Kulwant Singh, following which the SAD expelled him from the party. In the elections, the Azad group won 11 of the total 50 seats, with his wife, Harjinder Kaur, being one of the group’s winning candidates. While 37 seats went to Congress, the SAD drew a blank.Later in October last year, Sohana, along with his wife and supporters, returned to the SAD in the presence of party president Sukhbir Singh Badal, who assured him and his team members due honour and recognition in the party.

The South African side was chasing a target of 232 and the 19-year-old Chandigarh lad was bowling against Valentine Kitime and Dewald Brevis in the 11th over of the innings. After the shaky start, Bawa was taken out of the bowling attack.Having tried all bowlers till the 35th over in order to get Brevis’ wicket, Indian captain Yash Dhull called on Bawa again. This time, he made full use of the opportunity, as he took Brevis’ wicket. He added three more wickets to his kitty after that, ensuring that the Proteas were bundled out for 187 runs in 45.4 overs. Bawa took the scalps of South African captain George Van Heerden, along with Andile Simelane and the last man Aphiwe Mnyanda. “The South Africans did well to restrict us at 232 and it was up to the bowlers to do their job. They had come with a plan and done their homework too. I was disappointed after the first over and after that, I analysed the South African batters and bowled a tight spell in order to contain them. In the process, they gave away their wickets and fell short of the target. Our spinners did a fine job,” the city lad said. “I want to improve my economy in the upcoming matches. The pitches in the Caribbean are somewhat similar to India,” added Bawa, who forms the quick bowling attack along with Rajvardhan Hangargekar and Ravi Kumar. He was also involved in an important 35-run batting partnership with captain Yash Dhull before he departed for 13. Bawa was part of the India team that won the Asia Cup in the UAE and had taken eight wickets, including four against Pakistan. Grandson of Indian hockey Olympian Tarlochan Singh, Bawa owes his success to his coach and father Sukhwinder Bawa, who even trained Yuvraj Singh in the 90s along with other first-class domestic cricketers in Chandigarh. Emulating his father, Bawa picked up quick bowling and is a useful middle-order left-handed batter. “I was just four when I lost my grandfather. As I grew up, I got to know about his achievements. He is an inspiration for me and I want to play for India like him. My hero is Yuvraj Singh. I want to be like him and become a successful all-rounder,” said Bawa, who wants to help India win the U-19 World Cup like Yuvraj Singh did in 2000 and keep the promise he made to his 92-year-old grandmother Bhupinder Kaur Bawa. “I see a great resolve in my son as I had seen in Yuvi back in the 90s. He has been training hard since the last four years and making the India U-19 team for the World Cup was on his mind since then. He should be taking plenty of wickets in the tournament and also score quick runs,” said Sukhwinder.Bawa earlier played for Punjab U-19 but shifted to Chandigarh when UT Cricket Association got BCCI affiliation back in 2019. Bawa was disappointed when there was no tournament for the U-19 cricketers due to the pandemic.“It was very frustrating not being able to go out in the nets regularly and not get a chance to play in the Cooch Behar Trophy and the Vinoo Mankad Trophy. Then, the U-19 world cup was pushed to 2022. I practised hard with my father in the two years,” said Bawa. India takes on Ireland in their next game on January 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/under19-cricket-world-cup-chandigarh-s-rajangad-bawa-off-to-blistering-start-101642364915516.html

17-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi govt intensifies Covid enforcement, 466 teams on ground||The Delhi government has intensified enforcement against violations of Covid-appropriate behaviour amid the city’s fifth wave of infections, with 466 teams collecting overs ₹1 crore across 11 districts on Saturday alone, showed data accessed by HT.Each team comprises an executive magistrate and four civil defence volunteers, and are split between stationary and mobile units.Only around 150 enforcement teams were deployed across the city before the Omicron-fuelled surge hit Delhi in mid-December last year.On Saturday, these teams imposed fines worth over ₹1.02 crore, after issuing 5,210 challans for violations of Covid-appropriate behaviour (including flouting mask norms, spitting in public, among others).Most of these fines were imposed in East district ( ₹14.4 lakh), followed by South-East district ( ₹13.4 lakh), North ( ₹12.9 lakh), and Central district ( ₹12.3 lakh).According to a government document seen by HT, there were 396 such enforcement teams in the city on December 15, 10 days after the Capital reported its first confirmed Omicron case. On that day, the 11 districts together issued around 3,500 challans for violations of mandated Covid mitigation norms.The number of enforcement team increased to 425 by January 1, when cases were increasing rapidly. This number further increased to 466 by January 14, and the number of daily challans increased to 5,769.A revenue department official said district magistrates are empowered to designate any official, including teachers, as an executive magistrate. “Many teachers, tehsildars and other revenue department officials have been designated as executive magistrates,” said the official who asked not to be named.Mobile teams fan out across a district, with a focus on areas prone to crowding, like inter-state bus terminals, markets and railway stations.Stationary teams, meanwhile, are deployed in crowd-prone locations like some of the city’s popular markets.“The need for more teams was necessitated in the days before New Year, when markets started swelling with crowds and it was getting difficult to maintain distancing and mask discipline,” said a district official, who also asked not to be named.Another district official said regular meetings are being held with all stakeholders, including the police, civic bodies, market groups and resident welfare associations, among others.“There is a sharp focus on enforcing Covid-appropriate behaviour at public places, especially during peak gathering hours. Further, awareness material has been placed near the enforcement teams’ pickets and prominently displayed at places of mass assemblage,” said a district official.However, enforcement officials on the ground said people are often less than cooperative.A member of an enforcement team recently deployed at Lajpat Nagar market said the unit faced several difficulties in enforcing the norms, and were rebuffed when they tried to fine people.“At times, people refuse to pay on the spot, saying they don’t have cash on hand. Occasionally, defaulters get aggressive if we try to penalise them and give us excuses for not adhering to protocols. Some people also refuse to provide identification proof,” said the official, adding that they often need police personnel to help them out.Experts said people should not discontinue Covid-appropriate behaviour, even when the case curve flattens.“The number of cases has dipped for the last three days... The peak of the curve has already been hit and further restrictions may not be beneficial. The government should now start lifting restrictions imposed on business activities and individuals’ movement after watching the trend for a couple of more days. People, however, must be encouraged to continue to follow appropriate behaviour like wearing masks in public places and maintaining social distancing. Authorities should continue to ensure that people do not violate such standards,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital.Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Sunday said the state’s enforcement norms have proved to be beneficial. “People should continue to follow all Covid protocols and take necessary precautions like wearing masks for safety and to maintain social distance when entering public places,” he said in a briefing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-intensifies-covid-enforcement-466-teams-on-ground-101642364432437.html
17-01-2022||Chandigarh||Only 3 percent of Ludhiana’s eligible teens vaccinated against Covid so far||Even as the administration has been appealing to residents to get vaccinated at the earliest in view of the fresh surge in Covid cases, only 3% of the eligible population in the 15-18 age group have so far turned up to get inoculated. The vaccination drive for this group began on January 3. As per the health department, there are about 2.15 lakh teens in the 15-18 age group but only 7,604 (3.54%) have been vaccinated until Sunday. The reason for the slow start to teen vaccinations is being attributed to hesitancy, both among the teens as well as their parents. Due to the low response, the administration has also decreased the number of teen vaccination sites from 15 to six, though officials say the number will be increased in the coming days if more teens start showing up. Jitesh, a BRS Nagar resident, said, “I have an 18-year-old son and a 15-year-old nephew. Though both are eligible for vaccination, we have decided to wait for some time and observe. We are apprehensive since the vaccination anyways does not guarantee that we won’t be infected once jabbed.” Simar, 17, a resident of Model Town, said, “I had gone for vaccination on January 3. Though the administration had promised to set up separate centres for children, there was a heavy rush at the centre on the day, so we decided to return home. Now, we are staying put as the Covid cases are increasing and we fear that we may get infected when we go for vaccination. The department should set up special camps at school for teens.”Civil surgeon Dr SP Singh said the department is working to spread awareness among the 15-18 age group and the education department has also been roped in to motivate the eligible students. “Children are more active on social networks so they pick up all sorts of information online. The state government is planning to organise vaccination camps in schools. The number of vaccination camps for the 15-18 age group is less these days because of the low response. The number of camps will be increased depending on the demand,” said Dr Singh. Non-approval of Covaxin by other countries also a hurdleDr Singh said that only Covaxin is being administered to children as per the government guidelines. The department had also received queries from children and their parents on whether Covaxin is approved by other countries like Canada, Australia, USA etc, as many children in this category move abroad nowadays. There are some countries that have not yet given approval to Covaxin and that matter has to be taken up at Union government level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/only-3-percent-of-ludhiana-s-eligible-teens-vaccinated-against-covid-so-far-101642364312209.html
17-01-2022||Chandigarh||Editors Guild of India, Mumbai Press Club condemn ‘coup’ at Kashmir Press Club||Country’s prominent journalists’ bodies, including the Editors Guild of India (EGI) and the Mumbai Press Club (MPC), on Sunday came out in support of the elected management of the Kashmir Press Club (KPC), a day after it was taken over by a small ‘disgruntled’ group of mediapersons flanked by the police.The group on Sunday locked the club triggering outrage among the journalistic fraternity of Kashmir.“The club has been shut down on Sunday and this has anguished scores of its members who have been calling me. The KPC has continued to operate during the toughest times. I urge the L-G of J&K to intervene for the welfare of members and ensure the institution is allowed to function democratically,” said the president of the club, Shuja ul Haq in a statement.The EGI and the MPC condemned what they said was the forcible takeover of the Kashmir Press Club by a group of journalists with the help of armed policemen.The EGI termed the takeover of the club as a ‘coup’, demanded immediate restoration of the status quo which existed before the ‘hostile’ takeover and also wanted an independent inquiry as to how armed forces entered the club premises.“The Editors Guild of India is aghast at the manner in which the office and the management of the Kashmir Press Club, the largest journalists’ association in the Valley, was forcibly taken over by a group of journalists with the help of armed policemen on January 15, 2022,” the EGI said in a statement.On Saturday a group of journalists led by Mohammad Salim Pandit, working with a national daily, and flanked by police entered the Kashmir Press Club in Srinagar and declared themselves to be the new interim body of the KPC, which will hold elections for the new club.Although the 2-year-term of 11-member executive and management body of the 300-member strong club, which was elected in 2019, had ended last year in July but they said they could not conduct fresh elections immediately owing to mandatory re-registration of the club which was asked by the authorities.The takeover by the ‘disgruntled’ group, alleged to be supported by the local administration, had come a day after the administration suspended the KPC’s re-registration certificate - which had been issued by the authorities after seven months on December 29 - following an adverse CID report. The re-registration was suspended after the club’s elected interim body on January 13 had decided to initiate the process of fresh elections and also announced the date.Nine journalists’ bodies of Kashmir, including the elected Kashmir Press Club body, have termed the takeover as “illegal and arbitrary”. The head of the ‘disgruntled’ group Salim Pandit said that the term of the present press club had expired in July and the club was in a “mess”.The EGI said it was alarmed by the “arbitrary order” of putting the registration of the KPC in “abeyance” as the club’s interim management had announced an election for a new management body as well as the executive committee.The Mumbai Press Club also criticised the forcible takeover of the KPC and deplored the J&K administration’s ‘scuttling’ the club’s election process.On Saturday, former Jammu and Kashmir chief ministers Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti blamed the BJP’s policies for undermining and demolishing the free press in Kashmir and blamed some journalists for forcibly taking over the Kashmir Press Club with help of the administration.Reacting to the statements of the EGI and the MPC, the group said that instead of adhering to journalistic standards of verifying the other side of the story, the bodies came up with a “half-baked and sensational statement as if ”some government-sponsored coup” had really taken place.” The group said it was open to any scrutiny over the interim takeover but that “bias in issuance of statements without verification of ground reality amounts to nothing but malicious propaganda.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/editors-guild-of-india-mumbai-press-club-condemn-coup-at-kashmir-press-club-101642364191754.html

Chandigarh mayor Sarabjit Kaur was also present at the meeting.Speaking at the meeting, the mayor listened to the problems regarding need-based changes raised by the RWAs and said she will take up the issues with the administration.While Bahga was unable to attend the meeting, both Puri and Sharma were present. Puri spoke about the Delhi model, which many CHB associations have demanding for many years. “The officials have ruled out the possibility of implementing a Delhi model in Chandigarh, as it has led to problems in Delhi. But, we have been asked to develop a different model to solve the issue of need-based changes.”Former mayor Sharma added, “In the previous years, we have organised many protests to make the administration aware of these issues. The time has come to ask for our right. We will also talk to Member of Parliament Kirron Kher and take up the issue with the Centre.”Local councillor Gurbax Rawat, who was also present at the meeting, said, “There are many issues in the CHB houses in this ward. In the LIG duplex houses in Sector 40, the top floor’s bathroom has been made on top of the kitchen of the ground floor. So what if the people decided to get these changes sorted out by their own. We are willing to rise above party lines and collectively work towards the betterment of people.” Councillor from ward number 34 Gurpreet Singh, who also lives in a CHB house, expressed support for the initiative.The various RWAs demanded that the Delhi need based changes model be adopted here as well and notices on old violations not be served until it is implemented. They demanded that transfer of properties should not be stopped because of changes made in their flats. Residents demanded that Transfers based in on GPA valid before September 2011 should be accepted.Both Puri and Sharma assured the gathering that they will raise the residents’ viewpoints in the next need-based changes meeting of Chandigarh Housing Board which will be held on January 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chbflats-chandigarh-mayor-promises-to-take-up-rwas-issues-with-admn-101642363473645.html

This has prompted mayor Madhu Azad to seek a progress report from officials and convey the issue to the directorate of urban local bodies (DULB) for further action.The civic body conducted its last house meeting on December 27 last year, in which projects such as rejuvenating 72 ponds in the city, fixing water lines in DLF phases 1 and 2, fixing water lines and stormwater drains in Sushant Lok 1, constructing a Uttarakhand Bhawan, and constructing a badminton court in Sector 4, among others.According to Azad, councillors recently apprised her that little to no work has started for the projects approved for their respective wards.Of the 26 projects, MCG has only started constructing a badminton court in the Sector 4 area for ₹1.5 crore, said the officials.“While I understand that a large number of MCG officials are deputed for Covid-19 related issues amid the ongoing third wave of the pandemic, it is also imperative that development work in the city does not come to a complete standstill. Hence, I have asked for a status report on the projects approved during the last month’s house meeting,” said Azad, adding that she will send the report to DULB for taking further action.After a house meeting concludes, the MCG sends a file to the DULB containing a list of all the projects approved in the meeting.“Due to the ongoing third Covid-19 wave, a large number of workers have returned home, as a result several MCG projects are stuck. Due to this scenario, tenders for several projects approved in the last month’s house meeting are yet to be floated. We are expecting to start this process in early February and start on-ground work soon after,” said a senior MCG official, requesting anonymity.Coincidentally, the lack of action in projects approved during previous house meetings was brought up by a number of councillors as well as the mayor in last month’s house meeting. They had asked MCG’s engineering wing for an explanation on the delay, leading to MCG commissioner directing officials to carry out work approved in the house meeting on priority and in a time-bound manner.

The victim, a mother of three, had gone missing at about 8pm on Tuesday, after her husband had dropped her at the Maloya bus stand. At around 9.25pm, the police control room was informed by a passerby who had spotted the body lying in the bushes. Sources said that the woman’s mouth was gagged using socks, which police officials say was done to ensure she does not make any noise. The woman is survived by husband, two daughters and a son. The preliminary postmortem termed asphyxia as cause of death and a few injury marks indicating strangulation were found on the body. A murder case has been registered at Maloya police station. Police are scanning the mobile data dump and have questioned her husband at length, but so far, a suspect has not been identified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-woman-s-murder-even-after-4-days-police-groping-in-dark-101642363171664.html
17-01-2022||Delhi||Group linked to Al Qaeda says it planted bomb in Ghazipur market: Police||Mujahideen Ghazwat-ul-Hind (MGH), an al Qaeda-affiliated terrorist group active in Kashmir, has claimed responsibility for planting an improvised explosive device (IED) at the Ghazipur flower market last week, said Delhi Police officers associated with the investigation, even as no arrests were made till late Sunday.Although the authenticity of the claim could not be established, agencies said they were taking the matter seriously and have sounded an alert in Delhi-National Capital Region (Delhi-NCR) and other states, including those that are headed for elections, the officers said.A Delhi Police officer associated with the probe and who asked not to be named said the group made the claim on a Telegram group, where it also claimed that “the IED did not explode due to technical glitches”.According to the officer, the Telegram message was found during social media monitoring by intelligence gathering agencies. The same message was shared with the special cell that is investigating the IED recovery case. “In the same message on the platform, the alleged terrorist outfit mentioned that the IED not going off does not mean their (the outfit’s) plan failed. Through the message, the outfit also warned agencies to prepare themselves for more such attempted terror strikes,” the officer said.The development has left central agencies as well as the top brass of the Delhi Police concerned, said the officer quoted above, since it could mean the possible entry of Kashmir-based terrorists into the national capital, especially since the attempted attack comes even as preparations for Republic Day celebrations are underway, and the dates for elections in five states – Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur – have been declared.Since the outfit’s claim was made through an encrypted platform, investigating agencies have found it difficult to ascertain the source of the message. When contacted, Vijay Kumar, inspector general (IG) of the Jammu & Kashmir Police, said MGH has been in prominence recently and was reportedly started by a person named Khitab Kashmiri, who fought alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan and is reportedly living in Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK).Some senior Delhi Police officers working on terror-related cases said that they have reasons to believe that MGH is a front for the terrorist outfit Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind (AGuH), which was formed by former Hizbul Mujahideen operative and Kashmiri terrorist Zakir Rashid Bhat, popularly known as Zakir Musa, who was killed by security forces in an encounter in May 2019.Musa became the commander of the Hizbul Mujahideen after the killing of its top commander Burhan Wani in July 2016. However, in 2017, Musa left the terrorist outfit and formed Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind in Kashmir. After Musa’s killing, AGuH was led by Burhan Koka, a terrorist of Shopian district who was killed in April 2020, and some terrorists of Tral area in Pulwama district.Asked if AGuH and MGH are the same outfit, J&K police IG Vijay Kumar said: “As of now, there is nothing to suggest that they are one and the same, but both share ideologies. Considering recent trends, where the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) has been given a facade of The Resistance Front (TRF) and The People’s Anti-Fascist Force (PAFF), or Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) of the Kashmir Tiger Force, the MGH may also be an attempt to give a facade to AGuH.”At 10.16am on January 14, the city police received a call that the owner of a scooter spotted an unclaimed black bag containing an iron box with white powder, tapes and wires around it on a pavement near Gate 1 of Delhi’s largest flower market.Around 1.30 pm, the bomb detection and disposal squad of the National Security Guard (NSG) destroyed the IED through a controlled explosion that was carried out in an 8-feet pit hurriedly dug up with the help of an earthmover 100m from the spot where the bag was found.The NSG later said the IED weighed roughly 3kg and likely consisted of powerful chemicals such as RDX and ammonium nitrate, while shrapnel was also seen in the device, which could have led to significant harm if detonated. The NSG’s bomb experts collected samples of the explosive items from both the places – where it was found and where it was destroyed – for further findings, a report of which is likely to be shared with the Delhi Police on Monday.The special cell registered a case under the Explosive Act and took up the probe, primarily from the terror angle since the use of the RDX hinted the involvement of a terrorist outfit and the fact that the explosive substance was sourced from Pakistan. The investigating team has so far collected the footage over 200 CCTV cameras installed in the radius of nearly one kilometre from the spot where the IED was spotted.“The cameras are installed on the routes leading to the flower market from Delhi as well as Uttar Pradesh. There are at least 10 points through which someone can reach the flower market from the eastern part of Delhi and from Ghaziabad and Noida. The place where the IED bag was kept was not covered by any of the cameras installed at the market’s entry and exit gates. Moreover, nobody has come forward to claim that he or she had seen anyone keeping that bag. We are trying to identify the suspect or suspects through other video footage,” said an investigator, who did not wish to be named.

The Haryana State Employment of Local Candidate Act, 2020, mandates 75% reservation for local youth in private sector jobs, which offer a salary of less than ₹30,000 a month. Industry owners said that they are hopeful that they will get some relief from the Punjab and Haryana high court in this matter as the new reservation policy of the state government would make hiring very difficult and they will prefer to adopt a cautious approach. According to the Haryana government, all industries must register with the job portal created by the labour department in the next three months before hiring fresh candidates. The Gurgaon Industrial Association (GIA), which has challenged the Act, moved an interim application for early hearing in the Punjab and Haryana high court on January 13, which was rejected. The next date of hearing is schedule on February 2. The Act has also been challenged by the industrial associations in Rewari and Faridabad. Ashok Kohli, president of Chamber of Industries of Udyog Vihar, said industry owners have decided to adopt a wait and watch approach with regard to the local job reservation. “We are waiting for the next hearing in the Punjab and Haryana high court and are hoping to get some relief. This is basically a political move but will hit the industries badly. The availability of skilled labour is always short in the state. Instead of job reservation, the government should have focussed on skill building among youth and ensure that they are employable,” he said. J N Mangla, president of Gurgaon Industrial Association, said most of the industrialists were waiting for the court to hear their petition on February 2. “This reservation will make running business very difficult. Freedom to hire employees should remain the prerogative of a business owner. The pandemic has already put a lot of pressure on the industries,” he said. Manmohan Gaind, vice president of Manesar Industries Welfare Association, said the job reservation act was a very regressive law and it will bring Haryana down by taking away the rights of businesses. “We will register with the portal only after clear directions are issued by the court on the petition,” said Gaind. According to industry associations, the government has asked them to share details of existing employees. The job reservation is meant for fresh employees and new recruitment but in the next three months, the labour department perhaps will be building a database of existing employees, said Kohli. Meanwhile, Ajay Pal Dudi, deputy labour commissioner, Gurugram, said the proposed reservation is meant for fresh recruitment of employees and it does not impact the existing workers. “The firms and companies have been asked to register on the portal and share the information of existing employees within three months starting from January 15. New hiring can be done only after completing online registration,” he said. In order to ensure compliance to the Act, the labour department said each employer will have to submit a quarterly report on the designated porta,l mentioning details of the local candidates employed and appointed during this period. Haryana’s deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, who is the main architect of the Act, said this was a historic move and it will secure the future of local youth. “With the implementation of this Act, new avenues for employment will open for hundreds of youth of the state in the private sector. In this regard, a dedicated portal has also been created by the labour department along with a helpline number. Companies will now have to reflect their vacancy on the portal, which will be continuously monitored by the government,” said Chautala while speaking at a function in Sirsa on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/employment-act-gurugram-industries-pin-hopes-on-high-court-for-relief-101642362931724.html

Police on Saturday had recovered gold ornaments and coins worth over ₹1 crore from the house of kingpin Praveen Yadav’s brother-in-law who was posted on deputation in NSG. According to police, Praveen was planning to flee the country along with his family members and was in touch with his friends and some businessmen in the USA and the UK. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that Praveen was aware that he will be arrested soon as the victims had asked him to return money after they came to know that he has duped them. “The complainants had come to know in November that he was no longer posted in NSG and started calling him but he stopped answering their calls. He went incommunicado following which the victims started complaining to police. They also visited his village in Farrukhnagar to have a word with his father but even his phone was switched off,” he said. Police said that the economic offence wing (EOW) of Gurugram police is scanning Praveen’s bank accounts and checking all transactions in the private company he had formed.

17-01-2022||Delhi||10 water bodies may be labelled Delhi’s first wetlands this March||Not a single one of Delhi’s 1,043 identified water bodies – each of which has its own unique identification number (UID) -- is currently notified as a ‘wetland’. This, however, could soon change, with the Capital expected to notify 10 major lakes and water bodies as wetlands by the end of March, according to senior officials aware of the matter. The Delhi State Wetland Authority (DSWA) is expected to release a draft notification for each water body under the Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules of 2017.Not only will this ensure legal protection to the water bodies, but each of the notified wetlands will see Integrated Management Plans (IMP) prepared, allowing DSWA to get funds from the Centre to protect and rejuvenate them.The water bodies identified in the first phase include Sanjay Lake, Hauz Khas Lake, Bhalswa Lake, Najafgarh Jheel, Welcome Jheel, Smriti Van (Vasant Kunj), Smriti Van (Kondli), Pooth Kalan, Sultanpar Dabas and Daryapur Kalan. Another 50 water bodies will be notified in the second phase of the programme.The Delhi SWA was constituted in April 2019, as part of the Wetlands Rules of 2017, and officials said that they began work on notification of wetlands by the end of 2019.KS Jayachandran, member secretary, DSWA, said a draft notification for each water body will soon be released to the public, with a 60-day window for feedback and comments, before they are notified.The notification will detail the geo-coordinates of each water body demarcated as a wetland and the area over which it is spread. These, officials said, will ensure the water body is not encroached in the future.“In the first phase, 10 major water bodies were identified, but we are already working on the second phase, for which Khasra numbers (land survey number that is assigned to a specific plot or property) for 50 more wetlands are being identified. If a water body is notified as a wetland, the wetland conservation rules allow for an IMP to be prepared, which is a long-term action plan. We will also be applying for funding from the Centre for each of these wetlands,” said Jayachandran.While nine water bodies are currently being considered for notification through the Delhi government, SWA officials say Najafgarh Jheel could be notified as a wetland by the Centre, as it forms part of a National Green Tribunal (NGT) judgment.In September 2020, the NGT asked the Delhi and Haryana governments to jointly prepare an environment action plan for the lake, which falls in both the states. In their report, the two states said that it will be notified as a trans-boundary wetland by the Centre as it requires management from both the states.HT has seen a copy of the draft notifications, which mention a zone of influence for each wetland, including its buffer zone, where recreational activities like cycling and walking are permitted, while commercial activities, including grazing, are not.Suresh Kumar Rohilla, senior director, Urban Water programme at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), who is part of a technical committee formed by the Delhi SWA to notify wetlands, said the long-term plans for each water body will be detailed and can plug existing problems such as sewage in-flow and poor maintenance.“Currently, for most water body projects, STPs are being used to provide cleaner water, but there are no action plans on how the water body will be revived and then maintained over a period of time. The IMPs will help do that and also ensure there is legal sanctity for the wetland,” he says.Rohilla also said the Tikri Khurd lake was also being considered for notification in the first phase, with the NGT asking for clarity on its wetland status in 2019.A major chunk of Delhi’s 1,043 water bodies currently fall under the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and the Block Development Office (BDO). Data with the Delhi Parks and Gardens Society (DGPS), which has mapped these water bodies, said 836 water bodies in the city fall under DDA’s jurisdiction, followed by 131 under BDO. The forest department has 18 water bodies, while the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has 15 water bodies under them.Manu Bhatnagar from Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), who is also part of the Delhi SWA, states most water bodies that are set to be notified as wetlands in Delhi are currently without an adequate catchment area, or a source of water supply, a problem that will be addressed once they are notified.“The Bhalswa lake, which was once comparable to the Naini Lake in Nainital, now suffers from excess sewage dumping. Each water body has specific problems that will need a specific solution. We will look at plans for each of them,” he said.Diwan Singh, an environmentalist and convener of the Natural Heritage First, said while mapping 1,043 water bodies was an important step for Delhi, the next will be to make these individual plans work.“Funding is often not an issue for the smaller water bodies, but once we know exactly how many there are, they can be systematically tracked and revived. Most require efforts where they can be connected to a storm water drain or a source of water that sustains them through the year,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/10-water-bodies-may-be-labelled-delhi-s-first-wetlands-this-march-101642362031657.html

A former Patiala mayor, Kohli, 43, had joined the party, last week, after snapping ties with the SAD. He and his family had around seven decades of association with Akali Dal as his father Surjit Singh Kohli, senior vice-president of Akali Dal, remained public works department (PWD) minister in 1997. His grandfather Sardara Singh Kohli also represented the SAD as an MLA. Kohli was Patiala mayor from 2007-2012. Sumaer Sira, another contender of AAP from the constituency, said he had worked hard for party welfare, but will continue to work for the party. “It is a well thought-out decision as AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal had a word with me on Friday. Our main motive is to end Captain Amarinder Singh’s reign in Patiala city,” he said. Kohli said, “I will take all AAP leaders and workers along to build my campaign. The party has shown interest in me and I will give my 100% in ensuring party’s victory,” he said. CONG, PLC YET TO ANNOUNCE CANDIDATE The Congress and the Punjab Lok Congress are yet announce their candidate from the seat. For the Congress, it will be a major challenge to make up for Amarinder; he won four elections in a row from here (2002-17). Even during the 2015 by-polls, his wife Preneet Kaur emerged victorious.However, after floating the PLC, even Amarinder is yet to announce a candidate from this particular segment. “The party is in dilemma on whether to float a local party leader against expected experienced opponents or bring in an outsider to retain Congress supremacy in Patiala city,” said a senior party leader.From the Congress, names of Punjab cabinet minister Brahm Mohindra and former MP Dharamvira Gandhi have been doing the rounds. Mohindra, however, has already negated this possibility. “I abide by the party’s one family, one ticket policy. My son is contesting from Patiala rural. Therefore, there is no possibility of me contesting from urban constituency,” he said.

The Punjab Marriage Palace and Resort Association (PMPARA) estimates that there are 70,000-odd weddings, scheduled at hotels, resorts, marriage palaces across Punjab from January 15 to February 28. With the number of people at gatherings restricted to 50 indoors and 100 for outdoor venues, plus the night curfew from 10pm to 5am, cancellations have become the order of the day. NRIs are also in the state, especially for weddings of close relatives. On select dates, considered highly auspicious, there were hundreds of weddings planned in a day. Deshraj Singh, general manager, Hotel Maharaja Regency on Ferozepur Road in Ludhiana, says the panic is palpable and number of cancellations for weddings booked is at an all-time high. “There are days when we have three to four functions scheduled at the hotel in a single day. With timings being limited, there is utter panic and chaos in families,” he said, adding that 50% of bookings have been cancelled. He added that for some families, guests have arrived from abroad and invites sent to 500-odd guests. “Advance payments have been made to photographers, caterers, make-up artists etc on the basis of normal estimate of guests. On postponing the function, payments become an issue, and if some parties decide do go ahead with the function, putting a limit on the guests becomes difficult,” he said. Sukhdev Singh Sidhu, president, PMPARA, and owner of Chashme Shahi Resorts in Mohali, says, “In Punjab, people are known to spend and make weddings a gala affair. January 15 is considered to be the start of the wedding season, which lasts till February-end. With the restrictions in place, we are staring at huge losses.” Rajnish Kalra, owner, Razzle Resorts on Pakhowal Road, said, “This is the season for caterers, decorators, jewellers and all industries attached to a wedding. There are people getting affected with Covid in large numbers within families and preparations have gone for a toss. Resorts have a capacity of over 1,000 and we can easily accommodate people with social distancing, but somehow the wedding and catering industry ends up bearing the brunt of such restrictions,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-restrictions-in-peak-wedding-season-replace-families-joy-with-worry-101642361370883.html

17-01-2022||Delhi||Zamrudpur is cooking up a revolution in cloud kitchens||Md Shamim, a delivery executive with an online food aggregator, says that since the Delhi government banned dine-in at restaurants last week, the number of deliveries he makes every day has almost doubled. While he delivers to multiple locations in south Delhi, the pickup destination is almost always Zamrudpur, a village near Greater Kailash 1. “It is because this village is the biggest hub of cloud kitchens,” says Shamim, as he waits to pick up an order, a pizza, from a cloud kitchen located in a nondescript building in the auto market of the village. With restaurants in Delhi shutting dine-in facilities frequently due to pandemic restrictions in the past two years, cloud kitchens--- delivery-only outlets - have mushroomed across the Capital. The epicentre of this revolution is Zamrudpur, a south Delhi village, currently home to about 100 cloud kitchens, including Layla’s, Ah So Yum, Burgerama, Madam Curry, Kougan and Rutbah, among others that promise fine dining at home. Throughout the day, one can see food aggregators’ delivery partners zipping in and out of the village on motorcycles, cycles and electric bikes. Most cloud kitchens here have no signboard-- the only sign of their presence are delivery men receiving orders through a small opening in the doors of the buildings. Ashwani Basantani, who runs Cloud Kitchen Exchange, an online platform that helps buy, sell and rent cloud kitchens, says the village is a favourite with cloud kitchen enterprises because of low rentals, a south Delhi address, and its proximity to posh south Delhi colonies, which generate a bulk of the high-value orders. Ishaan Kapoor, who runs Madam Curry, a cloud kitchen, agrees. His kitchen, along with several others, is situated in the village’s dusty auto market, dominated by a motor mechanic and auto-parts shops. “It may look like an unlikely place for a kitchen hub, but this market is already one. The cloud kitchen model allows us to operate in any location; what matters is the quality of the kitchen infrastructure and food, ” says Kapoor, who ran a catering business before he started Madam Curry in 2020. The cloud kitchen, he says, has been a success, and he has since opened one more in Gurugram and is in the process of opening another one in Punjabi Bagh. “Setting up cloud kitchens allows you to move away from pricey retail locations and focus on just food,” he adds. A 200sqft space in Zamrudpur costs about ₹20,000 a month. Jahan Khurana, who owns 15 cloud kitchen brands such as Dana Pani, Ballu Bawarchi, Roji Roti and Shanghai Chillie’s, says the pandemic has led to the rebirth of the cloud kitchen concept in the country, with over 3,000 cloud kitchens opening in Delhi alone during the pandemic. “ The first cloud kitchens arrived on the scene a few years ago, but the model got a big boost during the pandemic. Now, new cloud kitchens are opening almost every day. Half the people opening them have no background in the food business,” says Khurana, who was among the first to open a cloud kitchen, a 1,400sqft facility, in Zamrudpur. He is rapidly expanding his business through the FOCO Model (Franchise Owned Company Operated). “Individuals in the US have invested in our business through this model. The cloud kitchen concept is here to stay,” he says. Many cloud kitchen enterprises in the country are raking in huge investments; a report by RedSeer Management Consulting predicts that cloud kitchens are set to be a $2 billion industry in India by 2024. In fact, among those opening cloud kitchens are top chefs who quit their jobs during the pandemic to start their own ventures. Anuj Wadhawan, who worked with a five-star hotel as an executive chef, started Ah So Yum in June 2020 . The kitchen in Zamrudpur makes about 50 deliveries per day on an average – of sushi, dimsums, bao, among other Pan Asian cuisine – to south Delhi localities. “I always wanted to start my own venture, but the disruption caused by the pandemic made me finally take the plunge,” says Wadhawan, who runs three cloud kitchens today in Gurugram, Zamrudpur in Delhi, and more recently, in Lucknow. He says that while he misses interacting with hotel guests, he enjoys the creative freedom. “In a hotel, we would change the menu once a year; here, I do so every couple of months,” says Wadhawan, whose kitchen is also located in the auto market. “It is a closed kitchen, so the location does not matter. I would be paying ten times more if I had space in the neighbouring GK and would have shut down by now. This place has given me access to sophisticated customers.” The ground floor of his facility in the village serves as the kitchen, the first floor as storage and the second floor as the office. He says that in the past few months the competition has intensified with top brick-and-mortar restaurants and even five-star hotels entering the cloud kitchen space.“But they won’t be able to beat us as they cannot match the economics of our model,” says Wadhawan,. Rajiv Goyal, a chef, who works as a consultant with many cloud kitchens in Delhi and Gurugram and runs India Food Tourism Organisation, which promotes food tourism in the country, says that several top chefs are not only opening their own kitchens, but many are also joining cloud kitchen ventures full-time. “They see a lot of potential; the cloud kitchen is a highly scalable model, and is raking in massive investments. Cloud kitchens are offering them better salaries than hotels, whose revenues have been hit due to the pandemic,” says Goyal. He says the cloud kitchen revolution was fuelled by the work-from-home culture during the pandemic, which brought in a shift from eating out to ordering in. “People have been working from home and many have had no time to cook and are not comfortable having a maid at home because of fear of infection . They regularly order food from these kitchens,” says Goyal. Besides, he adds, many home chefs, a lot of them women, who earlier took orders on phone and catered to their neighbourhood clients, are now operating cloud kitchens. They offer everything from diabetes meals to high-protein and no-carb meals. “Before the pandemic, I ordered meals from a few well-known brick-and-mortar restaurants, but now I end up ordering from cloud kitchens. Their food is as interesting as their packaging, but yes, there are concerns about the obscure locations of these kitchens and their hygiene standards. After all, a kitchen is not a warehouse,” says Adesh Gupta, a software engineer who lives in South Extension. Ishaan Kapoor says that online branding and packaging is important to the success of a cloud kitchen. “We are trying to create a gourmet fine-dining experience at home. Our brand name is inspired by Marie Curie. Because we are into experimental food, our food is served in glasses, injections and test tube-shaped packages,” says Kapoor. Most Zamrudpur kitchens have 10-20 staff members, including a chef and manager, working in shifts. Some kitchens are open until 4am. A manager at a well-known cloud kitchen in Zamrudpur, says working in a cloud kitchen is pretty tedious. “Earlier I was working in a Khan Market restaurant, but lost my job, so I joined a cloud kitchen here. Interacting with the guests was one of the most rewarding parts of the dine-in restaurant, now I just deal with delivery partners. I am not used to sitting in the kitchen for so long,” he says. But the villagers are not complaining. “I have no idea what they cook, and where the food goes, but they are offering good rent,” says Ramvir Singh, a resident. “Here they get a GK address at a Zamrudpur price.”

Mann said ample employment and business opportunities would be generated in the state. “We will give employment and salary according to the qualification and give new opportunities to the talented youth for their start-ups, so that they can create employment to other people along with them,” he said at a press conference in Mohali. The AAP leader said their plan is not only to provide people with employment but also to make them capable of creating job opportunities. “Young people used to do direct jobs or their own business earlier after getting their degrees from colleges and universities. But, today due to lack of employment young people are falling victims to depression and drugs, and money and talented people are moving abroad because of the incompetent governments,” he said. Criticising the Congress, he said that in the last elections, they promised to give employment in every household, but started giving jobs to the children and families of their MLAs, ministers, and leaders after the formation of their government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-aap-to-stop-flight-of-money-talent-from-punjab-says-mann-101642360171830.html
17-01-2022||Chandigarh||Guru Ravidas Jayanti: BJP, SAD (Sanyukt), PLC seek postponement of polls||Chandigarh : The BJP, Capt Amarinder Singh-led Punjab Lok Congress (PLC) and Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt) have appealed to the Election Commission to postpone the February 14 assembly election in Punjab in view of Guru Ravidas Jayanti, after the BSP and chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi made similar requests to the poll panel. The birth anniversary of Guru Ravidas falls on February 16. In a letter to the Chief Election Commissioner on Sunday seeking postponement of the election, Punjab BJP general secretary Subhash Sharma said, “The state has substantial population of followers of Guru Ravidas ji, including the Scheduled Caste (SC) community which is about 32% of the population of Punjab.” “On this pious occasion, millions of the devotees would visit Banaras in Uttar Pradesh to celebrate the gurparb. So it would not be possible for them to participate in the voting process. It is therefore requested to your goodself that the date of voting may be postponed so that these voters of Punjab could participate in the election process,” he wrote. Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt) chief Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, in a letter to the poll panel, also sought that the date of voting be postponed. Earlier, chief minister Channi had urged the Election Commission to postpone the polling date by six days “for enabling around 20 lakh SC devotees to utilise their right to vote for the state legislative assembly.” A large number of SC devotees from the state are likely to visit Banaras in Uttar Pradesh from February 10 to 16. In such a situation, many people from this community would not be able to cast their votes for the state assembly, said Channi who belong to the SC community. Bahujan Samaj Party’s Punjab chief Jasvir Singh Garhi was the first to demand postponement of the polling. He requested the Election Commission to hold the polls on February 20, instead of February 14. Voting for Punjab’s 117 assembly seats is scheduled for February 14 and the counting of votes will take place on March 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guru-ravidas-jayanti-bjp-sad-sanyukt-plc-seek-postponement-of-polls-101642360051591.html

17-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Denied ticket from Majitha, Cong Amritsar rural chief joins BJP||In a jolt to the ruling Congress, its Amritsar (rural) district president Bhagwant Pal Singh Sachar on Sunday joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the presence of its national general secretary Tarun Chugh, expressing disappointment over being denied the ticket from Majitha assembly segment.In Majitha, which is the bastion of senior Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader and former Minister Bikram Singh Majithia, Sachar had been working tirelessly and considered the front runner for the Congress ticket. His claim to the ticket got a fillip after the exit of Sukhjinder Raj Singh, aka Lali Majithia, who had contested the last two polls against Bikram unsuccessfully and recently joined the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). However, the party allotted the ticket to Lali’s brother Jagwinder Pal Singh, aka Jagga Majithia.In presence of other senior BJP leaders, including Rajindermohan Singh Chhina, Chugh welcomed Sachar to the party. “I had been noticing for the last many months that factionalism had taken center stage in the Congress in terms of distribution of tickets for assembly polls. Sidhu group, Channi group, Jakhar group… have emerged in the Congress. I was denied the ticket, thanks to this factionalism. This happened despite all surveys conducted by the party in the segment going in my favour,” said Sachar after joining the BJP.Sachar said that there is a common perception that the Congress gives the ticket to a weak, as per the consent of Bikram Singh Majithia to ensure the SAD candidate’s victory. “This happened here again, and strengthened the perception that this is a friendly match in Majitha. This forced me to say good bye to the Congress and join the BJP, in which I am seeing my political future. However, my joining is unconditional and I will accomplish any responsibility assigned to me,” he said.Other Congressmen from Amritsar who joined the BJP included Pardip Singh Bhullar, Rattan Singh Sohal, Paramjit Singh Randhawa and Tajinderpal Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-denied-ticket-from-majitha-congress-amritsar-rural-chief-joins-bjp-101642359931510.html

17-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: SAD war room highlights past development, fights negative campaigns||With social media emerging as a key campaign tool, especially amid ban on political rallies and large gatherings, the digital warriors of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) have adopted a two-pronged approach ahead of the Punjab assembly elections scheduled on February 14. On the one hand, the party’s IT wing that heads the election war room operations is busy highlighting various development works carried out during the previous Akali regimes, especially between 2007 and 2017, and on the other, it is keeping a close eye on Facebook and Twitter to counter all negative posts and comments that target the party. In fact, the IT wing is backed by a team of lawyers, who are quick to respond by reaching out to those spreading “negativity”. When persuasion doesn’t help, defamation suits are filed, says a party insider. The SAD had taken an early head start by hiring the poll strategy firm Mindshare. It is headed by Sunil Kanugolu, who had partnered with ace poll strategist Prashant Kishor in June last year to launch trending online campaigns #GalPunjabdi (Talk about Punjab) and #13pointagenda (to highlight SAD’s agenda for elections). In the entire social media campaign, party president Sukhbir Singh Badal remains at the centre stage and is projected as synonymous to development in the state. The agency conducted constituency-wise surveys about the issues and popularity of local leaders, and submitted a report much in advance, on the basis of which the party has fielded a number of candidates. “We did well with the two campaigns on all social media platforms. However, after the launch of farmers’ agitation, the campaign had to be stopped midway,” says SAD’s IT wing head Nashattar Singh Gill, who monitors social media campaigns on day-to-day basis. “Our campaign is purely positive, focusing on development projects such as road and bridges, memorials, thermal plants and water channels. We talk about welfare schemes run by the Akali Dal-led governments in the past, such as free power to the agriculture tubewells. However, we don’t take it lightly when anyone badmouths our party or its leaders on social media,” he says. According to Gill, the party president and his wife and Bathinda MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal take a lot of interest in finalising the campaigns. The IT wing is supported by the party’s media advisers Harcharan Singh Bains and Jangveer Singh, who give expert inputs. Singh also looks after messages on Twitter. The head of the PTC broadcast looks after the content for web channels. Sukhbir has 4.13 lakh followers on Twitter and the SAD’s account is followed by 81,800 people. Cadre is the strength The party’s cadre strength is also helping in the social media campaigns. The SAD’s poll war room, which functions from a plush office in Chandigarh, is in touch with 23,000 WhatsApp groups at a click of a button. At least 30 war room managers are engaged in making and sharing posts and video clips of Sukhbir’s speeches and short videos of projects started during the Akali regime. “We consider YouTube, Facebook and WhatApp as our strength. Each WhatsApp group has 40-60 members, and we give them one or two themes to be rolled out among voters,” says Gill, adding that the party has the data of one crore phone numbers of identifiable people who are also circulated the messages simultaneously. Gill explains that entire Punjab has been divided into six zones, and these zones have been equally divided into assembly constituencies and further into election booths. To check “negativity”, the war room managers are in a constant touch with Facebook authorities, and immediately complain in case there is any derogatory post or comment made against the party’s interests. “We have even tracked down influencers who were talking against the party leaders and have warned them,” says a war room manager, not willing to be named. 
17-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Women kin pitch in with door-to-door campaign for candidates||Amid ban on political rallies and road shows, female family members of candidates from various political parties are pitching in with door-to-door campaigning to woo the voters, especially women, who comprise 47% of the state’s electorate. In general, the women are campaigning in urban areas, while the candidates and their supporters are busy in rural pockets of their respective assembly segments. Sukhjeev Kaur Romana, wife of Youth Akali Dal president Parambans Singh Romana, has been making efforts to garner support for her husband, who is the Shiromani Akali Dal candidate from Faridkot. “Since the time available in hand for the campaign was limited due to the ban on rallies, I carried out door-to-door meetings daily to do my bit for my husband. A woman holds the power to change the thoughts of her family, and we believe that she will help the party earn votes, not only hers but also of many family members,” says Sukhjeev. Vinu Badal, wife of finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal, has been reaching out to a cross-section of voters, listening to their woes and telling them about the work done by her husband in Bathinda Urban segment. Similarly, Amrita Warring, wife of transport minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, is busy in door-to-door campaigning in Gidderbaha, from where he has been fielded once again by the Congress. In the Kotkapura assembly segment, three female family members of Aam Aadmi Party legislator Kultar Singh Sandhwan are canvassing for him separately. “My wife, sister-in-law and niece are seeking votes among women, as they relatively feel comfortable with a team of female campaigners,” Sandhwan said. The Election Commission (EC) has extended the ban on physical rallies and road shows for the upcoming assembly elections across five states to January 22, but granted relaxation to parties to conduct indoor meetings with maximum 300 persons or 50% of the capacity of the hall. As per the EC data, there are 2.12 crore voters in 117 assembly segments of Punjab, of which 1 crore are female voters. 
17-01-2022||Delhi||Delhiwale: Meet the chairmen||They are sitting on the floor, not on chairs, even though they are professional chair makers. The three gents are weaving cane chairs this icy afternoon in a central Delhi neighbourhood. Commissioned by an adjacent household, they have been at work since morning.“We have been tasked with making six chairs,” says one of them.Occasional passersby throw curious glances. Maybe because it’s not common to see chairs being woven by hand. “True,” agrees the same man. “These days, people buy ready-made kursi.”The men are brothers. At 41, Janak Songh is the youngest (and quietest), and Nathi Lal (60) is the eldest. Adal Singh (56) is doing all the talking. Exuding a friendly, easy-going temperament, his smile is endearing. The chair he is working on is almost finished.“The bunai (weaving) has to be strong and maheen (delicate),” Adal Singh says, his eyes contracting behind his glasses as he concentrates on the “cane” of the slip seat.The brothers live in the same locality (Kalyanpuri), but in separate houses. They mostly work as a team and commute to the site of the day in their respective bicycles. Each one’s wife packs a lunch box for each. “But we eat together, sharing one another’s subzi.”The brothers inherited the career from their father, the late Jyoti Prasad, who arrived in Delhi some 60 years back. A farmer’s son in Uttar Pradesh, he grabbed the first job he found in the city — as a chair weaver in a furniture shop in Lajpat Nagar. His young sons joined him from the village some years later. “We learned (the art of) bunai from our father,” says Adal Singh.Today, the brothers have 10 children in all. The new generation will not carry forward the legacy. “Our children are studying, they want to do office jobs. They haven’t learned bunai.” Pausing momentarily, Adal Singh explains: “Office work is simpler. You leave home at a fixed time in the morning and come back at a fixed time in the evening… our line is full of hard work, and everyday we have to go to different places, wherever the work is.”The next day the men are sighted at work on the same spot. “We will finish all the chairs today,” says Adal Singh, as he poses for a portrait with his two brothers. The eldest — “bhaisaheb” — is made to sit on a completed chair out of reverence for his seniority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-meet-the-chairmen-101642359567920.html

17-01-2022||Lucknow||India leading in vaccination: Yogi||LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said here on Sunday that India was leading in vaccination and Indian vaccine was the best against Covid infection. “Experts have accepted that the Indian vaccine is the best and effective for prevention of Covid,” Yogi said after inspecting the Covid facility at the King George’s Medical University. He said, “The third wave of the biggest pandemic of the century has come in the world and country. After experts foresaw a third wave in August last year, UP worked to tackle it and proved the third wave fear unfounded. Though cases are rising fast, the need for hospitalisation is little.” Sharing statistics, the CM said UP had administered over 22.87 crore doses of Covid vaccine since January 16, 2021. “Lucknow, particularly, has administered over 100% first dose of the target and over 72% have got second dose also. The city has a good vaccination drive.” “For the past about two years, we have done good Covid management under the leadership of the Prime Minister. The state’s management has been appreciated as a good model,” he said. “The new Covid variant Omicron is weak as compared to the second wave despite its fast spread. But it is less dangerous. This is why the state government has allowed daily activities apart from the night curfew. But we have to stay alert and safe, particularly children, elderly, and pregnant women,” he said. Of the over 1.03 lakh active cases, over 1.01 lakh were in home isolation. In Lucknow also, less than one per cent of the active cases were in hospital. Most of those in hospital were there due to some other ailment and got tested for Covid. This showed the virus was getting weak, said the CM. Earlier, Yogi inspected the Covid facility on the campus with vice chancellor Lt Gen (Dr) Bipin Puri, Dr D Himanshu, Prof SN Sankhwar and Dr Avinash Agrawal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/india-leading-in-vaccination-yogi-101642359152743.html

17-01-2022||Chandigarh||Ludhiana MC’s failure to ensure quality checks mar multi-crore road development projects launched ahead of the Punjab assembly polls||Ludhiana The multi-crore road construction projects taken up by the municipal corporation (MC) ahead of assembly elections have come to no good as the new roads have already begun wearing off merely weeks after construction.Several residents from different parts of the city including Udham Singh Nagar, Shastri Nagar, Kitchlu Nagar, Old GT road, Dugri among other areas have submitted complaints of substandard work over the period. Similar complaints were also received for the work done on Model Town-Jawaddi road and Pakhowal road, which were constructed by the Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT). A Model Town extension resident Tajinderpal Singh said, “The material started wearing off at the newly constructed Model Town-Jawaddi road (Deep hospital road) a few days after it was constructed. The ruling parties only take up the development project ahead of elections and hundreds of crores is spent on construction of roads, installing interlocking tiles just to woo the voters.” “However, with no check on quality the amount gets wasted and no one is held responsible for the same and the public is again forced to have a bumpy ride,” he added.RTI activist Arvind Sharma had also complained against poor quality of construction work at Model town-Jawaddi road and Pakhowal road to the local bodies department.The rainfall witnessed in the first week of January further blew the lid off the tall claims made by authorities regarding the quality of work. Gravel can be seen spread on damaged roads, increasing the chances of road accidents as the two wheelers can skid on roads. Mayor Balkar Sandhu had earlier said road construction work estimating ₹250 crores had been taken up in the city. Notably, the MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal had at the time written to the local bodies department to appoint a third party for quality checks.An MC official, requesting anonymity, said the ruling party MLAs and leaders pressurised the civic body to take up development projects ahead of elections despite the cold weather conditions. The hot mix material could not be laid properly during the work carried out in the night and the heavy rainfall and waterlogging witnessed during the first week of January added to the damage of the roads, which would have otherwise lasted for 4-5 years, he further revealed. A shopkeeper at Dugri road, Sanjay, said the main Dugri road is being constructed after a gap of over six years but poor quality of the work was evident as a stretch of the road wore out even before the project was completed.“No one is paying heed to the problem. Public money is being wasted and no relief is being provided to the public,” he added.It is pertinent to note that the MC contactors have taken up repair work of the roads that had been constructed in the last 2-3 months.MC additional commissioner Aaditya Dachalwal, meanwhile, said the respective contractors have been directed to take up the repair work following the complaints from residents. He revealed that the payments were held until the repair work is completed, before adding that the MC is also working to impose penalties on contractors for the damaged roads.Material at ‘smart’ Malhar road wears offThe road constructed under the heavily advertised project to transform Malhar road into a smart road under smart city mission has also begun to wear off. Notably, the authorities had made several promises to ensure the quality of works under the smart city mission, but the project has missed multiple deadlines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-mc-s-failure-to-ensure-quality-checks-mar-multi-crore-road-development-projects-launched-ahead-of-the-punjab-assembly-polls-101642358672988.html
