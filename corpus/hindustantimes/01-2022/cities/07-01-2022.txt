07-01-2022||Noida||10 AC city buses rolled out in Greater Noida to end commuting hassles||Jewar MLA Dhirendra Singh flagged off a city bus service comprising 10 air-conditioned buses to connect both rural and urban areas in Greater Noida, fulfilling one of the citizens’ long-standing demands.“The city bus service will cover dozens of sectors, villages, commercial spots, and important government offices so that the general public can make good use of this facility. We have asked the authority and the UPSRTC [Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation] to expand the service in the future to connect more sectors and villages so that all of Greater Noida and its villages can be covered,” said Dhirendra Singh.To begin with, the city bus service will comprise five routes connecting Greater Noida east and Greater Noida west, which is home to at least 400,000 newly built flats.“We will continue to seek feedback from citizens and revise the routes to provide connectivity in areas where it is needed. The authority will provide UPSRTC with the required support to run this service successfully,” said Amandeep Duli, additional chief executive officer of the Greater Noida authority.The Greater Noida authority and the UPSRTC together started the bus service on Thursday in the presence of Dhirendra Singh, Dadri MLA Tejpal Nagar, and MLC Shrichand Sharma at Kasna bus stand.The authority has agreed to bear the ₹30 lakh loss that is expected to take place while running this operation--according to the authority’s estimate, the service will initially witness a low passenger turn out on these five routes.“Initially, there will be a low number of passengers because of a lack of awareness of the routes. Most such services usually experience a loss in revenue due to this reason. But gradually when the general public becomes aware of the routes, more and more passengers will start using the service,” said a UPSRTC official, requesting anonymity.Initially, the bus service will provide connectivity from Raipur to Kasna via Greater Noida authority office, Surajpur, Sector P3, etc. (route number 1(, from Kasna to Metro stations like Delta 1, villages such as Bisrakh, Kisan Chowk, 18 industrial sectors and others (route number 2), 22 residential sectors, education hub (route number 3), Gharbhara village to GBU, Galgotia, Yeida office, etc. (route number 4), and Noida-Greater Noida border on Dadri road to Kulesra among other nearby villages and government offices (route number 5).“The city bus service is a much-needed service in Greater Noida. But the routes should be decided as per the feedback of citizens,” said Anendra Chauhan, a teacher and resident of Sector Delta 1.

07-01-2022||Gurugram||Gurugram picks up pace of Covid vaccination after state government’s jab mandate||The pace of Covid-19 vaccination, especially for the first dose, has increased rapidly in Gurugram in the past four days compared to that of the second dose, due to the impact of the state government’s order on mandatory vaccination certificates, said officials.According to the order issued on December 22, 2021, only people fully vaccinated against Covid-19 are allowed in public places such as malls and markets in Haryana from January 1.Officials of the health department said from January 1, 55,859 first doses of the vaccine have been administered to adults in the district. Including doses for children in the 15-17 age group, 111,085 first doses have been administered between January 1-7, they said. Over 70,200 second doses have been administered in the district between January 1-7, they added.Officials said that the increase is mainly because of the Haryana government’s vaccination mandate as well as several migrant workers coming forward to get vaccinated.“Till last month, we were administering around 1,500-2,500 first doses daily, which has increased to 8,000-9,000 doses now, as many people are coming forward to take the vaccine. One of the main reasons is the strict direction issued by the state government. Plus, many who had not taken the vaccine despite door-to-door campaigns are also coming forward,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer.He said that at present, the rate of first dose vaccination is 140% and will increase further. According to officials, in the district, first dose vaccination has crossed 100% as several people from other districts and a migrating population have also been vaccinated in Gurugram.“From the feedback we received from different doctors of the department, we have also learnt that many migrant workers who came back after the festive season are getting vaccinated now,” added Singh.On Friday, 13,883 children were vaccinated in the district, of whom 13,508 received their first dose in government centres and 375 in private vaccination centres.

On Friday morning, a spot check by HT found at least 300-500 people waiting in line to get vaccinated at these centres without social distancing.Naresh, a 34-year-old labourer who came to get vaccinated at Polyclinic Sector 31, said, “I had not taken the vaccine earlier as I had gone to my village. Now with the new rule in place, benefits from the state government will be stopped and contractors will also not hire me for work, so I am taking the vaccine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-picks-up-pace-of-covid-vaccination-after-state-government-s-jab-mandate-101641579467465.html

07-01-2022||Delhi||In green budget, NDMC says it will only buy e-cars, renewable energy||In a major push to make its operations energy efficient and pollution-free, the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) on Friday said that all official cars from now on will be electric vehicles, and that it will purchase power produced from renewable sources only.The announcements were part of the council’s budget for 2022-23 that showed a net surplus of ₹178 crore with an anticipated increase of 15% in its receipts at ₹4381.43 crore. NDMC administers the New Delhi area, including the Lutyens’ zone.NDMC chairman Dharmendra, who goes by a single name, while tabling the budget in a special meeting of the council on Friday, said, “NDMC continues to take lead in pollution mitigation measures and has resolved to stop purchase of petrol or diesel based passenger cars and will acquire electric cars in future, converting its existing fleet too in a phased manner. NDMC has already introduced more than 60 e-charging stations in its area and is augmenting by more than 100 in this year itself.”“We have embarked upon on ambitious journey of shifting to 100% renewable energy municipal body of the country. To ensure it, the NDMC has not renewed its power purchase agreement with thermal power generating stations after its expiry, but has also taken up fresh purchase agreements with only renewable power providers including hydel and solar energy,” he added.He said it was a forward looking budget, adding that the council was committed to a “well governed and financially sustainable municipal body”. “We have resolved to provide uninterrupted services to our citizens and keep New Delhi in a state that is befitting of the national capital,” he said.He added that NDMC has not proposed any increase in property tax rates for the year 2022-23. “The tax revenue is projected at an all-time high of ₹960 crore in this budget. Licence fees projections are at an all-time high of ₹764 crore maintaining a continuous growth streak, despite no annual enhancement in last two years,” he said.Adding to the green initiatives that the council was planning, Dharmendra said that a fleet of e-scooters will also be deployed this year, complementing the smart bikes.Listing the consumer friendly steps that the council proposes to implement in the next financial year, the NDMC chairman said common payment portals will be provided for the convenience of the residents. He added that a new website of all 49 council schools will be made by March 2022. “While the new electricity-water billing system in NDMC will be completed by 2023, we have also implemented smart classrooms in all NDMC schools from classes 6 to 12 to provide e-learning solutions. Now, we have decided to extend this facility to primary section. Also, all schools will be provided higher bandwidth connections,” he said.Unlike the fully elected municipalities -- East, South and North Municipal Corporations, NDMC is a 13-member council that is headed by a chairperson. Of the 13 members, 2 come from the Delhi assembly, including the New Delhi constituency legislator, five are nominated by the central government, four are nominated in consultation with the Delhi chief minister and the Member of Parliament from New Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/in-green-budget-ndmc-says-it-will-only-buy-e-cars-renewable-energy-101641579107229.html
07-01-2022||Delhi||Marital rape a crime of cruelty in India, Delhi govt tells high court||While stating that courts do not have the power to legislate into effect a new criminal offence, the Delhi government on Friday told the Delhi high court that martial rape is treated as a “crime of cruelty” in India.The high court is hearing a bunch of pleas seeking to criminalise marital rape in India. Exceptions to Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which deals with rape, decriminalises marital rape and mandates that sexual intercourse that a man has with his own wife (the wife not being under fifteen years of age) is not rape.A bench of justices Rajiv Shakdher and C Hari Shankar was hearing public interest pleas by NGOs RIT Foundation and All India Democratic Women’s Association and two individuals, a man and a woman, who sought the striking down of the exception to Section 375, arguing that it discriminated against married women who were sexually assaulted by their husbands.The petitions were heard after a gap of two years owing to the Covid-19 pandemic when only extremely urgent matters were being heard by courts.During the hearing on Friday, the Delhi government’s additional standing counsel Nandita Rao told the court that married women and unmarried women were placed differently under every single law.“Marital rape is a crime of cruelty in India. Married women and unmarried women are different under every single law,” Rao said.She also contended that even in the case of one of the petitioners, who claimed to be a victim of repeated marital rape, the FIR stood registered for an offence under Section 498A of the IPC (Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty).Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, representing the petitioner woman, argued that courts all over the world have recognised marital rape as an offence and abrogated the concept of a wife’s irrevocable consent for establishing sexual relations.He also said the value system and women rights have evolved with the passage of time and relied on a series of judgments passed by courts in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, the European Union and Nepal as well as international treaties to submit that an argument of a wife’s assumed consent was untenable.He also said the Nepal Supreme Court has observed that the Hindu religion did not exempt the “heinous act of rape of a wife”.Gonsalves further objected to the notion that marital rape was a “western concept” and highlighted a United Nations report which indicated the prevalence of sexual violence among married couples in certain Indian states.“Marital rape is the biggest form of sexual violence which happens in the confines of our homes. How many times does rape take place in the institution of marriage and is never reported? This figure is not reported or analysed,” he submitted.In 2018, the Delhi government had told the predecessor bench hearing the case -- headed by then acting chief justice Gita Mittal -- that wherever a spouse indulged in sexual relations without the willingness of the other, it was already an offence under the IPC and a woman was entitled to refuse sexual relations with her husband as the right to body integrity and privacy under Article 21 (protection of life and personal liberty) of the Constitution.The central government, in its affidavit, said marital rape cannot be made a criminal offence as it could become a phenomenon that may destabilise the institution of marriage and an easy tool for harassing husbands.The hearing in the case will continue on January 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/marital-rape-a-crime-of-cruelty-in-india-delhi-govt-tells-high-court-101641579049116.html
07-01-2022||Delhi||No disruptions for second week, people offer namaz at 10 locations in Gurugram||Muslims offered Friday namaz at 10 locations in Gurugram, with no disruption reported from anywhere, police said, adding that adequate deployment was made at all places. Senior police officers aware of the deployment said the community prayers were performed at Shankar Chowk, Udyog Vihar, Palam Vihar, and sectors 12, 29, 44, 10, 37 and 45. They also said that Hindu right-wing activists were kept away from the namaz, and the Muslims were asked to observe appropriate social distancing. This was the second consecutive week when Friday namaz being performed in public places were not disrupted by the Hindu outfits who have maintained that the weekly prayers cannot be allowed in open spaces and described it as encroachment. They have been protesting against it since 2018. The Muslims have said that they were forced to perform community namaz on Fridays since there were not enough mosques in Gurugram.To be sure, currently there are no designated sites (open public spaces) for performing namaz in Gurugram. There were 37 sites initially which were earmarked by the Gurugram administration. These were brought down to 20 last year. However, after the Haryana chief minister Mahohar Lal Khattar announced on December 10 that performing namaz cannot be tolerated in open spaces, all sites were cancelled. The administration is yet to earmark new places for prayers. Senior officers quoted above said some members of Sanyukt Hindu Sangharsh Samiti, an umbrella body of Hindu groups which is leading protests against namaz in open spaces, gathered at Sector 44, Sector 37, Udyog Vihar and Shankar Chowk before the namaz in the afternoon, but were turned away by police teams deployed there. Rajiv Yadav, assistant commissioner of police, said teams were deployed at all sites and Muslims offered prayers peacefully. “We did not let anyone near the namaz sites, and teams were on alert until the prayers were finished,” he said. Yadav said they had cautioned the Hindu groups in advance not to create a ruckus, and parked police vans near the locations to detain them. “We also ensured that everyone coming for namaz followed Covid-19 protocol and maintained social distance and were wearing masks,” he said. At Shankar Chowk, at least 500 people performed namaz in six batches (jamaat), and 300 prayed in different batches at the nearby Shyam Chowk, according to Mohammad Shamoon and Qari Aarif, who led the prayers at these two sites. At a park in Udyog Vihar, around 350 people performed prayers in different groups to ensure social distancing. Shamoon, associated with Gurugram Imam Sangathan, said they need at least 15 places in the city to accommodate the rush of people on Friday. “This is the fourth Friday prayer offered at this spot (Shankar Chowk). It remained peaceful. There was no disruption. Earlier, we offered namaz at Peepal Chowk, but it was shifted after the protest. Since the six spots have been fixed, police ensured security till the end of prayers,” he said. Mohammed Akil, one of those who had come for prayers at Shankar Chowk, said working people even from Delhi come to offer Friday prayers. “We are working professionals, and we congregate only on Fridays. You can see that we are praying peacefully, and following social distancing norms,” he said. Maulana Aarif, who also prayed at the same place, said the number of people who join the prayers has reduced. “Earlier, at least 1,000 persons used to gather, but now hardly 300 come for prayers due to Covid-19. There are 12 to 13 mosques in the city, but all of them are in old Gurugram. A large number of Muslims work in Udyog Vihar, it is not possible for them to go there,” he said. Hindu groups said despite the chief minister saying that namaz cannot be allowed in open spaces, the police did not take any action. Mahavir Bhardwaj, state president of the Sanyukt Hindu Sangharsh Samiti, said, “We will write to the chief minister regarding the violation of his directions, and will request him to take action against people offering prayers in open. We are not disrupting anymore but this cannot continue. Police and administration will have to take some serious action, else they (the Muslims) will continue to encroach upon public places,” he said. Altaf Ahmad, spokesperson, Gurgaon Muslim Council, which has been spearheading the Muslim side so far, said that namaz was being offered peacefully for the last two weeks. “There were no disruptions reported from any sites on Friday. Police and administration have been kind to us, and we hope that we will continue to get their support,” he said. Ahmad appealed to Muslims in the city to avoid Friday congregations in view of the latest wave of Covid-19 cases. “Muslims have shown restraint during the first and second Covid wave, I expect them to show the same now as well, and not come out for namaz congregations,” he said.Right-wing groups have been protesting against Friday namaz in open public spaces in Gurugram for the past three years. The Muslims have asked the administration to allot them spaces to build new mosques.

In view of this, it had proposed to build 21 more pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants to boost supply.During the second wave peak shortage of oxygen led to many losing their lives as demand for oxygen went up multi-folds.The proposed plants are to come up in Pune city, six with a production capacity of 12.7 metric tonnes per day, two in Pimpri-Chinchwad with a production capacity of 3.1 metric tonnes and 13 in Pimpri-Chinchwad with a capacity of nine metric tonnes daily.In order to ensure that there is no shortage of essentials necessary for the treatment of Covid-19 patients, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has written to the state government that there is enough availability of affordable resources.The IMA has urged the government to bring in one drug one price policy for all the important drugs required for the treatment of Covid-19 patients.In its letter to the state, the IMA has written, ‘ It would be difficult for the hospitals to deliver the healthcare with very high costs against low unsustainable capping of hospital charges.’The letter also draws attention to the fact that although the government has capped the price on most essentials on the ground the marketed price of all these essentials is exponentially high making it difficult for hospitals to sustain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/21-psa-oxygen-plants-in-pune-to-boost-supply-during-third-covid-wave-101641578867322.html
07-01-2022||Delhi||Two malls in Saket are Delhi’s fully vaccinated markets||Delhi government declared two malls – Select City Walk and DLF Avenue, Saket – as the Capital’s first fully vaccinated markets, a south district administration official said on Friday, adding that everyone working in these malls, from sanitation workers, guards and parking staff to management officials, was vaccinated with both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine.Yogeshwar Sharma, CEO, Select City Walk, confirmed that everyone on their staff, whether on the payroll or hired by agencies, as well as those working in the mall stores was fully vaccinated.Authorities said the Delhi government is running a campaign wherein everyone working at popular markets across the city is encouraged to get vaccinated at the earliest. All districts have been asked to organise camps in markets with a high footfall and ensure that all staff members are vaccinated at the earliest so that the markets can be declared fully vaccinated. GK-1 M Block and South Extension 1 markets (both under the jurisdiction of the south district) are likely to be soon declared fully vaccinated markets.A south district official said that posters announcing that the mall staff is fully vaccinated have been put up at both malls to increase visitors’ confidence and make the place safer for them. “We are organising vaccination camps in markets wherein the staff is not fully vaccinated. Soon GK-1 M Block market and South Extension 1 market will get the fully vaccinated tag, and all big markets in the district will be declared fully vaccinated very soon,” said the official, seeking anonymity.A revenue department official said that shopkeepers and market associations are encouraging their staff to get fully vaccinated and district authorities are also organising vaccination camps. “The purpose is to make markets safer for people working there and the customers visiting the markets. All districts have been asked to encourage the malls and markets to expedite the second dose for all those eligible for vaccination,” the official said.Brijesh Goyal, chairman of the Chamber of Trade and Industry, an association of traders, said it was a welcome move and every trader will support it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-malls-in-saket-are-delhi-s-fully-vaccinated-markets-101641578687540.html
07-01-2022||Pune||Covid cases continue to rise in Pune district, hospitalisations still low||PUNE Even as Pune district is experiencing a surge in Covid-19 cases since mid-December, the number of those admitted to hospitals is still low, as per the district health office.In the week from December 16-22, when the number of active patients stood at 1,837, 553 patients were admitted to hospitals. In the following week, when the number of active patients rose to 2,194 the number of hospitalised persons stood at 549. Out of 549 hospitalised active Covid19 cases, 63 are in ICU, and 31 needed ventilators, as per the district health office data.Most of the new Covid-19 cases being reported were breakthrough infections who report mild symptoms and so do not require hospitalisation, said officials.Dr Sanjeev Wavare, assistant health officer, said, “It is true that the number of new cases is rising rapidly, but the hospitalisations are not going up in proportion which is a good sign. Increased hospitalisation would add load to the already exhausted hospital infrastructure.”“On Friday too, the city reported over 2,700 new cases which took the active caseload to 9,792 cases, however out of those active cases, only 7.71% required hospitalisation. Currently, there are 95 patients on oxygen treatment, 21 on the invasive ventilator and 19 on the non-invasive ventilator,” he said.By the end of December, as the number of cases had already started rising rapidly, only two per cent of the active cases in the district required ventilators, and 35 of them needed ICU beds. To ensure that if hospitalisations continue to rise and there is no shortage of beds at the last minute, the district administration has prepared about 3,337 ICU beds and 1,825 ventilators. Also, 15,575 oxygen beds are available in various hospitals in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-cases-continue-to-rise-in-pune-district-hospitalisations-still-low-101641578507318.html

He was studying in Class 1. His mother works as a receptionist.She was away at work when her husband returned home around 6pm on Thursday to find the boy playing a game on his mobile phone instead of studying. ”The man told us that when he scolded his son, he didn’t listen. That angered him so much that he began beating the boy,” the DCP said.The boy eventually collapsed. A while after the man left the unconscious boy in the house and walked out, his wife walked in.Helped by a neighbour, she rushed the child to Max Hospital in Saket where he was declared dead on arrival. Hospital authorities informed the police that the boy’s body bore several injuries. The police reached the hospital to find the boy’s parents, sister and a neighbour in attendance.Around the same time, an anonymous person dialled the child helpline number to alert them about a boy being taken to Max Hospital after a thrashing by his father, the DCP said.The police began a probe, but the man denied beating the boy even as his wife seemed unaware of the incident. “We then enquired in the neighbourhood to learn of the man’s violent behaviour towards his son. When we confronted him, he confessed to the crime,” the DCP said.Investigations have not found any abuse by the boy’s mother or her role in the death. The police have recovered the stick allegedly used in the crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/father-beats-son-to-death-in-south-delhi-s-khanpur-101641578447870.html
07-01-2022||Delhi||AIIMS, Safdarjung hospital curtail OPD services as Covid cases rise||The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and Safdarjung hospital issued orders restricting non-Covid services for outpatient discharge (OPD), speciality clinics and centres till further notice, in view of the rising Covid-19 infections in the national capital.An order issued by the AIIMS administration on Friday said OPD services in the hospital will function only with restricted registrations, limited to only prior appointment patients, including new and follow-up.“All speciality clinics to be stopped for the time being and speciality clinics follow-up patients will be registered within follow-up appointment slots only,” said the order.“All routine inpatient admissions and all routine procedures/non-essential surgeries will be temporarily stopped till further orders,” the administration said.Similar directions were also issued by the Safdarjung Hospital on Thursday, restricting OPD registration timings in view of the Covid-19 surge.The AIIMS administration on January 4 also ordered the conversion of the hospital’s Trauma Centre into a Covid care facility. This was met with protests from the Resident Doctors’ Association (RDA), which said that trauma services should not be ignored as most of victims are young and often the sole breadwinners of their families.In a letter to the director, the RDA said that avenues like the surgical block, MCh block, geriatric block, burns and plastics block should be used to render services to Covid-19 patients.The hospital on Friday released a circular informing the public that trauma services will be shifted to the ground floor of AIIMS’ Old Rajkumari Amrit Kaur Building from 2pm on Friday. Staff and doctors of the hospital were asked to make the requisite arrangements to receive new patients and transfer existing patients to the building.“We have been battling the pandemic for nearly two years now and the government and the hospital administration should have made arrangements to increase beds in the hospital. During the pandemic where will other patients go? How can we compromise patient care?” said a doctor at AIIMS hospital, who asked not to be named.Dr JA Jayalal, former head of the Indian Medical Association, said that during the peak pandemic situation, some measures need to be taken to augment beds.“We know that the number of cases is going to go up in the coming days and it is alright if the administration is deciding to reserve some hospitals exclusively for Covid care. That said, non-Covid patients should also not be neglected,” Dr Jayalal said.
07-01-2022||Lucknow||They avoided, but now compelled to take Ram’s name: Yogi in Ayodhya||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday attacked the Samajwadi Party (SP) over the Ram temple issue and targeted the Congress government in Rajasthan for not doing enough during the second wave of Covid-19 to ensure the safe return of Uttar Pradesh’s 15,000 students from Kota. He added that these students were brought back home safely by the BJP government despite resistance by the Ashok Gehlot government.Yogi Adityanath was addressing gatherings in Ayodhya and Gorakhpur where he distributed smartphones and tablets to about 3000 students.“They used to avoid taking the name of Lord Ram. Now, they are compelled to take Ram’s name,” he said in an apparent reference to the Samajwadi Party in Ayodhya. He also inaugurated ₹49.74 lakh Integrated Traffic Management System for Ayodhya under which 10 prominent crossings in the city will have traffic signals, 14 will have public address systems and four will have free Wi-Fi systems. Yogi Adityanath assured that Ayodhya would be developed into a world class city, so much so that people will say “muskuraiya ki app Ayodhya mein hai (Smile because you are in Ayodhya).”The chief minister also laid the foundation stone of a Ayodhya Development Authority housing project that will come up on the 14-Kosi Parikrama route. “Now, opposition leaders are also talking about visiting Ayodhya,” Yogi Adityanath said.In Gorakhpur, he inaugurated 20 projects worth ₹62 crore. These included a hotel management institute.Continuing his attack during the Ayodhya visit, Yogi said , “Under previous governments, there used to be riots every third day (in UP). Now, even after five years, there has been no riot.” “Some people are seeing Lord Krishna in their dreams. Lord must be cursing these people as when they were in power, the first riot took place in Mathura. Then after sometime, Jawahar Bagh incident happened,” Yogi Adityanath said. At an event organised at the Government Inter College in Ayodhya, chief minister distributed tablets and smartphones to students of Ram Manohar Lohia Awadh University, Saket PG College, Government Polytechnic and ITI among others. He also talked about his government’s stern action against the mafia. In Gorakhpur, smartphones and tablets were distributed to 1,000 students. Twenty-two students received tablets and smartphones on stage from the CM.“We brought back 15,000 students of UP by sending buses despite opposition to Rajasthan’s Congress government,” he said on the occasion.The chief minister said that the state government had decided to distribute smartphones and tablets to one crore students enrolled in undergraduate, postgraduate, ITIs, Polytechnic and other skill development courses. The drive began on December 25,the birth anniversary of former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, when these gadgets were distributed to 60,000 students in Lucknow.He said that free digital access with best curriculum content will also be provided free of cost to beneficiaries so that they can seek help in studies and prepare for competitive exams. The tablets and smartphones will also be provided with employment related information about state and central government schemes, he said.In addition, the government has offered Abhyuday, free civil service and competitive exam coaching, both through offline and online. With such initiatives, students will no longer be required to go outside the state for preparation of competitive exams, he told the audience.The chief minister said that in its almost five-year tenure, his government had given jobs to 4.5 lakh youth, and given self-employment to another 60 lakh, and was working relentlessly for the better future of the youth.Describing the Omicron variant as less dangerous but highly contagious, the chief minister asked the crowd that students above 15 years of age should get vaccinated to avoid any untoward situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/they-avoided-but-now-compelled-to-take-ram-s-name-yogi-in-ayodhya-101641578327367.html
07-01-2022||Delhi||Resident doctors of Delhi’s largest municipal hospital threaten strike||At a time when Covid-19 cases are surging and health-care facilities in the national capital are bracing for a third wave of infections, the resident doctors’ association (RDA) of Hindu Rao Hospital, the largest municipal health-care facility, has threatened to go on a strike over non-payment of salaries and arrears. In the strike notice submitted to the North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Friday, the Hindu Rao RDA has stated that salaries for the last 83 days is currently pending and if funds are not released by January 15, doctors will withdraw from services. The development comes on a day when the north corporation announced that 100 beds in Hindu Rao and 50 beds in RBIPMT Hospital will be reserved for Covid patients. The order issued by the director, hospital administration, states that hospitals should make Covid beds functional immediately while other services will continue as usual.The doctors at the hospital had last announced a strike over salary delays in November 2021, but they later withdrew the strike on being assured timely payments. Dr Tanuraj Tyagi, president, RDA, said in another week, it would be three months since they received salaries. “Salaries are our right and while urging us to call off the strike in November, the administration had assured us that salaries will be credited to our accounts before 15th of every month. They (administration) have once again gone back on their word. We have not been paid for since October. Similar backlogs exist in all north corporation run facilities,” he said.The strike notice submitted to the medical superintendent said, “We the resident doctors deployed at North Delhi Municipal Corporation and Hindu Rao Hospital wish to express our anguish and despair. We are sadly bound to write this letter to put into your cognizance about the ongoing delay in salary disbursement. It has been more than 83 days of diligent duties performed without hard earned salary.” Dr Sridhar Mudhiraj, vice president, RDA, said doctors have already exhausted the savings and are no longer in a position to meet their day-to-day needs. “Last time, residents had called off the strike based on promises given by the administration which have not been kept. If salaries for two months is not disbursed before January 15, 2022, unwillingly, we will have to withdraw from non-emergency services,” he said. The development comes at a time when the North MCD administration had already announced that it plans to utilise the hospital as Covid designated facility in case the need for hospital beds rises.Hindu Rao has a provision of 250 oxygen beds and 50 ventilator beds and an 1000LPM oxygen generation plant which was set up after the second wave of Covid-19 in April-May 2021. The nurses and paramedics are also expected to join the strike. Indu Jamwal, who heads the nurses association at Hindu Rao, said their strike notice will be submitted on Saturday. “Our salary is pending for two months and we are acutely short of staff. During the last strike, the administration assured us that vacancies will be filled but no action has been taken in this regard. With rising number of Covid cases, the caseload burden will be transferred to the existing staff,” she said. “At least the sanctioned posts should be filled. There are 144 sanctioned posts of senior nursing officer of which only 17 are occupied. There are 304 posts for nursing officers and only 253 are currently occupied,” Jamwal said.Leader of the house, North corporation, Chhail Bihari Goswami said the civic body has completed the preparation for meeting the Covid surge at two hospitals and other units will be added soon. “We are working to release the pending salaries of health workers and a resolution will be found soon,” he said, when asked about the strike notice.The three civic bodies continue to reel under a severe financial crisis with staff and health workers having to work without salaries, which could prove a hurdle in expanding the Covid facilities. Last year, in October the doctors and healthcare staff at Hindu Rao Hospital had gone on strike over non-payment of dues and Covid patients had to be transferred to LN hospital and Aruna Asaf Ali hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/resident-doctors-of-delhi-s-largest-municipal-hospital-threaten-strike-101641578267386.html
07-01-2022||Gurugram||Retired bank manager loses ₹12.25 lakh to cyber fraudster in Gurugram, probe on||Police booked an unidentified man on Thursday evening for allegedly impersonating as an employee of the telecom company and duping a retired senior bank manager in Gurugram of ₹12.25 lakh on December 13 last year, officials said on Friday.The victim, Ashoka Kumar Srivastava, 65, and a resident of Gurugram Sector 70A, on December 13, 2021, received a text message for verifying know your customer (KYC) details for his SIM card. When he called on that number, no one responded. Later that day, Srivastava got a phone call from the suspect, who asked the retired senior bank manager to install a remote access software application on his cellphone. After Srivastava downloaded the app, ₹12,25 lakh was transferred from his three bank accounts and a credit card, without his knowledge. “I am a retired bank manager... I had no idea that I was becoming a victim of cyber fraud. The caller told me if I did not verify the KYC details, my SIM card would get blocked. I trusted him,” Srivastava said. Srivastava told the caller that he was a senior citizen and did not have much knowledge about the technicality of verifying the KYC details for his SIM card. “He won my confidence by the way he conducted with me, and asked me to install the remote access software application on my cellphone, following which I lost ₹12,25 lakh from my accounts and credit card,” he added. A big amount of the total money being stolen was transferred from Srivastava’s bank accounts after he was asked to log into his Internet banking app, police said.“As the suspect had the control of my cellphone with the help of the remote access software application, he deleted all the text messages about the bank transactions and also the call log,” said an officer of the cybercrime police station in Gurugram Sector 43.An FIR was registered against the suspect under Indian Penal Code (IPC) Section 420 (cheating) and Section 66 (punishment for dishonest or fraudulent act) of the Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008, at the cybercrime police station in Sector 43 on Thursday evening, police said.An investigation has been launched and we are trying to nab the suspect at the earliest, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/retired-bank-manager-loses-12-25-lakh-to-cyber-fraudster-in-gurugram-probe-on-101641578147083.html

07-01-2022||Lucknow||Muslims in Uttar Pradesh faced discrimination under successive governments: Owaisi||All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Friday alleged Muslims in Uttar Pradesh faced discrimination and exploitation under successive governments of the Congress, Samajwadi Party (SP), the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP).There was no uplift or appeasement of Muslims in Uttar Pradesh, he asserted.Owaisi was speaking at a conference “Muslims in Uttar Pradesh” organised by the AIMIM in the state capital . He released the document, “Situating Development of the Muslims in Uttar Pradesh Policy Implications”, prepared by Centre for Development Policy and Practice (CDPP). The document highlights the socio- economic condition of Muslims in UP.Owaisi said the report prepared on the data of the Central and state governments clearly indicates that post-independence, Muslims have been denied their share in government, administration, education, business, employment as well as in welfare schemes. Although the BJP launched its election campaign on the “sabka saath- sabka vikas’ slogan, Muslims remained a neglected lot under five years of its rule in UP, Owaisi said. AIMIM will highlight impoverishment of 19.25% of Muslims in UP in its election campaign, Owaisi said. The document on the socio-economic condition of Muslims prepared by scholars Amitabh Kundu, PC Mohanan, Amir Ullah Khan, Venkatanarayana Motkuri, Abdul Shaban and Anjana Diwakar shows that 71.2% of Muslims above 15 years age are illiterate or educated below the primary level, he said. It also said 48.05% of Muslims households were landless and per capita consumer expenditure among Muslim households was ₹752 compared to the national figure of ₹988. The proportion of regular wage employment of Muslims in UP is 25.6%, migration at 51% is the highest among Muslims in UP, Owaisi said.The Sachar Committee, Kundu Committee and the Rangnath Mishra Commission had earlier submitted reports on the miserable condition of Muslims in the country but governments overlooked these reports, he said. Injustice has been done to Muslims by successive governments in UP, he said, alleging the community was deliberately kept backward as political parties wished to use them as a vote bank.The AIMIM will seek a reply from its rival political parties on the plight of the Muslim community, Owaisi further said.“We will raise the demand for share of Muslims in power, administration and welfare schemes to improve their condition. We will also demand an end to injustice to Muslims,” he said. AIMIM will raise the issue of opening of more schools and banks in Muslim dominated areas across UP, he added. To check the large-scale migration of Muslims, the government should launch employment schemes and development projects, he said. 
07-01-2022||Delhi||Rain, strong winds in store for Delhi this weekend: Met||Delhi is likely to witness light to moderate thundershowers and winds blowing at a speed of 30-40km/hour on Saturday, the India Meterological Department (IMD) has forecast, and sounded a ‘yellow’ alert’.The IMD forecast said the maximum temperature may drop to 16-17 degrees Celsius on Saturday and the minimum may settle around 14 degrees, as the city is in store for yet another relatively warm night.Back-to-back western disturbances are not only bringing rain, but leading to an improvement in the air quality too, with Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) recorded in the ‘moderate’ category on Thursday, with a reading of 182, according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily 4 pm bulletin. The capital recorded the last moderate air day on October 26, 2021, when the AQI was 139.According to the IMD forecast, light showers are also likely in some parts of the capital on Friday night. “Delhi has seen two western disturbances in this short window. The first, which brought rain on January 5, impacted Delhi between January 3 and 5. The second western disturbance will impact the city between January 7 and January 9, hitting the peak on on Saturday,” said RK Jenamani, scientist at IMD.He added that this spell of rain is expected to be more intense than what hit the city on January 5. The city has recorded 9.2mm of early January rainfall. “There will be more rain, and the wind speeds could go up to 40 km/hr. Some parts of Delhi may also record moderate showers,” he said.A yellow alert is generally issued by the IMD, asking the general public to ‘be aware’ of a weather situation developing in the next 24 to 48 hours. It issues an orange alert to ‘be prepared and alert’ for a weather event and a red alert – the highest form of alert, asking the public to be prepared to ‘take action’ against a weather event.Delhi recorded a maximum of 20.3 degrees Celsius on Friday, one degree above normal, while the minimum was six degrees above normal, at 13.5 degrees Celsius. At the same time last year, Delhi had recorded a minimum as high as 14.4 degrees. During a western disturbance, the minimum temperature tends to rise, owing to clouds which do not allow the heat to escape at night, however, this also makes the days cooler.According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar), Delhi could even see ‘good’ air quality by Sunday, with a continued improvement in air quality expected in the next 48 hours, due to good winds and rain.“Prevailing weather with drizzle and rain spells are causing effective wet deposition and improving AQI. On 8th, it is likely to rain with high wind speeds, leading to further improvement of AQI to the ‘satisfactory’ or ‘good’ category due to wet deposition and strong dispersion,” Safar said in its bulletin on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rain-strong-winds-in-store-for-delhi-this-weekend-met-101641577787264.html

07-01-2022||Delhi||Two die as roof collapses in outer Delhi’s Begumpur||Two men were killed and two more injured when the roof of a house they were sleeping in collapsed in outer Delhi’s Begumpur in the early hours of Friday, the police said.One of the dead, Sonu Sharma, and the two injured, Anil and Pramod, were siblings. The police said while Pramod suffered head injuries, Anil escaped with relatively minor wounds. Both are expected to recover, said the police.The other deceased man was identified as 55-year-old Kedar Sharma.Pranav Tayal, deputy commissioner of police (Rohini), said the building was in a dilapidated condition, but the investigators were yet to identify the immediate trigger for the collapse. “We have registered a case of causing death due to negligence and are investigating,” said Tayal.Local residents told the police that the single-storey building was at least three decades old and pointed to waterlogging in its immediate surroundings, but the police haven’t found any visible impact to the building’s foundations. The room, about 10 square foot, was occupied by the three brothers who worked as daily wage labourers, and their friend Kedar, who worked as a carpenter. Atul Garg, chief of the Delhi Fire Services, said the collapse occurred a little after 4pm, upon which fire fighting teams were sent to the spot. Local residents recounted waking up to a loud sound of the collapse. They checked the collapse site to hear voices of some of the men trapped under the rubble and began rescuing them even as firefighters and the local police arrived at the scene to take over the operation.The four men were taken to Dr Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital where Sonu and Kedar were declared brought dead.No arrests have been made yet, and police are yet to identify people culpable for the collapse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-die-as-roof-collapses-in-outer-delhi-s-begumpur-101641577427127.html
07-01-2022||Mumbai||State reports 40,925 cases, no new curbs yet||Mumbai The Covid cases in Maharashtra rose to 40,925 on Friday, which was the highest tally since the previous high of 42,582 on May 13 2021. This surge in numbers prompted the state government to indicate that it may tighten enforcement measures, restrict non-essential services and impose a night curfew in Mumbai.The state also saw a marginally higher death count of 20, as against 13 mortalities on the previous day, though no fresh cases of the Omicron variant were detected. So far, 1,41,614 people have lost their lives to the virus.Mumbai led the tally of cases, followed by Pune city at 2,804 and urban agglomerations in the larger metropolitan region like Navi Mumbai (2,664), Thane (2,612), and Panvel (1,423). The state’s tally of active cases is 1,41,492.Dr Pradeep Awate, the state’s surveillance officer, said that the spike was expected to last for around three weeks before tapering. At present, the average positivity in the gold-standard RT-PCR tests was about 20 per cent for Maharashtra, with Mumbai city at over 25 per cent, and some districts like Ahmednagar at a lower three per cent. This average was expected to climb to 30 per cent. The cases in Mumbai and Thane, which was peaking faster than the rest of the state, are expected to decline sooner.Health minister Rajesh Tope warned that those not following Covid-appropriate behaviour may face punitive action and fines. He indicated that non-essential services could be restricted to an extent considering the rise in infections, and a night curfew may be imposed in Mumbai.“In Mumbai, we have already prevented a gathering of over five people at night. There should be no problem if non-essential services are restricted from 11 PM to 5 AM,” he added, stating that this proposal would be submitted to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. The health minister said that curbs could be imposed on non-essential activities to stem the spread of Covid, but stressed that local train services would not be restricted.“Restrictions regarding weddings and funerals are already in place, but they must be implemented stringently…the police and the district and municipal administrations shall be asked to take action. Our decision to fine those without masks will be implemented,” warned Tope, adding that “cases will be lodged if needed.”The caseload was rising due to the higher infection rate, but hospitalisation numbers and oxygen requirement was lower. “If the consumption of oxygen touches 700 metric tons (per day), and if 40 per cent hospital beds in Maharashtra are occupied, then a lockdown will be imposed in auto-mode,” said Tope, adding that at present, there was no such situation yet despite the growth.Talking about vaccinated teenagers between the age group of 15 to 17 years, Tope said, “I am appealing to these teenagers that if they want to protect themselves and others, they must understand that the norms are being tightened…f they want to go to a hotel, they cannot do so if they are not jabbed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/state-reports-40-925-cases-no-new-curbs-yet-101641577007196.html

07-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi monuments closed: Walk conductors call off tours||Among the last few public places that were open, until recently, were historical monuments in Delhi. These spots in the Capital witnessed a huge footfall on January 1. But now, according to the latest notice of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), they have been closed for public from January 6 to 20 or till the next order. An ASI official tell us: “Considering the surge in cases as a precautionary measure, all centrally protected monument will remain closed. Those who have made advance bookings will be refunded.” The Capital has more than 170 monuments under ASI, including Red Fort, Humayun’s Tomb, Safdarjung Tomb and Qutub Minar, which were reopened on June 16 last year, after remaining closed during the previously intense Covid waves. Calling it “a very good step seeing the rise in Covid cases”, author-historian Rana Safvi says, “Considering the amount of suffering that we have already experienced in the past two years due to Covid, I think it’s an excellent step to curb congregations — social, ritual, religious, academic, entertainment, political etc — and also to keep the monuments closed because some of the monuments see a huge footfall and it’s better to be safe.”This decision has led to the cancellation of many heritage walks and other such events. Abu Sufiyan, a city-based heritage walk conductor and founder of Purani Dilli Walo Ki Baatein, informs, “Considering the current rising case, many other community and heritage-based organisations have called off heritage walks, baithaks and micro tours in the city and around these monuments. I’m constantly in touch with friends who have got affected with Omicron (Covid variant), and their condition is not so good. Before things go out of hand, this is a wise decision.”And Asif Khan Dehlvi, heritage walk leader at Delhi Karavan, opines: “Monuments and heritage walks have been few of the places where people were able to unwind since the last two years. We had already reduced our heritage walk attendance numbers from about 50 people before Covid to 10-12 people in the Covid times. I had something big planned for the anniversary of Mirza Ghalib, which falls on December 27, but that was the time when Covid cases began to rise so had cancelled that, too. But we wanted to do something for the first weekend of the New Year. Not organising anything now.”“Since winters are the peak tourist season, and a time when most people step out to explore, most groups who run heritage walks or tours earn a major share of their livelihood during this time,” says Anas Khan, a Delhi-based blogger and heritage walk leader, adding, “Over the last two years, the frequent lockdowns and closing of monuments has affected the local tourism industry quite badly. However, with the current surge in cases, I think this move was necessary. The monuments remain quite crowded during the daytime especially on the weekends. The last weekend also saw a huge turnout in some of the main monument complexes like Qutab Minar, Red Fort, and Humayun’s Tomb. In such a scenario, it’s necessary for such action to be taken to avoid a further rise in infection... I have stopped the walks since last weekend, in view of the increasing cases and was already planning to organise virtual sessions instead of in-person walks.” Author tweets @siddhijainnFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-monuments-closed-walk-conductors-call-off-tours-101641576471642.html
07-01-2022||Lucknow||IIT Kanpur filed a record-breaking 107 patents in 2021||The Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, (IIT-K) filed 107 patents, including 97 national and 10 international, in the calendar year 2021, making it the highest number of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) ever filed by the institute by breaking its earlier record of 76 patents filed in 2019, said IIT Kanpur director prof Abhay Karandikar in a press release.Among the IPRs filed, the different IPR prospects included 62 patents, 15 design registrations, 2 copyrights, and 24 trademark applications along with 4 US patent applications. This was achieved despite the catastrophic impact of the second wave of the pandemic, he said.“IIT Kanpur has not only crossed a century in terms of patent filing in 2021 but has also reached a gross total of 810 IPRs over the period of time. With an exceptional technology transfer rate of 15.2% to industry partners from the total patents filed, the institute filed a record-breaking 107 patents in this calendar year,” prof Karandikar added.“This is quite an achievement for the institute and is also indicative of the fact that, despite the pandemic, IIT Kanpur has diligently driven structural initiatives strengthening translational and transformational research contributing to a self-reliant India,” he said.According to him, the patents included inventions ranging from MedTech to Nano technology. In view of the institute’s relentless contribution to the national efforts of mitigating the novel coronavirus pandemic, several Covid-related measures and inventions were protected through patent applications during the calendar year, he said.Two of the prominent inventions developed at IIT Kanpur are the reusable facemask consisting PVDF composite nano fibres and nasal spray formulation against Covid and related respiratory viruses.Moreover, the institute brought out some other inventions like methods for treatment of industrial wastewater and biodegradable magnesium-based alloys for orthopaedic applications in the healthcare field, to name a few, he said.The landmark of filing 107 IPRs was achieved with the presence of a supportive policy framework and synergistic teamwork at the IPR cell of the institute. The IP & Technology Transfer Office not only filed the highest number of IPRs but has also facilitated the highest number of technology transfer transactions, disseminating technologies from the institute laboratory to the assembly line of industries in the form of products, the director said.“The commercialisation activities at IIT Kanpur have witnessed a two-fold increase in revenues from IP licensing. The institute addressed the nation’s oxygen crisis during the second wave of Covid by developing and commercialising two types of oxygen concentrators by transferring the said technology to six different companies,” the press release said.The technology transfer was part of the Mission Bharat O2 project wherein thousands of oxygen concentrators were manufactured having capacity ranging from 10 litre per minute (LPM) to 500 LPM, an official said.Another prominent technology transfer that found mention in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech at the 54th convocation of IIT Kanpur, is the recently launched “Bhu Parikshak”— a portable, app-linked soil testing device that bears the potential to detect soil health within 90 seconds. “This device can be a milestone in revolutionising agricultural practices in the country,” he said.“The exceptional technology transfer rate of 15.2% to industry partners from the total patents filed and the record-breaking filing of 107 patents in 2021 bear testimony to the flourishing and dynamic R&D eco-system of the institute,” prof Karandikar said.

07-01-2022||Mumbai||Mumbai crosses 20k-mark, experts say tally inching towards peak of spike||Mumbai Mumbai’s case tally breached the 20,000-mark on Friday, with 20,971 fresh infections reported in the last 24 hours. With these figures, the city recorded the highest single-day spike for the third time this week.Taking into consideration the steady rise in cases, experts said that the city’s tally could be inching towards its peak and the Covid graph may have reached a saturation point owing to the high number of tests conducted. The experts also maintained that they need to wait for at least one more week to make a concrete conclusion on the intensity of the new variant.“With over 20,000 cases being reported regularly, we can say that we are at the peak of the spike. Cases may further increase by next week. The city has also reached a saturation point as laboratories are now overwhelmed with samples and it is taking more time than usual to get the RT-PCR test reports,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state Covid task force.“However, the key takeaway, for now, is that the demand for hospital beds is still not very high and most of the cases are mild. Also, we need to be safe with ourselves because the delta variant is still prevalent and most serious cases are because of the Delta,” Joshi added.“While the spread is similar to the characteristics of the Omicron variant, it is still too early to comment on the intensity. The cases had started to spike from December 20 and we will have to wait and watch the situation till January 15, because it usually takes the variant of a virus two-three weeks to show its actual symptoms,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, director of critical care in Fortis Hospital and member of the national Covid task force and Maharashtra Covid task force.Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal also said on Friday that the South African model showed that the cases peaked and began dropping after five-six weeks. Chahal said that Mumbai is already on the third week and after the next 10 days, the daily case tally may start to decline. At present, the active case tally in Mumbai stands at 91,731.Out of the fresh infections reported on Friday, 17,616 (84%) patients were asymptomatic. The city also reported six Covid deaths on Friday, taking the overall toll to 16,394.The daily positivity rate also declined by one per cent on Friday. With 72,442 tests done in Mumbai in the last 24 hours, the positivity rate stood at 28.94 per cent, while on Thursday, the positivity rate was around 29.90 per cent.Meanwhile, Dharavi also reported 150 cases on Friday, making it the highest-ever single day spike since the outbreak of the pandemic.Kiran Dighavkar, the assistant municipal commissioner from G/North ward, said that equal amount of cases are now being reported from both slum areas and residential towers.“We are doing maximum tests possible in a day. Even though the transmission rate of the spread is high, the symptoms are very mild and nearly 75 per cent of the overall active cases in Dharavi are asymptomatic. We are also transferring the patients who are unable to isolate themselves at their home to the institutional quarantine centres,” Dighavkar said.He also maintained that a general hospital in Dharavi has been converted into a Covid Hospital to meet the demand for beds.Suresh Kakani, the additional municipal commissioner and in charge of public health, said that the pattern of spread is still fluctuating and it’s too early to say if the daily case tally has reached the maximum point.“We are getting 15,000 plus cases from the last three days and the difference between Thursday’s case tally and Friday’s case tally is not very high. The pattern needs to be still watched closely in case the daily case figures start fluctuating again,” Kakani said.Meanwhile, the figures also showed that 1,395 patients were hospitalised in the last 24 hours, due to which the bed occupancy in Mumbai also increased by 2 per cent during this period. On Friday, with 6,531 beds occupied out of the 35,645 beds, the occupancy rate stood at 18 per cent, while on Thursday the occupancy was around 16 per cent.To ensure more Covid beds are available in Mumbai, the BMC on Friday shut all the OPD facilities in the Balasaheb Thackeray Hospital (Trauma Care Centre) at Jogeshwari and converted it into an entire Covid Hospital.“More than 80 per cent of the beds are vacant. At present, we have 35,000 beds activated and if the need arises, the bed capacity could be increased to one lakh,” said Kakani.Dr Mangala Gomare, the executive health officer in the BMC, said that the civic body is equipped to tackle the surge and there are enough beds in the city.“In the recent guidelines, we have also increased the duration of home isolation. This will also help us manage beds more efficiently,” said Gomare.He further added that many of the beds are occupied by international passengers during their isolation period and other high-risk contacts. The recovery rate in Mumbai stood at 87 per cent, with a total of 8,490 patients discharged on Friday, taking the total number of recovered patients to 7,64,053.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-crosses-20k-mark-experts-say-tally-inching-towards-peak-of-spike-101641574906927.html
07-01-2022||Chandigarh||Covid surge: Amid Omicron scare, Punjab awaits genome sequencing reports||Amid fears of the new variant Omicron driving the third wave of Covid-19 pandemic across India, the Punjab health department is left waiting for genome sequencing reports of positive samples to establish the dominant variant.So far, only seven Omicron cases have been confirmed in Punjab, even as the state has seen a massive surge is infection and positivity rates in the past couple of weeks.The Punjab government in December inaugurated the first state-run Covid-19 whole genome sequencing laboratory at the Government Medical College, Patiala, but still samples are being sent to Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (VRDL) labs in New Delhi, which are already overburdened.Reason: Most of the employees at the Patiala lab, including its in-charge Dr Rupinder Bakshi, tested positive last week, according to a state health official, who did not wish to be named. Due to this, as many as 95 samples are pending for testing at the lab, while another 140 reports (including of international travellers) are awaited from Delhi. Usually, it takes around five to six days for the reports to come, but there has been up to three-week lag, said the official. At present, the health department is focusing on international returnees and sending the samples of all of them testing positive for genome sequencing, said Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, state nodal officer for Covid-19.Meanwhile, only 10-15% of samples of others testing positive in the state are being sent for genome sequencing on random basis. Dr Bhaskar said the delay is on the part of New Delhi labs as the state department is completely dependent upon them for genome sequencing. “Moreover, the laboratory in Patiala is overloaded and is presently working with fewer staff,” he said.Director, health, Punjab, GB Singh said labs have been asked to speed up testing, so that Omicron cases could be detected at the earliest. “Seeing the manner in which the infection is rising in the state, the prevalence of Omicron cannot be ruled out,” he said.
07-01-2022||Chandigarh||Covid: 172 more Italy returnees test positive at Amritsar airport||The Punjab health department has ordered a probe into Covid-19 testing being conducted by a private laboratory at Sri Guru Ram Das Jee International Airport in Amritsar after 172 more Italy returnees were found positive on Friday, taking the total to 297 in two days. The inquiry was necessitated seeing the huge numbers and questions raised by passengers on the veracity of tests, said officials. All 285 passengers who landed at the airport on a EuroAtlantic Airways flight chartered by SpiceJet from Italy, an “at-risk” country, underwent RT-PCR testing on their arrival on Friday. Of them, 172 were found positive for Covid-19, said airport director VK Seth. This happens a day after 125 out of 179 Italy returnees on another chartered flight had tested positive for Covid-19, leading to chaos at the airport and posing a major quarantine challenge to the authorities. However, no such chaos was reported on Friday. “As passengers have tested positive for Covid-19 in such a huge number on second consecutive day, it has raised a question on their testing procedure. In view of this, we have decided to conduct tests of 75 passengers again and probe the lab,” said Amritsar civil surgeon Dr Charanjit Singh, who ordered the inquiry. All +ve returnees quarantined Meanwhile, three of Thursday’s 13 positive returnees who belong to Amritsar district got admitted to the quarantine centre at Guru Nanak Dev Hospital on Friday. The remaining 10 are isolated at home, said a government spokesperson. All those who testing positive on Friday were allowed to isolate at home under the surveillance of the health department’ teams. After the positive returnees had left for their homes on Thursday in violation of rules, the Amritsar deputy commissioner had warned of booking them under the Epidemic Act and Disaster Management Act if they fail to comply by Friday. 
07-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: AAP Punjab co-incharge faces protest over ticket distribution in Jalandhar||The brewing discontent among the Aam Aadmi Party cadre of the Jalandhar unit took an ugly turn on Friday after the party’s Punjab affairs co-incharge and Delhi legislator Raghav Chadha was shown black flags over ticket allocation for the upcoming Punjab assembly polls. Former AAP district chief Shiv Dyal Mali along with his supporters as well as aides of Dr Sanjeev Sharma, both of whom were ticket aspirants from two different segments in Jalandhar, reached the local Press Club where Chadha was to induct Congress leader Dinesh Dhall and others into the party. The protesters showed black flags to Chadha when he arrived at the venue and blocked the front gate, forcing the AAP leader to enter the club through a rear gate.Mali, a long associate of the party, was denied ticket from Jalandhar West in favour of former BJP leader Sheetal Aungral, who had joined the AAP a few days ago. Sheetal has also been facing serious criminal charges. Similarly, Dr Sanjeev Sharma, who unsuccessfully contested the 2017 polls from Jalandhar Central and was working in the segment for the past five years, was denied the ticket as the party picked Raman Arora instead. Supporters of Mali and Sharma continued to protest throughout the event, and followed Chadha till his car after the event and showed him black flags. Later, a scuffle broke out between supporters of Dhall and Mali on the Press Club premises, but police intervened timely. Mali said that he had come to the venue to question Chadha on why the party denied ticket to a volunteer and chose a candidate with “notorious criminal background”. He also accused Chadha of striking deals over the distribution of tickets for the polls. He said the Delhi leadership is forcing parachute candidates on the Punjab cadre, and it would bear the brunt of ignoring its volunteers.Even in Banga segment of the neighbouring SBS Nagar district, there is discontent among the AAP cadre after the party gave the ticket to Kuljit Singh Sarhaal, son of former MLA Balwant Singh Sarhaal. Meanwhile, Chadha remained unavailable for comment.

Nineteen farm organisations had floated the SSM, two weeks ago on December 25, to contest the Punjab polls, the announcement of which could come any day now.“We want to reassure ourselves by going to our cadre and the farmers. We want to know how many candidates the SSM has in a winning position,” said Harmeet Singh Kadian, president, BKU (Kadian), adding that a five-member committee had been formed to submit a report to the SSM after conducting a field survey. BKU (Kadian), based in Ludhiana, was the driving force in formation of the SSM and had also called upon other unions to join the political outfit and take on mainstream political parties. Now, Harmeet says, “The SSM is not a purely a political body, but could act as pressure group.” The committee, according to Kadian, will take seven-eight days to submit its report after holding meetings at the block and district levels in 18 districts of the state, where the farm body has a solid support base. Other than the farm bodies that had announced taking the electoral plunge last month, there are five other organisations, which are fence sitters. These bodies can be divided into two major ideological categories, the Left-oriented and the moderates.“We will analyse whether the SSM can take a political plunge or not? What is the mood among the state peasantry, our major support base. Are people from other sections willing to join the SSM? What is the political scenario, particularly, when a 4-5 cornered contest is on the cards. We will present a report to the SSM on these issues,” said Kadian. BKU (Dakounda), till now a fence sitter, is holding a meeting of its cadre in Barnala on Monday (January 10). In addition to the political scenario, it will also discuss farmers’ demands that the Centre is yet to respond upon.

The three belong to the same village as the victim. We are conducting raids for further arrests. We will not reveal the identities of other named accused as it could affect their arrests.”On Tuesday, Sanju Pradhan, in his 30s, was allegedly lynched by a mob of locals at Besrabazar village in Simdega district, accusing him of being involved in the illegal felling of trees and trading stolen wood.Sources in the police department said the three arrested were identified as Lorhe Pradhan, Tripati Pradhan and Maheshwar Pradhan. “These three had alleged that the trees that Sanju had cut belonged to them,” said a police officer.A day after the gruesome lynching of Sanju, his wife Sapna Devi alleged that her husband was killed by the mob in presence of policemen who did nothing to save her husband despite her repeated requests.BJP demands probe, action against copsA BJP delegation led by legislature party leader Babulal Marandi visited Sanju’s family at his village. Marandi said that the crime was a part of a conspiracy and innocent people have been arrested in the case. “This entire issue of tree cutting is an eyewash because that issue was stepped last year itself. There is a deep-rooted conspiracy. The entire crime happened in front of the police. They have now arrested members of the victim’s own family. He has been killed as he had raised his voice against the illegal activities of some people here. We demand action against the Simdega SP and Kolebira police station in charge,” said Marandi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/three-of-13-named-accused-held-in-simdega-lynching-case-101641572392218.html
07-01-2022||Mumbai||71% of current active Covid cases in Thane concentrated in 3 wards alone||The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has reported 2,442 new cases on Friday, a 12% increase from Thursday. As per the data submitted by the civic body, around 71% of the total active cases are concentrated in three wards – Majiwada-Manpada, Vartak Nagar and Uthalsar – with Majiwada-Manpada contributing to over 41% of the active cases.The civic officials also informed that over 91.73% of the active cases are in home quarantine and merely 9% to 10% require hospitalisation so far. The city at present has 10,086 active cases while the doubling days are now 81. An officer from the health department said, “Most of the positive cases are from these three wards mainly because the Majiwada-Manpada and Vartak Nagar wards comprise areas like Ghodbunder, Pokhran and Manpada that have many high-rise buildings. Here, people travel a lot for work. Moreover, the population of these wards is also high. We have over eight health centres in Majiwada-Manpada ward alone. Uthalsar, though does not have high rises, our testing lab is located here and that could be the reason.”He added that while samples were still being given for genome sequencing, it will soon stop as most of the cases are now of the new variant as per the symptoms. “It also does not mean that the Delta variant is suppressed. We have severe cases of this variant too, but we have to follow the same protocol in both variants.”Dr Tejas Ghude, pulmonologist, Thane, said, “The cases are more in areas where people have a travel history. A lot of people from the high-rises travel not only internationally but also to different states in India. We have patients who are positive after travel history to Delhi or Kolkata. The infection rate of the new variant is high, so even if one person travels, the entire family is infected and the cases in that particular area increases.” He added that contract tracing is the key to curb the rise in these particular areas. He said, “By tracing more and more positive cases and isolating them in time, we can curb the surge.” The civic chief has requested people to get vaccinated, wear masks and observe social distancing. In a statement released, Dr Vipin Sharma, TMC commissioner, said, “The vaccination drive in the city is going on at 78 centres. We have vaccinated 25.36 lakh people so far. The current wave has proved that vaccination is the only effective way to fight the virus.”Sandeep Malvi, additional municipal commissioner, added that around 91% of the people are home quarantined. He said, “Out of the 4,725 beds, merely 834 are occupied while 3,891 are vacant as per the data on January 7. Over 9,252 people out of the 10,086 active cases are in home quarantine as they have mild symptoms.” Talking about the increase in home quarantine compared to the second wave, Ghude added, “Most cases are symptomatic. However, over 91% have mild symptoms as the new variant is comparatively less severe. There are, however, few cases that are severe, which might be infected with the Delta variant. Moreover, the severe cases also include those who are not vaccinated, old or have comorbidities.”Unlike the first and second waves, there are very few cases with shortness of breath of reduced oxygen level, Ghude said. “Most patients we see since the last two weeks have symptoms like headache, throat ache, dry cough that advances to wet cough, fever, fatigue, diarrhoea and vomiting.”

As videos went viral on social media showing a group, including a woman, thrashing and abusing the man, chief minister Hemant Soren directed Dhanbad deputy commissioner to conduct a probe and take appropriate action. In the video, the man is seen being forced to do sit-ups, lick the road after spitting on it, besides being slapped and kicked by the group, even as he is heard saying repeatedly he was a Muslim. The man was beaten allegedly for abusing party leaders. “Dhanbad DC should probe the incident and revert with action taken report. There is no space for animosity in the state where people love to live in peace,” the CM said in a tweet, in response to a Twitter post on the incident. The victim has been identified as Zeeshan Khan, resident of Shamsher Nagar in Wasseypur in Dhanbad. His younger brother Rehan Khan told Hindustan Times that Zesshan was mentally unstable and is under treatment at Central Institute of Psychiatry in Ranchi. “Only three of us live in our home. Both me and my mother have private jobs. We were out when my brother left home. He has returned home after the incident. Though we are yet to decide on lodging a formal complaint, but they should not have done what they did. Even if he abused them, they could have handed him over to police,” said Rehan. BJP legislator from Dhanbad, Raj Sinha, who was present at the protest, said the incident should be probed in entirety. “This man came in front of us and started abusing our state president taking his name. We asked him to leave. I don’t know what exactly happened with him after the party workers pushed him away from where we were sitting. However, it needs to be probed whether this entire thing was a conspiracy. Otherwise why would anyone just come and start abusing us,” said Sinha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/video-of-mob-thrashing-muslim-man-goes-viral-soren-orders-probe-101641572206759.html

07-01-2022||Patna||1/3rd of PSA oxygen plants under PM Cares in Bihar face teething problems||More than one-third of the 62 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen generation plants installed in government facilities of Bihar under the Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations (PM Cares) fund are facing operational issues, a month after their commissioning, officials privy to the matter said. As many as 44 of the total 119 PSA plants commissioned in the state so far, against the total of 127 planned, were non-functional on Friday during an audit by the state health department. At least 55% of the 44 non-functional PSA plants are from the PM Cares fund, said officials quoted above. Seven of the faulty 24 PSA plants under PM CARES face oxygen purity issue, six have leakage problem, two have encountered zeolite problem (it absorbs nitrogen and separates oxygen from atmospheric air) and white dust issue in their oxygen tanks, two need replacement of auto changeover (required to maintain uninterrupted supply of oxygen in event of power failure), one has pressure issue, while six others face ignition problem, compressor, stabiliser, alarm, suction jar and valve issues. “The figure is dynamic and likely to change every day. The Centre is monitoring the performance of the PSA plants on a daily basis and has asked the vendors of Central agencies, which installed them, to urgently attend to the snag,” said an official. The 500 LPM (litres per minute) PSA plants at subdivisional hospitals (SDH) Benipur in Darbhanga district and Narkatiaganj in West Champaran, 1,000 LPM plants at subdivisional hospital Buxar and the sadar (district) hospitals of Khagaria, Munger and Siwan, 2,000 LPM plant at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, face oxygen purity issue, said the official. The SDH Benipur plant reported the lowest oxygen purity level of 65% while the SDH Narkatiaganj plant had 89%. As per Centre’s guidelines, PSA plants need to maintain a minimum oxygen purity level of 93% with a variation of plus or minus 3%, said officials aware of the matter. The 1,000 LPM PSA plant at Darbhanga Medical College Hospital (DMCH), 500 LPM plant at the SDH Tekari in Gaya district, 200 LPM plant at SDH Tarapur in Munger district, 1,000 LPM plant at district hospitals of Purnia and 200 LPM plant at Sheohar, and the 250 LPM plant at SDH Vikramganj in Rohtas district have leakage in either their medical gas pipeline system (MGPS) or oxygen tanks, said the officials. The SDH Mahua plant at Vaishali district has pressure issues. A PSA plant has to maintain 4-6 bar oxygen pressure. The desired level of oxygen pressure, prescribed at hospital bed of patient is 4.2 bar, as per the Centre’s guidelines. The PSA plants at SDH Pusa and Jagdishpur in Bhojpur district require replacement of auto-changeover. Of the 62 PSA plants under PM Cares in the state, the DRDO has installed 44, the HLL Infra Tech Services Limited (HITES) and the Central Medical Services Society (CMSS) nine each. Only 79 of the 119 PSA plants available in the state were found to be fully functional during a mock drill on December 23. As many as 14 PSA plants, including those at the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College Hospital, Bhagalpur, and the Government Medical College, Bettiah, had reported oxygen purity issues. These also included a few PSA plants at Bhojpur, Darbhanga, East Champaran, Gaya, Lakhisarai, Madhepura, Madhubani, Munger, Nalanda, Purnia, Rohtas and West Champaran districts. Twelve PSA plants, including in Araria, East Champaran, Gaya, Gopalganj, Katihar, Khagaria, Madhubani, Nalanda, Purnia, Saharsa and Bhagalpur districts, have reported leakage. There were pressure issues in 15 PSA plants, including some installed at Bhojpur, Gaya, Kaimur, Kishanganj, Lakhisarai, Madhepura, Madhubani, Munger, Nalanda, Purnia, Rohtas and West Champaran districts. A Central team had recently noted that ill-trained personnel were running the PSA plants in government facilities of the state. “We are hiring trained personnel from the Industrial Training Institute (ITI) to operate the PSA plants. They have already begun joining their place of posting and all of them should be in place by next week,” said an official of the health department who requested anonymity. “We will not allow oxygen supply to hospital bedside through any PSA plant which does not conform to the prescribed purity level prescribed by the Centre,” he said. Only six of the 62 PSA plants under PM Cares and seven of the 60 PSA plants of the state government or those put up by private and public sector firms under corporate social responsibility, have diesel generator sets as back-up for power supply. The state government on Thursday issued orders for installation of diesel generator sets against each PSA plant, the officer said. The PSA plants, which generate oxygen from gases in the atmosphere, have been installed at medical colleges, district hospitals, subdivisional hospitals and community health centres to tide over the oxygen crisis, as the Delta and Omicron variants of Covid-19 loom in the apparent third wave of the coronavirus. Bihar has scaled up its oxygen capacity to 448 metric tonnes against its assessed oxygen requirement projection of 377 metric tonnes during the peak active cases last year. Of this, 140 metric tonnes will be generated through 122 PSA oxygen generation plants and 308 metric tonnes of oxygen can be stored in cryogenic liquid medical oxygen tanks at 10 state-run medical college hospitals. The state has 15,178 total available beds against a total bed capacity of 19,383 for management of Covid-19 patients. Of these, 12,000 beds have oxygen supply through centralised pipeline, said senior state health officials. The Centre had allocated Bihar a daily quota of 214 metric tonnes of medical oxygen, but it was able to lift only 167 metric tonnes because of logistic issues in the first week of May last year. The state’s maximum oxygen requirement was then assessed at 240-250 metric tonnes, said the official quoted above. This led to one of the worst medical oxygen crises during the peak of the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic between April and May last year when the Delta variant claimed many lives. Meanwhile, union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan reviewed the preparedness status of oxygen infrastructure, including PSA plants, oxygen concentrators and oxygen cylinders, ventilators with states and union territories on Friday.

The Shakuntala Amir Chand Prize recognizes significant contributions to biomedical sciences and clinical research by young scientists and was instituted by (late) major general Amir Chand in the memory of his daughter in 1953. Chandra has been selected for developing several simple hand-held bio-sensing devices that can detect bio-molecules like alkaline phosphatase, cancer biomarkers, drugs etc in complex biological fluids. All such targets have a tremendous role in disease diagnosis and analyzing therapeutic interventions in pathological laboratories globally. “The bio-electronic device is palm sized and very handy for the onsite detection of molecules in miniaturized settings. Such devices can be deployed in hospitals and also be used in personalized settings,” said Chandra and added that the system is ultrafast and able to give readout signals in a short span of time compared to other conventional methods. IIT-BHU director prof Pramod Kumar Jain congratulated Chandra and said such devices can be of use for the common man and assist toward improving human health. “Such devices falls under the visionary national missions of “Make in India” and “Start-up India” of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and can compete with other similar imported devices. Several such devices and advanced analytical systems are under development at IIT-BHU. A team of researchers led by Dr Chandra has already filed the patent through IIT-BHU and the goal is to bring them to the market in coming years,” Jain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/iitbhu-assistant-professor-bags-icmr-prize-for-biomedical-and-clinical-research-101641568306551.html

Along with his two family members, he has now tested positive with the Omicron variant.On December 17, a family of four – a couple and their two children – came back from Kenya. Accordingly, Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation got the list of travellers and they went to their home to conduct their tests.The department took their sample for RT-PCR and Omicron tests but before the report came, the family went for a trip. On December 21, they tested positive while the genome sequencing detected Omicron variant in the couple and the son whereas the daughter was only Covid positive. When the corporation officials went to their home to check their quarantine facility, they found that the family had gone for a trip.A Vithalwadi police officer said, “The corporation officials called the man and asked them to self-quarantine wherever they are but later, through some investigation, officials found the family has been roaming around Vaishno Devi, Amritsar and other tourist places without following any pandemic rules. They returned on December 31 and still continued to do the same. Therefore, the corporation officials came to file complaints against the family member.

Because it must not have happened in history that the PM of a nation would have to address 500 people, where arrangements had been made for 70,000,” he said at a press conference at the Punjab Congress Bhawan, supporting his own government which is under fire for the unprecedented security breach. He was accompanied by Congress national spokesperson and media in-charge for Punjab elections Alka Lamba.The PM’s cavalcade was stuck on a flyover on the Moga-Ferozepur highway for 15-20 minutes during his first visit to poll-bound Punjab in almost two years on Wednesday, as protesters blocked his route. The Union home ministry has promised action for the security breach, and the BJP has accused the Congress of conspiring to put the PM in harm’s way. The Charanjit Singh Channi-led Congress government has repeatedly denied any security lapse.Accusing the BJP of playing dirty politics, Sidhu said their attempt to put the onus of the entire security on Punjab Police was not correct because there are 10,000 persons of the Special Protection Group (SPG), IB, RAW and other agencies who are involved in the PM’s security paraphernalia and the state police takes instructions from them. There was no plan for the PM to travel by road, how it was changed suddenly, he asked, stating that their (BJP’s) attempts to defame the state would not succeed.The Congress leader said the BJP has no vote or support in Punjab, adding that this is why they are trying to defame the state, and fight elections in Uttar Pradesh and other states and reap political benefits. “Wherever the BJP does this drama, issues get sidetracked. Has anyone talked about unemployment, agriculture or future of the next generations for four days?” he asked. Sidhu added that all those seeking President’s rule in Punjab are parrots like former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, who says what the BJP asks him to say.Capt Amarinder has floated own party, Punjab Lok Congress, after quitting the Congress and has entered into an electoral alliance with the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/security-lapse-bjp-enacting-drama-to-escape-low-ferozepur-turnout-sidhu-101641567046439.html

07-01-2022||Mumbai||BMC to resume Coastal Road work as fishers remain staunch in opposition||Mumbai Officials in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) coastal roads department on Friday said that they will resume work on the disputed interchange between the Coastal Road and the Bandra-Worli Sea Link in south Mumbai. Construction of the same has been stalled on at least 10 occasions since October 30, by protesting fisherfolk, who maintain that the interchange, if built as per current design specifications, will cut them off from their traditional fishing grounds.This development follows on the heels of a meeting on Thursday between representatives of two registered fishing societies in Worli Koliwada, state environment minister and MLA from Worli Aaditya Thackeray, fisheries minister Aslam Shaikh, BMC commissioner Iqbal Chahal, additional municipal commissioner Ashwini Bhide, industries minister Subhash Desai, and transport minister Anil Parab.Vijay Nighot, chief engineer (coastal roads department), who was also present during the meeting, said, “We had a very fruitful discussion with the fishers led by Aaditya Thackeray, and they are ready to cooperate with us. It has been agreed that the BMC will start construction on pillar numbers 1 to 5 of the interchange and that the fisherfolk will suggest experts independently review their grievances within 15 days. We will examine that report and take a call regarding their navigation route issue. Our jack-up barge has been moved to the construction site today to resume the work.”Fisherfolk, however, gave a contrary view of Thursday’s meeting. In a written response to the BMC via their legal representative, the Worli fishers have expressed further disappointment at the state government’s approach to their demands, which include a span of at least 200 metres under the proposed interchange, as opposed to the BMC’s designs which provide a span of only 60 metres. “My clients reject the conclusion that seems to have been drawn by the MCGM from the meeting held on January 6 2022, that the MCGM should proceed with construction of five pillars, leaving the construction of some pillars in abeyance till further deliberation. Such consolations are not in favour of the community and a way of deflecting their demand,” wrote advocate Meenaz Kakalia to the BMC, adding that “No further work on the interchange should commence till a concrete decision about the navigation span is made by the Government.” BMC officials did not provide any comment regarding this statement.Nitesh Patil, secretary of the Worli Koliwada Matsyavyavsay Sahakari Sangathan, said, “In Thursday’s meeting, our words were twisted to imply that we are consenting to the BMC starting work again. Today, barges and tugboats have started moving in the area and several fishing nets have been damaged. We will take an assessment tomorrow and halt the work again if our demand for a redesign of the interchange is not agreed to.” Delays in construction of the interchange have cost the BMC at least ₹30 crore over two months. As per the 2021-22 BMC budget, the cost of this project is ₹12,950 crore including construction and other consultancy charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-to-resume-coastal-road-work-as-fishers-remain-staunch-in-opposition-101641565486111.html
07-01-2022||Mumbai||Clean, hygienic street food hubs to come up outside Vashi railway station||Soon, commuters and residents can enjoy clean street food outside the Vashi railway station as the CIDCO has undertaken to revamp the area.The Food Safety Standard Authority of India (FSSAI) has decided to set up clean street food hubs at different places of Mumbai, Thane, Mira-Bhayandar as well as Navi Mumbai. The popular eatery outside Vashi railway station has over 30 stalls and hundreds of people have food there on a daily basis. The FSSAI has chosen this eatery to turn into one such hub and has asked the local authorities to take care of the basic infrastructure. As the area belongs to CIDCO, they are now renovating that place to meet the standards set by the FSSAI.A senior CIDCO officer said, “The FSSAI officials initially explained their plans to the people working in the eatery and then conducted an online training programme last month. During the programme, they trained the people on how to cook hygienic food with less oil, sugar or salt, how to store and serve those at their stalls. Recently, FSSAI set up one such hub in Juhu, Mumbai, and reportedly it has received very good response from the people.“Meanwhile, they also asked us to take care of the cleanliness and basic infrastructure of that area. So, we are now changing the old paver blocks with new ones in the area between the station premises and the eatery. We have already repaired the old sewage lines and covered the uncovered parts. We have also put some umbrella-type structures where people can stand and have their food. If required, we will also do some minor paintings at some places.”The daily commuters and employees of the nearby offices say that this initiative would help thousands of people who have food at the eatery.Manish Tiwari, 37, who works at a nearby office, said, “Several people come and have breakfast, lunch or evening snacks at these stalls. Many of the stalls, however, do not follow the basic cleanliness rules. We also cannot protest as the options are limited. So, the initiative taken by FSSAI and CIDCO will ensure hygienic food for the people.”

This is very unfortunate”.Giani Harpreet Singh said that normally an act to kill unarmed and innocent civilians is considered terrorism, but “verbally targeting and vilifying any particular community is also a type of terrorism”.“Surprisingly, the government is not containing the elements indulging in spreading this kind of terrorism. Even some responsible persons have indulged in making such remarks and threatening the community to repeat 1984-like tragedies (anti-Sikh violence). This is not good in any way. This is kind of hate terrorism. The Government of India must rein in this kind of terrorism that is worse and more dangerous than ordinary terrorism in the world,” he said.The Akal Takht jathedar said that what happened with the PM has no link with Sikhs. “Yet, they are facing such vilification. Action should be taken against those behind it. They should be booked under sedition charges,” he said.Giani Harpreet Singh said that Sikhs were vilified even during the farmers’ agitation even as it was a dispute between farmers and the government. “Now, again Sikhs are being dragged into this fresh dispute, while it is one between two governments or political parties. The Union Government should pay attention to it,” he said, adding, “What happened with the Prime Minister should not have happened, because he is an honourable leader of the country. However, what is happening after it is worse”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sikhs-being-terrorised-on-social-media-after-pm-security-breach-akal-takht-jathedar-101641562126117.html
07-01-2022||Mumbai||Children make up 5% to 6% of Covid positive cases in Navi Mumbai: NMMC||The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation has stated that around 150 to 200 new Covid cases among children are registered daily. This is around 5% to 6% of the total positive cases.In this month so far, 683 paediatric cases were found positive. Presently, of the total 6,758 active patients, 433 are paediatric cases.Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) commissioner, Abhijit Bangar, said, “Compared to the second wave, there is a slight increase in the percentage of paediatric cases but overall percentage of 0-18 years age group remains less. But the absolute numbers of positive paediatric cases are indeed more.”The CIDCO Exhibition Centre-II facility is converted into a paediatric facility to isolate and treat the paediatric cases exclusively. “Though there are no critical paediatric cases, it is important for the children between 15 years and 18 years to get vaccinated. This third wave is a proof of how vaccination has helped in reducing the severity of the Covid cases even in patients with comorbidities,” a health officer from NMMC said. In the span of four days, NMMC has been able to vaccinate 36,356 youth aged between 15 years and 18 years. “The response from the youth is good and we expect a similar response even in the coming days,” the officer added.Of the 36,356 youth, only 560 of them opted to get vaccinated from private hospitals while the rest got their first jabs from the drive organised by the NMMC in 206 schools. A total of 72,823 children in this age group are expected to get jabbed by the corporation.Dr Vijay Yewale, member of Maharashtra paediatric task force and a practicing paediatrician in Navi Mumbai, said, “During the third wave, the Covid spread is faster than what it was during the second wave. Yet, the criticality of the cases and deaths reported are far less than what it was during the second wave. The reason behind it is only vaccination. Almost 100% of the eligible population above 18 years in Navi Mumbai have received their vaccination. But now, even those above 15 years can get vaccinated and every child in that age group should get their jabs. The vaccine is extremely safe, just like other vaccinations. No vaccine is ever recommended to the public without being sure that it is safe. There is no reason for anyone to have any kind of doubts or suspicions regarding the vaccine and even if anyone faces any doubt, they should get in touch with their respective doctors.”Dr Upendra Kinjawdekar, National President of Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP) and a practicing doctor from Navi Mumbai, said, “Every child is being vaccinated right from the birth in a time-bound manner for various diseases. After various trials and ensuring the safety, the vaccine is now permitted for above 15 years as well and in Navi Mumbai, apart from the schools, it is also available at mobile vans totally free of cost. Every parent should encourage their eligible child to take vaccination.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/children-make-up-5-to-6-of-covid-positive-cases-in-navi-mumbai-nmmc-101641561469398.html
07-01-2022||Mumbai||Alumni of Mahatma Gandhi School in Ambernath make Maths easy and fun to learn||To make Mathematics easy and fun for school students, the alumni of Education Society’s Mahatma Gandhi School in Ambernath have set up a Mathematics laboratory in their school.The lab is equipped with several geometrical shapes, models, measuring units, weights and blocks that can aid the students and teachers in learning or teaching the subject. It also has a digital board for the teachers. The lab, gifted by the alumni of the 1977 batch, will be useful for students of Classes 1 to 10. The laboratory is gifted in the memory of Bharat Karmarkar, who had passed out from the same batch. He taught Mathematics to children of different villages till the end and used money from his own pockets for the same. The batch has also named the laboratory after their 1977 batch Mathematics teacher, PK Chaudhari, 80, who they claimed made the subject easy for them. Owing to him, most of them had taken Mathematics for their further studies and did PhD in the subject and have become Maths professors.Ashok Kulkarni, 65, one of the alumni, said, “We thought of this concept after we lost Karmarkar, who had dedicated his entire life for the subject. He educated the children of different villages in the state and ensured that everything he earned was spent on education. He only kept the bare minimum of his earnings that helped his wife and him to survive. Mathematics was his favourite subject. All of us together collected ₹5.66 lakh for the laboratory.”The group had another Mathematics teacher, a PhD graduate, who started working on the plan for the lab before the pandemic. Kulkarni added, “It took us three months to set up the lab. We got all the different weights used to weigh groceries, vegetables, food and some old measures used to weigh kerosene and milk. We also got measuring tapes, blocks, several different geometric shapes and models for the students to develop interest in the subject.” The group conducted a few workshops with the school teachers and formulated written and digital projects for them. The projects also focussed on tricks to solve the major problems easily and are very innovative. One room of the school is completely dedicated for this laboratory. A digital board consisting of Maths learning videos will help children to try different ideas to learn this subject, he said. The school principal, Dr. Balasaheb Gaikwad and other teachers appreciated the efforts done by the 1977 batch. A school teacher said, “When they put forth the idea, we were not aware that it would be on such a large scale. Despite all of them from the batch being in their sixties, they used to wait here till late in the night to work on the projects. They have put forth 50 to 60 innovative ideas for several concepts that have made our work easy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/alumni-of-mahatma-gandhi-school-in-ambernath-make-maths-easy-and-fun-to-learn-101641559191533.html

07-01-2022||Mumbai||HC sets aside proclamation against Param Bir Singh’s co-accused Riyaz Bhati||Mumbai The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday set aside the proclamation by the magistrate court declaring Riyaz Bhati an accused of former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh in the extortion case, as an absconding accused on grounds of parity. Bhati’s counsel had relied on the HC order which set aside the written proclamation of another accused Vinay Singh based on which magistrate court had set aside the proclamation against Singh as well. The single-judge bench of justice Revati Mohite-Dere while hearing Bhati’s petition challenging the November 17, 2021 magistrate order which had directed issuance of a written proclamation that Param Bir Singh, Vinay Singh and Riyaz Bhati were absconding accused in the complaint filed by Bimal Agarwal, a hotelier and civic contractor. The Goregaon police had booked Singh along with Riyaz Bhati, Vinay Singh, Sumit Singh, Alpesh Patel and dismissed Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze as accused in the case. The magistrate had permitted the application by the Mumbai police to issue a written proclamation for the appearance of Singh as per section 82 of the CrPC. In his complaint, Agarwal had alleged that Singh along with Vaze had resorted to extortion, criminal conspiracy and common intention. Though initially the case was registered by Goregaon police station it was later transferred to the Crime Branch Unit XI of Mumbai police. Advocate Taraq Sayed, representing Bhati, informed the Court that a bench of justice S K Shinde on December 1 had passed an order setting aside the written proclamation by the magistrate court declaring Vinay Singh as an absconding accused as the same was not passed after following proper procedure as mandated under the CrPC. Sayed sought similar relief to Bhati who was similarly placed as Vinay Singh. On December 2, based on the HC order a magistrate court had cancelled the proclamation issued against Param Bir Singh. Special Public Prosecutor Shekhar Jagtap submitted an affidavit in reply by DCP, CID opposing the petition wherein it was conceded that the December 1 order of HC had not been challenged. The bench noted that as the December 1 order had not been challenged, the same would cover Riyaz Bhati too. The court noted, “The order publishing proclamation, being contrary to section 82 of CrPC, is accordingly quashed and set aside. The application is accordingly allowed and disposed of in aforesaid terms. Needless to say, that prosecution is at liberty to take steps in accordance with the law.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-sets-aside-proclamation-against-param-bir-singh-s-co-accused-riyaz-bhati-101641558465542.html
07-01-2022||Mumbai||No one has a fundamental right to a public holiday, says Bombay high court||MUMBAI: It is time to reduce public holidays in India rather than increase their numbers, the Bombay high court has observed as it rejected a petition by a resident of Dadra and Nagar Haveli to declare August 2 as a public holiday to commemorate its liberation from the Portuguese in 1954.“As it is, we have far too many public holidays in this country. Perhaps the time has come to reduce, not increase the number of public holidays. We do not see any substance in the petition. It is rejected,” a bench of justices Gautam Patel and justice Madhav Jamdar said on a petition filed by Kishnabhai Ghutia.To be sure, the central government, which has a five-day week, has 17 gazetted holidays including three national holidays, and 2 restricted holidays every year.Lawyers Bhavesh Parmar and Devmani Shukla, appearing for the petitioner, said the union territory administration discontinued the practice of declaring a public holiday on August 2 in 2021 and sought directions to reinstate the holiday.The lawyers also argued that if August 15 could be a public holiday to mark the nation’s Independence Day, there is no reason why August 2 should not be declared a public holiday for Dadra & Nagar Haveli.They also referred to an April 15, 2019 order of another bench of the high court which ordered the government to observe ‘Good Friday’ as a public holiday in the union territories of Diu, Daman, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, and not a restricted (optional) holiday.The high court ruled that the 2019 verdict stands on a different footing.“That PIL was about the failure to gazette i.e. make compulsory, a public holiday rather than keep it optional. Whether or not to declare a particular day as a public holiday or an optional holiday or no holiday at all is a matter of government policy. There is no legally enforceable right that can be said to have been infringed. Nobody has a fundamental right to a public holiday,” the two-judge bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-one-has-a-fundamental-right-to-a-public-holiday-says-bombay-high-court-101641555885446.html
07-01-2022||Chandigarh||PM security breach in Punjab: FIR against over 100 unidentified people in Ferozepur||The Ferozepur police have registered a case against unidentified persons for blocking the Ferozepur-Moga national highway and leading to the security breach during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Punjab visit on Wednesday. Also read: Security agency sounded out ‘grave threat’ prior to PM Modi’s Ferozepur rallyKulgarhi station house officer Birbal Singh said on Friday afternoon that an FIR was registered against more than 100 people. He declined to share any details. “We have instructions not to divulge any further details of the sensitive case. The matter is being probed. No person has been detained or arrested,” said the SHO. Even as the police registered a case against unknown persons, activists of the Bharti Kisan Union (Krantikari) on Wednesday evening claimed responsibility for stalling the movement of the PM’s convoy. Ferozepur range deputy inspector general Inderbir Singh and Ferozepur senior superintendent of police Harmandeep Singh Hans were unavailable for comment. The SHO evaded reply when asked if videos in the public domain are being taken into consideration to identify those who violated rules that led to Modi’s convoy being stuck on the flyover for 15-20 minutes. BKU (Krantikari) general secretary Baldev Singh Zira first owned responsibility of leading the dharna at Piareana village on the Moga-Ferozepur highway that blocked the PM’s convoy. In a video posted on social media on Thursday, the ultra-Left farmer union chief, Surjit Singh Phul, claimed that there were about 1,000 activists at the dharna. He admitted that the protesters did not allow BJP supporters’ buses to pass by to reach the rally that Modi was to address in Ferozepur. Some farmer unions lauded BKU (Krantikari) for stopping the PM, while others termed the blockade of his convoy “avoidable”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pm-security-breach-in-punjab-fir-against-over-100-unidentified-people-in-ferozepur-101641555165333.html
07-01-2022||Pune||Global Village Idiot: How to walk 5km... indoors||Monday was a disappointing day. A disappointing, disappointing day. All I did was walk 2.6-kilometre and that’s way below my average, way way below. And it wasn’t even a weekend.But let me start from the beginning. Every individual has an internal logic on various matters that they would have built since childhood, and they would have come to some decisions about life, living, learning, health, well-being ... as also fitness.I have never been into ‘fitness’. Never. As in there’s been no phase in my life where I was watching what I eat, pumping iron or steel, dancing to music to tone muscles, or walking round and round and back around to address a health issue, perceived or otherwise.Nor have I ever been a gym member.Well, once - or rather, one day in 1988 - my friend Satyan and I did walk into a gym near our colony in Santacruz, Mumbai. The then Mr Mumbai University was in that gym (great guy, also happened to be a family friend and lived in our colony). We looked at the toned muscles of everyone around, which while extremely impressive did not distract us from the hard, physical labour that seemed to be required to get those results. The instructor told us to do 20 push-ups each. I think we gave him 10 between us with take-it-or-leave-it exhaustion and he took it and asked us to do 10 pull-ups each. To which we responded with two - Satyan did one pull-up and I did the other one. We walked around a bit after that, flexed our forearms on a contraption and then we left, telling the gym owner we would think about joining.Satyan and I were satisfied with our visit to the gym and being quick on our feet, we looked ahead a few years and the decision was quite unanimous: there was no way either of us could sustain that kind of hard labour for no apparent reason (part of my internal logic).That was the only day I have ever spent in a gym for deliberate exercise.It’s not that I am reckless with my health. I played cricket and football and badminton and when there was no one to play with, ran around any available space at a clip for hours - every day ... and that’s how I stayed healthy: sports. So, while I couldn’t do five pull-ups in a gym, I was a rock climber, and dangling a few hundred feet above bleak Himalayan rocks always gave me a rush and a natural motivation to haul myself up to the top on fingerhold.If it wasn’t fun, I didn’t see the purpose of the hard work. Just as I didn’t see the purpose of being on a treadmill, walking 20 kilometres and not going anywhere. Plus, I have natural-born morbidity that always makes me ask: will I be able to do this when I am injured or crippled or older or closer to death but not quite there yet?In the recent two decades, I have had less opportunity for sports so I have been walking daily and also mountain-walking three or four times a year. Last two years I made no trips up any mountain and the year before (2019) I did only one trip, that too early in January. Till June, July that year there was hope there would be another trip. But by October it was clear that I wouldn’t be doing another one till 2020, so in November, I started monitoring my daily walk. That was before the pandemic.I walk a good bit every day because I enjoy walking, enjoy feeling the muscles at work, and out of sheer habit I walk with my whole body, stretching the muscles in my neck, shoulders, arms, chest, back, glutes, hamstrings, calf, feet and extending my joints, pushing them to do a little bit more than they are capable of.The health app on my phone informs me of the kilometres I walk every day, the number of steps I take. In general, I know the approximate distance I have walked from the fatigue or tenseness in my muscles. But the app helps me set and monitor a goal: In 2020 it was to walk a daily average of five kilometres (2019 was 3.6). I closed 2020 at 5.2 kilometres on average and set 5.5 kilometres as the goal for 2021. An ACL tear and subsequent surgery in July meant that I closed 2021 at an average of four kilometres per day. For 2022, I have set a goal to get back to the annual average of 5.2 kilometres.A few days ago, a friend asked me how I am walking five kilometres indoors, so here’s the long answer: I am a restless person and thanks to a few health conditions, I am incapable of sitting in one place or one position for more than ten minutes at a stretch. So, I get up and walk from one room to the other, or pace around the room or walk the terrace when I am on calls. (This is normal behaviour for me, even in the office or at home in regular, non-lockdown situations. It drives people mad and some have even asked me to stop pacing because it makes them dizzy).Calls are great for walking because I can walk 1-1.5 kilometres on a single call. A client call could give me three kilometres. The constraint of space is in the mind. Since the lockdown, I have set a routine and milestones, exactly as I would on a trek or a village to village walk - a kilometre before 9 am, another before noon, two more during evening playtime with the children and so on.But here’s the answer to the question that my friend wanted to but didn’t ask. It’s not about walking. Nor is it about keeping occupied or focused or sane. Being a restless person, I learned the hard way that the mind will keep me awake for days on end if I engage it all the time. It thrives on meaningful engagement. Which is what reading books or watching Netflix or interesting work does to me. The body must be tired and overworked beyond its daily capacity for my mind to switch off. And that’s what a day has always been about for me: to work mind and body to 10% beyond what they did yesterday. Any given day. Good day or bad day. That’s the focus. Why?Because even on disappointing days, it’s important to leave it all behind and get a good night’s sleep.Sanjay Mukherjee, author, learning-tech designer and management consultant, is founder of Mountain Walker and chief strategy advisor, Peak Pacific.

07-01-2022||Delhi||Weekend curfew in Delhi: Eateries feel the pinch||As Delhi witnessed a surge in fresh cases of Covid-19 infections, the Delhi government imposed a weekend curfew, starting this Saturday. The hospitality industry that had just managed to make a staggering recovery, is fearing the worst for their business due to the weekend curfew. Presently, restaurants and bars are allowed to open with 50% capacity with restricted timings. With the weekend curfew, many feel that it will have an unsettling impact to the badly hit industry. They are hoping to pursue rent waivers and get some support. Many are pinning the hopes on their outlets in Gurugram and Noida to keep the business afloat.“This is another blow to the industry. We were just recovering from our losses and this hit again is hard,” says Vikrant Batra, co-founder, Cafe Delhi Heights. “Partial restrictions just affects business badly as we operate with no support , no revenues and incur same expenses,” adds, Umang Tewari, founder, Local. Restaurateur Priyank Sukhija feels that restaurants are being singled out with night curfew and with weekend curfew it’s going to be worse.For Zorawar Kalra, director, Massive Restaurants, the priority for the industry has always been the safety of its patrons and colleagues and shall be fully abiding by the guidelines issued by the authorities, he says. However, he adds, “That being said, the restrictions such as the weekend lockdown will have a very unsettling and deep socio-economic impact on the already beleaguered industry that is the second largest employer of human capital in India. Already over the past two years there has been a permanent closure of 30% of all restaurants and 25% permanent loss of employment.”A few also plan to pursue rent waivers to the malls, and landlords and eventually take the decision of reducing manpower. Amit Bagga, co-founder, Daryaganj says, “Restaurants like ours which have high fixed costs and revenue share with malls, and commissions to aggregators will suffer major losses. We will have to reduce our manpower cost and also expecting a relief from our real estate partners as they did before.” Sukhija also adds, “Rent waivers will definitely be pursued and we are hopeful that landlords and large mall owners will lend adequate support so that this situation can be dealt with amicably.”The key players in the industry which is massively hit with the Covid-19 also want to appeal for restaurants to be exempted from weekend curfew. “The night curfew already hit our business. What we can request government is to let 50% occupancy still be preferred in restaurants and a little relaxation over weekends can be given,” says Udit Bagga, co-founder -OTB. Some eatery owners feel that the crowds will be moving to dine in at neighbouring states. “Gurugram is not very far whatever happens in Delhi is followed by the city,” says Udit Bhasin, co-founder. Another restaurateur adds, “The night curfew imposed in the city will let people go again to home delivers or spend weekends in Gurugram” says Mohit Ahuja, owner, of Shakespeare cafe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/weekend-curfew-in-delhi-eateries-feel-the-pinch-101641551565365.html

The Punjab government has also claimed that a first information report (FIR) has been registered against protesters who had blocked the PM’s convoy at the flyover. However, senior Punjab Police officials and the Ferozepur police are tight-lipped about the contents of the FIR.

A two-member panel led by Justice Mehtab Singh Gill (retd) and principal secretary, home affairs and justice, Anurag Verma, are looking into the lapses. The panel will submit its report within three days and the outcome will be shared with the MHA as soon as it is received, the status report said.

07-01-2022||Delhi||Delhiwale: Flight mode in CP||It is late morning. The N Block sky over Connaught Place is blue and sunny. The icy air is echoing with the peep-peep of traffic horns. Most of the pedestrians are walking down CP’s tunnel-like corridors with eyes firmly fixed on their mobile phones.Suddenly, a different kind of sound makes it to this placid world. As if it were a great fluttering of many feathers. Indeed, up in the sky, a huge dark cloud has surfaced — of pigeons flying along an imaginary arch. The birds soar above the busy road. After some moments, they retrace that arch, as if somebody abruptly ordered them to return along the same track. The cloud disappears as swiftly as it had appeared.The pigeons are now gathered on a gigantic road divider, hobnobbing around like New Year holiday-makers on a Goa beach. The only odd one in the great crowd is a solitary woman sitting on the tip of the divider. One of the birds is perched atop her head. Turns out that the woman runs a stall on the spot — she sells grains and other bird food. A scooterist stops by, purchases fistfuls of grains from the woman, and tosses them towards the pigeons. The birds fatten themselves on the free buffet, occasionally making deep gurgling sounds.Watching fellow citizens deal with their conscience by feeding urban birds is not rare. You see such scenes across Delhi. The breathtaking vision was that airborne parade of these birds. They repeat the act after a few minutes. As these birds climb high up in the air and start to fly forward along CP’s radial, their moving shadows run on the road directly underneath.For the best experience, a birdwatcher must lean against one of the sturdy columns that line the colonial-era corridor, and patiently wait, like an angler, for the procession of birds that punctuate the CP sky every now and then.The gap between the two flights though is frustrating — it can be very brief or very long (the photo above only managed to capture the tail-end of a flight, comprising a handful of lazy back-benchers). Meanwhile, more than ten minutes have passed and the pigeons haven’t taken off again. It is also fascinating to observe CP’s high-altitude architecture — Statesman House, American Center, Gopaldas Bhawan, the new multi-storey (Parsvanaths) that came up on KG Marg during the pandemic.Suddenly, the birds become a cloud and N Block again becomes ethereal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-flight-mode-in-cp-101641514869633.html

In the probe dated December 27, the deputy DEO Charanjit Singh said that though the teacher in question did tickle the minor female student, there was no “solid proof” of him harbouring “wrong intentions.” He also castigated the government school principal of not immediately alerting the department of the incident. As per the report, the incident took place on November 17, 2021, but the officials were informed after a month.Asked on what basis had the deputy DEO cleared the teacher of “wrong intentions” when he had apologised before a panchayat, Charanjit Singh refused to comment on the matter, and termed his probe “honest.”Ten days after a probe was marked to the deputy DEO, a member of the parents’ union had garlanded the DEO, Lakhvir Singh Samra, with slippers, triggering outrage among the teaching community, which had staged a protest demanding the culprit’s arrest. The teachers had also found support in the farmers who joined the protest outside the DC office. The union member, Rajinder Ghai, has been booked, but is yet to be arrested.A senior official, requesting anonymity, blamed the inquiry officer, who he said, had submitted a “diluted report.” “The DEO could not suspend the teacher or recommend a strong action against him to the higher authorities since he was not held guilty by the inquiry officer. Moreover, the DEO had already transferred the teacher and forwarded the inquiry report to his seniors for further action”, said the senior official.

07-01-2022||Delhi||Deadline to register kids for entry-level classes extended||Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday extended the last date for registration for admissions to entry-level classes in private schools by two weeks in view of the latest surge of Covid-19 cases in the city.The process of registrations for admission to entry-level classes — nursery, kindergarten, and Class 1 — for the 2022-23 academic session in private schools across the Capital began on December 15.Earlier, the last date for submission of forms was January 7 this year.“Keeping in view the prevailing Covid conditions, the last date for filing applications for admission in nursery/ entry level classes in private schools of Delhi is being extended for further two weeks,” tweeted Sisodia, who also holds the state education portfolio.Sudha Acharya, principal of ITL Public School in Dwarka, and the chairperson of the National Progressive School’s Conference, which has over 120 private Delhi schools as its members, said the extension will help those parents who cannot avail of online services.“Due to a surge in Omicron cases, some parents in the city might not have got the chance to submit forms [offline]. The extension will help them,” said Acharya.Bharat Arora, general secretary, Action Committee of Unaided Private Schools, called the extension “a welcome step”.Arora said that while many parents in the Capital were hesitant to register this year because of the uncertainty surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic, formal education could not be replaced.“All private schools are of the view that learning must continue irrespective of the situation. They must not miss this opportunity to get their child registered. We have tried our best to minimise learning losses in all sorts of challenging situations and will continue to do so. Formal schooling cannot be ruled out because of any sort of pandemic,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/deadline-to-register-kids-for-entry-level-classes-extended-101641514190892.html

07-01-2022||Delhi||Additional ₹50,000 aid for kin of Covid-19 victims in Delhi||Over 20,000 people who lost a family member to Covid-19 and have already received ₹50,000 as ex gratia under the Mukhyamantri Covid-19 Pariwar Aarthik Sahayata Yojna, will now be given an additional ₹50,000 each under the Delhi Disaster Response Fund.An official of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), which issued an order to this effect on Wednesday, said the ex gratia amount will be released to all eligible families without seeking any application as their eligibility and payment credentials are already verified. In one week, the payment may be disbursed to their bank accounts, the official said.Apart from that, any Delhi resident who loses or has lost a family member to Covid-19 and is yet to get any ex gratia can submit an application for ₹50,000 as assistance. Delhi now has two Covid compensation schemes -- one under the chief minister’s scheme and the other under Delhi Disaster Response Fund, each for a sum of ₹50,000.“In compliance of a Supreme Court order if November 29, 2021, fresh guidelines have been issued for release of ex gratia from the Delhi Disaster Response Fund (DDRF) to the next of the kin of a person who died of Covid-19,” a DDMA official told Hindustan Times.“Ex gratia assistance of ₹50,000 from DDRF will be released without calling for any fresh application in respect of all those cases in which compensation of ₹50,000 has been released by the districts under the Mukhyamantri Covid-19 Pariwar Aarthik Sahayata Yojna,” said a DDMA order issued on Wednesday.“Applicants are required to apply directly to the district magistrate concerned for Covid-19 death related ex gratia assistance and DDMA will release fund directly to the beneficiary after verifying the eligibility and other necessary criteria,” the DDMA order said.A link will be created on https://edistrict.delhigovt.nic.in/ to enable applicants to submit their application. The district magistrate offices will also accept hard copy applications from those applicants who are unable to apply on th e-district portal.In June 2021, the Supreme Court directed the National Disaster Management Authority to recommend guidelines for ex gratia assistance to kin of those who lost their lives to Covid-19. The order came against petitions seeking directions to the Central and state governments to provide ex gratia compensation under the Disaster Management Act (DMA) for Covid deaths.In December, the apex court sought information from the Delhi government and other states on the progress with regard to receiving applications and releasing payment under the scheme.In its order, DDMA outlined the fresh guidelines for release of ex gratia assistance from the Delhi Disaster Response Fund to eligible families.The guidelines say that for the purpose of considering a death as due to Covid 19, the person should have been diagnosed through a positive RT-PCR or other tests or clinically determined through investigations in a hospital or in-patient facility by a treating physician.Deaths occurring within 30 days from the date of testing Covid-19 positive or from the date of being clinically determined as a Covid-19 case will be treated as deaths due to Covid-19 even if the death takes place outside the hospital or in-patient facility.The patient who was admitted in the hospital and who continued to be admitted beyond 30 days and died subsequently of Covid-19 will also be treated as a Covid-19 death.A family member of the deceased who died by suicide within 30 days of being diagnosed as Covid-19 positive will also be entitled to ex gratia assistance of ₹50,000.An official, who did not want to be identified, said all claims will be settled within 30 days of submission of required documents and disbursed through Aadhaar linked direct benefit transfer procedure. “The central government contributes 75% to the Delhi Disaster Response Fund and the 25% is contributed by the Delhi government. It is a standing fund,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/additional-rs-50-000-aid-for-kin-of-covid-19-victims-in-delhi-101641513652784.html

07-01-2022||Chandigarh||Despite collecting ₹30-cr cow cess in four years, LudhianaMC fails to rein in stray cattle||Ludhiana Local residents and commuters have expressed their displeasure at the Municipal Corporation’s (MC) inability to curb the problems being faced on the roads because of the increasing number of stray cattle. Several rued the civic body’s failure to tie reflective tapes around the cattle, which pose a heightened risk for commuters in the foggy weather conditions.The civic body, which had collected around ₹30 crores as cow cess since January 2017, had bought 500 reflective tapes and initiated a drive to tie them around bovines in the month of October last year, but frequent commuters of Hambran road, Tajpur road, Jalandhar bypass, Dugri, BRS Nagar and neighbouring areas claim that no visible change has been witnessed at ground level.An official, requesting anonymity, said the work was carried out only for a few days under the drive.A resident from the vicinity of Bhamiyan road, Manjit Singh said a large number of stray bovines can be found in the locality and near the Jalandhar bypass area, making it difficult to see the cattle, especially in the fog. “Years have elapsed and a number of fatal accidents have also taken place, but the authorities have failed to find a solution for the problem,” he said.Citing the civic body’s failure to carry out the drive effectively, Gursharan Singh, another local resident, suggested that a private company be hired for the task. “The lives of residents are at risk, but the authorities are adopting an indifferent approach, which is condemnable. No one is held responsible for the accidents and neither any compensation is provided to the victims if any accidents take place,” he added.Speaking on the issue, the MC joint commissioner Ankur Mahindroo said the concerned veterinary officials had commenced another drive and reflective taps were being tied around the cattle. “I will check the status with the concerned officials and the drive will be intensified to tie tapes around the stray animals, while the department is working to find a solution to remove them from roads,” he added.MC struggles to find shelter for stray cattleThe civic body officials also complained about the amount of space required to build a shelter for the stray cattle, due to which agreements are being made with management of different gaushalas to shelter in exchange of a certain fee. As per reports, around ₹8 crore have been spent by the civic body on sheltering and upkeep of animals. The officials stated that last year, the civic body had established a shed in Burj Poway village for sheltering 150 cattle before adding that an additional 1500 cattle had also been put in different gaushalas across the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/despite-collecting-30-cr-cow-cess-in-four-years-ludhianamc-fails-to-rein-in-stray-cattle-101641513821760.html

According to the district probationary officer Atul Soni, who is in-charge of the women’s shelter, also known as Nari Niketan, the first death occurred on December 20, 2021.“An inmate Sunita (45) died on December 20, following which another inmate Aradhna (55) passed away on December 23. On December 30, a 25-year-old woman, identified as Priyanka, also passed away. All these deaths occurred at the district hospital where the women were admitted for treatment two-three days before their demise. On January 3, a 30-year-old woman identified as Ruby passed away at the women’s shelter,” said Soni.He added the women were admitted to the shelter home in the last six months and several attempts to reconnect with their family members had failed. Their post-mortem was conducted by police after which, their last rites were done.“According to the post mortem reports, while Sunita and Aradhna died due to heart attack, Priyanka died due to a prolonged illness and Ruby’s cause of death has been identified as tuberculosis,” said Gyan Singh, station house officer of Sector 24 police station, Noida.Soni added all the four women were designated as MR (mentally retarded) after their medical checkups during admission. “These women were mentally challenged and suffered from occasional bouts of seizures as well,” he said.The shelter home currently has 116 inmates, against a capacity of 150, and has 14 caretakers.

07-01-2022||Noida||Greater Noida: NGT asks authorities to end water pollution in urban villages||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has asked the Greater Noida authority, agencies monitoring pollution and the Gautam Budh Nagar administration to look into the issues of water pollution plaguing the urban villages in Greater Noida and take remedial steps to address the matter. The move comes after an environmentalist, advocate Akash Vashishtha, filed a plea before the NGT. The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 provisions are being violated by the Greater Noida authority, thereby contaminating the ground water and creating health issues, alleged the petitioner. “In view of above, let a joint committee of CPCB, state pollution control board, the Greater Noida authority, district magistrate Gautam Budh Nagar and secretary, urban development of UP, look into the matter and take remedial action,” said a bench headed by NGT chairperson Adarsh Kumar Goel, justice Sudhir Agarwal and expert member Dr. Nagin Nanda in an order delivered on January 4. The case will be heard again on April 8. The NGT said that the CPCB and the UPPCB will be the nodal agencies for compliance and coordination. “The committee may meet within two weeks, undertake visit to the site, interact with the stakeholders and ascertain the action plan for remedial action, if any. The action plan may cover septage management, sewerage plant with STP(s). The Committee may also identify the authorities responsible for the failure and action to be taken against the violators or erring authorities,” said the order.In 1992, the Uttar Pradesh government established the Greater Noida authority with an aim to acquire agricultural land from farmers, develop it and allot the same for residential, industrial and other urban schemes. Spread on 38,000 hectares of land between Noida and Dadri, Greater Noida was developed by roping in land from at least 93 villages. Currently, no urban village sewer is connected to the sewage treatment plant for treatment. As a result, the sewage goes untreated into village ponds or spills over internal roads of rural areas, thereby polluting waterbodies and posing health risks to villagers. “The Greater Noida authority is yet to lay the storm water drains and sewer network in at least 93 villages. As a result, we are failing to conserve rain water and also letting untreated sewage seep into the ground water table and pollute the source of drinking water. The villages are full of filth and untreated sewer causing several health issues,” said Vashishtha. The petitioner alleged that the authorities are not paying heed to their demands with regard to water needs and protection of natural resources.The NGT observed that “The above averments depict unsatisfactory state of affairs and rampant violation of provisions of Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and “Public Trust Doctrine” laid down in M.C. Mehta v. Kamal Nath, (1997) 1 SCC 388. There is also failure of the authorities to enforce citizens’ right to clean environment and the principle of sustainable development.”Officials from the Gautam Budh Nagar administration, the Greater Noida authority and other agencies said they will do the needful as per the NGT order and take steps appropriately. 
07-01-2022||Noida||Rain gives Ghaziabad its first moderate air day in over 2 months||Light rainfall since Wednesday had positively impacted the overall air quality in Ghaziabad to give the city its first “moderate” air quality day in over two months on Thursday. The last time the city saw a moderate day was on October 26, and since then, the air quality index (AQI) has been oscillating between “severe” and “very poor” categories. According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s 4pm bulletin on Thursday, the Ghaziabad city recorded an AQI of 179, while Greater Noida recorded an AQI of 182, both in the “moderate” category. The AQI for Noida was 252, in the “poor” category. An AQI reading between 0 and 50 is considered ”good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 ”moderate”, 201 and 300 ”poor”, 301 and 400 ”very poor”, and 401 and 500 ”severe”. The officials of the UP pollution control board (UPPCB) said that favourable meteorological conditions has helped improve the city improve its AQI on Thursday and the impact was largely due to the light rainfall triggered by a western disturbance. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has already predicted that the better conditions are likely to prevail till January 9, under the influence of another western disturbance. “The dip in pollution levels is a result of light rainfall and favourable meteorological conditions. On our part, we are still carrying out measures listed under the Graded Response Action Plan. Since light rain may continue over the days, it is likely that the air quality will improve even further,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer, UPPCB. According to IMD statistics, the Ghaziabad district recorded 2.5mm of rainfall on January 6 and about the same amount of rainfall between January 1 and January 5. On October 26, 2021, the Ghaziabad city recorded an AQI of 176, in the “moderate” category, and later, the pollution levels spiked to “severe” levels for 10 consecutive days (starting November 4, 2021) during the post-Diwali period. Thursday ended this long spell of high pollution levels that had lasted for over two months, pollution control board officials said. “The city achieving “moderate” air quality is a big achievement in itself. But it is due to rainfall activity and not due to any effort by local agencies. During the initial days of winter, the officials blamed stubble burning for pollution and later the festival season. But the pollution failed to reduce even after all that and additional efforts at the local level were required. But that did not happen, and now it is the rain that has ended the continued spell of high pollution,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist.
07-01-2022||Noida||Ghaziabad: 63 centres, 76 camps in schools to vaccinate children aged 15-18||Ghaziabad: The district health department has increased the number of vaccination centres for children from existing eight to 63 to increase vaccination coverage for those in the 15-18 age group. The district has a target of vaccinating 234,488 children with Covaxin. According to data available on the CoWIN portal, the district completed administering the first dose to 46,367 children till 6.30pm on Thursday. For the other categories, the district has an overall target of vaccinating 2,702,167 beneficiaries, of whom 2,675,798 (99.02%) have been administered the first dose. “With this rate, we are hoping to achieve the first dose target for different categories (excluding children) within next two days. For children, we have increased the number of centres with Covaxin allotment from eight to 63. This will help children get vaccines at their nearest centre. If they have camps scheduled in schools, they should take vaccine at their respective schools,” said Dr GP Mathuria, nodal officer for Covid vaccination. Overall, the district on Thursday operated 228 vaccination centres. According to the state guidelines, children will be administered only Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin as it is the only vaccine with Emergency Use Listing (EUL) for the 15-18 years age group and recommended by ‘Covid -19 Working Group’ of the National Technical Advisory Group on immunisation.“Beneficiaries, who are to get first dose, will be mandatorily given Covaxin at the 63 centres. For all other beneficiaries scheduled to get the second dose, the vaccine they received as the second dose will be given. This arrangement has been done to increase vaccination coverage for children as well as for people who have been left out of the immunization programme and have not taken any of the vaccine doses,” said Dr Mathuria. Apart from the 63 vaccination centres, the health department is also conducting vaccination camps at 76 schools to inoculate children. “We expect the vaccination for children to be completed in two weeks. We have already covered 67.9% of our targeted beneficiaries with the second doses. This has given enhanced protection to people against Covid infection. It is also vital that people who have their second dose due get it at the earliest and also those, who have not taken any dose so far, should get vaccinated on priority” said Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar, chief medical officer. “We have also started preparations for the precaution dose for healthcare workers, frontline workers and senior citizens having co-morbid conditions. Their vaccination will start from January 10,” said the CMO.  According to the estimates of the department, the district has about 300,000 beneficiaries whose second dose is due for now.
07-01-2022||Noida||Ghaziabad reports over 1,000 fresh Covid cases in first six days of January||The tally of fresh Covid cases reported in the month of January as well the active cases in the district crossed the 1,000-mark as 360 new infections were reported on Thursday on the back of 8,007 samples. Ghaziabad reported 160 fresh cases two days ago on Tuesday (January 4). Officials from the district health department attribute the rise in the number of cases to increased testing in the past two days. According to official data, so far in the first six days of January, 1,020 fresh cases have been reported in the district compared to 235 cases which were reported in December. Currently, there are 1,180 active cases in the district. “There has been rise in cases as we have increased daily testing for past two days. According to our estimates, a majority of the present cases, about 80%, are people in the age group of 21-50 years. These are people who have to travel for work. Testing is mostly being done for people having symptoms or a travel history from different states/countries. Most of the patients are asymptomatic,” said Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar, chief medical officer. He said that the department will further increase testing and is planning to conduct about 5,000 RT-PCR tests, besides rapid antigen tests. The state government has already given a target of conducting 3,900 RT-PCR tests and 3,500 tests using rapid antigen kits daily. From Wednesday onwards, the district has increased testing and collected 7,892 samples on the day, of which 255 tested positive for Covid-19. With the increase in fresh cases, the sample positivity rate (number of samples testing positive per 100 samples tested) in the month of January (till Thursday) stood at 3.64% while it was 1.89% in the first three days of the month. The positivity rate increased to 2.56% on January 4. The current positivity rate is higher than the overall positivity rate of the district, which is about 2.64%, since the start of pandemic. Officials said with the sudden rise in cases, they are expecting the Covid-19 infection to reach its peak in January/February and decline thereafter. “We are ensuring that proper medical kits and medicines are prescribed to patients in home isolation. This is being done by our rapid response teams, which we have now increased to 102 from the existing 82 teams. It has been observed that in the current wave, symptoms in patients are persisting for about 2-3 days. However, we are tracking all cases and taking samples of patients who have a travel history for genome-sequencing . About 323 samples have been taken so far and only two have tested positive for the Omicron variant of Covid-19,” said the CMO. Health experts said the positivity rate surging with the increase in tests indicates that the infection is widespread. “It also indicates that it is headed towards community transmission even if the authorities do not admit it. The way the infection is spreading also indicates that it maybe the Omicron variant. But it is major relief that patients are recovering early with mild symptoms and there has been almost no need for hospitalization,” said Dr Ashish Aggarwal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter).According to state control room figure released on Thursday evening, Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad had 1,706 and 1,180 active cases respectively.

The protesting councillors also burnt the effigy of the Punjab government after a protest march from Chaura Maidan to the Himachal Pradesh Vidhan Sabha. The march was led by BJP’s Chandigarh general Secretary Ramvir Bhatti and Shimla mayor Satya Kaundal. The BJP councillors demanded the imposition of the President’s Rule in Punjab and alleged that threatened by the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Punjab chief minister resorted to such tactics and termed it as a failure of Punjab chief minister.They alleged that the security lapses during which the Prime Minister’s convoy was stuck on a flyover in Ferozepur was a conspiracy to compromise his safety. The protesters demanded to impose President’s Rule in Punjab.Fearing poaching ahead of mayoral elections, the BJP has sent its one dozen councillors to Shimla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-councillors-from-shimla-chandigarh-burn-punjab-government-s-effigy-101641503801069.html
07-01-2022||Chandigarh||Mehbooba Mufti, three other Jammu and Kashmir ex-chief ministers to lose special security cover||Four former chief ministers of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah, Ghulam Nabi Azad and Mehbooba Mufti, are likely to lose their Special Security Group (SSG) protection as the union territory’s administration has decided to “right-size” the elite unit established in 2000, officials said on Thursday. In a recent communication to the additional director general of police (ADGP), security, the UT administration said, “The competent authority has also approved to right-size the SSG and, accordingly, I am directed to convey to reduce the posted strength of SSG to the bare minimum, preferably headed by a DSP, for maintaining continuity.” “All the resources, including vehicles, access control gadgets, etc, of the SSG, except such resources as may be required by SSF, be transferred to the security wing,” the order, issued by Rashid Raina, undersecretary to the J&K administration, added. The move comes a little over 19 months after the Centre had issued a gazette notification -- Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Adaptation of State Laws) Order, 2020 -- on March 31, 2020, amending the Special Security Group Act of the erstwhile J&K government by omitting a clause that provided former chief ministers and their families with SSG security. Officials said the decision was taken by the Security Review Coordination Committee, a group that oversees the threat perception of important leaders in Jammu and Kashmir. The officials said the SSG will be “right-sized” by reducing the number of the elite force to the “bare minimum”. It will be headed by an officer below the rank of superintendent of police as against director, who is of the rank of inspector general of police and above. However, the officials feel there was a re-think over the downsizing of the SSG as some experts within the police force feel that this may hamper the preparedness of the elite unit. The decision will entail the withdrawal of the security cover of Farooq Abdullah, Ghulam Nabi Azad and two other former chief ministers Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti at a time when a number of terror incidents have taken place in Srinagar. All these former chief ministers except Azad reside in Srinagar. However, Farooq Abdullah and Azad will continue to be provided the security cover of the National Security Guard, also known as Black Cat commandoes, as both of them are Z-plus protectees. Omar and Mehbooba will continue to have Z-plus security cover while in Jammu and Kashmir, but are likely to have reduced security outside the Union territory. The leaders will be provided security by the district police as well as the security wing based on the threat assessment, the officials said. Meanwhile, the National Conference and the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) alleged that the Centre was trying to curtail movement of their leaders. PDP chief spokesperson Suhail Bukhari said this is “not going to deter them from speaking the truth for their own people”. “We will continue to speak for our people. Even when PM Modi got stopped in Punjab, they (BJP) created hue and cry on the security issue and everyone is aware about the security situation in Kashmir, especially targeted killings and other factors,” Bukhari said, referring to the alleged security lapse in Punjab that resulted in PM Modi’s convoy getting stuck on a flyover for 15-20 minutes on Wednesday. National Conference spokesperson Imran Nabi Dar said, “Considering the security situation in Kashmir and the accompanying circumstances, it will not be wrong to say that this new directive is aimed to curtail the movement of Dr Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah.” ---With inputs from agencies

07-01-2022||Chandigarh||Centre converting Jammu and Kashmir into military garrison: Mehbooba Mufti||Two top J&K mainstream political leaders, including former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti, has said that the Government of India is converting J&K into a garrison.The leaders were reacting to allocation of land to the army at tourist resorts of Sonmarg and Gulmarg.“Allocating thousands of kanals to armed forces that too in tourist areas confirms GOIs intention to convert J&K into a military garrison. Under the ‘state land’ pretext, our land is up for grabs and to add insult to injury locals are being evicted from their homes,” said Mehbooba Mufti in a tweet on Wednesday night.CPI (M) leader and Peoples Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) spokesman Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami said the Jammu and Kashmir government must review its decision to declare 1,034 kanals of land at the famous ski-resort of Gulmarg and 354 kanals in another popular tourist destination Sonmarg as “strategic areas” for the use of armed forces as these are two most popular tourist destinations in the Valley.“There are already a lot of areas with the army for such purposes. Gulmarg and Sonamarg along with Pahalgam are the three most popular tourist destinations in the Valley which need to be promoted for tourism purposes,” Tarigami said in a statement.The CPI (M) general secretary said the need of the hour is to develop tourism infrastructure in Kashmir which can generate employment for burgeoning numbers of unemployed youths.“So-called real estate development by the government can’t generate employment or create livelihood opportunities, but are only meant for giving benefits to the corporate sector,” he said.Tarigami hoped that the government will review its decision and focus on developing tourism in Gulmarg, Sonamarg and other tourist destinations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/centre-converting-jammu-and-kashmir-into-military-garrison-mehbooba-mufti-101641503625888.html

07-01-2022||Chandigarh||Ladakh again disputes Himachal’s claims over Sarchu||Even as Himachal Pradesh has stepped up efforts to resolve the long-standing interstate dispute with its bordering states, its neighbour, Ladakh, has raised fresh rows claiming grazing rights over the pastures in Shinkula. The ministry of home affairs held a meeting on January 5 to resolve the border dispute between Himachal Pradesh and the union territory of Ladakh. The border dispute between the erstwhile at Sarchu between Lahaul-Spiti and Leh, then a part of erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir, erupted in 2013 when people from Leh set up temporary sheds at Sarchu with a commercial purpose. Sarchu, 13 km inside Himachal, is the last station of Lahaul-Spiti district on the Manali-Leh highway which attracts a large number of tourists. Ladakh placed pre-Independence revenue records to stake its claim over the disputed boundary at Sarchu and Sumdoh in tribal Lahaul and Spiti district. Himachal too placed old records to claim that the local shepherds have grazing rights in Shinkula. “We placed our own records while they submitted their own records. The dispute has to end somewhere now. That’s what I requested the Centre,” said deputy commissioner, Lahaul and Spiti, Neeraj Kumar. “Now both sides have agreed for demarcation in the summer months. It’s the time when tourists rush to the tribal regions,” he said. The stand of HP throughout this dispute has been that the boundary be demarcated according to the relevant maps prepared by the office of the Survey General of India. After the dispute in 2013, deputy commissioner, Lahaul and Spiti, and deputy commissioner, Leh, carried out a joint spot visit during which the Himachal authorities presented revenue records and indexed sheets of Survey of India as evidence to buttress their claim on the territory. The records presented revealed that the boundary was 12-13 km ahead of the disputed point and both sides agreed on a demarcation. The district administration of Leh suggested that they will present relevant forest and revenue records later to press forth their claim, but no tangible evidence was given by them. There is also an unfinished gate structure at the site of the inter-state boundary along the highway. This location is also reflected in the Survey of India maps.

The police have registered a case against the suspect and launched an investigation. The student’s mother, an advocate, filed the complaint in this regard. “On November 23, 2021, my daughter posted some photos on her social media account. On November 25, she found that a man threatened to rape her in the comment section,” she said. The student blocked the user and informed her mother about the matter. “The suspect started messaging her from multiple IDs. We then filed a complaint in the cyber cell,” she said. In the complaint she added, “I am a single mother and an advocate. My daughter and I live in an all-woman household, and in light of such threats against my daughter, I am extremely scared and apprehensive about her safety,” she said. The advocate said that she later found that the same suspect had threatened to rape and assault other children on social media in the past. The cyber cell investigated the matter and asked the Sector 49 police to register an FIR on Wednesday. Vinod Kumar, SHO Sector 49 police station, said that a case has been registered against the suspect under Section 66C and 67A of IT Act. “We have launched an investigation into the matter,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-man-booked-for-rape-threat-to-minor-on-social-media-101641502838306.html
07-01-2022||Chandigarh||2015 sacrilege cases: Question Dera Sacha Sauda head at Rohtak jail, high court tells Punjab Police||Punjab and Haryana high court has said that if Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmeet Ram Rahim is directed to appear before a Punjab court, it may create “a lot of law and order problems”, hence, if required, the special investigation team (SIT) of Punjab Police probing the sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib in 2015 can question him at Sunaria jail in Rohtak. The high court bench of justice Arvind Sangwan said the apprehension on law and order assumes significance, especially in view of the recent incidents in Punjab ahead of the assembly polls and the state police is already under heavy pressure. The court was hearing Dera head’s anticipatory bail plea filed on October 28 and another plea against his production warrants issued by a Faridkot court. The order on asking police to go to Sunaria jail was passed as state’s advocate general DS Patwalia made a special request for the same in view of high court not allowing to bring him to Punjab. The bench observed that it is a matter of fact that when Ram Rahim was convicted by the CBI Court, Panchkula, in August 2017, widespread violence had erupted, causing loss of life and property. It further recorded that even the state’s affidavit reflects that they are apprehending the law-and-order problem in case Ram Rahim is directed to appear before the trial court. The court was referring to AG’s submissions that arrangements will be made for bringing him from Sunaria jail to Punjab through a helicopter. It was also submitted that proper security arrangements will be made by deploying 3,200 police personnel, jammers, etc. if he is brought to Punjab. “(it)..will unnecessarily put heavy expenses on state exchequer in a state like Punjab, which is already facing financial crunch,” the bench observed. The SIT has been pressing for bringing him to Punjab arguing that it has visited Rohtak jail twice to question him. But his “replies were evasive and he pretended to be ignorant”. The SIT says he is bound to be involved in the 2015 sacrilege cases. Confessional statements of the accused of these cases clearly indicate that a conspiracy was hatched at the dera headquarters in Sirsa, claims the SIT. “…it is an open secret that the members of the dera did not do a single act without the permission of the petitioner and were willing to lay down their lives for him,” the SIT says. The dera head is lodged in Sunaria jail since August 25, 2017, after he was awarded 20-year jail term for the rape of two disciples. Subsequently, he was also convicted in two murder cases, those of journalist Ram Chander Chhatrapati and former dera manager Ranjit Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2015-sacrilege-cases-question-dera-sacha-sauda-head-at-rohtak-jail-high-court-tells-punjab-police-101641500797129.html
07-01-2022||Chandigarh||‘Life threat gimmick’ aimed at imposing President’s rule in Punjab, says Channi||Tanda (Hoshiarpur)/Ludhiana: Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi has said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘life threat gimmick’ was aimed at toppling a democratically elected state government.Addressing a gathering at Tanda after laying foundation stones of development works worth ₹18 crore at the new grain market, the CM said there was no threat to the life of the Prime Minister, claiming the latter cancelled his programme on Wednesday because of the thin presence of people at the BJP rally he was to address. He said that empty chairs chided the PM due to which he went back to Delhi, citing security threat as the reason. He said the false pretext on which the PM cancelled his visit was part of a larger conspiracy to defame Punjab and “murder democracy” in the state like it was done in Jammu and Kashmir.The CM questioned as to how the life of the PM was threatened if the protesters were more than a kilometre away. He said the Punjabis had sacrificed their lives for the unity, integrity and sovereignty of the country and they would never pose any threat to the life and security of their Prime Minister. He said it did not behove of a leader of Modi’s stature to indulge in such ‘cheap theatricals’. “The gimmick played by Modi and his coterie was aimed at imposing President’s rule in the state,” the CM said.Calling former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh a ‘political deadwood’, Channi said he had backstabbed Punjabis, predicting a resounding defeat for the candidates of Captain’s party in the coming elections.Earlier, the CM inaugurated an environment park in the memory of Giani Kartar Singh and a road constructed at a cost of ₹8.21 crore, besides laying foundation stone of development works, including upgrade of primary health centre at Gardhiwala, tehsil complex at Tanda Urmur, 66KV sub-station at Sansarpur village and a synthetic athletics track at Tanda.The chief minister also addressed a rally at Macchiwara, which is part of the Samrala assembly segment, in Ludhiana district. “Today there are 70,000 people here, yesterday (Wednesday) there were only 7,000 in Ferozepur. Protesters block my routes as well, but instead of running away, I take the alternative road,” he said in his address at the rally. Channi said had there been any danger to the life of the Prime Minister, Punjabis are nationalist enough to shed their blood to ensure his (PM) safety.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/life-threat-gimmick-aimed-at-imposing-president-s-rule-in-punjab-says-channi-101641500497201.html
07-01-2022||Chandigarh||PM Modi’s security breach: ADGP had directed SSPs to ensure routes are clear on Ferozepur rally day||Road blockade by farmers that resulted in breach of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s security on Wednesday was much anticipated by Punjab Police as ADGP (law and order) Naresh Kumar had warned of such an exigency a day before the rally. As per letters sent by the ADGP to district police chiefs between January 3 and January 5, police were tipped about farmers’ plan to stage dharnas and block roads on the day of PM Modi’s rally. On January 4, a day before PM’s arrival, the ADGP had asked all SSPs involved in the security duty to personally assess the plan of farmers. “Farmers should not be allowed to move to Ferozepur district to disrupt the rally,” the letter said. In one such letter dated January 2, the ADGP mentioned that around 1 lakh people are being mobilised for the programme and a lot of public traffic, as well as a large number of VIPs, will be moving to Ferozepur. “You are requested to make necessary arrangements in your area by deploying force at important points. Recovery vans should also be in place. Farmers are also likely to hold dharnas on January 5. These dharnas may result in road blocks at many places. Please make necessary arrangements accordingly,” the letter said. The same letter also said since rain was expected on January 5, Punjab CM and other VIPs may also be moving, so the plan and alternate route arrangements should also be made in advance. “How it is possible that the police had alternate plan for the CM in mind but not for the PM,” questioned a retired Punjab DGP. All five letters gave clear instructions to the DIGs, IGPs, SSPs in Punjab to clear the protesters and make necessary traffic diversion plans in advance to ensure the smooth movement of traffic to the rally site. A senior official said some senior cops took the directions casually and there was also a tiff between an SSP-rank official and intelligence wing’s senior official over attending a drill in Ferozepur.

The police have identified the main manufacturer, but no arrest has been made. Accused Rohan spilled the beans Rohan was the first to be arrested on December 31. The district crime cell had arrested him from a naka in Ram Darbar following a tip-off and recovered a desi katta, along with a live cartridge, from him. On his disclosure, a country made revolver was also recovered from his house in Hallomajra. During questioning, he revealed that he had procured the weapons from Abhishek, whose supplier was Saksham. Acting on the information, police contacted the other accused for weapons and caught them when they arrived for delivery. A desi katta, a country made pistol and a live cartridge was found in Abhishek’s possession and Saksham was nabbed with a country made pistol and six live cartridges. Deals done through WhatsAppGiving details about the gang’s modus operandi, a senior police official said, “They finalised all deals through WhatsApp calls and received payments online to avoid being traced. The weapons were delivered at the time and place chosen by the customer.” The official added that the gang earned commission from each sale. They would sell a pistol for ₹23,000, a revolver for ₹15,000 and desi katta for ₹8,000.The trio was produced before a court and sent to judicial custody. They have been booked under the Arms Act at the Sector 31 police station. 
07-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Owners of 29 immigration firms booked for skipping registration||Police have booked the owners of 29 immigration and consultancy companies in Sector 34 for operating without mandatory registration. According to police, the firms were found running without registration during physical verification, a violation of the district magistrate’s orders. All violators were booked under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code at the Sector 34 police station. To keep a check on the activities of immigration, emigration and student visa companies, the UT administration had made it mandatory for such firms to provide their complete antecedents in writing to the police. Police sources said since a licence for student visa consultancy was not required, the firms also start providing immigration and emigration consultancy. They invite customers through advertisements in leading newspapers and close their offices after duping innocent people. Therefore, owners of such companies were directed to provide complete antecedents in writing to the police at the Public Window or Police Headquarters within seven days of starting their business in the city. “Complaints of frauds by immigrations firms have been pouring in. We have started a physical verification drive to keep a check on their activities,” said Shruti Arora, assistant superintendent of police (ASP, South), Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-owners-of-29-immigration-firms-booked-for-skipping-registration-101641499901908.html

The latest WD was highly active and was also being fed moisture by the Arabian Sea, which is why it brought more rain than the weaker WDs in December 2021.”More rain expected from tomorrowWhile the current WD has passed, another will affect the city from Saturday onwards. “There is again a chance of up to 30mm rain on Saturday and Sunday in the city. There is also a warning of heavy rain in the northern parts of Punjab.”Mercury risesAfter rain in the morning, the day turned sunny by afternoon, causing the maximum temperature to jump by over four notches, rising from 15.2°C on Wednesday to 19.5°C on Thursday, but was still one degree below normal.

07-01-2022||Chandigarh||PGIMER Chandigarh suspends walk-in OPDs from January 10||With 67 more healthcare workers, including 35 doctors, testing positive for Covid-19 at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) on Thursday, the institute decided to suspend walk-in out-patient department (OPD) facilities from January 10.Patients will have to utilise tele-consultation and will be provided prior appointments if physical evaluation at OPDs is required. PGIMER authorities said the decision had also been taken to prevent exposure of co-morbid patients to the infection.At present, around 8,000 patients visit the institute’s OPDs daily, leading to a footfall of over 20,000 individuals, including patients’ attendants.“Overcrowding increases the risk of infection spread among patients, attendants and healthcare workers in OPDs. Hence, it has been decided that tele-consultation will be used as the first point of contact between patients and doctors. Only patients requiring further evaluation and examination will be called to the OPD by appointment,” PGIMER authorities said in an official release.The orders will be applicable to all OPDs of the institute, including New OPD, Advanced Eye Centre, Advanced Cardiac Centre, Advanced Paediatrics Centre, Drug De-addiction Treatment Centre and Oral Health Sciences Centre (dental OPD).“More and more healthcare workers at PGIMER are being infected, while the positivity rate among patients is also high. Therefore, the walk-in OPD facilities will remain suspended till further orders,” said PGIMER director Dr Surjit Singh. Elective surgeries to be curtailedThough PGIMER is not suspending the elective surgeries, authorities have decided to curtail their number. “Patients, who have already been given appointments for various elective procedures and surgeries, are requested to re-confirm the dates with their respective departments or consultants before arriving at the hospital,” authorities said.Walk-in OPDs resumed in Sept 2021When the pandemic first broke out in March 2020, PGIMER had suspended walk-in consultation and online appointments, and had been providing only tele-consultation. From June 21, 2021, physical consultations resumed, but only after prior appointment through telephone.On September 6, 2021, the institute had resumed the online appointment facility for OPDs, through its official website, but with a cap of 30 patients per department to ensure adherence to Covid protocols.Walk-in facility at OPDs was fully resumed only on September 27, 2021.‘Infected PGI staffers have mild symptoms’Since December 20, 264 healthcare workers, including 123 doctors, have been found infected in the institute, the hospital authorities confirmed.A total of 2,367 employees of the institute, including doctors, nurses and sanitary staff, have contracted the infection since March 2020, with some also getting re-infected in the second wave and current spike.Dr PVM Lakshmi, professor, community medicine and School of Public Health, PGIMER, said, “Doctors and nurses come in direct contact with hundreds of patients daily. Not only from the Covid or emergency wards, staffers of almost all departments are being found infected. All those testing positive on Thursday have mild symptoms and are isolated at home or in institutional quarantine facilities. Almost all of them are fully vaccinated, reducing the number of hospitalisations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pgimerchandigarh-suspends-walk-in-opds-from-january-10-101641499844291.html
07-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh equipped with adequate Covid infrastructure: Health secretary||Amid the rapid surge in Covid-19 cases, the UT health department has assured that it has adequate facilities to tackle another surge.“During the peak of infection, the state must have adequate beds, ventilators, medicines and medical oxygen to cater to the patient load. The UT health department has enough of these facilities to tackle another surge,” said UT health secretary Yashpal Garg. Giving details, Garg said, “In various government and private hospitals of Chandigarh, 1,206 beds have been reserved for Covid-19 patients. Besides, 606 beds are also available in Covid care centres, taking the total count to 1,812. In the first wave, 3,163 beds were reserved for Covid, while the count was 3,740 in the second wave. Since hospitalisations are low at present, the beds reserved are limited and the number will be increased as per requirement.”‘Oxygen capacity increased’Chandigarh presently has 53.8 million tonnes (MT) of daily medical oxygen generation capacity, against the requirement of 49.5 MT during peak Covid spread.“We will get 40 MT oxygen from central allocation, while we will be generating 6.7MT through pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen generation plants. Also, 4.7 MT will be available from oxygen concentrators and 3.4 MT from air separation units,” the health secretary saidHe added that the PSA plants’ capacity had been increased from 1,600 litres per minute (LPM) during second wave to 2,050 LPM at present. Also, projects are in pipeline to increase the capacity to 2,240 LPM.Essential medicines kept in stockThe UT health department has also procured essential medicines for emergency use. Currently, UT has a stock of 43,923 injections of dexamethasone, 31,371 enoxaparin, 18,756 remdesivir, 5,090 methylprednisolone, 4,811 amphotericin B deoxycholate, 470 posaconazole, 241 tocilizumab and 173 intravenous immunoglobulin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-equipped-with-adequate-covid-infrastructure-health-secretary-101641499842217.html

With curbs, we want to contain the infection in these zones, while imposing limited restrictions in the rest of the city. We want a more localised approach rather than a pan-city lockdown,” said UT adviser Dharam Pal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-tricity-s-24-hr-covid-tally-climbs-to-857-woman-dies-in-mohali-101641499839884.html
07-01-2022||Chandigarh||Daily Covid cases soar to 331, Chandigarh clamps night curfew||The UT administration reintroduced night curfew in the city after a gap of nearly five months as the daily Covid-19 cases surged to 331 on Thursday, a 331% spike from 70 cases on New Year day.The administration had eased the last night curfew on August 17, 2021, after the second wave waned.However, noticing the sharp rise in cases once again, the UT administration imposed a slew of fresh restrictions on public movement and also closed down all educational institutions till further orders. The decisions follow the latest restrictions imposed by Punjab and Haryana.As per the order issued by UT adviser Dharam Pal, movement of individuals for all non-essential activities will remain prohibited between 10pm and 5am.However, essential activities, including emergency and health services, transport of essential goods; operation of multiple shifts in industries and offices, movement of people and goods on national and state highways, unloading of cargo, and travel to destinations after disembarking from buses, trains and airplanes will be permitted.The decisions were taken in the Covid review meeting chaired by UT administrator Banwari Lal Purohit.Only online teaching at educational institutesAll educational institutions, including schools, colleges, universities and coaching institutions, have been closed and told to maintain their academic schedule through online teaching. However, medical and nursing colleges may continue to function normally.Government schools were set to reopen on January 8 after the winter vacations, while private schools were reopening gradually with different schedules.At Panjab University, most classes are already being held online and due to the ongoing protest by teachers, the December semester exams had been postponed.Market restrictionsCongested markets, including Palika Bazar and Sadar Bazar in Sector 19, Patel Market in Sector 15, Shastri Market and mobile market in Sector 22, Krishna Market in Sector 41 and all apni mandis will close by 5pm.At the Sector 26 grain and vegetable market, only fully vaccinated vendors will be allowed, and entry of retail customers and general public will be prohibited from January 10.Offices to work with 50% staffAll government offices in Chandigarh, except essential services and departments, will function with 50% staff. All heads of offices will devise rosters to implement the order.Services of any staff of the UT administration can be utilised in the essential services and departments, including health, revenue, municipal corporation and police.All private offices will also function with 50% staff and rest will be required to work from home.Restrictions on hospitality industryAll bars, cinema halls, multiplexes, malls, restaurants, spas, museums, etc., will operate at 50% capacity with fully vaccinated staff.Gatherings for any purpose have been restricted to 50 persons for indoor and 100 persons for outdoor events. However, the total number of persons should not exceed 50% of the venue’s capacitySwimming pools and gyms have been ordered shut, while sports complexes can remain open only for organising and training for national and international events.Thrust on vaccinationDuring the review meeting, Purohit directed the officials to place maximum thrust on vaccination.Ordering vaccination on a war footing, he directed that 100% of the eligible 15 to 18 years population be administered the first dose of vaccine within a month and simultaneously, in the same period, the eligible people aged over 18 be covered with the second dose.“It has been brought to my notice that most of the testing burden as of now is on PGIMER, which needs to be rationally divided among various health facilities,” said Purohit and directed that by the end of the month, facility for RTPCR testing be made functional at GMSH-16.Creating testing infrastructure at the civil hospitals in Sectors 22 and 45, and Manimajra may also be explored, Purohit told the health secretary.Expressing serious concern over a number of doctors of PGIMER testing positive in the past few days, the administrator, at the behest of the director, approved tele-consultation as well as curtailing of elective surgeries.Incomplete Covid testing data on the requisite portal, resulting in projection of high-positivity rate, was taken seriously by the administrator.“Incorrect data can cause undue panic in public. It also obstructs research of scientists working on different aspects of the third wave of pandemic and will mandate imposition of uncalled-for restrictions,” said Purohit, while directing the health authorities to rope in more data entry operators for immediate uploading of data on the portal.Earlier, he reviewed the availability of medical infrastructure, including oxygen and beds, and expressed satisfaction over the arrangements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/daily-covid-cases-soar-to-331-chandigarh-clamps-night-curfew-101641499838415.html

The posters carry the names of ‘Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal Kashi’.The posters read, ‘Ganga, ghats of Varanasi and temples here are symbols of Sanatan Dharma, Indian culture and centre of our faith. Those who follow Sanatan Dharma are welcome at the ghats. These are not picnic spots’.“This is not a request.

07-01-2022||Other||Farm voice takes centre stage in Punjab, BJP unlikely to have it easy||Bathinda The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) may face an uphill task ahead of the forthcoming Punjab assembly elections as farmer unions have, again, started consolidating against it. Political observers say the anti-BJP voice has, paradoxically, gained centre stage after Wednesday’s events, when a security breach forced Prime Minister Narendra Modi to cancel his Ferozepur visit. This is the first election that the BJP is fighting independently in the state, after its old ally, the Shiromani Akal Dal (SAD), parted ways with it over the farm laws. Modi’s rally was expected to be show of strength, but these hopes were, however, dashed as there was a low turnout at the BJP rally.Modi was to launch the BJP’s campaign by formally announcing projects worth over ₹42,000 crore. He was also expected to announce a special package to win over electors, who have been resentful against the party over the farm laws. On Thursday, farmer unions came out in support of the BKU (Krantikari) for blocking the cavalcade of Modi and other BJP leaders and not allowing them to reach the rally in Ferozepur city. Four-time Congress legislator Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi, who joined the saffron front less than a month ago, said, “The BJP leadership is not disheartened. By hindering the PM’s movement, the Congress government has been exposed. We will only gain sympathy due to this attitude. The government used anti-social elements and the police to jeopardise an official function to launch a mega health care facility in the border town of Ferozepur.” He added that Wednesday’s events had jeopardised a much-awaited boost to infrastructure works in Ferozepur and elsewhere in the state. In a video message posted to journalists on Thursday, Surjeet Singh Phul, president, ultra-Left leaning body BKU (Krantikari), said, “A gathering of nearly 1,000 activists blocked the Ferozepur-Moga highway near Piareana village on Wednesday. We did not allow BJP supporters’ buses to pass.” BJP legislator from Abohar Arun Narang alleged that under state government pressure, police had instigated people to block roads leading to the rally. “The model code of conduct can be invoked anytime, and by not allowing the PM to visit Ferozepur, Punjab may have missed expected welfare announcements. Worried over the BJP’s growing electoral strength, the Congress government has abused state machinery,” said Narang, who had been thrashed by farmer activists at Malout in Muktsar last year. Political analyst Dr Jagrup Singh Sekhon, state coordinator of Lokniti, a social science research programme of New Delhi-based Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), said, “The BJP has no support base in rural areas and it may continue to face the ire of agrarians. It has traditional acceptance in urban pockets, but it may not be an easy task for it to make major electoral gains in cities. Disruption of the PM’s convoy indicates strong sentiment against the Centre,” said Sekhon, ex-head of political science department, GNDU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farm-voice-takes-centre-stage-in-punjab-bjp-unlikely-to-have-it-easy-101641499056365.html

It should be left to the Punjabis to shunt out this corrupt, scam-tainted government. This government has not only failed on all fronts, but is also incapable of maintaining law and order in the state,” he claimed. Sukhbir added that a major security breach had occurred during the PM’s visit to the state, and chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi was squarely responsible for this. He added that it was condemnable that security lapses had not been identified and no action had been taken. “The state should have given utmost importance to the security of the PM; this matter is not to be politicised,” he said, adding that the Congress government had politicised the state police force, leading to the current state of affairs. “The state has witnessed multiple change of officers at the top level, including state police chiefs, purely to satisfy the vendetta that the Punjab Congress has unleashed against the SAD. This has led to a paralysis in the chain of command. There is now politicisation of policing decisions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/principally-opposed-to-president-s-rule-says-sad-president-sukhbir-101641497855959.html

In a statement issued from the party headquarters on Wednesday, Chhabra said it was not hidden from anyone who was indulging in horse-trading.“After registering a massive victory with 14 seats in the MC polls, AAP turned out to be the largest party in the city, which the BJP leaders are not embracing. Therefore, they are making rhetoric statements. If all BJP councilors are together, why were they sent to Shimla overnight?” Chhabra questioned. He also termed the decision of Congress councillors to not file nominations in the mayoral election a betrayal of the public: “All councillors, irrespective of the party, were elected with public support.”SAD yet to decide on strategyWith just one day to go for the Chandigarh mayoral elections, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) is yet to take a final call on its stand.The lone councillor from the party, Hardeep Singh, met party chief Sukhbir Singh Badal on Thursday, but a decision on the party’s strategy was not finalised. It is still not clear whether the party will vote or not, though there is a strong buzz that it might abstain from it.With the Congress declaring that it will not participate in the voting, the one SAD vote might decide the fate of the election. Both Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have 14 votes each. Congress has seven, after its councillor Harpreet Kaur switched sides to BJP.The full strength of the house is 36, which includes 35 councillors and the Chandigarh member of Parliament (currently from BJP). On Tuesday, both BJP and AAP had filed nominations for mayoral polls, while the Congress abstained. Anju Katyal is in the fray from the AAP, and the BJP has fielded Sarabjit Kaur Dhillon. To get elected, they will need 19 votes of the total 36.Allegations of horse-trading have been flying high since the declaration of MC election results on December 27. Fearing poaching, first AAP took its councillors to Delhi and Congress to Jaipur, Rajasthan, and then on Wednesday, BJP shifted all its elected councillors to Shimla.Though AAP councillors have now returned to Chandigarh, Congress ones are still in Jaipur. Congress councillors are expected to return on January 8, while most of the BJP councillors are scheduled to return on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mayoral-elections-aap-believes-in-positive-politics-not-horse-trading-says-chhabra-101641497682161.html

Significantly, the charge-sheet cites witnesses’ statements to claim Ashish’s presence on the spot during the incident.Senior prosecution officer (SPO) SP Yadav told the media that under Section 207 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), details of the charge-sheet and evidence have to be provided to the defence counsel, to prepare for the trial. Another prosecution official said the defence counsel had been given carbon copies of statements of nearly 200 witnesses, details of physical and scientific evidences, including copies of forensic reports, call detail records and ballistic reports of firearms of the accused.The official said the initial complaint had named only Ashish. After investigation, the SIT charge-sheeted 13 accused. Ashish’s relative Virendra Shukla’s name was added to the charge-sheet under Section 201 of the IPC (disappearance of evidence) as the 14th accused. The court has fixed January 11 as the next date of hearing, and summoned Shukla. The prosecution official added, “The court could order his arrest, if he does not appear on this date.”12 ACCUSED SEEK BAILWith the charge-sheet now in court, 12 accused filed their bail applications over Wednesday and Thursday. Five accused — Ankit Das, Latif alias Kale, Shekhar Bharti, Nandan Singh Bisht and Satya Prakash alias Satyam Tripathi — moved their bail applications in the court of the Lakhimpur Kheri CJM on Thursday through their lawyer, Shailendra Singh Gaur. On Wednesday, seven accused —Sumit Jaiswal, Rinku Rana, Dharmendra Banjara, Ashish Pandey, Lavkush Rana, Ullas alias Mohit Trivedi, and Shishu Pal — had moved the CJM’s court. SPO Yadav said the court had instructed all applicants to file affidavits stating that no other bail applications were pending neither in the sessions nor in the high court. The bail applications were likely to be heard on Friday, provided the required affidavits were also filed, he added. Defence counsel Gaur said, “After the addition of Sections of the IPC and of other acts, fresh bail applications are required to be moved in the court of the CJM.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-ashish-s-lawyer-given-copies-of-documents-related-to-chargesheet-101641496115468.html

07-01-2022||Delhi||Covid-19: HC asks Delhi govt for status report on Omicron infections||The Delhi high court on Thursday sought to know from the Delhi government the number of patients who are gravely ill in the national capital, after contracting the new Covid-19 variant Omicron, and how many of them were in need of ventilator support and oxygen beds.“We would want to know the situation of omicron. The patients who are in ICU, who are on ventilators, oxygen support? How many of those are omicron cases? Because we would want to know the percentage of the severe cases,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said.Appearing for the Delhi government, senior advocate Rahul Mehra said he would take instructions and inform the court on the next date of hearing the status of these patients.The court was hearing a bunch of pleas, including one by advocate Rakesh Malhotra, seeking better facilities for the Covid-19 patients in the city.During the hearing, the court said, “So your chief minister is also down with Covid-19. What is the position otherwise? Hospitalization is not much.”Apprising the court about the figures, Mehra said there were 10,986 active cases of Covid-19 in Delhi as on January 3. He submitted that the period of home isolation has been reduced to seven days from 10 and the governments, both central and state, are closely monitoring the situation.During the hearing, central government standing counsel Anurag Ahluwalia informed the court that the Union government has already come out with a policy for a ”precautionary dose” of Covid-19 vaccine.The Centre on Wednesday said the same vaccine will be administered as the third dose of booster or precaution dose of vaccine and no mix and match will be allowed as of now. This means those who have received Covishield as their first and second dose will receive Covishield as their third dose. Similarly, those who have received Covaxin in their first two doses will receive Covaxin in the third dose, Niti Aayog member (health) Dr VK Paul said during the press briefing of the health ministry. The court said since the government has already declared the policy regarding the “precautionary dose”, no further consideration on this aspect is needed at this stage.The matter will next be heard on February 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-hc-asks-delhi-govt-for-status-report-on-omicron-infections-101641491915095.html
07-01-2022||Delhi||Covid-19: Free ration scheme in Delhi extended till May 31||Weeks after chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that the Delhi government has extended the distribution of free ration in the city for six months till May 31, state food and civil supplies minister Imran Hussain chaired a high-level meeting with officials of his department to review the programme.Hussain directed officers to ensure there are no bumps in the ration distribution process. “Strict action will be taken against FPS dealers who refuse the distribution of complete ration to the beneficiaries. The decision is benefitting about 1,778,632 households covering about 72.77 lakh [7.2 million] beneficiaries, which include 68,732 Antyodaya Anna Yojna (AAY) households that have 281,006 beneficiaries,” he said. The government in a statement later said the minister is keeping a close watch on the price trends of essential commodities and assured that wherever considered necessary, Delhi government will undertake market intervention to stabilise prices of essential commodities in Delhi during the pandemic. “To bring relief to the consumers, the F & S Minister directed the Commissioner (F&S) to convene weekly meetings with stakeholders departments and agencies viz APMC, Delhi Agriculture Marketing Board(DAMB), Nafed to ensure that prices of essential commodities stay in range. The Minister also asked the Department to keep a strict vigil on the availability and movement of prices of essential commodities. The minister directed that the intelligence teams should also gather information about instances of hoarding and/ or black marketing of essential commodities during the corona pandemic if any so that the concerned departments could initiate necessary action against them under the essential commodities Act,” read the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-free-ration-scheme-in-delhi-extended-till-may-31-101641491734925.html
07-01-2022||Delhi||Uphaar case: Police oppose suggestion to release Ansal brothers||The Delhi Police on Thursday strongly objected after the Delhi high court suggested releasing real estate barons Sushil and Gopal Ansal, citing their advanced age, on interim bail in a case of tampering with the evidence in the Uphaar fire tragedy.Justice Subramonium Prasad was hearing a plea by the Ansal brothers for suspension of their seven-year jail terms. The judge suggested releasing them on an interim basis given their age and the prevailing Covid-19 situation, and asked the trial court to decide their petition against conviction in the case. Gopal Ansal is 79 years old, and his bother Sushil is 82 years old.The judge also observed that even during the previous two waves of the pandemic, persons involved in offences for which the two petitioners are convicted, were released on bail.Opposing the suggestion, senior advocate Dayan Krishnan, who was representing the prosecution, said the petitioners would get the benefit of any policy of release of inmates after it is formulated by the authorities concerned, and assured that the jail doctors were taking all possible care of the petitioners who had “nothing special about them”.“Whether there is a second wave or a third wave, it is really something which is a policy decision and not about an individual person. A convict cannot be better than the other. When a policy (on release due to Covid-19) comes, they will get the benefit,” Krishnan submitted.Krishnan argued that the nature of offences by the Ansal brothers was such that the “entire system was put in peril” and the medical condition of the petitioner during the pandemic cannot be a ground for their release.“We have serious objections. There are jail doctors, jail hospitals...they are taking every possible care.It can’t be a ground for suspension..The nature of offence (was such that) it is shocking to one’s conscience. The entire system was put in peril,” he added.On December 3, a sessions court rejected a plea by the two brothers to suspend their conviction and jail term in the case related to tampering with the evidence, and refused to release them on bail. Subsequently, the Ansals moved the high court which sought responses from the city police and the complainant, Association of Victims of Uphaar Tragedy (AVUT).Senior advocate Arvind Nigam, representing Sushil Ansal, contended that the “mutilated” documents were not even relevant to his culpability in the main Uphaar trial and his conviction in the evidence tampering case was a “travesty of justice”.The senior lawyer submitted that secondary evidence was recorded on the missing issues and the same was not objected to during trial. He said that his client was over 80 years of age, and suffered from various ailments.Senior counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for Gopal Ansal, also argued that his client was over 70 years and the court should exercise its wide and liberal discretion to release him. He emphasised that there was an “inevitable long pendency of appeals” before the trial courts and even during trial, Gopal Ansal was on bail.A magisterial court sentenced them on November 8 last year to seven-year in jail and imposed a fine of ₹2.25 crore each on them. The case was lodged on the direction of the Delhi high court on a petition by AVUT chairperson Neelam Krishnamoorthy.A fire broke out at the Uphaar cinema on June 13, 1997, claiming 59 lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/uphaar-case-police-oppose-suggestion-to-release-ansal-brothers-101641491436489.html
07-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi may get more rain from Friday, says weather office||After a cold and overcast Wednesday that saw Delhi record its lowest maximum temperature of the season, there was some respite from the day-time chill on Thursday, with the city’s weather gauges recording readings of 21.1 degrees Celsius (°C), two notches above normal. While the skies were still overcast over parts of the Capital, rain eluded the city on Thursday, with intermittent periods of sunshine punctuating an otherwise cloudy day. Delhi’s maximum temperature fell to 15.7°C on Wednesday.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that while one western disturbance - which influenced Delhi from January 3 until January 5 - has left, a fresh one will bring the city more showers from Friday. “Unlike Wednesday, winds will be stronger, with speeds expected to touch 30-40 km/hr. We may also see moderate showers as well in parts of Delhi. This western disturbance will bring rain from Friday night and we may see some drizzle on Sunday as well,” said RK Jenamani, scientist at IMD.Delhi recorded 9.2mm of rainfall till 8.30am on Thursday, a spell that significantly cleaned up the city’s air.The city’s air quality index (AQI) was back in the ‘poor’ category on Thursday, with a 24-hour average reading of 258 at 4pm – a sharp drop from 397 (very poor) on Wednesday, showed data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).The Capital meanwhile recorded a minimum of 11.7°C – five degrees above normal. This is expected to rise even further in the next two days. “A western disturbance makes nights less cold, while the days are chilly due to overcast conditions and rain. The minimum temperature could rise to 13°C by Saturday, but the maximum, which is around 21°C now, is expected to fall below 18°C by then,” said Jenamani.According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), the AQI could improve to the ‘moderate’ range by Saturday. “On Friday, AQI is likely to be in the ‘poor’ or lower end of the ‘very poor’ category. On January 8, it is likely to rain with high wind speeds, leading to an improvement in AQI due to wet deposition and strong dispersion resulting in the AQI to be in the lower end of ‘poor’ or ‘moderate’ category,” said Safar on Thursday.An AQI between 101 and 200 is classified as ‘moderate’ by the CPCB, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is ‘very poor’ and over 400 is ‘severe’ as per CPCB’s daily index.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-may-get-more-rain-from-friday-says-weather-office-101641491194873.html
07-01-2022||Delhi||Union home secretary reviews Covid situation in Delhi-NCR||Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla on Thursday chaired a meeting to review the spike in Covid-19 cases in the national capital region, and asked the local authorities to ramp up testing, officials aware of the matter said.Several states including Delhi are recording a sharp spike in the number of daily Covid infections, particularly due to the new, highly transmissible Omicron variant of the Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.States in NCR have imposed a series of restrictions on social gatherings and movement of people to break the transmission chain. A night curfew between 10pm and 5am, and an additional weekend curfew is in force in Delhi. In Gurugram, only fully vaccinated people are being allowed in public spaces such as grain markets, bus stand and railway stations, parks, religious places, bars, restaurants and hotels. Malls and markets are allowed to open only til 5pm.Among those who attended the meeting on Thursday include chief secretaries of Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Haryana or their representatives along with senior police and health officials of the NCR states. Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan and NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul were also present.Officials said Bhalla asked the authorities in Delhi, Gurugram, Noida, Ghaziabad and Faridabad to monitor the availability of hospital beds, oxygen and other facilities in case there is a spike in hospitalisations and make arrangements in respective areas to avoid any crowding.He also touched upon enforcing rules pertaining to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and conducting tests.A total of 90,928 fresh Covid-19 cases and 325 deaths were registered across the country in the last 24 hours. The active caseload also went up to 285,401 during the same period, according to the Union health ministry data. The total number of Omicron cases in the country has reached 2,630. Also, the first Omicron-related death in the country was recorded on Wednesday in Rajasthan’s Udaipur.On December 27, Bhalla issued an advisory asking states and union territories to not let their guard down.The home secretary asked the states and UTs to refer to his earlier order, issued on December 21, which focuses on the five-fold strategy of Test-Track-Treat-Vaccination and Adherence to Covid appropriate behaviour to avoid any surge in Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/union-home-secretary-reviews-covid-situation-in-delhincr-101641491134928.html
07-01-2022||Delhi||Sushil Kumar case: 1 more held in murder of wrestler at Delhi stadium||New Delhi: A 24-year-old man, who was wanted for the murder of wrestler Sagar Dhankar inside the Chhatarsal Stadium on May 4 last year, and was absconding for the past nine months, has been arrested from outer Delhi, Delhi Police said on Thursday.Police said Parveen Dabas, along with other accused persons in the case, including two-time Olympic medalist Sushil Kumar murdered Dhankar. He was arrested in the early hours of Tuesday, officers said, adding Dabas had a reward of ₹50,000 on his arrest.“The special cell team received information about the movement of fugitive Parveen Dabas, an associate of Olympic medalist Sushil Kumar near his village Madanpur Dabas. We laid a trap and arrested him when he was coming to the village at night,” said Jasmeet Singh, deputy commissioner of police(special cell). DCP Singh said Dabas told the police that he, along with Sushil Kumar and other persons, who were armed with hockey sticks and rods, assaulted the members of their rival group during the intervening night of May 4 and 5 inside the Chhatarsal Stadium in north Delhi.“Sagar Dhankar, Sonu Mahaal, Amit and others of rival group suffered serious injuries during the attack. He said that the assault was orchestrated by Sushil Kumar and his associates to settle their personal scores with the members of rival group, and to prove their dominance. Later, Dhankar succumbed to his injuries in the hospital. A case of murder was then registered at the Model Town police station,” said DCP Singh.Police said they have arrested 18 persons in the case so far. Police have also filed a charge sheet against the arrest persons, including Kumar.In the charge sheet, the police have said that Kumar killed Dhankar because his ego was bruised by rumours of his diminishing clout and he wanted to re-establish his authority among younger athletes. Kumar’s lawyers have denied the allegations.Kumar, who won medals at the Beijing and London Olympics, is facing charges of murdering 23-year-old Dhankar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sushil-kumar-case-1-more-held-in-murder-of-wrestler-at-delhi-stadium-101641490834641.html
07-01-2022||Delhi||Over 15,000 new Covid cases in Delhi||Fresh Covid-19 infections in Delhi have nearly tripled in two days, with the city adding 15,097 cases on Thursday, up from 5,481 on Tuesday, as the pandemic continued to expand its footprint across the Capital at a rapid pace, likely fuelled by the extremely transmissible Omicron variant of the coronavirus.Thursday’s fresh cases came at a test positivity rate of 15.34%, with the statistic now at its highest since May 12 last year, when just over 17% of all collected samples in Delhi returned positive results.The national capital also added six deaths of the infection, according to data released by the state health department on Thursday.Covid-19 fatalities have crept up in the city over the past three days. Delhi recorded eight deaths of the infection (the most since late June last year) on Wednesday, and three the day before that.Delhi added an average of 6,150 fresh cases of Covid-19 each day over the past week, up nearly 12 times from the 540 cases it logged on average in the seven days ending December 30.However, despite the surge, hospitalisations in Delhi have risen at a far slower pace, in keeping with global trends and studies which indicate that while the Omicron variant of the Sars-CoV-2 virus may be extremely infectious, it causes milder symptoms and leads to far fewer hospital admissions than the previously dominant Delta variant.Nearly 11,500 Covid-19 beds in Delhi continue to be vacant, with 1,091 people hospitalised as on Thursday evening. Over 31,000 people in the city are currently battling the infection, the state bulletin saidDelhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Thursday urged people not to panic and to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour thoroughly.“Patients infected with the Omicron variant can be treated at home. Do not panic, go to the hospital only if the symptoms are severe,” said Jain.The Delhi government on Thursday released an official order asking all 11 revenue districts in the Capital to allow asymptomatic and mild cases to isolate at home, as per the Centre’s revised home isolation guidelines released on Wednesday.“The Omicron variant is highly infectious. Our intensive care units (ICUs) are full. We are observing that patients are coming to get checked for different issues but are testing positive. Home isolation needs to be the focus to reduce the burden on hospitals during the surge period,” said Dr Vikas Maurya, pulmonologist at Fortis HospitalTo be sure, testing also jumped significantly on Thursday, with the state collecting 98,434 samples, up from 89,742 the previous day. These were also the most tests in a single day since Delhi conducted just short of 100,000 tests on April 17 last year.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has previously said that the state is amping up its testing infrastructure, and will soon be able to collect 300,000 samples a day.The city’s fifth wave of Covid-19 has seen cases rocket at a pace previously unseen during the previous surges. Daily cases have gone from breaching the 1,000 mark (1,313 infections on December 30) to over 15,000 in just eight days.During the fourth wave of infections (between April and May last year), fresh infections took 23 days to go from over 1,000 to the 15,000 mark..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/over-15-000-new-covid-cases-in-delhi-101641490474742.html

07-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi plans mesh of sensors to monitor pollution air hot spots||The national capital’s 40 real-time ambient air quality monitoring stations (CAAQMS) account for a network that roughly covers every 37 sq km of Delhi’s 1,484 sq km area, if these stations were spread out at equal distance from each other across the city.While this network is considerably denser than the four stations functional each in Gurugram, Ghaziabad, Noida and Faridabad, and the two stations in Greater Noida, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) is now considering deploying multiple low-cost sensors to enhance the coverage further.The idea is to install these sensors at the neighbourhood level to create a spatial grid alerting the anti-pollution body of changes in air quality levels in different parts of the same area, to enable local interventions in places where spikes are reported, DPCC officials aware of the matter said. If approved, the plan is start by using these sensors in Delhi’s 13 pollution hot spots, where urgent corrective action in needed, they added.“These sensors function in a similar way to an automatic real-time stations present in Delhi, but they will also be able to identify local sources of pollution, which otherwise cannot be detected by a real-time station as it covers a substantially larger area. Depending on which sensor is showing high-levels of pollution, we can take corrective action, for example acting on dust in its vicinity or any kind of garbage burning,” said a senior DPCC official who asked not to be named.Pollution is one of the biggest problems dogging the national capital, and the city experiences a public health emergency every winter with the air quality deteriorating to hazardous levels. Between November and December last year, for example, the city witnessed 17 “severe” days, and even “very poor” and “poor” days on the Air Quality Index (AQI) rating scale are considered periods of respite. To be sure, this problem is not restricted to winter. Delhi’s average PM2.5 level in 2021 was 87 micrograms per cubic metre, 17 times higher than safety levels prescribed by the World Health Organization (WHO).In 2018, DPCC identified 13 pollution hot spots, which have a substantially higher annual PM 2.5 concentration than the city’s mean average. These are Jahangirpuri, Anand Vihar, Ashok Vihar, Wazirpur, Punjabi Bagh, Dwarka Sector 8, Rohini Sector 16, RK Puram, Bawana, Mundka, Narela, Okhla Phase II and Vivek Vihar.Initially, it is these areas that DPCC wants to target with the network of low-cost sensors.While an automatic monitoring station costs around ₹1-1.5 crore, a low-cost sensor costs only ₹50,000, if it is to measure both PM 2.5 and PM 10 particulate matter. For each additional sensor to measure gases such as SO2, O3 and NOx, the cost goes up by ₹25,000 per filter.In Delhi, the 40 real-time stations have been installed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and DPCC, each measuring PM 10, PM 2.5, SO2, NOx, NH3, CO, O3 and benzene.The low-cost sensors are relatively less accurate but experts said that the data can be used very effectively for analysis and intervention.Ronak Sutaria, founder, Respirer Living Sciences, who specialises in gathering local-level data from low-cost sensors, says while a real-time station influences area of 3-5 sq km, low-cost sensors could cover a radius of 1 sq km easily, creating both a spatial and temporal grid that can be analysed by DPCC.“If we have to assume each pollution hot spot in Delhi is spread over an area of 5 sq km, five such low-cost sensors can be installed covering a kilometre each and you can then identify in which grid the pollution levels are higher. The denser the grid, the more accurate the readings will be,” he says, stating while costing nearly 30-40 times lesser than an ambient air quality station, these low-cost sensors still have an accuracy that is only around 10-15% apart from a real-time station.“If the real-time station is showing “severe” air, then these sensors will show”severe” air too, and the actual concentration may be 10-20 micrograms apart, but it will still give a good idea of the concentration levels in the area,” he added, pointing out that local data also gives a better idea of spike of bad air spikes during different times of the day.Professor SN Tripathi from IIT Kanpur, who is part of a committee formed by CPCB to look at ways to utilise both low-cost sensors and ambient air quality monitoring stations together, says Delhi could benefit with a low-cost network in addition to the existing stations. “While the existing network of 40 stations in Delhi is good enough for policy-level decisions, low-cost sensors will be able to give an idea of certain locations at the neighbourhood-level which have a higher concentration level. Based on this, you could strategically act on the sources of pollution around that sensor,” he said, adding that Beijing is uses a network of over 3,000 low-cost sensors.Anumita Roychowdhury says the approach to use low-cost sensors to tackle hots pot pollution can help coordinate ground-level action better. “Only once we know the source, can we act on it. Ground-level action such as high readings from burning of waste or dust can be easily captured,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-plans-mesh-of-sensors-to-monitor-pollution-air-hot-spots-101641490054822.html

07-01-2022||Chandigarh||PM security breach: Channi, Randhawa behaving like cowards, says Amarinder||Former Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Thursday lashed out at the incumbent, Charanjit Singh Channi, and his deputy and home minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa for “behaving like cowards” and running away from their responsibilities, in view of the security breach during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the state on WednesdayAmarinder, who has entered into a pre-poll alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party after floating the Punjab Lok Congress, was addressing media after inducting senior Congress leaders Surinder Singh Kherki and Sandeep Singla into his party at Samana in Patiala district. “Punjab is in hands of inexperienced leaders. The security breach of PM’s convoy has highlighted their inexperience in how to handle such issues. As the CM, I had attended to the PM and President several times, without any flaw. They (Channi and Randhawa) have caused a loss to Punjab, as the PM was going to announce economic package for the state,” said Amarinder. Asking Channi and Randhawa to take responsibility for the lapses, he said: “True leaders own responsibilities and do not pass the buck on others. This is no leadership, it is cowardice.” Amarinder also criticised Channi for not receiving the PM personally at the Bathinda airport, and reiterated that the President Rule was the best option in Punjab as those at the helm of affair are “novice”. He also appealed to farmers to stop blocking roads and railway tracks and instead focus on what is in their and Punjab’s interests. 
07-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab farm bodies divided over PM convoy blockade||Various farm bodies that were part of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), which led the agitation against the now-repealed central farm laws, are divided over the Wednesday’s demonstration by the ultra-left Bharatiya Kisan Union (Krantikari) that left Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s cavalcade stuck on a flyover on the Moga-Ferozepur highway in a major security breach. While the farm bodies came out in support of protests against the unmet promises made by the Prime Minister when he announced the repeal of three farm laws in November last year, a section termed the blockade of his convoy “avoidable” . Harmeet Singh Kadian, who heads BKU (Kadian), said that farmers are unhappy and their anger has erupted. “The kind of popularity the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) enjoys in Punjab could be gauged by the thin attendance at the Ferozepur rally (which Modi was forced to skip), but the PM should not have been shown disrespect as he had come to our state.” BKU (Kadian) had decided to contest the upcoming Punjab assembly polls and is part of 19 farm organisations that have formed the political outfit Sanyukt Samaj Morcha (SSM). ‘Drastic step was avoidable’ Meanwhile, BKU (Dakounda) general secretary Jagmohan Singh said that small and marginal farmers of Punjab are debt-ridden and Modi was expected to announce a package for them. “Our union was not part of the blockade, but we appreciate the villagers and activists of BKU (Krantikari) for blocking the roads. However, the drastic step of stopping the PM’s cavalcade should have been avoided,” he said. He added that it needs to be understood that it’s a political fight between the Congress and BJP and farmers should not involve themselves in it. According to Darshan Pal of Krantikari Kisan Union, there was no plan to block the cavalcade, and it was already decided on December 31 that confrontation should be avoided. He defended the BKU (Krantikari), calling it a coincidence that the PM’s cavalcade used the same road where they were protesting. “What happened yesterday is sad, could have been avoided, as the onus would now fall on the farmers and Punjabis,” he said, blaming the security agencies for the lapse. BKU (Dakounda) and Krantikari Kisan Union are not keen to take the electoral plunge. ‘A symbol of BJP’s rejection’ Meanwhile, a section of farm bodies called the blockade a symbol of rejection of the BJP by the farmers of the state. They said the saffron party would continue to face opposition as the Centre has not waived farm debts, offered no economic support to promote agriculture and also not giving compensation to families of those who died during the yearlong agitation against the farm laws. “The BJP had a plan to use an official function in Ferozepur to launch its election campaign. But it failed due to the annoyed farmers. There was nothing wrong in blocking the PM’s cavalcade, as farmers have a strong resentment against the Centre and Punjab government,” said Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC) president Satnam Singh Pannu. The farm body is active in Majha and pockets of Doaba and Malwa belt and was the first to give a call to oppose Modi’s rally. Ruldu Singh Mansa, president of Mansa-based Punjab Kisan Union, said any leader of the BJP or its ally would not be allowed to hold any political programme in villages or towns. “If Modi had any soft corner for Punjabis, he would have announced special packages for farmers and farm labourers before coming here. People have not forgotten how it forced farm laws on us and we will take inspiration from the Ferozepur episode to oppose Modi’s any further visit to Punjab,” said Mansa, an active member of SSM that is gearing up for the upcoming polls.Threat to PM’s life concocted: SKMMeanwhile, SKM released a statement that 10 affiliated farmer organisations had announced a symbolic protest to push for the arrest of Union minister Ajay Mishra in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence case and other pending demands. The SKM stated that farmers had no concrete information that the PM’s convoy was going to pass through the flyover.“It’s clear from video of the occasion that protesting farmers didn’t even make any effort to go towards the PM’s convoy. Only a group with BJP flag had reached near that convoy. Therefore, the threat to the life of PM seems completely concocted,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-farmers-divided-over-pm-convoy-blockade-101641482973786.html
