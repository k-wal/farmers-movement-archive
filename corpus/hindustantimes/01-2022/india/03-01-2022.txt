Wankhede has denied the allegations, including a charge of forging his caste certificate.The NCB, under Wankhede, had earlier arrested Malik’s son-in-law Sameer Khan in a narcotics case and the agency has recently moved the Bombay High Court to cancel the bail given to the latter in this case. Prabhakar Sail, an ‘independent’ witness in the cruise drugs case, had claimed and filed an affidavit that there was an extortion bid of ₹25 crore by some agency officials, and others for letting off Aryan Khan from the case.Sail had stated that he overheard that ₹8 crore ‘bribe’ out of this money was to be paid to Wankhede. Following these allegations, the agency headquarters here had removed Wankhede from the case apart from five others and had placed their investigation under a team led by its deputy director general (DDG) operations based in Delhi.Another DDG (northern region) is conducting a vigilance probe into the allegations of extortion in the cruise drugs case.Wankhede and his family had categorically denied these charges and said these allegations were made to deter the officer from taking strong action against drugs peddlers and syndicates operating in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sameer-wankhede-s-tenure-with-mumbai-ncb-ends-sent-back-to-dri-101641233552399.html
03-01-2022||India||Lakhimpur charge sheet names Mishra||LAKHIMPUR KHERI/LUCKNOW: Investigators probing the October 3 Lakhimpur Kheri violence filed a charge sheet against 14 people on Monday, naming the son of junior home minister Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’ as the main accused and citing witness statements to confirm his presence at the spot during the incident. Four farmers and a journalist were allegedly mowed down by the minister’s son, Ashish Mishra, and others during a farm protest in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3. A special investigation team (SIT), which filed the charge sheet on Monday, told the local court last month that it was a “well-planned conspiracy”. The SIT filed the 5,000-page charge sheet in the court of chief judicial magistrate (CJM) Chinta Ram on Monday. It included thousands of pages of case diary, and documentary, scientific, forensic, physical and electronic evidence, said senior prosecution officer (SPO) SP Yadav. “Witnesses in the case confirmed Ashish Mishra’s presence on the spot and the same are part of the case diary,” said Yadav. Mishra had repeatedly denied being present at the spot when violence broke out. The SIT included the statements of 200 witnesses in the charge sheet, and named Ashish Mishra as the main accused.But family members of the victims alleged that the government was protecting the minister by not naming him in the charge sheet. “The SIT is playing at the hands of the government that seems adamant on saving Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’. The minister is the real mastermind of the incident and justice will not be done till the time he is put behind bars,” alleged Sukhwinder Singh, the father of 18-year-old Gurvinder Singh,who was killed on October 3. Amaan Ahmad, who represents the farmers in the case, said they were angered over the omission despite the minister being named in the initial police complaint. “The SUV that mowed down farmers is also registered in Teni’s name. We will appeal in the court for proper investigation into the case,” he said.The violence sparked nationwide condemnation and energised Opposition parties to demand the minister’s resignation, months before high-stakes polls in the crucial state. In the previous winter session of Parliament, several opposition parties disrupted proceedings to demand Ajay Mishra’s removal. The initial complaint into the case only named Ashish Mishra and unknown persons. Subsequent investigation by the SIT identified 12 other accused. In the charge sheet, the SIT added a 14th accused -- Virendra Shukla, a relative of the minister who is yet to be arrested.The 13 accused were charged under sections 147(rioting), 148 (rioting armed with deadly weapons), 149 (unlawful assembly ), 307(attempt to murder), 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt), 302 (murder) and 120B (criminal conspiracy), section 427(mischief causing damage ), 34(acts done with common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC),and Section 177 (wilfully disobeying directions) and B177 of the Motor Vehicle Act, said Yadav.The people in jail are Ashish Mishra, Ankit Das who is a relative of the Lucknow-based businessman, his aide Nandan Singh Bisht, his private security guard Latif alias Kaale, and driver Shekhar Bharti, who were said to be present in one of the three SUVs in Mishra’s cavalcade.The SIT filed additional charges under section 3/25 of the Arms Act against Sumit Jaiswal, section 30 of the Arms Act against Ashish Mishra, Ankit Das, Latif alias Kaale and Satyam Tripathi and section 5/27 of the Arms Act against Nandan Singh Bisht, said Yadav. Virendra Shukla’s name was added in the charge sheet under section 201 of the IPC (disappearance of evidence) and he was called to the court on January 10. Four farmers and a journalist died when an SUV owned by Ajay Mishra ran over farmers from behind in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3. In the ensuing violence, three more people — two of whom were Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers and one was the driver of the car — were killedOn December 14, a court in Uttar Pradesh added stringent sections of the IPC and Arms Act, including attempt to murder, to the First Information Report (FIR) after the SIT said that incident was “well planned” and “deliberate”. The prosecution urged the court to exclude copies of case diary and some other documents from a list of papers to be disclosed to the accused, said Yadav. It will not be in public interest to do so, he added.Some family members of the farmers killed on October 3 expressed discontent over the charge sheet. “Police officials promised us to ensure that all accused of the incident will be put behind bars. But they are clearly saving the mastermind Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’,” said Jagdeep Singh, son of Nacchhatar Singh, a father killed in the violence.The Opposition criticised the government over the development. “The BJP has a washing machine. After getting washed in this special BJP washing machine, a criminal doesn’t look criminal anymore,” said Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav. “The 5000 page charge sheet is actually a black box of the double engine government of the BJP,” he tweeted. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted ,” The whole country has seen the truth of the 5000-page chargesheet in the form of a video, yet the Modi government is trying to save the accused. India is a witness!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-charge-sheet-names-mishra-101641233071309.html

03-01-2022||India||Decide on plea to bring back Kerala woman from Kabul jail for ISIS link: SC||NEW DELHI: The central government should decide within eight weeks on the extradition and repatriation of a woman from Kerala who is detained in Afghanistan with her child on charges of joining the ISIS terror outfit, the Supreme Court ruled on Monday.The court was hearing a petition filed by 65-year-old VJ Sebastian Francis, a resident of Ernakulam district, who requested repatriation of his daughter Sonia, alias Ayisha, and granddaughter. The two are at Pul-e-Charkhi prison in Kabul since 2019, before the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan.Francis said he feared for the lives of his 32-year-old daughter and nine-year-old granddaughter, and sought the top court’s intervention.“First you have to persuade the Indian government. You should have first approached the government instead of moving the court,” a bench comprising justices L Nageswara Rao and BR Gavai said.Commenting on news reports suggesting cordial diplomatic ties being established between India and Afghanistan, the bench said, “The relationship appears to be good.”The woman left the country on July 30, 2016 to join her husband, who was working with ISIS in Afghanistan. On an Interpol red corner notice issued on March 22, 2017, Ayisha and her daughter surrendered before Afghan forces on November 15, 2019, and were jailed.India’s National Investigation Agency has charged Ayisha under various provisions of the anti-terror law UAPA.“There are several treaties in force under which extradition is possible. But in cases involving UAPA, they (Centre) do not initiate,” the bench said, expressing its limitations.A representation was moved before the federal government but there’s been no response yet, advocate Renjith Marar, appearing for Francis, told the court.The petition was filed in the Supreme Court in July last year. Disposing of the petition, the apex court bench said, “We direct the cabinet secretary and secretary, ministry of external affairs (MEA) to consider and dispose the request for extradition of the detenues, preferably within eight weeks from today.”The apex court also permitted Francis to approach the Kerala high court, instead of approaching it, if he is aggrieved with the decision taken by the Centre after the eight-week period.During the hearing, Marar pointed out that the jail in which the kin of the petitioner were lodged was destroyed by the Taliban and prisoners were shifted to detention centres in border areas adjoining Pakistan.In his petition, Francis said that India was duty bound under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to bring back its citizens. He requested the Indian government to extend consular access to ensure the safety of his daughter and granddaughter through diplomatic channels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/decide-on-plea-to-bring-back-kerala-woman-from-kabul-jail-for-isis-link-sc-101641227852144.html

Otherwise, they (farmers) will never pardon you. Nor the souls of 700 farmers who sacrificed their lives,” he added.Malik triggered a massive row after reports of his statement at an event on Sunday. Malik, who has been critical of the Centre's handling of the farm agitation over the now-repealed three laws, said: “When I went to meet the Prime Minister to discuss the farmer issue, I ended up fighting with him within five minutes. He was very arrogant. When I told him that 500 of our own (farmers) had died… he said, ‘Did they die for me?’ I told him yes, since you are the king. I ended up having an argument with him.”Asked by HT, Malik said: “I did not say the PM was arrogant, he was just adamant about his position.” The Meghalaya governor also stressed that the home minister did not speak ill of the prime minister and told him that people are telling Modi different things so he must meet and give him the right picture.At the press briefing on Monday, Surjewala also accused the Modi-led government of compromising national security and the country’s territorial integrity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-demands-pm-s-apology-amid-uproar-over-satya-pal-malik-s-arrogant-remark-101641218481408.html

The non-petroleum exports in December 2021 was of $31.67 billion, registering a positive growth of 27.31% over non-petroleum exports of $24.88 billion in December 2020.Goyal said that India's Missions abroad have reacted very well to PM Modi's clarion call for 'Local Goes Global: Make In India For the World'. He also said that the sharp increase in trade deficit with China under the government of Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) has been brought that down considerably by the current Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled government.He said the imports from China during the UPA government grew by 1,160% between 2003-04 and 2013-14 while it was brought down "drastically to 8% between 2014-15 and 2020-21" under the BJP government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-on-track-to-achieve-export-target-of-400-billion-piyush-goyal-101641216315378.html

There is gender imbalance no doubt,” news agency ANI quoted her as saying earlier in the day.Several other women parliamentarians had joined the chorus in demanding they be allowed to contribute to discussions on the issue. Shiv Sena MP Priyanka Chaturvedi wrote to Vice President and Chairman of Rajya Sabha Venkaiah Naidu seeking more women representation in the committee.Meanwhile, Kanimozhi of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) criticised the government for sending the bill to raise women’s legal marriage for review to a committee that had 30 men.“There are a total of 110 female MPs but the government chooses to assign a bill that affects every young woman in the country to a panel that has 30 men and only one woman.

Samples of all the passengers were tested after a crew member contracted the viral disease.The ship was initially made to wait at anchorage on Sunday for a few hours as the authorities debated the steps to be followed before asking the ship operators to get all the 2,000 passengers tested.“Out of 2000 samples tested from Cordelia cruise ship, 66 passengers tested positive for #COVID19 Respective collectors & MPT (Mormugao Port Trust) staff have been informed. The government will take appropriate measures to discuss disembarking of passengers,” Rane said.The passengers who were found negative will now have to await further instructions before being allowed to disembark.The state recorded four more cases of the fast-spreading Omicron variant of the virus with the National Institute of Virology, Pune, confirming the same during the day.Among the four, one has no prior travel history, leaving officials flummoxed and leading to the belief that the variant has already begun spreading in the state.“One patient is from within the state with no travel history, indicating indigenous spread to be further examined by experts,” Rane said, adding he would discuss the matter with chief minister Pramod Sawant regarding the steps ahead.The Goa administration is likely to impose a night curfew between 11pm and 6am, besides cancelling classes for students of classes VIII to XII. The classes will be taken back online.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/66-of-2-000-aboard-cordelia-cruise-ship-from-mumbai-contract-covid-goa-minister-101641215207291.html

He reiterated Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s remarks that the onus is on India to take steps to create an environment conducive to dialogue between the two sides.The 19th Saarc Summit was to have been held in Islamabad in November 2016 but was called off after New Delhi pulled out over the Uri terror attack that was blamed on Pakistan-based terrorists. There is also uncertainty about the status of Afghanistan, one of the eight members of the grouping, following the Taliban takeover of the country last year. Qureshi, who was speaking in Urdu, described Saarc as an “important forum” and said: “Unfortunately, India has made this forum dysfunctional because of its stubbornness. They are not ready to come to Islamabad, they are hesitant.” He added: “Because of India’s obstinacy, this forum is suffering. If India does not want to come [for the Saarc Summit], then new means are available. I reiterate our invitation to all Saarc members and Pakistan is willing to host the 19th Saarc Summit in Islamabad. If India doesn’t want to come, they can attend virtually.”Qureshi further said, “If they [India] have problems coming here physically, they can attend virtually but they shouldn’t stop others. They should let others come and not affect this forum.”There was no immediate response by Indian officials to Qureshi’s comments. Saarc operates on the principle of consensus and the summit cannot be held if even one member decides not to attend. With India-Pakistan relations at an all-time low following a string of terror attacks blamed on Pakistan-based groups, New Delhi has said there cannot be any dialogue between the two sides if Islamabad does not act against terrorist groups operating from its soil.In recent years, India has also focused on other regional groupings, such as the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (Bimstec) to take forward developmental cooperation.Qureshi further told the news conference that prospects for durable peace and stability in the region and the potential for economic development and regional cooperation had been “held hostage by the hegemonic and hostile behaviour of India”, whose leadership has adopted a “particularly irresponsible and politically motivated anti-Pakistan posture”. He contended that India’s “unilateral and illegal actions” in Jammu and Kashmir since August 2019 had “vitiated the environment and threatened international peace and security”. Qureshi said, “Resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute is a prerequisite for durable peace and stability in South Asia.” He added that Pakistan will continue to extend “moral and diplomatic support” to the Kashmiri people in their struggle for self-determination.

03-01-2022||India||In setback to Bengal govt, SC declines to lift Suvendu Adhikari’s arrest shield||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday refused to interfere with the Calcutta high court order granting protection from arrest to Bharatiya Janata Party leader and West Bengal leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari in connection with criminal cases lodged against him.On September 6 last year, a single judge bench of the HC had granted an interim stay on any coercive action against Adhikari in connection with criminal cases -- which were registered after he switched from the ruling Trinamool Congress to BJP. This order was challenged by the West Bengal government before a division bench, that refused to stay the order. Against this dismissal, West Bengal had appealed to the top court.During Monday’s hearing, the bench of justices DY Chandrachud and AS Bopanna observed that this was the second case coming up against the same order. On December 13, the court had dismissed appeals filed by the West Bengal government and a complainant in one of the cases on the ground that the HC order was passed as an interim direction, pending final consideration of Adhikari’s petition. The top court’s order had permitted the state to file an application before the high court to vacate the stay.In the present appeal, the state government took fresh grounds questioning the dismissal of its letters patent appeal (LPA) by the HC’s division bench. The bench said, “Since the order of the single judge was assailed before us, the issue of maintainability of LPA pales into insignificance. Parties are to be governed by our order of December 13.”Senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy, appearing for the state government, informed the Court that the issue raised in their appeal was similar in nature to a case already pending before the top court. She said, “the issue here is whether LPA can be moved in terms of a writ petition before the high court under Article 226 of Constitution. This question is pending consideration in the Anup Majee v CBI case pending before this Court.”“We have already dealt with the HC order on merits; then where is the question of LPA? Once you have approached us on merits and we have dismissed your appeal, there is no question of dealing with another petition against the same order,” the bench said.Guruswamy sought to argue that the question raised by the state has not been dealt by the December 13 order. She even requested the court to allow this matter to be tagged with the Anup Majee petition as similar questions of law have to be decided. For Adhikari, senior advocate PS Patwalia opposed the state’s arguments and requested the court to dismiss the same. As regards clubbing the petition with the other pending case, the bench told the state, “The state is already before us in the Anup Majee matter.”Adhikari had approached the HC seeking stay of arrest in seven criminal cases lodged against him in the state. The high court order had stayed any coercive action against Adhikari even as the state government was directed to file its response.In its December 13 ruling, the top court had said, “Since the high court is seized of the proceedings, and the special leave petitions arise from an interlocutory order, we are not inclined to exercise the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution.” At the same time, the bench had said, “The High Court may either consider taking up the petition (pending before it) for expeditious final disposal or, in the event that it is not possible to do so, to consider any application that may be filed for modification of the interim order based on the material which is produced by the investigating officer in the affidavit-in-opposition (by state government).”Adhikari has claimed that the FIRs were the result of “regime revenge”. One case pertained to a theft of ₹5,000 and a gold chain while another related to theft of tarpaulin sheets at the behest of Adhikari. Even an old case of an alleged suicide of Adhikari’s personal security officer (PSO) was sought to be re-investigated on a complaint by the deceased’s widow who alleged murder of her husband.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-setback-to-bengal-govt-sc-declines-to-lift-suvendu-adhikari-s-arrest-shield-101641213510930.html

The victim then paid ₹9,250 by Google pay in his account, the complainant alleged. When the accused did not return his money despite demanding several times, the complainant approached the police and a case was registered in the matter, police said. Deputy Commissioner of Police (IGI Airport) Sanjay Tyagi said the team through its sources and electronic surveillance analyzed and monitored the CCTV cameras installed at the terminals and located one suspected person who used to visit frequently at IGI Airport. "On December 30, on the basis of CCTV footage, alleged suspected person was apprehended from IGI Airport T-2 when he was trying to cheat other passenger," Tyagi said.Interrogation revealed that the accused used to visit different airports for cheating passengers. He used to introduce himself as a student of a reputed university and cheated passengers on the pretext of missing his flight. Once he was able to convince the passenger, he used to get the ticket money transferred into his bank account and would cheat the passengers, the senior officer said.It also came to light that 5 more FIR’s already stands registered against the accused and on Twitter also, there were many complaints against him, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-man-held-at-delhi-airport-for-conning-people-saying-he-missed-flight-101641213005228.html

The government said in a release that the media reports were “false and misleading and based on incomplete information.”“There have been some media reports alleging that expired vaccines are being administered in India under its national Covid-19 vaccination programme. This is false and misleading and based on incomplete information,” the release said.The government highlighted that the 3-months extension of the shelf life of Bharat Biotech's Covaxin was approved by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) in October last year. It further said that the shelf life of Covishield, the Indian version of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, was also extended from six to nine months in February 2021."The shelf life of vaccines is extended by the National Regulator based on comprehensive analysis and examination of stability study data furnished by the vaccine manufacturers," the release added.Bharat Biotech earlier said that the approval of the shelf-life extension was based on the availability of additional stability data, which was submitted to CDSCO. Amid the issue of vaccine wastage, the Hyderabad-based manufacturer also recently announced that the opened vials of its Covid-19 vaccine can be stored at 2-8 degrees Celsius for up to 28 days and are not required to be discarded immediately in a day or at the end of the immunisation session. Covaxin has been approved for use under the 28-day multi-dose vial policy from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) and the WHO Emergency Use Listing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-rejects-reports-of-expired-vaccines-being-administered-in-india-as-misleading-101641206925139.html

Bandi and resorted to violence and lathi charge, thrashed and manhandled senior party leaders and workers is highly deplorable and condemnable. It is yet another glaring example of the murder of democracy and constitutional rights by the Telangana government,” Nadda said in a statement.Bandi was arrested on Sunday after he sat on a fast and a night-long vigil in alleged violation of Covid protocol to press for changes to guidelines on the transfer of employees.

This is what CM Bommai said||The Karnataka government is likely to impose more restrictions to stop the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The state cabinet may decide in this regard later this week after consulting experts, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said on Monday.The cases have been rising due to the Omicron variant, which was first detected in South Africa on November 24 last year and has since then spread across more than 100 countries. In India, the Omicron tally has crossed 1,700."We are monitoring both Covid and Omicron situation. It is spreading at a very fast pace in the country, in the state and in neighbouring states, so we need to have a discussion with experts. In this regard I will have a discussion with experts tomorrow evening," Bommai said."Having the experience of managing the earlier two waves, we have already asked the experts to recommend containment measures, with limited impact on daily lives of the people," he further said.The chief minister also urged people of the state to show self-control and follow the Covid-19 guidelines.The Karnataka government has already imposed containment measures like "night curfew" from 10pm to 5am since December 28 till January 7 morning, to control the spread of the infection.Karnataka has been witnessing a surge in COVID cases over the last five days, with daily figures crossing the 1,000 mark.

He left his studies, later his addiction affected his marital life and even his parents started living separately because of his habits. But, Sahu is a changed man now.He has not only overcome his addiction, but also helps local police in nabbing drug peddlers and motivates other addicts in his area to quit drugs and liquor consumption. Like him, there are several men in Chhattisgarh's Korea district who have quit addiction in the last six months, thanks to a campaign being run by local police against drugs and illegal liquor sale. Under the 'Nijaat' (riddance) drive, launched in July last year, the police have been successful in effectively curbing the smuggling of drugs and illegal liquor, and also persuaded a large number of addicts to quit the habit and lead a normal life, Korea Superintendent of Police Santosh Singh claimed while talking to PTI. The campaign is gaining momentum across Korea, a small district in Chhattisgarh's tribal-dominated Surguja division, with wall paintings, posters and banners of 'Nijaat' seen at many places in urban areas and remote villages of the district. According to the police official, the campaign is drawing more attention as celebrities like Prabhu Deva, Arbaaz Khan, Rajpal Yadav and Kailash Kher have been roped in to appeal to people, through video messages, to quit drugs and liquor. Some noted artists from Chhattisgarh, like actor Anuj Sharma and folk singers Teejan Bai and Mamta Chandrakar, have also extended support to the campaign. Singh, the brain behind the drive, said "the campaign has started yielding results and local public representatives as well as the common people have taken it forward in their areas on their own”. Around 200 public awareness programmes have been conducted so far under the drive in the district where hundreds of drug addicts have been counselled and successfully convinced to quit the habit, said the 2011-batch IPS officer. Besides, since July last year, so far 152 people have also been arrested in 126 cases registered under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, while 822 arrests have been made in 935 cases pertaining to the sale of illegal liquor, the police official said. After attending an event under the campaign in Sonhat village, Mukesh Sahu, a local, came in contact with police who convinced him to quit the addiction. "I started consuming liquor when I was in Class 10. I did not even appear for the exams and later quit studies. Soon, from liquor, I shifted to smoking ganja and chewing tobacco, and became addicted to these narcotics. I had no idea that I had started on a catastrophic journey,” Sahu told PTI. He said he used to buy liquor with money given to him for household items. His parents thought he might quit drug addiction after getting married. "I got married in 2016, but I continued with my habits and even assaulted my wife in drunken state. My wife started living most of the time at her maternal home along with my two children and even my parents left me," he said. "A few months back, I got in touch with Sonhat police station house officer Shiv Kumar Yadav, who encouraged me to quit the addiction," Sahu said, adding that he is now living happily with his whole family. Amitabh Gupta, a 48-year-old social activist whose organisation 'Samanata Kranti' has been associated with 'Nijaat', said as part of the campaign, people have now voluntarily formed committees at local level, and this has given a boost to the drive. “The campaign has two purposes- to locate drug peddlers and take action under the law which was already underway, and to understand the feelings of families of addicts and help them,” Gupta said. He said they have conducted various programmes, visited villages and contacted addicts and their families. "The prime focus was on Chhindiya village under the district's Patna police station which was infamous as a drug peddling hub. Narcotic substances from neighbouring Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand were believed to be smuggled into Chhindiya from there and circulated across the district,” he said. The police successfully cracked down on peddlers there and arrested many of them in the last six months, he said. The campaign is showing significant results in many parts of the district, though it will take time to reach a conclusion (to end the drug menace in the district), Gupta said. With the initiative of the superintendent of police, a de-addiction centre comprising 50 beds has also been set up at Baikunthpur in the district, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nijaat-campaign-helps-addicts-shun-drugs-alcohol-in-chhattisgarh-101641192254978.html
03-01-2022||India||Renaming places in Arunachal is part of Chinese psy-ops||Playing mind wars with the adversary is an old Chinese tactic since Sun Tzu days with deception, treachery, and propaganda legitimate tools of Communist Party arsenal. The Chinese renaming of 15 places in Arunachal Pradesh in mandarin language is part of the same psychological warfare designed to keep Narendra Modi government on tenterhooks and declare a new normal of Beijing’s strategy on boundary resolution.The Chinese are playing similar mind games with Republic of Taiwan and its western backers with its PLA warplanes breaching the Taipei’s southwestern air identification zone or ADIZ virtually on a daily basis throughout 2021. The last big Chinese breach took place on November 28, 2021 with 27 fighters, bombers and aerial reconnaissance planes bullying Taiwan into a new normal with regional and global powers on perpetual tenterhooks. Since the dawn of 2022, there has been a breach of Taiwan ADIZ by Chinese reconnaissance plane on January 1 and 2 respectively as if the Chinese Communist Party under its all-powerful leader Xi Jinping is marking territory.While India dismissed the Chinese renaming of some places in Arunachal Pradesh, the national security planners understand Beijing’s mind games and will respond to this at the right place and right time. The Narendra Modi government is in no mood to be reactive to Chinese psy-ops but will not allow any free lunches to Beijing.Perhaps, the Chinese move itself was a reaction of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat calling upon His Holiness the Dalai Lama on December 21 at McLeodganj. The RSS chief not only exchanged notes with the 14th Dalai Lama but also met the leaders of Tibet Government-in-Exile in Dharamshala. It is quite evident from the Chinese embassy reaction to Indian MPs attending a reception hosted by the Tibetan Government in Exile that the Tibet issue is as much as a red rag to CCP as Taiwan if not more. Breaching diplomatic etiquettes, the Chinese Embassy virtually threatened the six MPs attending the reception in December 2021 and asked them to refrain from supporting the Tibetan cause. Even in the past, junior level diplomats of Chinese embassy and consulate in Mumbai have breached diplomatic etiquettes by openly questioning Indian Ministers in the previous UPA regime including Pranab Mukherjee, who later became President, on 1962 war. Besides, Beijing has a habit of issuing a statement every time an Indian VVIP visits Arunachal Pradesh.While China takes serious umbrage on any issue concerning Tibet, Sinkiang and Taiwan, India in the past has followed the Beijing’s practice of changing names of towns and cities in Tibet and in Sinkiang. The Indian Embassy in Beijing has practiced diplomatic etiquettes by not writing directly to Chinese propaganda media who routinely project India in very poor light as part of its information warfare. Maybe the time has come for Indian surveyor general to publish new maps that call a spade a spade in Tibet and not pander to the Xizang nomenclature of CCP.

Keeping in view the rising concerns over the virus variant, Adityanath said while requisite precautions must be taken to cut the spread of the disease, there is no need to panic.“It's true that Omicron is highly contagious,” the UP chief minister acknowledged while addressing reporters on concerns about a third wave of the pandemic. “However, it is also true that compared to the second wave, the Omicron variant is weaker and is comparable to a simple viral fever.”“Safety precautions are necessary when dealing with any disease,” he added. “And in this case, too, safeguards are necessary.

03-01-2022||India||Covid-19: Vaccination of children aged between 15 and 18 begins today||Amid concerns over the new, highly transmissible Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, India is all set to begin vaccinating the 15 to 18-year-old age group against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) from today. It is, however, to be noted that only Bharat Biotech's indigenously-made shot ‘Covaxin’ will be used for vaccinating this age bracket. According to a note sent by the Union health ministry to all states and Union territories, additional doses of Covaxin will be sent to the states for administering the vaccine to this population category.The government's decision to begin the vaccination drive in this regard was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Christmas Day last December. It was said that while vaccination for the age bracket of 15-18 will begin from January 3, 2022, the administration of a precautionary third dose (booster shot) for vulnerable categories of people will begin from January 10.Who are potential beneficiaries of the vaccination drive?According to an official release by the Union health ministry, those people with the birth year of 2007 or before will be eligible for vaccination under the category of 15 to 18 year-olds.States have been asked to ensure there are separate queues and vaccination teams for the 15-18 age group to avoid confusion with the vaccination process of all adults.Potential beneficiaries began registering themselves on the Co-WIN portal from January 1; however, there is also the option of walk-in registration (albeit limited) at multiple vaccination centers when the immunisation drive begins today.Where to get vaccinated?While most existing vaccination centers shall have separate queues beginning today, states have also been informed that they have the option to dedicate a few Covid Vaccination Centres (CVCs) as ‘dedicated CVC’ exclusively for the 15-18-year-olds. The same shall also reflect on the Co-WIN app to ensure that there is no confusion in administering the vaccines to the different age groups.The states have also been advised to ensure the orientation of vaccinators and vaccination team members for the immunisation of 15-18 year-olds and the identification of dedicated session sites for the same. The states were further exhorted to undertake proper planning in advance for the distribution of Covaxin to identified session sites.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccination-of-children-aged-between-15-and-18-begins-today-101641167567261.html

03-01-2022||India||Students denied entry to class for wearing Hijab||Bengaluru: Six students were denied entry into classes by college authorities in Udupi district, located around 400 km from Bengaluru, for wearing hijabs, the students and their parents claimed. The incident took place at the government pre-university college for women. On Saturday, the parents of these students along with activists held a protest against the authorities for not allowing the students inside the class for three days. Apart from not being allowed into the class over the dress code, the students also complained that they are not being allowed to talk in Urdu, Arabic and Beary languages. The girls stood outside the classroom for three days in protest. The students claimed though their parents approached the principal Rudra Gowda for talks, he refused to hold a discussion on the issue. The girls said they have not been given attendance for the last three days and feared they might face an attendance shortage. “We were told to bring our parents to college, but when they arrived, school authorities made them wait for some three to four hours,” a student told media. Another student said, “ Everything was fine before we started wearing the hijab, but now we are being discriminated in this manner.” College principal Rudra Gowda said the students can wear hijabs on the school premises, but not inside the classrooms. The rule is being followed to ensure uniformity in classrooms, he said. Talking to the media in Udupi, the college principal, clarifying on the issue, said a parents-teachers meeting will be called to discuss the matter. “There are no provisions to have hijab as the uniform in our school’s rules. For the past three days, six students out of a total of 60 Muslim girl students are arriving at the college wearing Hijab. So, we have not allowed them to attend classes. They can attend classes if they remove the Hijab. We have called their family members and discussed the issue,” he said. On Saturday, a delegation including some students at the college along with some members of the Islamic Organization of India approached district collector Kurma Rao regarding the incident. Five girls who were stopped from entering the classroom were part of the delegation. Rao was not available for comment. Meanwhile, the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) Udupi unit chief Nazeer Ahmed said that the party will stage a protest if the students are not allowed to attend classes with their hijabs. In a press conference, the Campus Front of India warned of gherao if the college does not reconsider its decision of not allowing Muslim girls to wear hijab.The issue comes up at the time when the Karnataka government is pushing for the anti-conversion bill. The bill is yet to become a law as it is yet to be approved by the Legislative Council. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai termed the bill as both constitutional and legal. He said that the bill aimed at getting rid of the menace of religious conversion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/students-denied-entry-to-class-for-wearing-hijab-101641149967868.html
03-01-2022||India||Row erupts over move to free temples from Karnataka govt’s control||The BJP has hit back at the Congress after its president opposed the Karnataka government’s move to bring in a law to free temples from the state’s control. BJP national general secretary and former minister CT Ravi told reporters on Sunday that the Congress does not have the mindset to address issues pertaining to the majority community. Ravi said the Britishers in India took over the temples not because of the respect they had for the Gods, but for the income the temples generated, and the BJP is bringing a law to remove this practice. “It is a matter of faith, and it is given by devotees with the same in mind. The government doesn’t have to run on this donation money, it is the property of society. That money should be used for developing temples and social work. There is no need for this money to run the government,” he said. Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Wednesday said that the government plans to introduce a new bill to free temples and Hindus religious institutions in the state from government control. “Hindu temples are under different types of control bylaws and rules. Before the budget session, a law would be given shape to make our temples free from such restrictions. Temples will be allowed to function freely, and there will be only regulations,” Bommai said. Responding to this announcement, DK Shivakumar, president of Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC), on Saturday said that Congress is opposed to freeing temples from state control. “The state’s temples belong to the people. The BJP government in the state has decided to transfer this public property to the workers of the BJP and members of the Sangh Parivar. This is an anti-Hindu move and the people of the state, as well as Gods, would not forgive them. This is a huge blunder. Congress is not anti-Hindu; it is the BJP which is really against the interests of the Hindus.” “The government is planning to overturn the policy that has been in place for a long time. Apart from a few temples and mutts, the remainder comes under the control of the government. People contribute crores to these temples which have accrued over hundreds of years. The BJP is making plans to distribute these funds to their workers,” he added. There are 180,000 temples in Karnataka, among which 35,500 come under the Muzarai department. As per the records of the Muzarai department, there are 207 ‘A’ grade temples that get an annual income of more than ₹25 lakh, 139 ‘B’ grade temples that have an income between ₹5 lakh and ₹24.99 lakh. These ‘A’ and ‘B’ grade temples are required to submit accounts annually, as mandated by the law. Only four temples in the state -- Chamundeshwari temple of Mysuru, Yediyur Siddalingeshwara temple, Ghati Subramanya temple and Banashankari temple of Bengaluru -- are submitting audit reports every year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/row-erupts-over-move-to-free-temples-from-karnataka-govt-s-control-101641149964803.html
03-01-2022||India||Keep Covid guard up to avoid lockdown: Karnataka CM||Amid a spike in Covid-19 cases in Karnataka and its borders, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Sunday asked people to cooperate with the government in containing the spread of the disease and avoiding a lockdown. He said the officials of districts bordering Maharashtra have been directed to be extra cautious as the neighbouring state is witnessing a spike in cases. “Our stand is very clear. In the past, lockdown was imposed. The same should not happen again. For this, we are taking stringent measures. People have to cooperate with us,” Bommai told reporters in Bengaluru. The statement comes as daily increase in Covid-19 cases in Bengaluru is inching towards the 1,000 mark. On Sunday, Bengaluru reported 923 new Covid cases and three deaths. Karnataka on Sunday added 1,187 new cases to the state’s overall infection count. In comparison, Bengaluru reported 1,033 new cases on Saturday, 832 on Friday, 707 on Thursday and 566 on Wednesday. According to the health department bulletin, while the positivity rate for the day stood at 1.08%, the case fatality rate (CFR) was 0.50 per cent. There were 275 discharges on Sunday. Of the six deaths reported in the state, three are from Bengaluru Urban, and one each from Tumkur, Dakshina Kannada and Uttara Kannada. After Bengaluru Urban, Dakshina Kannada accounted for the second-highest number of new cases with 63 . Regarding extending the night curfew or imposing tough rules, he said it would be decided either on Monday or Tuesday. “We have to see how coronavirus is spreading. We saw it increasing in a big way in Bengaluru. We will take a call keeping that in mind,” he said. Bommai said he has directed the officials to be cautious in the districts such as Belagavi, Vijayapura and Bidar bordering Maharashtra, which is witnessing a rise in cases. He added that those entering Karnataka would have to be fully vaccinated and they should also possess a negative RT-PCR test report. “These measures will cause trouble to the travellers but we are doing it keeping in view the public health of people of Karnataka, especially Belagavi,” Bommai said. Keeping in mind the oxygen shortage last time, the government has now contacted the oxygen plants to supply life-saving to the state. “These plants have been asked to start operations in preparation for the spike in the cases. Also. I have directed the officials to add 4,000 more ICU beds in the state. We are also making preparations for adequate medicines,” he said. Stating that the government was also focusing on the vaccination drive, the chief minister said vaccinating teenagers from 15-18 years would start from Monday. Booster doses would be given to those who have co-morbidities, he added. Karnataka revenue minister R Ashoka said the spike in infections in Karnataka was a serious issue. “Bengaluru is in the Red Zone according to the list declared by the Union government. It is important to sound an alert in Bengaluru. We can save people’s lives if we impose more restrictions in Bengaluru and reduce the number of hospitalisations,” he said. He said that the government is mulling to announce ‘some tough rules’ in coming days. “We will convene a meeting and announce some tough rules before January 7 when the night curfew will be lifted,” Ashoka said. He added that the experts’ committee would convene a meeting before January 7. “We will implement the recommendations of the committee in toto because we have seen the sufferings and deaths last time,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keep-covid-guard-up-to-avoid-lockdown-karnataka-cm-101641149906074.html
03-01-2022||India||Chennai man kills self, wife, two sons due to debt: Police||A family of four, including a one-year-old child, were found dead inside their posh apartment in Chennai’s upscale Perungudi on Sunday. Police said the 36-year-old man killed his wife and two children and he died by suicide. According to preliminary investigations, the cause of the crime was the man’s mounting debt. “At least four money lenders showed up today at the apartment to whom he owed 80 lakh,” said the investigating officer in the case who did not wish to be named. “He seems to have promised to settle all the repayment on January 2.” The Thoraipakkam police station have registered a case under section 174 (police to enquire and report on suicide) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). As the new year began, the facts of the tragic crime that have emerged so far in the case have shocked the surrounding community. The apartment also provides assisted living for senior citizens. Money lenders and neighbours rang the bell several times on Sunday morning and since no one opened the door, they rang police control room. Cops and neighbours together attempted several times before they could open the main door. They found the man hanging from a ceiling fan. His wife, 35, was lying dead with a deep injury on her head. “He had hit her with a cricket bat,” the officer quoted above said. “We don’t know how he killed his children. We are waiting for the post mortem reports.” The children are two boys aged 1 and 10 years. The bodies of all four have been sent to Chennai’s Royapettah Government Hospital. Police suspect the murders happened after Saturday evening. “The door was locked from inside so we don’t suspect any other foul play,” the police officer said. The man and his family lived in a three-bedroom house for rent paying ₹35,000. The man had worked abroad at a Barclays Bank before returning to India. His native is Coimbatore district and he had been living in the Chennai apartment for a year. He had been working in a call centre in the city but recently has been out of a job, police said.
03-01-2022||India||CID to probe police attack on Koragas in Udupi: Home minister||Karnataka home minister Araga Jnanendra has said that the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) will take over the investigation into a police attack on members of the Koraga tribal community in Udupi district. During a pre-wedding mehendi ritual at Kota Thattu village on December 27, a police team had attacked Koraga community members, including the groom. “I am pained by the way the police department dealt with the Koraga community at Kota during a mehendi programme. This case will be handed over to CID. In addition, all those who were assaulted by police will be given ₹2 lakh from the government,” Jnanendra said after visiting the Koraga settlement on Saturday. He visited the house of the groom, Rajesh, and consoled the family members. “The sub-inspector of Kota police station did not bring the incident that occurred on the night of December 27 to the notice of higher officials. As he acted as if he was supreme, the situation went from bad to worse. The police system is there in place to control the outlaws and maintain peace in society. Police themselves should not behave like rowdies,” the home minister said. According to the complaint registered by members of the community with the police chief in Udupi, the incident occurred on Monday night when the police team, led by sub-inspector Santhosh, arrived at the groom’s house after neighbours complained of loud music. After an initial altercation with the locals, the team began assaulting those present at the ceremony and later took five people, including the groom, to the police station and assaulted them, the complaint said. The detention led to a protest outside the police station by the community members. The home minister said the attack on the community, categorised as a scheduled tribe (ST), has caused the government pain. “The innocent community, which is at the lowest rung of the society, rarely does this kind of mehendi programme. This incident has caused pain to the community and shocked the family,” he said. The attack on the Koraga community was the third incident where a police officer has faced action for assault against minorities. In September, the CID arrested a police sub-inspector for allegedly forcing a Dalit man to drink urine, while the latter was in custody in May. Arjun Horakeri, the sub-inspector posted with Gonibeedu police station, was produced before a court in Chikkamagaluru, and an additional district and sessions judge remanded him to 14 days judicial custody. On December 8, a police sub-inspector was suspended after he had allegedly manhandled a young man and forced him to drink urine in Bengaluru. Sub-inspector Harish KN was suspended after a departmental inquiry. He was charged with “dereliction of duty and not registering a complaint.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cid-to-probe-police-attack-on-koragas-in-udupi-home-minister-101641149786185.html
03-01-2022||India||Jagan to call on Modi, Shah for aid||Andhra Pradesh chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy is set to leave for a two-day visit to New Delhi where he is expected to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah, an official from the chief minister’s office (CMO) said. “He has got an appointment with the prime minister at 4 pm on Monday, and is expected to meet the home minister on Tuesday,” the CMO official said on Sunday. The official said chief minister Jagan would raise the issues related to flood relief funds and the Centre’s indifferent attitude towards the state during his visit. “He is expected to present a list of demands before them, among the others,” the official said. Nearly a month-and-a-half since heavy rains flooded south coastal and Rayalaseema districts of Andhra Pradesh, leaving a trail of destruction of properties and standing crops and claiming around 60 lives, the state government is yet to receive relief funds from the Centre despite representations made to Modi and Shah, apart from the reports submitted to the Central team which visited the flood-affected areas in the last week of November. The four south coastal districts of Krishna, Guntur, Prakasam and Nellore and four Rayalaseema districts of Kurnool, Anantapur, Kadapa and Chittoor received an average rainfall of 11.1 cm, against the normal rainfall of 3.2 cm between November 13 and 20, according to state meteorological department. In a single day, on November 19, the highest rainfall of 20 cm was recorded at Peddamandyam block in Chittoor district, followed by 19.3 cm in Galiveedu block of Kadapa district and 17.8 cm in Nallacheruvu block of Ananthapuram district. In a statement made in the state assembly representation on November 26, the chief minister said as many as 44 people were declared dead, and 16 others could not be traced. He pointed out that several highways, irrigation tanks and canals got breached and damaged at several places in Kadapa, Chittoor, Ananthapuram and Nellore districts. Somasila reservoir in Pennar basin received heavy inflows of more than 500,000 cusecs of water in 48 hours, causing inundation of low lying areas in Nellore town and Kovvur in the district. In all, 1,990 villages in 119 mandals across four districts were affected by the floods, of which 211 villages were completely inundated. As many as 1,169 houses were completely damaged and 5434 houses were partially damaged, the assembly representation stated. In a representation made to the prime minister on November 24, Jagan said the state had suffered a loss of ₹6,054 crores in the form of destruction of properties and infrastructure and damage to standing crops. He requested that the Centre release an amount of ₹1,000 crore towards immediate relief and restoration works in the flood-affected areas. On November 27, an inter-ministerial central team, headed by Kunal Satyarthi from the ministry of home affairs, toured the flood-affected areas for three days. The central team interacted with the affected people, besides holding a series of discussions with the state government officials. The team also had a winding-up meeting with the chief minister and appreciated the efforts made by the state government in providing relief to the people. “We have asked for the Central assistance what we are entitled to. So far, we have not heard anything from them,” state disaster management authority commissioner and secretary K Kanna Babu told HT. He said the state government was regularly following up with the Centre to get the promised assistance. “We hope they will extend the financial assistance at the earliest,” Kanna Babu added.

It is a question of national prestige and dignity,” Khan told reporters. “I am not going to respond to statements made out of sheer ignorance. Some of these statements are unfortunate and disturbing.”The state government and Khan have been at loggerheads over the appointment of vice-chancellors to universities. As far as a recommendation was concerned, it was within the remit of the university or the chancellor, Khan said. The governor is chancellor of universities in all states in India. “What I have to speak, I have spoken,” Khan said. “I am not going to respond to irresponsible and ignorant statements.”Chennithala had claimed on Saturday that the government rejected Khan’s recommendations to confer D Litt to the visiting President two weeks ago. Later, state opposition leader V D Satheesan of the Congress criticised Khan “for making an inappropriate recommendation.” Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, state secretary of the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist), however, denied any knowledge of the matter. “We have no idea about it,” he said. “Either the governor or Chennithala will have to explain it.” The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party has also asked the state government and political leaders not to insult constitutional positions. Khan’s remarks come in the midst of a standoff with the state government. In a letter sent to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan last month, Khan had said he was pained over the “dipping standard” of higher education and blamed it on “brazen political interference”. The reappointment of Kannur University vice-chancellor Gopinath Raveendran is among the points of contention. He was reappointed for four years in November after the state government issued a notification and appointed a selection committee for a new vice-chancellor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-talk-about-national-institutions-lightly-kerala-governor-hits-out-at-chennithala-s-remark-101641149725162.html
03-01-2022||India||18 years and fighting: HIV-infected Kerala mother seeks job for her educated children||Thiruvananthapuram: Stigmatised and alienated by the society for being HIV-positive, a woman and her three children in north Kerala’s Kottiyoor are fighting a valiant battle for 18 years. The mother, Rema (47), who was the face of the state government’s campaign against the dreaded disease and social stigma attached to it, now says she is tired of her fight. She wrote a letter to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in June, asking the government to provide jobs to her educated children to keep the hearth burning, but her wait still continues. An optimist and a fighter, she is hoping against the hope. The heart-rending tale of Rema and her three minor children surfaced in 2003 when a lower primary school in Kottiyoor (Kannur district) expelled her two children after it came to know that they were also infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It shocked the conscience of the state and she also threatened to fast outside the school. The school was forced to bend its knees before the fighting mother. Later the state government appointed her as a “positive worker” for three years and she drew a monthly stipend of ₹3000 then. As a “positive worker” she tried to bust some of the myths attached to the disease. Rema’s life turned upside down in 2002 when her husband K Shaji, who was working with a private firm in Mumbai, returned home after he was infected with AIDS. Later tests done on the mother and two children also revealed that they were infected -- the eldest daughter was negative. Her children were thrown out of their school but she fought back and ensured education to her children at the same school (HT had profiled her in 2003). Before his death, Shaji confided to his wife that he used to frequent red light areas in Mumbai. “I somehow married off my eldest daughter last year. She holds a post-graduate degree in engineering. And remaining two, a girl and boy, also completed their graduation and are waiting for a job. There were enough promises and claims but nothing happened,” said the mother, adding that they lived all these years due to magnanimity of some good Samaritans. ”Stigma, aversion and indifferent attitude are still there. I don’t know how I lived all these years. I have to fight every inch to open a path before us. I feel exhausted. My children desperately need jobs. There were enough promises and claims but all remained in thin air,” she said, adding that she thought of suicide several times but the innocent face of her children prevented her from it. “Even after 18 years, the attitude of the society remains same. My daughter was selected for a job last year but failed to get it because she’s HIV-positive. We don’t need sympathy but we need wherewithal to live an ordinary life,” she said, adding many film personalities and others promised help to her but all waned later. “We were subject of ridicule and discrimination. We fought our way back. But things remained more or less same. Society still views us with stigma and aversion. What we need is acceptability and means to live an ordinary life,” she said, adding she will meet the chief minister again to help her children get jobs. When contacted, a spokesman of the government refused to comment on the woman’s letter to the CM.
03-01-2022||India||45 new Omicron cases detected in Kerala||Kerala on Sunday reported 45 new Omicron cases, highest single day tally since the first case of the new Covid variant was detected on December 7. Total Omicron cases went up to 152 in the state, said health minister Veena George. Of the new cases nine persons came from high-risk countries and 32 came from the nations marked as low risk, the minister said in a statement, adding four contracted the infection locally. Among new cases 16 reported in Ernakulam followed by Thiruvananthapuram with 9 cases. Two days ago the state had logged 44 cases crossing the 100 mark. The minister has called for heightened vigil in view of rising cases. “We have to be extremely careful in coming days. We have to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour strictly. We have noticed people removing masks while talking and this should be discouraged,” the minister said, adding the state was well prepared with enough oxygen stock and beds. The state detected the first case of the new variant on December 7 and cases crossed 100 in less than a month. Experts said Omicron cases are likely to peak in the state in two months. The government said it has taken enough precautions to meet the exigency. At least 98 per cent of eligible population in the state received the first dose of vaccine and 77 per cent received both and experts said good vaccination rate will help contain the new threat of Omicron but they warned it is too early to lower guard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/45-new-omicron-cases-detected-in-kerala-101641149487584.html
03-01-2022||India||Covid cases double in Tamil Nadu in a week||In a week’s time Covid-19 cases have doubled in Tamil Nadu from the range of 600 new daily cases to 1594 new cases on January 1 which authorities link to the rapid transmission due to Omicron variant. There are 118 cases of the variant so far including the highest of 92 in Chennai. Chennai and adjoining district of Chengalpattu are reporting the highest Covid-19 cases in Tamil Nadu. The two districts on January 2 reported 776 and 146 cases, respectively which is a rise from 171 and 48 that it registered a week ago on December 26. Daily testing during both periods has been in the same range of more than a lakh. Since patients with Omicron only have a mild form of the disease, health minister M Subramanian said they’re likely to monitor people from home as cases are expected to go with the Pongal festival coming up in mid-January.The state is focusing primarily on vaccinating the population as part of its prevention measures. It held its 17th Mega Vaccination Camp in 50,000 camps across the state on Sunday. More than 14-lakh people got inoculated in a day at these camps.Addressing a press conference at a camp in Chennai, Subramanian said those infected with the Omicron variant mostly test negative after three days, and the state is repeating a test on the fifth day and only then discharging them. “It is not severe like the Delta variant where a majority required hospitalisation and oxygen support. Most patients are asymptomatic,” the minister said. Tamil Nadu will begin vaccination for children aged above 15 from Monday onwards. Chief minister MK Stalin will inaugurate the drive in Chennai on Monday, Subramnaian said, adding that 26 lakh school children in Tamil Nadu have been identified.Health secretary J Radhakrishnan said 96 lakh individuals are due to receive the second dose of vaccination while 70 lakh people are yet to receive the first dose in the state. The health department and Greater Chennai Corporation held a meeting on Sunday to discuss re-opening more Covid care centers and imposing more enforcement.The officials have decided to bring back infrastructure which was in place during the second wave driven by the Delta variant. The city will now bring back screening centres where patients will be triaged, 20 car ambulances for positive patients will be readied. Covid-19 control room will be re-opened at the city corporation which was functioning during the second wave.“People have dropped their guard so civic and police officials will together enforce 100% mask compliance in the city,” Subramanian said. Chennai’s corporation commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi said the civic body has collected ₹105 crore as fines from people who violated Covid-19 norms in public. About 5-lakh people are yet to be vaccinated in Chennai, he said, urging people to get vaccinated. On the eve of the new year, Tamil Nadu came up with more restrictions in view of the rising cases such as going back to 50% capacity in theatres, restaurants and fitness centres.

03-01-2022||India||Marriage bill: Women groups reach out to Parliamentary panel||Several women organisations have reached out to the Parliamentary committee assigned to examine the The Prohibition of Child Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which seeks to raise the legal age of marriage for women to 21, a senior member of the panel said on Sunday. “Many women organisations and individuals would be invited. We will hear views of different sections before preparing our report. Some women organizations have already contacted us to depose before the panel. This bill would not be reviewed hastily,” the member said, seeking anonymity.The remarks came after Shiv Sena MP Priyanka Chaturvedi pointed out that the panel of 31 members included only one woman. She was referring to Trinamool Congress MP Sushmita Dev. “Women participation for a woman centric bill! In a committee of 31 only 1 is a woman,” Chaturvedi tweeted. Another member, however, argued that the composition of the panel depends on the nomination of MPs by various parties and the decision of the Rajya Sabha chairman.“But we will hear many women and women organisations during the discourse on the bill. It would not be that the bill would be reviewed by only the men present in the committee,” the member said, seeking anonymity.“We are meeting on January 5 to decide the methodology of reviewing the bill. Usually, all committees invite public response for bills. We will also follow the same route.” Vinay P. Sahasrabuddhe, panel chairman, told HT. The Prohibition of Child Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 2021, was tabled in the Lok Sabha during the Winter Session of Parliament and later referred to a parliamentary panel for further scrutiny by a voice vote. The bill seeks to modify the definition of a child, stating that it means a male or female who has not completed 21 years of age. It also seeks to make consequential changes to various personal laws relating to the marriage of different communities to ensure a uniform marriage age.According to the draft legislation, “women are often put in a disadvantageous position in regard to higher education, vocational instruction, attainment of psychological maturity and skill-sets, etc. Entering into the employment sphere and being part of the workforce to make themselves self dependent ... is a critical area”. “These disadvantages perpetuate the dependence of women on men,” it added. The draft legislation seeks to amend seven personal laws – the Indian Christian Marriage Act; the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act; the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act; the Special Marriage Act; the Hindu Marriage Act; the Hindu Minority and Gaurdianship Act, and the Foreign Marriage Act. Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently backed the central government’s decision to increase the age of marriage of daughters from 18 to 21. “We have decided daughters will be allowed to marry at the same age sons are allowed to. With 21 years of age for marriage of daughters, they will get full time to study and will also be able to make their career,” he said. The bill evoked mixed responses. While a section of political leaders have extended their support, a few Muslim organisations have raised concerns over the bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/marriage-bill-women-groups-reach-out-to-parliamentary-panel-101641148464821.html

Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) and Police authorities are coordinating further action,” Vaishnaw tweeted. Meanwhile, the Delhi Police Sunday said they had registered a first information report (FIR) at the cyber cell police station of south east district against unidentified persons. The incident comes nearly six months (July 2021) after unidentified persons created an app and uploaded photographs of Muslim women with derogatory messages. No arrests were made in the case. One of the woman journalists whose doctored image was also uploaded on the app took to Twitter to express her anguish. She also posted a copy of the complaint she filed over the matter with the Cyber Cell of the Delhi Police. Acknowledging the complaint, the Delhi Police tweeted: “The matter has been taken cognizance of. Concerned officials have been directed to take appropriate action.” Another complaint was filed in Mumbai regarding the matter. “The case was registered under the Indian Penal Code. It is likely to be transferred to the Intelligence Fusion and Strategic Operations unit of Delhi Police,” said a senior cyber cell officer pleading anonymity. Meanwhile, a GitHub spokesperson said, “GitHub has longstanding policies against content and conduct involving harassment, discrimination, and inciting violence. We suspended a user account following the investigation of reports of such activity, all of which violate our policies.”  The incident evoked a strong criticism from many political sections, including Congress leader Rahul Gandhi who tweeted Sunday saying the humiliation and communal hatred against women will stop only when all raise a united voice against it. “The year has changed, the situation has also changed -- now we have to speak,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/muslim-women-s-photos-morphed-centre-steps-in-police-file-fir-as-outrage-mounts-101641148344787.html

The flight landed in Delhi at 11.15 am. As per standard operating procedures (SOPs), an aircraft has to take multiple permissions from ATC before taking off from an airport. It needs to take permission to push back from the aircraft stand. Then, it has to take permission before starting the engines. Then, it has to take permission to stand in the line up, and then a final permission is given for take off.“An enquiry is being held to ascertain the reasons for the lapse and based on the outcome, appropriate action shall be taken against those found irresponsible,” DGCA director general Arun Kumar said. “Pilots have been off rostered pending an inquiry,” a SpiceJet spokesperson said, seeking anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-spicejet-pilots-temporarily-suspended-for-taking-off-without-atc-nod-101641148224994.html

The circular, issued by the top court’s registry, said, “Keeping in view the rising number of cases of Omicron variant (Covid-19), the competent authority has been pleased to direct that…physical hearing (with hybrid option) before courts will remain suspended for the present and all hearings before the courts for a period of two weeks from and with effect from January 3 shall be through virtual mode only.”The notification came on a day when Delhi reported more than 3,000 cases on Sunday with the fast-spreading Omicron variant being reported from 23 states. On Sunday, India reported a little over 18,000 cases and 284 deaths, according to the dashboard maintained by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW).The Supreme Court had allowed physical hearings (with an option to login virtually) from October 7. This had continued till courts closed for vacation from December 18 onwards.The circular replaces the October 7 notification by which the Court directed that “all matters listed on Wednesday and Thursday would be heard only in physical presence of the counsels/parties in Court-rooms.” Later, a slight modification was introduced to this rule by allowing the respective courts to provide virtual link to lawyers on prior demand on these two days. On Mondays and Fridays, hearing was to be held through the virtual mode while on Tuesdays, the choice was open for lawyers to argue physically or virtually.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-covid-19-cases-rise-sc-suspends-physical-hearing-for-2-weeks-101641147926077.html

The Omicron variant being highly transmissible, a high surge in case can overwhelm the medical system. Therefore, leave no stone unturned in ramping up infrastructure to manage a high surge so that India escapes unscathed from this episode of Covid-19,” said Mandaviya during a review meeting on the pandemic situation and vaccination progress, the statement said.Also Read| Covid-19: Can at-home tests detect Omicron? Here's what experts are saying“The meeting was basically to discuss together bottlenecks and how the preparations can be expedited and streamlined to manage the expected surge,” said a health ministry official, who was part of the meeting.The health minister in particular directed states to better utilise funds under the Emergency COVID Response Package (ECRP-II ) for an adequate number of ICU beds, oxygen beds, paediatric ICUs, high dependency unit beds etc. So far, the states collectively have used just over 17% of the available funds.“Effectively use IT tools for tele-medicine and tele-consultation, including training and capacity building of human resources, timely availability of ambulances, readiness of states to operationalise Covid-19 facilities for institutional quarantining, and effective and supervised monitoring of those in home isolation,” he said.The health minister also emphasised that irrespective of the Covid-19 variants in circulation, measures for preparedness and protection remain the same. He asked the states to re-invigorate their teams to work at the ground level and strengthen monitoring and containment mechanisms.Critical bottlenecks in medical infrastructure were also discussed at the review, according to the statement. “We have put up a strong fight against Covid earlier and this learning must be used to re-focus on efforts against the Omicron variant. There is a continued need to follow Covid appropriate behaviour along with renewed and stringent focus on containment measures for addressing the present surge,” he said.He also asked states to start preparations to administer Covid vaccine doses to children aged 15-18 years from January 3. “We must focus on planning with regard to the 15-18 age group vaccination and precautionary doses for eligible beneficiaries. Ensure that the healthcare workers and frontline workers are fully vaccinated, as they form the vulnerable categories,” said Mandaviya.While appreciating the efforts of states and UTs in achieving the national average of 90% coverage of first dose vaccination of all eligible adults, he urged those states, whose progress of vaccination is below the national average, to ramp up their vaccination campaign.“States were also advised to prepare a weekly plan to catch up and exceed the average national vaccination coverage and review the implementation of this plan on a daily basis at the level of Secretary/ACS Health [with special emphasis in 5 poll-bound States of Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Manipur],” read the health ministry statement.Also Read| Covid spreading faster than it was in second national wave: DataStressing on the need to ensure smooth implementation of new vaccination guidelines, States were advised to ensure the orientation of vaccinators and vaccination team members for vaccination of 15-18 years age-group, and the identification of dedicated session sites for vaccination of 15-18 years age-group. To avoid the mixing-up of vaccines during administration, separate covid vaccination centres, separate session sites, separate queue (if at same session where adult vaccination is ongoing) and separate vaccination team (if at same session site) should be formed.States have also been asked to share their requirement of vaccine doses through district wise estimation of beneficiaries using CoWIN, and plan for distribution of Covaxin to identified session sites well in advance and publish sessions for at least 15 days to provide sufficient visibility.
03-01-2022||India||Child safety, content moderation among key issues in social media law outline||Growing cybersecurity challenges, child safety and content moderation are among the aspects raised in a preliminary discussion paper circulated in the ministry of electronics and information technology regarding the need for an international standard law for social media companies, officials familiar with the matter said.The contours of the law, which are being discussed in the ministry, may also expand to include user harm regulation and response, definitions and regulation of high-risk artificial technology and privacy concerns surrounding new equipment such as wearable devices. These are among the challenges outlined in the discussion paper, a copy of which has been reviewed by Hindustan Times.The move comes amid a series of charges against Meta (formerly known as Facebook) by a former employee in UK stating that the social media giant stokes online hate and extremism, fails to protect children from harmful content and lacks any incentive to fix these problems“It is recognized that while technology and internet have many advantages, several challenges in user harm, security, child safety have emerged that need legislative response,” the discussion paper states.“It is time to look at the digital India legislative architecture differently — instead of more laws and more authorities — why not look at current laws, rules and institutions and see if we can pivot and transform them into being aligned to future needs of digital India, that is, global standard cyber laws,” it adds.On November 26, Union minister for electronics and IT, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, had told HT that the Centre is deliberating a “global standard law” for social media companies to curtail user abuse. “For a country like India, where 800 million users are online, it becomes imperative to develop a safe and open cyberspace as the country moves towards a $5 trillion economy,” Chandrasekhar said then.At present, the different laws that govern the technology sector in India include the Telegraph Act, the information technology act, the new intermediary guidelines, TRAI Act and sections of the IPC. The country’s first data protection law is also in the works, with the joint parliamentary committee examining the framework tabling its report in the winter session of Parliament.“The IT Act and TRAI Act date back to the pre-internet, pre-digital India era,” states the discussion paper. “Current laws are rigid, inflexible, narrow and do not enable evolutionary policy making,” it says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/child-safety-content-moderation-among-key-issues-in-social-media-law-outline-101641147872936.html
03-01-2022||India||Haridwar event: 5-member SIT set up to probe hate speech case||A five-member special investigation team (SIT) was constituted on Sunday by Uttarakhand Police to probe the hate speeches at a religious gathering in Haridwar. A criminal case has been already filed in the matter.The move comes a day after investigators added two more names — Yati Narsinghanand, the organiser of the event, and Sagar Sindhu Maharaj — to the list of accused persons, the Uttarakhand’s director general of police Ashok Kumar said on Saturday, taking the total number to five. The first information report registered on December 23 listed only one accused, Jitendra Narayan Tyagi, formerly Waseem Rizwi. Later, two more names, Annapurna Maa alias Pooja Shakun Pandey, and Dharamdas Maharaj, a general secretary of the Hindu Mahasabha, were added.The SIT has been formed “for a fair and unbiased probe”, said Karan Singh Nagnyal, deputy inspector of police, Garhwal range.“The SIT will be led by a superintendent of police, assisted by an additional SP, one inspector and two sub-inspectors. The case, which was being investigated by Haridwar Kotwali police, will be handed over to the SIT. Necessary legal action will be taken against the accused after investigation,” said Nagnyal.Police have added Section 295(a) (insulting a religion with deliberate and malicious acts) under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) to the complaint. Earlier, only Section 153 (a) (promoting disharmony, enmity or feelings of hatred) of the IPC was mentioned.In another development, police on Sunday registered one more case against accused Tyagi at Jwalapur police station of Haridwar after receiving a complaint from a local resident. “Following a complaint by a local resident Nadeem Ali, a case was registered against him under Sections 153(a) and 298 (deliberate intention of wounding the religious feelings of any person) of the IPC,” said inspector Chandrakar Naithani, station house officer of Jwalapur police station. The decision to assign a special team to probe the politically sensitive case comes against the backdrop of criticism that the police probe has been moving at a slow pace. On Friday, lawyer Kartikeya Gupta said police should have been more “active” in probing the case relating to communal issues.Uttarakhand police chief Kumar, however, insisted police are “taking all necessary action” in the case.The event where hate speeches targeting minorities were made from the podium was held from December 17-19 in Haridwar.A police case was registered after videos of the event emerged on social media on December 22. Initially, the case was assigned to a sub-inspector of the Kotwali police station for investigation.

The measures were announced following a meeting of the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine (SMVDSB) with the L-G. More than 27,000 pilgrims had visited the cave shrine on Saturday, while over 15,000 visited on Sunday till 6 pm, officials said.“Chaired a meeting of SMVD Shrine Board. Several decisions have been taken to ensure safety of pilgrims. Besides ₹10 lakh announced as an ex-gratia, additional amount of ₹5 lakh to be given to the next of kin of the pilgrims who lost their lives in the unfortunate tragic incident,” Sinha, who is also the chairman of SMVDSB, tweeted.The L-G said that directions were “issued for physical and systematic improvements wherever required after critical examination, augmentation of infrastructure:. “Online booking to be made 100 per cent,” he said. Besides these, Sinha informed that measures such as “decongestion of the entire track, appropriate use of technology for effective crowd control and queue management besides RFID tracking shall be put in place”. The meeting also discussed the modalities for suspension bridge, a ropeway and skywalk for effective queue management, besides identifying more halting spots to cater to large crowds at the Mata Vaishno Devi Bhawan and Katra, the base camp for the pilgrims visiting the shrine atop Trikuta hills in Reasi district, an official spokesperson said.The members of the board will monitor the implementation of the decisions, the L-G said.On Saturday, at least 12 people were killed and over a dozen others were injured in the stampede as hundreds of thousands of pilgrims rushed to offer prayers at the shrine on the first day of 2022.The J&K administration has constituted a three-member panel, headed by principal secretary (home), to probe the incident and submit its report within a week. It also announced a relief of ₹2 lakh to the injured which will be paid by the Shrine board. While an official said the stampede likely occurred after an altercation between some boys among the pilgrims, witnesses alleged mismanagement on part of the shrine and also demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the alleged lapses. J&K director general of police Dilbag Singh said action will be taken against those involved in the alleged scuffle that led to the stampede. ““The committee constituted would look into the causes that led to the stampede,” Singh said.Replying to a question whether police will take action if those involved in the scuffle were identified, he told PTI “yes” and added that “police would do its work simultaneously”.Meanwhile, the administration has issued a public notice asking eyewitnesses to share information on the incident.“It is for the information of the general public that any person who desires to furnish any facts, statements, electronic evidence etc. regarding the incident (stampede) may share the same,” the notice issued by Jammu Divisional Commissioner Raghav Langer, one of the members of the probe panel, said. “Any person, who desires to furnish any facts, statements,evidence may share the same on email Id: divcomjmu-jk@nic.in or at whatsapp number 09419202723 or at landline number 0191-2478996 by or before January 5.

03-01-2022||India||Measures to conserve Western Ghats to be delayed by 6 months||Measures to conserve the ecologically sensitive Western Ghats will be delayed by another six months after the central government extended the deadline to notify the new rules till June 30 citing difficulties in consultations due to the coronavirus pandemic, a notification from the Union environment ministry stated. Earlier, the deadline was set to expire on December 31. The union environment ministry issued a notification on December 31 amending the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986. In rule 5, sub-rule (3) and clause (d), “for the words, letters and figures 31st December, 2021, the words, letters and figures 30th June, 2022 shall be substituted,” the notification stated. The clause applies to prohibition or restrictions imposed by the government on the location of industries or the carrying on of processes and operations in an area.After floods and landslides in the Western Ghats in Maharashtra and Kerala last year, experts had called for an immediate demarcation of the ecologically sensitive areas. The government intends to prohibit or restrict industrial and developmental activities in some 37% of the area of the mountain range, an area of 59,940 sq km spread over five states. The environment protection act rules enjoin the central government to consider all observations and objections within 120 days of publication in the official gazette, and impose the new curbs within 180 days which has been now been amended to extend the timeline. The five Western Ghats states – Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Goa, Maharashtra and Gujarat – have opposed several of the measures. Last year, these states did not agree with the Union environment ministry’s fourth draft on the subject in a notification dated October 3, 2018. In view of the pandemic, the ministry had on June 16 extended the validity of the notification till December 31. But once again, the five states were not able to reconcile their differences, a ministry official said, requesting anonymity. Several activities such as mining, operating thermal power plants or specified polluting industries, building townships and area development will either be completely banned or severely restricted. The Western Ghats is an ecologically fragile region. An expert panel led by ecologist Madhav Gadgil in 2010 recommended that 75% of the 129, 037 sq km area should be declared an environmentally sensitive area because of its dense forest and a large number of endemic species. In 2013, a panel headed by rocket scientist K Kasturirangan scaled it down to 50%. The Kasturirangan report’s recommendations were further diluted, and four draft notifications have been issued since. “The need for conserving Western Ghats ecology without compromising local livelihoods has been recognised in various planning, policy and scientific documents,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at the Centre for Policy Research, a think tank. “Its legal and regulatory enforcement has, however, been a vexed process. “This new extension for the finalisation of the notification represents political negotiations and prioritisation challenges of various governments,” Kohli said. “It is also an important moment to strengthen the process by reflecting on post-Covid consciousness around public health, food security and biodiversity.” Several experts have linked unplanned construction and quarrying to the worsening of disasters in the Western Ghats. “I know what kind of vested interests are prevailing. They are nurtured. They are the construction lobby who work so that the rich can make more and more money,” Gadgil had told HT in an interview in October after floods in the Konkan and landslides in Uttarakhand. “People in the Konkan have now started talking a great deal about improper construction of bridges, high embankments and highways in vulnerable areas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/measures-to-conserve-western-ghats-to-be-delayed-by-6-months-101641146425111.html
03-01-2022||India||Number Theory: A data wish-list for the New Year||Every day, the data and political economy team of the Hindustan Times brings you stories we call Number Theory. They are based on databases from India and sometimes even abroad. We will continue to do this in the New Year as well. However, to give tradition and our readers a welcome-break, we have decided to do a wish-list on behalf of the data and political economy team. The stories we do depend on availability of data. In most cases, whether or not such data is available, is a function of the government deciding to collect or publish such data. Here are four databases our team would like to have access to in 2022. Census of India data 2021 was supposed to be the year of the decadal census in India. This exercise has not been delayed even once until 2011 since 1881, when India conducted its first full census. 2021 is over and we do not know what the progress is vis-à-vis the conduct of this all-important data collection exercise. In a response to a Lok Sabha question on December 7, 2021 the government simply said that the 2021 census and related activities “had been postponed” in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. This decision would have made sense a year ago, when we knew little about the pandemic and did not have vaccines. But with the country well on its way towards fully vaccinating all adults; we have announced vaccines for even children and booster doses now, it does not make any sense. When seen against the fact that a lot of contact-intensive activities; commercial as well as things like campaigning for elections, are going on like business-as-usual scenario, it seems preposterous that the census should be delayed anymore. This is all the more important because the census is not just about the number of people living in India. It gives us a whole lot of valuable information, from employment, languages spoken and quality of dwelling as well as access to various amenities. Given the fact that a lot of census data is available only after years of completion of the exercise, it makes even more sense to start the process as soon as possible. Consumption Expenditure Survey The Consumption Expenditure Survey (CES) used to be conducted every five years by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO). The latest published estimates of the CES go back to 2011-12. That is 10 years back in time. While the NSSO did conduct a CES in 2017-18, the report was scrapped after leaked findings in 2019 suggested a drop in inflation-adjusted average consumption levels. The decision to scrap the report was widely condemned by academics. However, what is even worse is the fact that we do not have clarity when another CES will be conducted and its findings published. The CES is not just about whether or not there was a fall in average consumption levels from one period to another. Given the economic shock of the pandemic, this is now a very likely possibility. It also tells us how consumption baskets of households changes over time, an information which is essential for updating other important economic databases such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket and even the GDP series. To give an example, India’s households consumed a lot more cereals than vegetables a couple of decades ago. Now, if we did not have regular CES data to capture this fact, our inflation numbers would have failed to capture the price burden (or lack of it) on household budgets because they would not have increased the weights of vegetables or reduced that of cereals. Lack of such data is not just a handicap for journalists like us, it also blindsides policy, especially at a time when boosting household demand is an important economic challenge.A socio-economic caste census Political pressures driving policy is often cited as a bane in India. However, its importance as a safety valve of sorts for our democracy cannot be overstated. Caste is one of the biggest routes through which politics has driven policy in India. 2022 is likely to be an eventful year on this count, with a lot of political parties making a demand for conducting a caste census in India, a practice which was abandoned in 1931 by the British. To be sure, the politics is behind such a demand is not driven by some esoteric quest for statistics. It is using this to build a case for breaching the existing 50% cap on reservations by increasing the 27% quota for Other Backward Classes (OBCs). Most survey-based estimates suggest that OBCs account for more than 40% of India’s population. While such data clearly shows that in relative terms, OBCs continue to lag behind the population which does not belong to Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST) or OBC groups. However, this is entirely consistent with the possibility that in terms of absolute numbers, the rich among OBC ranks are at par, even greater than their non-SC-ST-OBC counterparts (see https://bit.ly/3JqYbqJ for example). An HT editorial had described the demand for a caste census as something with a “troubling premise and potentially disturbing consequences”, but also an eventuality which “is inevitable now”. Whenever such a census is conducted, and it is likely that 2022 will see concrete movement on this count, it is essential that the exercise looks at the socio-economic traits of each sub-caste in India rather than just doing is a simple head count. This is absolutely essential for an informed overhaul of affirmative action policy in the country.A detailed district-level testing database of the pandemic If there is one count where 2022 already looks ominous, it is on the pandemic front. With the Omicron variant of the Covid-19 virus spreading rapidly, it looks like we are set for a third nation-wide wave of the pandemic. To be sure, we do not know whether infections from the Omicron variant will be as severe as the ones due to the Delta variant, which, to put it politely, tested the limits of India’s medical infrastructure. If there is one statistic which will answer this question about Omicron, it is consistent availability of hospitalisation across the country.The Hindustan Times newsroom, in line with the best in the world, has tried to analyse the pandemic on the basis of numbers. This endeavour was driven by both government data, as well as public data communities such as Covid19india.org stepping up by creating data sets out of disparate pieces of statistics around the pandemic. Despite these efforts, there continue to be significant gaps in public access to consolidated pandemic statistics. District-wise testing numbers and therefore positivity rates are one such key statistic which we still do not have. More than anything else, it hides the adequacy of testing outside the large urban centers or state capitals, something this story by Abhishek Jha had highlighted vis-à-vis Uttar Pradesh, India’s largest state (https://bit.ly/342HFNn). This is one data the government can make available at the stroke of a pen. And doing this will make our and everybody else’s news coverage of the pandemic far more informed.
