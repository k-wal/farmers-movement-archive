There should be adequate preservation of the right to privacy and dignity in regard to separate toilets and shower facilities, said the advisory issued on Monday.There are currently 70 transgender prisoners lodged in jails in India, National Crime Records Bureau data show.“However, while making a provision for a separate enclosure/ward for transgender prisoners, due care must be taken by the prison authorities that this may not result in their complete isolation or propagate social stigma among such prisoners,” the advisory said.The self-identity of transgender persons must be respected at all times in regard to admission procedures, medical examination, search, clothing, requisitioning of police escort, treatment and care inside prisons, the home ministry said.For this, prisons may facilitate the process of acquiring transgender identity certificates under the provisions of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, if such a request is made by the person concerned, the ministry said.Transgender should be included as a category in prison registers as well as electronic records. In case a court warrant does not mention the self-identified gender of the inmate, the prison superintendent must make changes in the document with the help of legal authorities, the advisory said.The transgender rights law, which came into effect on January 2020, provides for the recognition of the identity of transgender persons, prohibition against discrimination and including them in education, health, social security programmes as well as other welfare measures of the government.“The transgender inmates in Tihar are well assimilated with other prisoners. Currently, we have about 8-10 transgender inmates,” said a warden of Tihar jail, the country’s largest prison complex. “The transmen are lodged in male prisons, while transwomen are in female prisons according to their choice,” he said, requesting anonymity.“As far as prisons are concerned, the person concerned should have the right to decide where he or she wants to be inside the prison,” said Chayanika Shah of the Labia Foundation, a queer feminist LBT Collective.The body search of a transgender person may be conducted by a person of their preferred gender or by a trained medical professional, and the person conducting the search much ensure the safety, dignity and privacy of the inmate, the home ministry advised.Prison authorities have further been asked to provide health care facilities and meetings with family and legal advisors at par with other prisoners. The advisory asks prison chiefs to train and brief the staff about the protection of rights of transgender persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mha-seeks-separate-jail-wards-for-transpersons-101641922416164.html
11-01-2022||India||Disturbing that ex-top cop of Mumbai Police has no faith in own force: SC||The Supreme Court on Tuesday lamented what it called a “very disturbing scenario” in Maharashtra where Mumbai’s former police commissioner Param Bir Singh does not have faith in his own force while the state government does not trust the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).“This is a very disturbing scenario but unfortunately this is the ground reality. A former head of the police department (Singh) does not have faith in the police... What does one do when authorities start expressing doubts against each other and say they don’t trust each other,” remarked a bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh.The court was hearing a petition by the IPS officer, who alleged a witch-hunt against him while seeking the transfer of investigation in six criminal cases from Mumbai Police to CBI.At present, CBI is conducting an investigation into Singh’s complaint accusing former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh of running an alleged extortion racket using the police. While the Bombay high court directed a CBI probe against Deshmukh on April 5 last year, the Supreme Court affirmed this order on April 8.Singh, in his petition filed in November 2021, alleged that as a consequence of this complaint, which he addressed to state chief minister in April 2020, false criminal cases were foisted upon him at the behest of some criminals against whom he took action during his tenure as the commissioner of Mumbai Police. He was suspended from service by the state government on December 2, 2021.In previous hearings on November 22 and December 6, the bench granted protection from arrest to Singh in the extortion cases while also restraining the Mumbai Police from filing the charge sheet against him in these cases.On Tuesday, the bench took note of the affidavits filed by CBI and the Maharashtra government in the matter as it regretted the lack of confidence shown by both on each other.In its affidavit, CBI alleged that Maharashtra police was trying to “meddle in the court-entrusted investigation” being conducted by CBI by registering cases against Singh on facts overlapping with the criminal investigation pending against Deshmukh.Supporting Singh’s plea for transfer of probe in connected criminal cases to the central agency, CBI alleged that there was clearly an attempt by the state government to “jeopardise” the ongoing probe against Deshmukh by overreaching the orders of the Supreme Court and the Bombay high court through lodging cases that involved common facts and evidence.“The present set of issues highlighted by the petitioner (Singh) deserve to be entrusted to CBI for a complete, thorough and impartial investigation...if the investigation is not entrusted to CBI, the mandate of this honourable court may remain unfulfilled...there is a need to ensure the integrity of the investigation conducted by CBI,” stated the agency’s affidavit, imploring the bench to let it examine the criminal cases against Singh as part of its investigation against Deshmukh.Countering assertions by CBI and Singh, Maharashtra, in its affidavit, maintained that there were no overlapping facts between cases being probed by the agency and the state police, and that such statements by CBI were based on “conjecture”.The state added that it even urged the Bombay HC to transfer the probe against Deshmukh from CBI to a court-monitored special investigation team. While the HC dismissed the state’s writ petition on December 15, 2021, the Maharashtra government added, it has now challenged the dismissal order in the top court.On Tuesday, CBI, represented through solicitor general Tushar Mehta, submitted before the bench that the state should be asked not to take steps in any manner that may prejudice the court-ordered investigation against Deshmukh. He added that all orders by the Maharashtra government or any of its departments into the matter should be subject to the order of the court.On his part, senior advocate Darius Khambata, appearing for the state government, argued that Singh faced several cases and charges, including disciplinary proceedings by the state government, and all those could not be made a subject matter of the present petition.Appearing for Singh, senior advocate Puneet Bali contended that the state government was using policemen of “dubious character” to foist false extortion and corruption cases on his client.“Nobody is holier than thou in this scenario... This is the same police force that you headed. Now, what do we say, the head of the police force has no trust in the police force, the administration has no trust in the police. This is a disturbing scenario,” commented the bench.Noting the submissions made by the parties and the subsequent developments, the bench said that it would not pass any further directives in the matter especially since the Maharashtra government has approached the top court for getting the investigation against Deshmukh transferred from CBI.“Now, the state government took a particular avenue by which they did not think it was appropriate for the CBI to look into it. We do not know which bench of this Court will consider it and what view they will take. Let us see,” said the bench, adjourning the case to February 22.

He will be taken to Raipur where he will be produced before a judge, the EOW said in a statement.GP Singh, a 1994 batch Indian Police Service officer (IPS), was the additional director general of police of Chhattisgarh’s anti-corruption bureau (ACB) and EOW teams till June last year when he was shunted to the state police academy. He was suspended on July 8 after a first information report (FIR) filed by EOW alleged that his assets were disproportionate to his known sources of income.A statement issued by Chhattisgarh’s EOW on Tuesday said GP Singh was taken into custody from Haryana’s Gurugram near national Capital Delhi because he wasn’t cooperating with investigators.“The accused, suspended under the charges of Prevention of Corruption Act sections 13 B, 13(2) and IPC sections 201, 467, 471 (forgery and enriching himself illicitly during the period of his office), wasn’t cooperating in the investigation of the case and nor coming to EOW office even after legal notices,” the EOW statement said.“On Tuesday, a team of EOW took Singh into custody for enquiry from Gurugram… Singh will be produced before the court in Raipur after he reaches Raipur and further action will be taken,” the statement said.Singh approached the Chhattisgarh high court on November 26, 2021 to protect him from arrest in the case, alleging that he was falsely implicated, but the high court declined the request.Investigators conducted searches at 15 locations linked to Singh between July 1 and 3, and later claimed to have discovered documents related to movable and immovable assets worth over ₹10 crore. An ACB statement issued on July 3 alleged that he allegedly amassed assets disproportionate to his known sources of income and indulged in a “massive exchange of money”.“Singh also allegedly tried to commit money laundering by investing in shell companies,” the statement said.A week later, the Chhattisgarh government ordered probes in three cases against the suspended IPS officer. In these cases, GP Singh has been accused of hushing up a case of police atrocity in 2013, helping an alleged criminal by forging documents, and misappropriating money claimed to have been recovered from a Maoist leader when he was posted as the inspector general Durg Range in 2018.Tuesday’s police action comes just a day after the Chhattisgarh high court cancelled a FIR accusing ex-bureaucrat Aman Singh of corruption, ruling that the EOW registered the FIR without any evidence and that the case against Aman Singh and his wife was based on probabilities and “an abuse of process of law”.
11-01-2022||India||Tripura transgender persons allege police stripped them to prove gender identity||AGARTALA: Four transgender persons have alleged that personnel from Tripura police stripped them on Saturday in a bid to prove their gender identity. The transgender persons were later released after they were allegedly asked to give an undertaking assuring not to wear “cross dress” ever again or else, they will be arrested. They alleged that on Saturday night they were on their way back from a party organised at a hotel in the capital city of Tripura when they were stopped by a police team and taken to custody. “While we were coming back from a DJ party in a hotel at around 11 pm on January 8, a few police personnel and a man who claimed to be a reporter stopped us. We were taken to West Agartala Women Police Station where we were asked to strip in presence of both male and female police in the night. They even taunted about our dress code and character, “ said Mohini, one of the transgender persons. She added that they were accused of extorting people with fake gender identity. The transgender persons claimed that their source of income through make-up art has suffered loss since a few videos of their harassment became viral on social media, and they, including many other transgenders in different parts of the state, faced harassment in their respective localities. However, some of these videos were deleted from the social media after they sought intervention of the Agartala Press Club. They also alleged that the police made them sit on the floor and did not get them food even after telling the police that they were hungry. “We demand justice for ourselves and action against the police personnel and the reporter who were in the police station on the incident night, “ she said. Sneha Gupta Roy, an LGBTQ+ rights activist and a transgender person, said, “Their life at home and in their localities are stigmatized after a few videos of their harassment went viral on social media. This has also caused pain to our community both psychologically and emotionally. “ “ It’s all about struggle for identity. Whatever happened is violation of human rights. We will fight legally to get them justice, “ said Nilanjana Roy, counsel of the distressed transgender persons. Later, on Monday evening, they filed a complaint at West Agartala Police Station. An official from Tripura police, on the condition of anonymity, said that they were arrested under Section 51 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) having provisions of preventive arrest. “I have heard they were held under Section 51 of IPC and we have asked for a report to ascertain on what grounds they were arrested,” said the official, adding that they can seek intervention of either the Human Rights Commission or Police Accountability Commission if they have faced harassment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-transgender-persons-allege-police-stripped-them-to-prove-gender-identity-101641920255960.html

11-01-2022||India||Global economy heads for a sharp slowdown, India to grow at 8.3%: World Bank||Global economic growth will dip sharply from 5.5% in 2021 to 4.1% in 2022 and 3.2% in 2023, even as India’s annual growth is projected to be 8.3% in the current fiscal year, 8.7% in 2022-23, and 6.8% in 2023-24, according to the World Bank’s Global Economic Prospects Report, released on Tuesday. The report also flagged the risks posed by growing inequality and rising inflation.After having recovered in 2021, the global economy is headed towards a “pronounced slowdown”, due to the new variants of Covid-19; a rise in inflation, debt and income inequality; the winding down of fiscal and monetary support; and the fading of pent-up demand – all of which have eroded recovery prospects in emerging and developing economies in particular.“The rapid spread of the Omicron variant indicates that the pandemic will likely continue to disrupt economic activity in the near term. In addition, a notable deceleration in major economies — including the United States and China — will weigh on external demand in emerging and developing economies. At a time when governments in many developing economies lack the policy space to support activity if needed, new Covid-19 outbreaks, persistent supply-chain bottlenecks and inflationary pressures, and elevated financial vulnerabilities in large swaths of the world could increase the risk of a hard landing,” said the report.In its outlook for South Asia, however, India stands as a relatively bright spot. The Bank’s 8.3% growth projection for India in 2021-22 is unchanged from its June 2021 outlook. But the forecast for 2022-23 and 2023-24 has been upgraded to 8.7% and 6.8%, respectively, “reflecting higher investment from the private sector and in infrastructure, and dividends from ongoing reforms”.India’s economy is expected to grow 9.2% this financial year, according to advance estimates from the country’s statistics office, ensuring that the economy exceeds its pre-pandemic level (2019-20). Most high frequency indicators were at or above pre-pandemic levels in December, although January has been marked by increasing disruptions caused by restrictions on account of the Omicron-driven third wave of the coronavirus pandemic.The World Bank report flags risks specific to South Asia – the emergence of Omicron could hinder economic activity with mobility restrictions and lower external demand; upward price pressures could lead to inflation expectations becoming unanchored, “worsening domestic financing conditions, eroding real incomes and weakening the financial sector”; and, with an increase in climate risks, the region remains vulnerable to climate-induced increases in poverty, disease, child mortality and food prices.Inequality, between and within countries, and inflation, both in the advanced and emerging economies, will complicate recovery.The report points to the possibility of a sharp divergence in growth prospects in advanced economies and emerging economies – by 2023, all advanced economies will have achieved a full output recovery; yet output in emerging and developing economies will remain 4% below pre-pandemic trends.“The pandemic has raised global income inequality, partly reversing the decline that was achieved over the previous two decades. It has also increased inequality in many other spheres of human activity — in the availability of vaccines; in economic growth; in access to education and health care; and in the scale of job and income losses, which have been higher for women and low-skilled and informal workers. This trend has the potential to leave lasting scars: for example, losses to human capital caused by disruptions in education can spill over across generations,” said the report.Inflation will further complicate recovery. “Rising inflation – which hits low-income workers particularly hard – is constraining monetary policy. Globally and in advanced economies, inflation is running at the highest rates since 2008. In emerging market and developing economies, it has reached its highest rate since 2011. Many emerging and developing economies are withdrawing policy support to contain inflationary pressures – well before the recovery is complete.”India isn’t an exception on the inflation front. Retail inflation continues to remain within the central bank’s comfort level but in excess of 4% (it was 4.9% in November), with core inflation (excluding food and fuel) remaining even higher at 5.9%. Wholesale inflation was high, too, at 14.23% in November, mainly on account of a rise in food and fuel prices.

We request your urgent action on the Armed Forces Special Powers Act and the brutality and injustice that have accompanied its operations in our homeland for the last 63 years,” said the memorandum signed by members of various influential Naga civil society organisations including the Naga Mothers’ Association, Naga Students Federation, Global Naga Forum, Eastern Nagaland People’s Union Dimapur and Konyak Union Dimapur.Stating that the killing of civilians in Oting last month was not an isolated incident, the memorandum maintained that Afspa has repeatedly deprived innocent civilians of their right to life which contradicts the very concept of human rights and the reason for governments to exist.Besides the repeal of Afspa, the signatories also requested that the prime minister take cognizance of the serious human rights crimes alleged to have been committed by the security forces in the Oting massacre by bringing justice to the victims and their families, and ensuring that the perpetrators are brought under civil court for criminal prosecution.They also underscored the need for the government of India to take cognizance of previous allegations of excesses by the Indian military and compensate the victims or the nearest kin.“We earnestly request you to recognize the state government’s role of handling law and order of the state, and make provisions that henceforth Afspa 1958 will not be enforced in Nagaland,” the memo said.The demand for repeal of Afspa has been growing since 13 civilians were killed at Oting in Nagaland’s Mon district and another in Mon town on December 4 and 5 last year in a botched military operation. Subsequently, the Nagaland state assembly called an urgent session on December 20 and adopted a resolution to press for repealing the Act. On December 26, the Centre constituted a high-level committee to examine the demand for withdrawal of the Afspa from Nagaland, whose recommendation is expected in February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagalands-walkathon-against-afspa-ends-outside-raj-bhavan-campaign-continues-101641914615791.html

If roads could be cleared for the chief minister, why not for the Prime Minister? Because a plan was made in the chief minister's office to embarrass the Prime Minister and BJP," Majithia was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.“It's not about PM Modi alone. It's about the Prime Minister's chair. It's a constitutional post. The most protected person is the Prime Minister of the country,” the SAD leader said.Majithia further said the culprits involved in planning and plotting of the incident should be nabbed.Modi, who was on his way to Ferozpur in poll-bound Punjab on January 5 to lay the foundation stone of several development projects, faced a security breach when his convoy was stuck on a flyover for 15-20 minutes as a group of farmers blocked the route, which was around 30km away from the National Martyrs Memorial in Hussainiwala.Hours after the breach, Modi told officials to thank the Punjab chief minister that he returned to Bhatinda airport alive.On Monday, the Supreme Court directed the Centre to set up a panel, headed by a former SC judge, to probe the alleged breach.Channi has said that there was no threat to the Prime Minister's security, adding no protestor was seen in the one-kilometre range of Modi’s cavalcade.Meanwhile, lawyers have alleged that they received an anonymous, pre-recorded call from a group claiming responsibility for the incident on January 5. Hindustan Times earlier reported that the call appeared to be from the banned group Sikhs For Justice (SFJ).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-roads-can-be-cleared-for-punjab-cm-why-not-majithia-on-pm-security-breach-101641910106278.html

Union civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia expressed gratitude for the approval. In a tweet, Scindia said, “Extending gratitude on behalf of the citizens of Shivpuri to union labour and environment minister Bhupender Yadav for the gift of tiger safari to Madhav National Park in Shivpuri on my request. This will not only provide employment to the youth but will also increase tourism in Madhav National Park in future.” Scindia met Yadav in August this year and sought his ministry’s approval for developing a tiger safari in Madhav National Park. The park’s additional director Anil Soni confirmed that the central government has approved tiger safari in Madhav National Park. “An enclosure of about 5 to 10 hectares will be developed in Madhav National Park on the lines of Ghorela enclosure of Kanha Tiger Reserve for soft release of the tiger. A similar enclosure of about 25 hectares will also be built for breeding and increasing the prey base. The tigers from Kanha and Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserves will be shifted to tiger safari,” Soni said. The national park staff will be trained at Panna Tiger Reserve, where tigers were successfully reintroducted in 2010. In Shivpuri, the last tiger was seen in 1996. In 1998, a tiger safari project was proposed. Madhya Pradesh state government will develop another tiger safari near the hill station of Panchmarhi where tigers from Satpura Tiger Reserve will be shifted. (with inputs from Ranjeet Gupta)

If there is a statutory obligation in filling up a vacancy, at best within six months, anything beyond that is unconstitutional,” a three-judge bench headed by justice AM Khanwilkar said in preliminary observations during a hearing into a bunch of petitions filed by the 12 MLAs against the assembly resolution of July 5, 2021, to suspend them from the House for a year.The MLAs were accused of misbehaving in the House and using “abusive language” against the presiding officer, Bhaskar Jadhav.The bench, also comprising justices Dinesh Maheshwari and CT Ravikumar further stated, “Even if we accept the argument that the House has the power to suspend, you cannot create a constitutional void or hiatus where a constituency remains unrepresented for a year. If a member is expelled, there is a vacancy that can be filled within six months. This is worse than expulsion as the constituency has no remedy. Each constituency has equal power to be represented.”The observations followed the arguments by the MLAs, represented by senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi, Mahesh Jethmalani and Sidharth Bhatnagar.Jethmalani said that principles of natural justice were not followed as the MLAs were not heard before passing the resolution. Rohatgi said that the only means to punish an unruly act of a member of a House is by suspending the legislator for a maximum period of 60 days or expelling the said legislator, in which event, the seat has to be filled by a fresh election.However, Bhatnagar submitted that under Article 190(4) of the Constitution, a seat can be declared vacant due to a member’s absence without permission for a period of 60 days. Keeping a member suspended beyond this period has a detrimental effect on democracy, Bhatnagar said.Appearing for the Maharashtra government, senior advocate CA Sundaram told the court that the power to suspend was absolute and there could be no fault with that decision of the state assembly. He further stated that the unruly acts were witnessed by the Speaker and members and they were within their power to pass the resolution of July 5. The speaker was not represented in the proceedings.The bench told Sundaram, “Your argument is dangerous for democracy. Absolute power doesn’t mean unbridled power. Who knows this can be a precedent for experimentation. Today it is 12, tomorrow it may be 120. Is it not hitting the basic structure of the Constitution?”The court said that these are just prima facie thoughts and would not be the final outcome. It gave time to the state government to prepare its reply to the questions posed by the Court and posed the matter for hearing next Tuesday.In their petition filed through advocate Abhikalp Pratap Singh, the 12 MLAs -- Sanjay Kute, Abhimanyu Pawar, Ashish Shelar, Girish Mahajan, Atul Bhatkalkar, Harish Pimpale, Parag Alavani, Yogesh Sagar, Jayakumar Rawat, Narayan Kuche, Ram Satpute and Kirtikumar Bhangadia -- stated that the resolution for their suspension, brought by the parliamentary affairs minister Anil Parab, was a “malafide” action as it was passed with a majority voice vote. The resolution accused them of misbehaving in the House and using “abusive language” against the presiding officer Bhaskar Jadhav.In March 2017, the Devendra Fadnavis government also moved a resolution to suspend 19 MLAs of the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party for nine months for creating ruckus in the assembly during the presentation of the annual budget. The suspension, however, was revoked the following month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dangerous-for-democracy-sc-rebuts-maharashtra-on-suspension-of-bjp-mlas-101641912155515.html

11-01-2022||India||Chhattisgarh mulls perks equivalent to constables to ‘sahayak arakshak’||RAIPUR: The Chhattisgarh government is planning to provide ‘perks and privileges’ equivalent to constables to the assistant constables (sahayak arakshak), officials said on Monday. Officials further said that chief minister Bhupesh Baghel instructed the police headquarters (PHQ) to make a plan in this regard and also ensure that how these ‘privileges’ and ‘perks’ can be provided to these assistant constables of the state who are mostly posted in the Maoist affected regions of the state. According to a senior official of the PHQ, there are around 31,000 assistant constables in the state who are paid ₹15,000 a month. The assistant constables can be directly recruited by the Inspector General of Police of the range and are mostly surrendered Maoists or former special police officers. In 2005, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Raman Singh government started a campaign Salwa Judum, which was a government-sponsored vigilante movement to fight Maoists. During this phase the state appointed special police officers (SPOs). But in 2011, the Supreme Court banned Salwa Judum and the state government made these SPOs assistant constables. These lower rank personnel were recruited from among local tribal youth and surrendered Naxals in Bastar division and most of them are part of the District Reserve Guard (DRG) - the frontline anti-naxal force of the state. Notably, a month back, the assistant constables protested in Bijapur and Raipur and demanded better pay and promotion from the government as early as possible. The families of cops from the lower ranks from different parts of the state reached Raipur in a bid to gherao Police Headquarter (PHQ) in Nava Raipur demanding promotions, higher salaries and better work conditions, including compassionate appointments and weekly-offs. Commenting on the government’s plan, Bela Bhatia, a human rights activist working in Bastar said, “While the assistant constables as government workers have a right to demand payment that is non-exploitative, just giving in to their demands is not enough. The government needs to review the security-centric policy of dealing with the Maoists that the employment of these assistant constables is part of.” “This policy has led to extensive militarisation and an unending spiral of violence in Bastar since 2005 and is no longer credible. The government should roll back this policy and resort to peaceful negotiatiations with the Maoists instead. Only then will the Adivasis of Bastar have a chance to live non-exploitative lives,” she said. A senior police officer of the PHQ said, “The chief minister has instructed us to chalk out a plan how to benefit these assistant constables as they are very important for anti-naxal operations in Maoist-hit region. We will soon submit a report to CM and then an announcement will be made by the government,” 
11-01-2022||India||Delhi riots: Cops says Umar Khalid's ultimate aim was to bring govt to its knees||The Delhi Police on Tuesday said the “ultimate objective” of student activist Umar Khalid was to bring the government of India to its knees and destabilise the foundation of democracy while opposing his bail plea in a riots conspiracy case.Khalid, a former student leader of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), and several other activists have been booked under stringent provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), and accused of "masterminding" of the riots in the national capital that had left at least 53 people dead and over 700 injured in February, 2020.The arguments on their bail pleas have been going on for more than five months.Special public prosecutor (SPP) Amit Prasad further contested Khalid’s claims that the investigating agency was communal and the charge sheet in the riots conspiracy case was a “figment of imagination”.Arguing before additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat, Prasad said, “The ultimate objective was to overthrow the government and undermine the authority of the parliament, which enacted the Citizenship (Amendment) Act CAA and destabilise the very foundation of the democracy.”“The idea was to bring the government of India on its knees and enforce the withdrawal of CAA. It is not that I am making the statement. This is evident from the chats which clearly state that the government has to be brought to its knees.”Stating that riots in northeast Delhi were not a spontaneous outburst of violence, Prasad said, “From the charge sheet, we have demonstrated that 23 protest sites were created and those sites were not organic in nature. They were meticulously planned with the location which was in close proximity to the masjids (mosques).”“Multiple teams were formed to monitor these sites, given logistic support, there were remote supervisors, local leaders and people who were visiting. We have also demonstrated the use of identical placards and banners at different protest sites which clearly shows that they were not organic and created in a coordinated manner,” he added.Prasad said the protests were not woman-dominated, rather they were managed by men, and protest sites were swelled by bringing in women from the outside.“We have also demonstrated from the charge sheet that there was a clear interrelation between December 2019 riots and the February 2020 one. A similar pattern of crime was followed – blocking of roads, attacking police, destructing properties, and (indulging in) violence with public and police,” he said.The charge sheet disclosed that 53 people died, he said, adding that 101 police officers and 41 public persons were injured in the first phase of riots in December 2019. In the second phase, 132 police officers and 76 public persons were injured.“There was clearly a case of death and injuries to persons. Total damage and claim settlement amount to ₹21.93 crore. 61 claims have been settled and more are yet to be settled,” the SPP said.The investigation in the case revealed that firearms, petrol bombs, acid attacks, sticks, iron rods, stone-pelting through pre-fabricated large-sized slingshots were used to attack and kill police personnel, government employees, and public persons, he added.Prasad further said that Khalid, through his lawyer, focused on “irrelevant materials” while arguing his bail application in a bid to divert the court's attention.“He (Umar) wants his application to be decided with reference to a web series and present case to be equated with 'The Family Man' or 'The Trial of the Chicago 7'. You do not have something on merit, you want to divert the attention of the court, focus on irrelevant materials, you want to go on media trial, create headlines,” the SPP said.On September 3, 2021, Khalid, through senior advocate Trideep Paid, said the charge sheet in the case read like a script from a web-series 'The Family Man' and news channels. The lawyer also gave a reference to Voldemort, a villain in Harry Potter movies, to draw parallels between the statements in the chargesheet. Again on December 9, he referred to 'The Trial of the Chicago 7' in the courtroom.The SPP said, “To equate the riots in which 53 lives were lost with a web series is unfortunate. He does not want to refer to the law laid down by the constitutional courts. The idea is that you create a public perception. You want to refer to something which is relevant in media and not the law. The entire submission has been made on surmises and conjectures.”He further said the court cannot go on a speculative analysis.Besides, Prasad opposed Khalid’s claims that the investigation agency and the investigating officer are communal.“I do not appreciate my learned friend arguing that the investigation agency and the Investigating officer are communal. The investigation agency is not of a particular person, it's of a State. The first conviction in the riots case was that of a Hindu. To say that the investigation agency is communal does not go well,” he said.In the last hearing, Umar, through his lawyer, said that advocacy against a law like the CAA is not a crime and that police pressured the witnesses to give statements against him.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-riots-cops-says-umar-khalid-s-ultimate-aim-was-to-bring-govt-to-its-knees-101641908059636.html
11-01-2022||India||As Covid cases rise, govt’s Covid task group head shares 3 steps to contain spread||With the number of daily new Covid-19 infections in the country rising steadily, a top government expert has listed three steps that could help contain the spread of the transmission of the coronavirus.Chairman of the Covid-19 working group of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) Dr NK Arora on Tuesday said the three factors of following Covid-appropriate behaviour, enhancing vaccination coverage and imposing curfews could help tackle the rapid spread of the infection.Further, he said the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) has rightly estimated that Covid-19 cases are set to surge in the coming days.“IIT's modelling shows Covid cases will increase rapidly in the coming days, which is, in fact, happening. Covid-appropriate behaviour and vaccination coverage are two important factors to contain its spread. Administrative steps like curfews also help,” news agency ANI quoted Arora as saying.Also read | At 168,063, India sees fall in fresh Covid cases; Omicron infections at 4461On January 8, IIT Madras said the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic could peak by the middle of February. “What we expect from the exploratory data analysis is that the peak will happen somewhere between February 1-15 and our analysis also shows that as compared to previous waves, there will be a sharper increase to the peak,” Dr Jayant Jha, assistant professor at the department of mathematics in IIT Madras, told news agency PTI.The remarks from him came even as the government began administering a precautionary third dose for healthcare and frontline workers, who were the first among India’s priority groups to receive the jab when the country’s immunisation drive started in January 2021.Citizens above 60 years of age with comorbid conditions are also eligible for the third dose.Moreover, the vaccination drive has also been recently expanded to include youngsters above 15 years of age, while it was only for those above 18 years previously.Regarding the Omicron variant, which is largely attributed for driving the third wave of infections in the country, Arora said at least three sub-lineages of the variant have been observed so far but their behaviour has been the same.“There are three to four sub-lineages of the Omicron variant of coronavirus. These sub-lineages could be different when it comes to diagnosis but their epidemiological behaviour is the same,” he said.Earlier this month, he said there were “epidemiological similarities” between India and South Africa, where the Omicron variant caused a rapid surge in daily infections. He said the number of cases started falling in two weeks in South Africa and most of them were either asymptomatic or had mild illness.“We may see a somewhat similar pattern in India as far as the third wave is concerned,” he had said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-covid-cases-rise-govt-s-covid-task-group-head-shares-3-steps-to-contain-spread-101641906467306.html

The three pillars of democracy - legislature, judiciary and executive - are being destroyed. The media is also working at the behest of the three pillars of democracy. No one is paying heed to the citizens of the country. There is a sense of fear among citizens,” read the letter.Also read | 'Nijaat' campaign helps addicts shun drugs, alcohol in Chhattisgarh“The right to vote is the supreme right of democracy which is being executed through EVMs. No nationally or internally recognized institutions or governments have certified the EVMs as a cent per cent accurate. Despite this fact, by conducting polling using the machines in India, which is the biggest democracy in the world, the constitutional right of my vote is being violated. There is no guarantee whether my vote is cast in favour of whom I pressed the button through the EVM machine,” he said.The CM's father further said it is the constitutional duty and responsibility of the Election Commission and the central government to introduce such a transparent system of voting and counting in the elections, which can be evaluated by the public, the voters themselves.Many developed countries in the world have adopted ballot paper and box systems of elections, he said."In such circumstances, when all my rights are being violated, then the very purpose of my life is getting lost and being a citizen of India, my conscience is not allowing me to live any longer. Honourable President Ji, you have taken an oath to protect the Constitution, but my constitutional rights are not being protected, due to which I have no option but to die," he said.Urging the President to issue an order to conduct elections using ballot papers in place of EVMs in the larger interest of healthy democracy, he added, “if voting with ballot paper is not possible, then he (President) should allow me euthanasia on National Voters' Day on January 25 this year”.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/voting-via-ballot-papers-or-euthanisia-chhattisgarh-cm-s-father-writes-to-prez-kovind-101641904774735.html

Purohit moves plea for in-camera trial||MUMBAI: Lt Col Prasad Purohit, an accused in 2008 Malegaon bomb blast case, on Tuesday filed a plea urging the Special NIA Court to carry the trial in-camera. Purohit claimed that the media was allowed by the court to cover the trial with certain restrictions. However, there has been violation of the conditions of the court order. Purohit, who is accused of floating Abhinav Bharat a right-wing group allegedly part of the blast conspiracy, moved the plea before special NIA judge Prashant R Sitre through his counsel, advocate Viral Babar. Purohit giving reference to an order dated October 1, 2019, passed by the special court has said that the said order clearly specified the terms of references and restrictions imposed on media while reporting about this particular case. “Since the above mentioned order has been passed by this court the said order has been completely violated, the permission given to the media in the restricted form may be please withdrawn completely and no presence of media allowed in the courtroom during the proceedings. It is requested that in the interest of justice and conduct of fair trial the case should remain confined to the court room and should not be allowed to be highjacked by opinion makers and anti-national opportunists,” said the plea. Purohit has pointed out that the court had restrained media from conducting interviews, debates, interactions or discussions of any kind on the subject matter, to print / publish /display the same in any whatsoever manner till the end of the trial. Special NIA Judge Sitre has called for replies of all the parties concerned. Sameer Kulkarni, another accused in the blasts case, has opposed the application and informed the court that similar application by NIA for in-camera trial has been rejected by the court. The truth should come out before the public, he said. The investigating agency moved a similar application for in-camera trial, which was opposed by journalists, and the Special NIA Court later rejected it. The prosecution has till now examined 222 witnesses in the case out of which 16 have turned hostile.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/malegaon-2008-blast-case-lt-col-purohit-moves-plea-for-in-camera-trial-101641905316560.html

11-01-2022||India||Gauhati HC seeks detailed affidavit from Assam govt on alleged fake encounters||The Gauhati high court on Tuesday asked the Assam government to file a detailed affidavit within two weeks on alleged fake encounters by the state police since May last year.Hearing a petition filed by lawyer Arif Jwadder, a division bench of justices Sudhanshu Dhulia and Soumitra Saikia directed that a detailed counter affidavit should be filed by Secretary (Home) or Additional Secretary (Home).In his petition filed last month, Jwadder mentioned that 80 incidents of fake encounters had happened in the state since May 2021 and resulted in 28 deaths and left 48 injured.On January 3, the court directed Assam’s advocate general Devajit Saikia to inform about progress made in cases of alleged fake encounters. On Tuesday, Saikia informed the court that magisterial inquiries were held into the cases.Appearing on behalf of the petitioner, senior advocate and former Additional Solicitor General of India Indira Jaising informed there is no such information available on the inquiries and urged the court to direct the state police to upload FIRs on their website, if FIRs were lodged.In his petition, Jwadder sought an order from the high court for the registration of an FIR in the alleged fake encounter cases and an independent investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), a Special Investigation Team (SIT) or a police team from another state, under the supervision of the court.He also sought a judicial inquiry by a sitting judge of the Gauhati high court into the alleged encounters and monetary compensation to the families of the victims after due verification.Besides the state government, Assam Police, the department of law and justice, National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and the Assam Human Rights Commission have been named as respondents in the petition. The high court admitted the petition but is yet to list any date of hearing.In his petition, Jwadder stated that the people killed or injured in fake encounters by police were not dreaded criminals and modus operandi of all such incidents according to the police version are the same.“It is stated that the alleged accused tried to snatch service revolvers of police personnel and in self-defence, police had to retaliate and kill or injure the alleged accused…It can’t be the case that all the alleged accused could snatch a service revolver from a trained police officer whose pistols are normally tied to a rope to the waist belt of the officer,” the petition, which HT has seen, stated.It added that while police version mentioned about the accused trying to snatch weapons from police, there were no mention of the accused aiming or firing at police personnel. Also, all the encounters took place at night and the victims were unarmed and handcuffed at that time.In July last year, Jwadder filed a complaint against such incidents with National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). The commission sought a report from Assam police in September. In November, NHRC transferred the case to the Assam Human Rights Commission. The complaint is still pending.In July last year, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma asked police personnel to shoot at legs of alleged criminals if they tried to escape from police custody. The opposition Congress has been targeting the state government over the encounters terming most of them as fake.
11-01-2022||India||John Kerry to visit India soon to take climate dialogue forward||NEW DELHI: US special envoy for climate John Kerry and India’s Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav had a telephone conversation on Tuesday and discussed the prospect of meeting soon, keeping in mind the evolving Covid-19 situation, in order to take the Climate Action and Finance Mobilisation Dialogue (CAFMD) forward. Kerry is expected to visit New Delhi this month or sometime in February for a meeting with Yadav.“We cannot confirm the dates of the meeting because everything depends on the Covid-19 situation. But it will be organised shortly,” an environment ministry official said.During Tuesday’s phone call, they discussed a wide range of issues including Kerry’s forthcoming trip to Delhi, India’s ambitious targets that it announced during the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow last year, and the possibility of India and America working together to achieve those stated goals. Yadav and Kerry focused on the CAFMD during their conversation. They agreed to start negotiations under the climate dialogue framework as soon as possible.New Delhi and Washington launched the CAFMD in September as part of a partnership that aims to attract investment and technology in clean energy projects. The climate dialogue is one of the adopted tracks to finance projects for climate change mitigation under the India-US climate and clean energy agenda 2030.On November 1, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced at the Glasgow summit on climate change that India’s non-fossil energy capacity will reach 500GW by 2030, meeting 50% of the country’s energy requirements by 2030.He said India will reduce its total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes between now and 2030; reduce the carbon intensity of India’s economy by 45% by 2030 over 2005 levels; and achieve net-zero emissions by 2070. Modi flagged that these ambitious actions would be impossible without adequate climate finance from developed nations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/john-kerry-to-visit-india-soon-to-take-climate-dialogue-forward-101641898895013.html
11-01-2022||India||Odisha panchayat elections in 5 phases from Feb 16; OBC politics in spotlight||BHUBANESWAR: Elections to panchayati raj institutions in Odisha will be held in five phases between February 16 and 24 this year with a complete ban on political rallies in view of the rising Covid-19 cases, state election commissioner Aditya Prasad Padhi said on Tuesday. The election commissioner said voting for 853 zilla parishad seats, 91,916 wards and 6,794 gram panchayats will be held on February 16, 18, 20, 22 and February 24 between 7 am and 1 pm. The counting of votes, which will be done at block sadar level, will be held on February 26, 27 and 28. Padhi said model code of conduct has come into effect from Tuesday and will be in force till February 28. “In view of Covid cases, only door to door campaigning with not more than 5 people including the candidate would be allowed. No physical rally of political parties or probable candidates or any other group related to election would be allowed. Political parties and candidates are advised to conduct their campaign as much as possible through digital/ virtual/ mediaplatforms/ mobile based mode instead of physical mode ensuring strict compliance of Covid safety norms. Only fully-vaccinated persons after negative RT-PCR or Rapid Antigen testing will be allowed into the counting centres,” said Padhi. This will be one of the few times in Odisha when an election is held with caste at the forefront with political parties competing amongst themselves to give more representation to the Other Backward Caste (OBC) community who constitute at least 54 per cent of the total population. While the ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD) initially said it will give 27 per cent of the tickets to OBCs, last month it upped it to 40 per cent. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress have not made any announcement on how many of the tickets will they give to OBCs, but have indicated that they may match or surpass the BJD’s number. The state government’s plans for reservation of seats for backward castes for the first time in panchayat polls came to a standstill after the Orissa high court in December ordered the government to withdraw its notification on reservation of seats for the forthcoming panchayat polls and publish a new notification citing a judgement by the Supreme Court which quashed the Maharashtra government’s ordinance making 27% reservation for OBCs in all zilla parishads and panchayat samitis without collecting data on OBCs in every municipal body seat. In September last year, the Odisha Assembly passed the Odisha Panchayat Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which would have ensured at least 21 per cent vertical reservation for the OBCs as a little more than 28 per cent of the seats are to be reserved for SCs and STs. With no official reservation for OBCs now possible, the BJD has announced giving 40 per cent of the tickets to the backward class. The Congress and the BJP, which wanted postponement of the polls citing Covid-19 cases, have dismissed the claims of the BJD saying the party has taken the easy way out rather than challenging the high court order in the Supreme Court. “We would challenge the HC order on OBC reservation before SC in next couple of days. Let the poll process go on. We are determined to get at least 27 per cent reservation for the OBCs in the panchayat polls,” said Surath Biswal, head of the BJP’s OBC morcha. Though caste has never been a factor in the state’s politics, the BJD’s stirring the OBC pot may have been triggered by fears of the opposition BJP trying to target them ahead of the panchayat polls. Senior BJP leader and union education and skill development minister Dharmendra Pradhan, himself an OBC, early last year wrote a letter to chief minister Naveen Patnaik urging him to reserve seats for students belonging to the OBC category and the socially and economically backward classes. In the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the BJP went to town stressing on Modi’s OBC roots. The verdict of 2022 panchayat polls will determine whether the BJP has gained any strength after it challenged the hegemony of the BJD in 2017 panchayat polls winning 297 of the 851 zilla parishad seats, its best ever performance in the rural polls. The 2017 panchayat poll laid the ground for a sterling performance for the BJP in 2019 Lok Sabha polls when the party secured 38.4 per cent of the votes and won 8 Lok Sabha seats. In the Assembly polls held simultaneously with Lok Sabha polls, the party secured 32.5 per cent of the votes winning 23 of the 147 seats. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik who did not campaign for his party in 2017 panchayat polls which led many in the party to believe the reason for BJD’s ‘under-performance’, has left no stones unturned this time as he went around campaigning in several districts over the last 3-4 months distributing smart health cards under Biju Swasthya Kalyan Yojana, a health insurance scheme that allows the beneficiaries to get free treatment in private hospitals. Patnaik has showered sops such as raising the upper age limit for government jobs to 38 years, incentive to anganwadi and SHG workers, money for repair of houses in village areas, increasing the pay of over 33000 junior teachers in schools by over 50 per cent and regularizing jobs of over 8100 contractual teachers in schools. Unlike 2017 panchayat polls when counting of votes was held in each panchayat on the day of polling which revealed the names of victorious candidates, in 2022 panchayat polls the counting will be held centrally at the block level on different dates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-panchayat-polls-to-be-held-in-feb-parties-rely-heavily-on-obc-votes-101641898175219.html

"It is the country's best hospital. It has treated over 22,000 patients so far," he said later. The chief minister further said, "Delhi has the capacity to set up 37,000 beds with 11,000 ICU beds."Most cases of coronavirus during the third wave are showing mild symptoms unlike the second wave, which was caused by the Delta variant, he said, adding the Omicron variant of Covid-19 is less virulent but highly contagious.Meanwhile, the DDMA on Tuesday ordered the closure of restaurants and bars, and asked private offices, except those engaged in essential services, to shift to work from home (WFH) mode amid massive a surge in Covid-19 cases.The order came as the positivity rate in the Capital reached 25 per cent after 19,166 fresh Covid-19 cases were logged on Monday, around 3,500 fewer than Sunday’s count of 22,751.This drop was likely due to lower testing usually on Sundays and public holidays.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-worry-cm-kejriwal-promises-no-lockdown-in-delhi-amid-covid-19-spread-101641892730706.html

But political workers, in collusion with police, stopped not only the public, but also the PM from attending the rally. It has only strengthened the resolve of BJP workers,” news agency ANI quoted Shekhawat as saying.The minister was addressing the media at the BJP’s headquarters in New Delhi after a programme in which leaders from Punjab joined the party. “Eminent personalities from Punjab #JoinBJP at party headquarters in New Delhi,” the party’s Punjab unit wrote on Twitter.Former Punjab Congress MLA Arvind Khanna, Gurdeep Singh Gosha of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and former Amritsar councillor Dharamveer Sarin joined the BJP during the event in which Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri was also present.Also read | Explainer: SC, SPG Act and PM Modi's securityThe remarks came after some opposition leaders, including Congress leaders Randeep Singh Surjewala and Navjot Singh Sidhu and Samajwadi Party supremo Akhilesh Yadav, said the PM would have only addressed “empty chairs” had the programme taken place.This was not the first instance when Shekhawat alleged a conspiracy behind the incident. On January 7, he blamed the ruling camp in the state for the security failure during Modi’s visit. “PM Modi is not a person, he is an institution. The country felt relieved and thankful after hearing the PM returned alive. This was not just the Punjab government's failure, but a well-organised conspiracy directed by Congress leaders,” he had said.Several other BJP leaders have blamed the Congress government for the security lapse. However, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi has denied such allegations. A probe is underway.Modi was scheduled to visit Ferozepur in Punjab for inaugurating multiple development projects, which was cancelled during his trip to the location after his convoy was stuck in a flyover, nearly 30km away from the National Martyrs Memorial in Hussainiwala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-s-ferozepur-rally-would-have-seen-highest-ever-turnout-but-gajendra-shekhawat-101641894035326.html
11-01-2022||India||‘Diverting forest land for other purposes to cost 1.5 times more’||NEW DELHI: It will cost 1.5 times more to divert forest land for other purposes, according to a revised formula to calculate the one-time payment of net present value (NPV) by the environment ministry. The ministry informed all states and Union territories about the new rates in a letter on January 6. HT has reviewed a copy of the letter. For example, diversion of very dense forests in the so-called Eco-class 1 will now cost ₹15.95 per ha compared to ₹10.43 lakh earlier . Similarly, diversion of the open category of forests will now cost ₹11.16 lakh per ha compared to ₹7.44 lakh earlier. This will act as a deterrent to industries and projects on the extent of forest land they seek to divert, environment ministry officials said. The collected amount goes to the Compensatory Afforestation Fund. “This upward revision is unlikely to be deterrent against diversion of forest land as it’s understood to be a routine exercise as allowed by the apex court,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at the Centre for Policy Research, a think tank. “The ministry has processed this as business as usual without a reflection or evaluation of whether NPV has been an effective mechanism for forest conservation. There has been an increasing demand world for governments to review their reliance on monetary offsets like compensatory afforestation or NPV.”In compliance with the Supreme Court’s order dated March 28, 2008 in T N Godavarman Thirumalpad vs. Union of India case, the ministry started imposing an NPV in lieu of diversion of forest land for various development projects. The apex also directed in its order that the environment ministry should revise the rates every three years.“This is the first time NPV rates have been revised after 2009. The first letter with NPV rates were issued to states in 2009. The revision was long pending,” a ministry official said on condition of anonymity.The Supreme Court’s central empowered committee recommended the concept of NPV to compensate for the loss of forest land due to developmental projects. A committee chaired by Kanchan Chopra, former director, Institute of Economic Growth submitted a report in 2006, which was examined by the empowered committee. The top court in 2008 directed the envirnment ministry to impose NPV on projects involving forest land diversion.NPV has been determined based on the ecological importance of forests falling in different eco-value and canopy density classes. For calculating the average NPV per hectare of forest in India, the monetary value of goods and services provided by the forest were considered by the committee, including the value of timber and firewood; non-timber forest products; fodder; ecotourism; ecological services of forest; and value of flagship species and carbon sequestration value. In effect, the amount has to reflect the current value of all these.NPV shall be charged to the extent of 10 times of the normal NPV payable in the case of national parks and five times in the case of wildlife sanctuaries. The use of non-forest land falling within national parks and wildlife sanctuaries may be permitted on payment of an amount equal to the NPV payable for the adjoining forest area. For non-forest land falling within marine national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, the amount shall be five times the NPV payable for the adjoining forest area, the letter stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/diverting-forest-land-for-other-purposes-to-cost-1-5-times-more-101641893374570.html

The first park designated as “Waste to Wonder” was opened for the public by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) in February 2019. It features replicas of the seven wonders of the world which have been set up using 150 tonnes of scraps of automobile parts and other metal waste such as rods, iron sheets, nut- bolts, bicycle and bike parts, and old appliances that were lying rusting in municipal yards. The then SDMC municipal commissioner, Puneet Goel, reported that the idea of the park was inspired by Kota's Seven Wonders park in Rajasthan, where a scene of Bollywood film Badrinath Ki Dulhania was shot. A corporation team visited Kota Park in 2017, following which the Delhi project was conceptualised.

11-01-2022||India||Despite Covid-19 surge, travel bookings see negligible drop||India is seeing a surge in Covid-19 cases, but that hasn’t deterred the spirit of travel enthusiasts. Though curbs are in place in Delhi and some neighbouring states, youngsters seem more than willing to escape the city for a quick break, albeit cautiously. Moreover, with many companies going back to the work from home setup, professionals are game to go on a workation to someplace nearby for a breather. Namit Kapoor, a software engineer from Gurugram, is spending this weekend in Mussoorie to escape the curfew in Delhi. “We’ll return on Monday morning. Everything will be shut in Delhi, so we can have a mini vacay with precautions before more curbs are imposed,” he says. And Kritika Jain, a chartered accountant from Delhi, has planned a road trip to Shimla with colleagues: “We’ll be working from there. Our hotel needs negative RT-PCR reports of guests.” Resort owners say there have been cancellations, but not a lot. “We are seeing longer stays and rescheduling, along with a certain percentage of cancellations. Also, guests who have recovered from Covid-19 are willing to travel to drivable destinations,” says Allen Machado, CEO, Niraamaya Surya Samudra.Another reason for steady bookings, industry players say, is that people want to avoid crowded cities when Covid-19 cases are on the rise. “Families do not want to return to the city due to the [Covid-19] surge, and some companies have announced WFH. So, guests are taking advantage of that,” says Pranav Maheshwari, co-founder, Vista Rooms.Prahlad Krishnamurthi, chief business officer (CBO), Cleartrip, says: “Travellers are looking for flexible options that have them covered in case of a sudden change in regulations due to the new Covid-19 variant. Leisure destinations such as Goa, Chandigarh and Jaipur are showing strong uptick compared to 2021.” Leisure travel may see a slight downfall in the coming weeks, feels Manish Rathi, CEO and co-founder of IntrCity. “People will postpone family vacations as the virus spreads. There may be some impact on leisure trips to the hills or pilgrimage sites. At the moment, we’re seeing a minor impact on daily ticket bookings at a few leisure destinations,” he adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/despite-covid-19-surge-travel-bookings-see-negligible-drop-101641884254330.html
11-01-2022||India||Why is Google facing probe in India over abuse of dominant position?||Antitrust body Competition Commission of India (CCI) ordered a probe against Google last week for abuse of dominant position in determining a fair revenue distribution. CCI said that news media play a critical role in a well-functioning democracy and it is important to ensure that the digital gatekeeper firms do not abuse their position to harm the “competitive process of determining a fair distribution of revenue amongst all stakeholders.”The fair trade regulator ordered a probe on a complaint filed by the Digital News Publishers Association, a private body that aims to secure the interest of digital news publishers. The association alleged that its members have to suffer a loss of advertising revenues despite working and generating credible news.What's the issue?The majority of the traffic on news websites comes from online search engines, the association said, and Google, being the most dominant search engine and a major stakeholder in the digital advertising space, unilaterally decides the amount to be paid to the publishers. Google algorithm decides which news website gets more traffic through its search engine.The CCI noted that the display of news snippets doesn't guarantee users clicking on it to enter the news websites, limiting the ad revenue earning potential of publishers. On the other hand, Google would continue to earn ad revenue on its results page while also enriching its search algorithm resulting from the volume of search queries."No doubt, Google, being the gateway, generates substantial traffic for news publishers, but at the same time, the bargaining power imbalance and denial of fair share in the advertising revenue, as alleged by the Informant, merit detailed investigation," the Commission said.This is not the first time questions have been raised on Google’s use of news snippets and the inability of publishers to bargain a fair share in the value chain of news dissemination.In 2020, the Australian government proposed News Media Bargaining Code to address bargaining power imbalances between Australia’s news media businesses and two Big Techs - Google and Facebook. Australia's competition watchdog said in a report that Google and Facebook are more than mere distributors or pure intermediaries in the supply of news.Google, initially warning to pull of search engine from Down Under, reluctantly caved in and struck deals with publishers to pay for journalism. France also asked Google to enter into a good-faith negotiation with news publishers for paid licensing of content to address the bargaining power imbalance.The CCI has directed its investigation arm, the director-general (DG), to probe and submit the investigation report within 60 days.It added that "nothing stated in this order shall be tantamount to a final expression of opinion on the merits of the case, and the DG shall conduct the investigation without being swayed in any manner whatsoever by the observations made herein".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-is-google-facing-probe-in-india-over-alleged-abuse-of-dominant-position-101641882895907.html

The last of the 36 contracted fighters from France is actually the first fighter used for training IAF personnel after the deliveries started from France. This fighter was inspected by Defence Secretary Ajay Kumar at the Istres air base during his visit to France for a high level defence dialogue in December 2021.Although IAF remains tight-lipped over what India specific enhancements are on Rafale, it is learnt that these relate to long range Meteor air-to-air missile, low band frequency jammers, advanced communication systems, more capable radio altimeter, radar warning receiver, high altitude engine start up, synthetic aperture radar, ground moving target indicator and tracking, missile approach warning systems and very high frequency range decoys.On the arrival of the fighter jets, the IAF will test the specific enhancements to their satisfaction under Indian conditions apart from verifying the original equipment manufacturers claims as per agreement. After this, work will begin in retrofitting the remaining 32 aircraft at Ambala in western sector and Hashimara air base in eastern sector with the India specific enhancements with all the related equipment already with the IAF. The upgradation exercise will be carried out at Ambala air base which has the maintenance cum repair set up for Rafale fighters in India.In light of the Indian acquisition of Rafale, the Pakistani air force has decided to go for 25 Chinese made J-10 multi-role fighters as a counter and PLA Air Force has deployed the J-20, so called fifth generation fighter, at Hotan, Lhasa, Kashgar and Nyingchi air bases in Tibet and Sinkiang.

The nation's second Prime Minister, who succeeded Jawaharlal Nehru, was known for his simplicity and honesty, and was posthumously honoured with the Bharat Ratna, becoming its first posthumous recipient.Though born in 1904, 35 years after Mahatma Gandhi, Shastri shared his birthday with the former, as both were born on October 2. Hailing from a simple family, he became an avid follower of Gandhi, and went on to hold important portfolios during his political career.A famous anecdote from the former PM's life is when, on two occasions, he resigned as railway minister, taking moral responsibility for two separate train accidents which took place during his tenure. Also a former home minister, he took over as Prime Minister on June 9, 1964, in the wake of Jawaharlal Nehru's demise.As the nation's premier, Shastri oversaw India's response to Pakistani aggression in 1965, which resulted in a war between the two neighbours. Though the war officially ended with a ceasefire, India had the upper hand over Pakistan when the ceasefire was announced.It was during this war, when he coined the now iconic slogan ‘Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan’ (hail the soldier, hail the farmer).He passed away in Tashkent on January 11, 1966, a day after the signing of the Tashkent Agreement between India and Pakistan. While cardiac arrest was reported to be the cause, several conspiracy theories exist around the leader's death.His resting place is Vijay Ghat in New Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lal-bahadur-shastri-nation-remembers-former-pm-on-56th-death-anniversary-101641870141518.html

The average 24-hour AQI was 151 on Monday.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.On Monday, the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar) said the AQI remained in the “satisfactory” category due to rain that caused wet deposition of pollutants. It added for the next three days, a gradual increase in maximum temperature was likely due to cloud-free conditions. The wind speed was likely to be moderate leading to enhanced ventilation. “AQI is likely to degrade to ‘Moderate’ on 11th and 12th (Tuesday and Wednesday) due to moderate ventilation and absence of wet deposition of pollutants.” Safar said from Thursday onwards, low wind speeds were expected to reduce dispersion and degrade the air quality further.The maximum temperature was expected to reach 19 degrees Celsius on Tuesday amid a moderate fog. On Monday, the maximum temperature was 18.1 degrees Celsius and the minimum 9.6 degrees Celsius.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhis-aqi-in-poor-category-101641869673508.html

In the ensuing encounter, two terrorists of proscribed terror outfit Al-Badr were killed and their bodies were retrieved from the site,” the spokesperson added. “They were part of groups involved in several terror crime cases including attacks on security forces and civilians ,” the spokesperson said, adding that Wani was involved in an attack on policeman Mushtaq Ahmad Wagay of Pulwama on December 19. Wagay was seriously injured in the attack.“Abdul Rashid Thoker, before joining terrorist ranks, was working as a terrorist associate and was involved in an attack on a civilian at Chitragam,” the spokesperson said.On January 7, three Jaish-e-Muhammad terrorists were killed in Zolwa Kralpora in central Kashmir’s Budgam district.On January 5, three terrorists, including a foreigner associated with Jaish-e-Mohammad, who according to police was also an expert in making vehicle-borne crude bombs, were killed after an encounter in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district.For the first time, the number of local terrorists operating in Kashmir has gone below 100, Kashmir’s inspector general of police Vijay Kumar told reporters on December 31.

11-01-2022||India||Orissa HC rejects Dara Singh’s plea for treating 21 years in jail as life term||BHUBANESWAR: orissa high court has rejected the plea of Dara Singh, serving life sentence in three separate cases of murder including that of Australian missionary Graham Staines and his two sons in Keonjhar district in January 1999, to treat his 21 years in jail as life sentence. The HC bench comprising chief justice S Muralidhara and justice BP Routray rejected Singh’s criminal appeal seeking his release from jail in the murder case of a Muslim trader in 1999 for which he was sentenced to life by a trial court in 2007. Singh pleaded that as he has already undergone more than 21 years inside the jail and considering his long custody, the punishment may be treated as life term. In 2007, a trial court in Mayurbhanj sentenced Singh to life for killing and then burning Muslim trader SK Rehman of Padiabeda village in Thakurmunda block of the district. The same year, he and three others were sentenced to life for murdering 35-year-old Catholic priest Father Arul Doss in Sep 1999, at Jamubani village of Mayurbhanj district. In 2003, a trial court in Khurda district awarded Singh death sentence and life to 12 others for burning alive Staines and his two sons in Manoharpur village of Keonjhar district. Staines was sleeping with his sons, aged 8 and 10, in a stain wagon in the forest when a mob led by Singh poured petrol over it and set fire to it. In 2005, the Orissa high court commuted Singh’s sentence to life. The High Court acquitted 11 others. In 2011, the SC upheld Singh’s life sentence. First arrested in January 2000, Singh, now 59 years old, is lodged in a jail in Keonjhar district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/orissa-hc-rejects-dara-singh-s-plea-for-treating-21-years-in-jail-as-life-term-101641848612116.html
11-01-2022||India||‘Abuse of process of law’: Chhattisgarh HC cancels DA case against ex-bureaucrat, wife||RAIPUR: The Chhattisgarh high court on Monday quashed a disproportionate assets case registered against the state’s former principal secretary Aman Singh and his wife in February 2020, holding that the first information report (FIR) filed against them was based on probabilities and “an abuse of process of law”.Aman Singh was an influential bureaucrat in the Raman Singh government in Chhattisgarh. Singh and his wife Yasmin resigned from the government after the Congress came to power in 2018. The FIR was registered two years later on a complaint by Uchit Sharma, a Raipur-based RTI activist.A single bench of justice Narendra Kumar Vyas passed the order quashing the FIR registered by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) wing of the state police, lawyer Abhishek Singh said.The judge noted that the FIR accused the couple of disproportionate assets and alleged their involvement in various scam and money laundering.“… but the FIR does not speak about how the petitioner involved in the alleged scam as mentioned in the FIR. It has also been stated in the FIR that the petitioner was working in various posts of profit and working as influential person and the fact is not in dispute that the petitioner was on deputation and worked as joint secretary with the Government of Chhattisgarh, definitely he has posted in the office of chief minister of state, therefore, merely his working as joint secretary cannot be said to have been commission of offence under Section 13 (1)(b), 13 (2) of the Act, 1988 and Section 120B of IPC, thus, the registration of FIR is nothing but an abuse of process of law,” justice Vyas said.“The FIR nowhere discloses commission of any offence with definite facts and figures,” it said. “It is not in dispute that truthfulness of allegation has to be examined on evidence, but at least it is incumbent on the part of the prosecution that the FIR should prima facie disclose commission of offence under Section 13 (1)(b) read with Section 13 (2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and Section 120B of IPC, but all the allegations levelled against the petitioner are prima facie based upon probabilities and on the basis of probability any person cannot be prosecuted”, it said. “…the FIR registered against the petitioner and his wife at Police Station EOW/ACB, Raipur for committing offence punishable under Section 13(1)(b), 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and Section 120B of IPC, is liable to be and is hereby quashed,” the order stated. A statement by EOW after registering the FIR in 2020 claimed: “It was found that Aman Singh and his wife have disproportionate assets in Raipur, Durg, Bhopal, Delhi and foreign countries, which is under investigation.” The statement further claimed that Singh formed shell companies which were engaged in money laundering.“It was found that shell companies –Vyas Mines and Minerals, Samay Multi Trade, Shrishti Natural Resources, YN Singh Memorial Foundation and Kargil India Limited – was made by them and crores of money laundering was done,” the EOW statement of 2020 said adding that Singh was himself promoter YN Singh memorial foundation even though he was a government employee.The petitioners challenged the FIR, arguing that it levelled baseless allegations and contained immaterial allegations and deserves to be quashed. Abhishek Sinha told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/abuse-of-process-of-law-chhattisgarh-hc-cancels-da-case-against-ex-bureaucrat-wife-101641846092268.html
11-01-2022||India||No compromise on right to bodily integrity: HC on rape||The Delhi high court on Monday observed that even though there can be no compromise on the bodily autonomy of a woman, marital rape cannot be treated as a prosecutable offence because of the qualitative difference between a marital and non-marital relationship.Describing the difference, Justice C Hari Shankar said a marital relationship holds an expectation and also a legal right for reasonable sexual relation from the spouse. “In a marital relationship, there is a qualitative difference. There is an expectation of a conjugal relationship of both parties. When a party gets married, a person has an expectation and to a certain extent, the legal right also to express normal sexual relationship with your partner. Because if it is denied, it can lead to civil consequences and can also lead to divorce,” Justice C Hari Shankar said.He added that qualitative difference has a part to play in the exception that has been added to the Section 375 of IPC.Exceptions to Section 375 IPC (rape) decriminalises marital rape and mandates that sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under 15 years of age, is not rape.The judge, however, clarified that he was neither expressing his final opinion on the petitions nor examining whether marital rape should be punished at this stage.Justice Shankar, who was hearing a bunch of pleas filed in 2018 seeking to criminalise marital rape, along with Justice Rajiv Shakdher, observed that a non-marital relation, no matter how close, cannot be compared with a marital relationship.“If the legislature feels that where parties are married, we should not categorize this as rape as it would be categorised in a case where parties are unmarried and the man says I want to have it (sex) then it is a matter of force. You are not exercising any right which is socially or legally in any manner given to you. Here (marriage) the man is exercising what he believes to be the conjugal right,” Justice Shankar said.He emphasised that the offence of rape was punishable with 10 years imprisonment, and the issue of removal of marital rape exemption required serious consideration.“There is no compromise with a woman’s right to sexual and bodily integrity. A husband has no business to compel. (But) the court can’t ignore what happens when we knock it (marital rape exception) off,” Justice Shankar said.The court was hearing PILs by NGOs RIT Foundation, All India Democratic Women’s Association and two individuals who have sought striking down the exception in the law arguing that it discriminated against married women who were sexually assaulted by their husbands.The judge also expressed his reservations with regard to the use of the term marital rape , saying that every act of rape has to be punished and the repeated use of marital rape to define any form of an unwilling sexual relationship between a husband and a wife was a “pre-decision” (jumping to a conclusion).“There is no (concept of) marital rape in India... If it is rape marital, non-marital or any kind, it has to be punished. Repeated use of the word, according to me, obfuscates the actual issue,” he said.Advocate Karuna Nundy, appearing for the NGOs, argued that the marital rape exception created an anomaly as it was under-inclusive (not included) and violated the Constitution.She contended that the exemption violated the right to dignity and sexual autonomy of women, and that there were thousands of victims who approached her clients for protection.In 2018, the Delhi government, in its response, told the predecessor bench hearing the case -- headed by then acting chief jJustice Gita Mittal -- that wherever a spouse indulged in sexual relations without the willingness of the other, it was already an offence under IPC, and a woman was entitled to refuse sexual relations with her husband under the right to bodily integrity and privacy as per Article 21 (protection of life and personal liberty) of the Constitution.The Centre, in its affidavit, said that marital rape cannot be made a criminal offence as it could become a phenomenon that may destabilise the institution of marriage, and an easy tool for harassing the husbands.The matter will now be heard on January 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-compromise-on-right-to-bodily-integrity-hc-on-rape-101641845033483.html

11-01-2022||India||‘35 of 46 who died from Jan 5-9 were not jabbed’||Delhi government analysis of deaths among Covid-19 patients in the city between January 5 and 9 has shown that 35 out of 46, or 76%, of the fatalities were in unvaccinated people, and 21, or almost half, were admitted for other reasons before they were detected as infected with coronavirus.The data reinforces trends seen worldwide and in other Indian cities – being vaccinated significantly reduces the risk of fatality, and many of the infections in hospitalised people are incidental discoveries, suggesting they already needed medical attention for complications not necessarily linked to Covid-19.“It will be wrong to say that this time deaths are happening purely because of Covid-19. If we say, deaths are because of Omicron, it will be incorrect. It is mostly because of other co-morbidities,” said BL Sherwal, medical director at Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, adding that there is a marked reduction in the number of serious people being hospitalised.A detailed classification of cause of death was not immediately available of all deaths that occurred in this period, but some analysed by HT showed a pattern that in many of the deaths, a Covid-19 infection was seemingly incidental.One such case was the death of a 74-year-old man at Lok Nayak Hospital due to a heart attack – this person was detected as Covid-positive only after his demise. A second death at the same facility was that of a 77-year-old cancer patient. Another fatality was at Majidia Hospital, where the 59-year-old patient had uncontrolled diabetes and chest infection while a fourth death, at National Heart Institute, was of an 80-year-old man who was asymptomatic but had severe hypertension, according to some of the death records seen by HT.In all, 34 of the 46 the deaths were among people who had comorbid conditions known to raise the risk of severe Covid-19, and 23 – or 50% -- of all deaths were recorded within a day of the patients being admitted, suggesting their condition was already critical when they got medical attention.To be sure, it is not clear if Covid further complicated the existing comorbidities.The January 5-9 hospitalisation and death analysis was presented at the Delhi Disaster Management Authority’s (DDMA)meeting on Monday, when the agency, headed by the lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, reviewed the Covid-19 outbreak in the Capital and announced new curbs on dining-in at restaurants.An official aware of the discussions at the meeting said experts agreed on the need to further study the rise in death numbers, even though they appear to be lower in comparison to past waves.The Delhi government has formed a Covid death analysis committee to review each death that takes place during the current wave.The Capital recorded 17 fatalities classified as Covid-19 deaths on Sunday, the highest since June 16. There were 17 deaths on Monday as well.The data also showed that while the number of cases requiring oxygen support jumped from 140 to 440 in the five-day period, the proportion of such patients remained under 0.8% of active cases in this period.Of the 46 deaths, 25 were in people above the age of 60 years, with those between the age of 41 and 60 suffering the next-highest numbers of fatalities at 14.“Some of the patients who recently died were those who were brought to hospitals when their SpO2 fell below 80 and was in the 70-80 range. Their lungs were badly infected even before they were brought to the hospitals. People should take the infection seriously and avoid self-medication or delay in seeking qualified professional medical treatment,” a second official, who asked not to be named, said.The severity trends seen in Delhi till now are consistent with the outcomes in other countries hit by Omicron-induced waves. The commissioner of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation last week said that of the 1,900 people requiring oxygen support in Mumbai’s hospitals, 96% were unvaccinated.Researchers in South Africa, the country first hit by the Omicron variant, said they found a likely correlation between a past infection and vaccination and reduced risk of severe disease or death when people were infected by this configuration of the virus.The Omicron variant of the coronavirus, designated as being of concern in late November, is the most transmissible and resistant yet.
11-01-2022||India||HT This Day: Jan 12, 2002 – Ammo blast near Bikaner destroys 80 trucks, kills 2||HT CorrespondentJaipur / New Delhi:  ABOUT 80 trucks in an army convoy of 250 trucks carrying tank ammunition went up in flames after an explosion in one of the trucks. Two people died and 11 were injured in the incident. The trucks were going from Bhatinda, Punjab, to Bikaner when the explosion took place at Udasar, 5 km from Bikaner, at about 3 p.m. on Friday The first explosion set off a chain reaction. Eyewitnesses say the fire spread very fast. Fire tenders and local authorities rushed to the spot. The explosions died down in approximately 90 minutes. But after a lull of about an hour huge explosions began to rock the city. There were fears that the fire had spread from the trucks to an underground ammunition dump. The explosions, which were continuing when reports last came in, sparked off a scare in Bikaner. People living within a radius of five km from the spot were asked to evacuate. Panic stricken residents vacated a number of colonies - Kanta Kathuria Colony, Vyas Colony and Sadulgang Colony. Explosions could be heard even 15 km away from the site. The blaze and the huge clouds of smoke it sent up could be seen from rooftops at the other end of the city. Ammunition and scrap from the dump were scattered by the explosions over a large area, including Bikaner city. The army cordoned off the area, and traffic on the Jaipur-Bikaner highway was diverted. STD access in Bikaner was blocked, apparently because of security reasons. This is the third major fire at army ordnance depots in Rajasthan. In 2000, a depot at Bharatpur had caught fire and in May 2001, a sub-depot at Suratgarh had gone up in flames. Bikaner is only 100 km from the Indo-Pak border and the incident assumes particular seriousness in view of troop build-ups on both sides of the Indo-Pak border. An army spokesman in New Delhi claimed that most of the ammunition had been saved. "Immediate action was taken and the unaffected trucks were (saved)," he said. The cause of the explosion is not clear. The army has ordered a court of inquiry into the incident. CHAIN OF EVENTS Friday, 3pm: Army truck carrying ammunition explodes 5 km from Bikaner.
