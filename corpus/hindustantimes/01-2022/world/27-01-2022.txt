Stay safe, everyone – and please get vaccinated,” he added. Trudeau, 50, is fully-vaccinated, and in January received a booster dose of a Covid-19 vaccine at a pharmacy in Ottawa.There were no additional details available.Trudeau also self-isolated in March 2020, when the pandemic first arrived in Canada, after his wife Sophie Gregoire was infected while on a trip to England.Covaxin production in CanadaThe biopharmaceutical company which has partnered with India’s Bharat Biotech to make Covaxin in North America, has entered into an agreement to acquire a manufacturing facility in Canada.The Pennsylvania-based Ocugen announced on Thursday that it had signed a non-binding letter of intent with the Canadian company Liminal BioSciences for the acquisition of their manufacturing site in Belleville, Ontario.If approved, Covaxin will be “the first product manufactured in new upgraded facility”, a release from Ocugen said.Ocugen’s Canadian subsidiary Vaccigen has an application for emergency use authorisation of the vaccine with Health Canada. Ocugen plans to repurpose the dormant vaccine manufacturing facility and create capacity in Canada.“This site, after transformation into a state-of-the-art hub, with the support of the regional talent pool can help bring our innovative products – from vaccines to our modifier gene therapy assets – to the patients we will serve globally,” said Ocugen’s chairman and CEO Dr Shankar Musunuri said.The introduction between Ocugen and Liminal was facilitated by Canada’s minister of innovation, science and industry François-Philippe Champagne.Covaxin’s was submitted to Health Canada on June 30. However, there is no clarity on when, and if, regulators will clear the vaccine for use in Canada.In a tweet earlier this month, the agency said, “A decision will be made once all of the required information has been thoroughly evaluated by Health Canada. As the review is still ongoing, it is not possible to predict when a regulatory decision will be made.”Health Canada said it reviews vaccine applications through an independent process and authorises products based on “scientific rigour and medical evidence”.“Timing for the completion of Health Canada’s review depends on many factors, including but not limited to, the need for additional data, discussions with the sponsor, and requirements for updates to safety information,” it added.Covaxin was approved for emergency use by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in November 2021. It has been recognised in Canada for the purpose of travel since November 30 when the country started accepting those with two doses of Covaxin as fully vaccinated.

That was the biggest increase in 40 years.For the full year, inflation rose 3.9 percent, according to the data.Excluding volatile food and energy prices which have increased sharply in the year, the core PCE price index rose 3.3 percent in 2021, and 4.9 percent in the fourth quarter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-economy-grew-5-7-in-2021-6-9-in-q4-amid-omicron-hit-govt-101643292295164.html
27-01-2022||World||Working ‘closely’ with India to handle border problem, US should not interfere: China||China on Thursday said it will work “closely” with India to properly handle the ongoing border tension and strongly criticised the US for saying it was concerned by Beijing’s attempts to coerce its neighbours including India.The Chinese defence ministry added that the border problem is a bilateral matter and both China and India oppose interference from a third party.Defence ministry spokesperson, Wu Qian said “…some American politicians are so fond of using the word ‘coerce’, they seem to have forgotten that the US is the inventor and master player of ‘coercive diplomacy’.”China neither “coerces” nor is “coerced” by others, and strongly opposes the US forcing “coercive diplomacy” on other countries, Wu said on Thursday.Wu was referring to comments made by the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki ahead of the 14th round of military talks between India and China on January 12 to resolve the ongoing border tension between the two countries along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh. “We’ve been pretty clear how we view Beijing’s behaviour in the region and around the world. We believe it can be destabilising. And we’re concerned by the People’s Republic of China’s attempt to intimidate its neighbours,” Psaki said.“We continue to support dialogue and peaceful resolution of these border disputes,” she said, adding: “We’ll continue to stand with our partners on that.”Referring to the China-India border issue, Wu stressed that the Chinese side believed that the last round of talks were positive and constructive. “…China will work closely with the Indian side to properly handle the border issue through negotiation and consultation,” Wu was quoted as saying by the official China Military Online website.Referring to the joint statement issued after the talks, Wu said the two sides agreed that they should follow the guidance provided by the leaders of the two countries and work for the resolution of the remaining issues at the earliest. “Second, the two sides agreed to consolidate the previous outcomes and take effective efforts to maintain the security and stability on the ground in the western sector including in winter,” Wu said.“Third, they agreed to stay in close contact and maintain dialogue via military and diplomatic channels and work out a mutually acceptable resolution of the remaining issues at the earliest,” he said, adding that the two sides also agreed that the next round of the commanders’ talks should be held at the earliest.Indian and Chinese border troops have been locked in a border standoff in eastern Ladakh since May, 2020, when a violent clash in Pangong lake area led to both sides gradually deploying tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry along the border.Several rounds of military and diplomatic talks have only resulted in partial disengagement of troops until now.India has repeatedly and consistently rejected China’s allegations that Indian troops crossed over to the Chinese side of the LAC in eastern Ladakh, asserting that New Delhi has always taken a responsible approach towards border management and maintaining peace and tranquillity in the border areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/working-closely-with-india-to-handle-border-problem-us-should-not-interfere-china-101643291696889.html

27-01-2022||World||Covid-19: Canada to relax testing norms to ease travel from India||Travel between India and Canada is likely to become easier soon as Ottawa is likely to relax restrictions related to Covid-19 testing that made the process cumbersome.According to sources, the Canadian government is likely to update its rules allowing for RT-PCR testing of air passengers from India to be permitted at several laboratories recognised by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR).At this time, the travel advisory for India that is in force, limits pre-departure testing to a single laboratory of the company Genestrings located at Delhi airport. Travellers have to provide a negative test result before they are allowed boarding for any Canadian destination, making the process problematic to those connecting via Delhi as getting the test taken and results received consume up to eight or nine hours. As of now, that test has to be done within 18 hours of scheduled departure.Another relaxation that’s expected is that of the mandatory requirement for travellers from India to be tested at a third country in case they are catching a connecting flight to come to Canada. The present norms read: “Passengers who travel from India to Canada via an indirect route still need to provide a pre-departure negative Covid-19 molecular test result from a third country before continuing their journey to Canada.”A test conducted in India is likely to be accepted for onward journey to Canada from a third country once the expected announcement is made. Sources said that announcement could come as early as this week.However, Canada still has in place a warning against any non-essential travel abroad due to concerns over the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. That, though, is relevant to those departing Canada rather than incoming passengers.The testing norms specific to India were introduced in September when Canada lifted its ban on direct flights between the two countries, which was imposed in April last year amid concerns over the Delta-driven wave in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-canada-to-relax-testing-norms-to-ease-travel-from-india-101643266852834.html
27-01-2022||World||Researchers find 2 paths to ‘super immunity’ against Covid-19, no correlation with age||There are two paths towards “super immunity” against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and both provide roughly equal levels of enhanced immune protection, according to a new study. Researchers at Oregon Health & Science University studied the quantity, quality and breadth of humoral immune response from and without natural infection in addition to vaccination against Covid-19. They found that the additional antigen exposure from Covid-19 substantially boosts immunity regardless of whether it occurs before or after vaccination.“It makes no difference whether you get infected and then vaccinated, or if you get vaccinated and then a breakthrough infection,” said Fikadu Tafess, co-author of the study. “In either case, you will get a really, really robust immune response — amazingly high.”The Covid-19 vaccines approved by the World Health Organization significantly reduce overall mortality and severe illness from the infection. Several studies have shown that people with hybrid immunity – induced through vaccination after recovering from coronavirus infection – have enhanced immune responses as compared with the vaccinated peers with no prior infection. But the effects of post-vaccination breakthrough infections on humoral immune response was yet to be determined.The OHSU researchers measured neutralizing antibody responses from 104 vaccinated individuals, including those with breakthrough infections, hybrid immunity, and no infection history. The participants, vaccinated with the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, were divided into three groups: 42 with no infection, 31 who were vaccinated after an infection, and 31 who had breakthrough infections following vaccination.“We find that human immune sera following breakthrough infection and vaccination following natural infection, broadly neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants to a similar degree,” the authors said in the study published in the journal Science Immunology.While age negatively correlates with antibody response after vaccination alone, the researchers concluded that there was no correlation with age in breakthrough or hybrid immune groups.“Together, our data suggest that the additional antigen exposure from natural infection substantially boosts the quantity, quality, and breadth of humoral immune response regardless of whether it occurs before or after vaccination,” the study said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/researchers-find-2-paths-to-super-immunity-against-covid-19-no-correlation-with-age-101643264713275.html
27-01-2022||World||Canada, India exploring opportunities in Indo-Pacific: Melanie Joly||Canada’s foreign minister Melanie Joly has stressed on “working together” with India in addressing challenges in the Indo-Pacific and to “bolster diplomatic and regional stability, trade and economic connectivity and sustainability”.Joly made these comments while appearing at a virtual Republic Day celebration organised by the Indian High Commission in Ottawa. Joly, who was the chief guest at the function, said that the two countries are “working together to explore opportunities in the Indo-Pacific”. She added that “as Pacific-facing nations, we share mutual interests in ensuring peace, stability and prosperity of the region.” Melanie Joly also described as “a remarkable achievement” the administration of over 1.5 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines in India.The matter of strengthening collaboration in the Indo-Pacific was also addressed by India’s High Commissioner to Ottawa Ajay Bisaria. He said the two countries “need to come together to defend the rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific” while conveying India’s appreciation of Canada’s “articulation of a vision” for the Indo-Pacific.When the new House of Commons met in November last year for the first time after the September elections, governor-general Mary Simon outlined the policy priorities of the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and among those was “making deliberate efforts to deepen partnerships in the Indo-Pacific”. Canada is currently formulating a comprehensive Indo-Pacific policy.“India and Canada as Pacific nations and G20 economies are natural partners,” Bisaria said, while pointing out that they are also observing 75 years of establishment of diplomatic ties.The event was also attended by Canada’s defence minister Anita Anand who conveyed her greetings on Republic Day. Also joining the function and extending their wishes were the leader of the opposition in Canada Erin O’Toole, and the premiers of the provinces of Ontario and Alberta, Doug Ford and Jason Kenney.Meanwhile, while there were protests in front of the High Commission in Ottawa as well as India’s consulates in Toronto and Vancouver, there were no reports of disruption of R Day functions. India had sought enhanced security from Canada this year after its consulate in Vancouver was blockaded by protestors in 2021 and pro-Khalistan speeches were delivered at the site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-india-exploring-opportunities-in-indo-pacific-melanie-joly-101643264331923.html
27-01-2022||World||Covid-19: 'Flurona' isn't real, people can get co-infection, say researchers||Some posts on social media talked about one such infection named ‘flurona’ in Israel, which the users said is a double infection of Covid-19 and influenza.Also Read | Can vaccination reduce long effects of Covid-19? Here's what we knowBut healthcare experts have now dismissed this, saying it’s not a different thing.“The contractions like ‘flurona,’ I think they’re very misleading to people. It presents the idea two viruses have somehow merged into one, which is not at all the case,” Dr Ellen Foxman, an immunologist at the Yale School of Medicine, told NBC News. “Somebody got a co-infection. People get co-infections all the time.”Watch: India's Covid cases breach 4-crore markOther researchers too agree with Dr Foxman. Dr Guy Boivin, a clinical virologist in Quebec, explained that co-infection can result in three outcomes: Little or no symptoms, severe illness due to virus attacks at the same time or one infection could block another.According to reports, the first case of ‘flurona’ was recorded late in December in a pregnant woman who was admitted to the Rabin Medical Centre in Petah Tikva to give birth. Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth reported that the young woman was not vaccinated.At that time, Dr Nahla Abdel Wahab, a doctor at Cairo University Hospital, had told Israeli media that ‘flurona’ may indicate a major breakdown of the immunity system as two viruses are entering the human body at the same time.Israel is administering a fourth vaccine shot against Covid-19 to individuals with a compromised immune system. It is mulling expanding the coverage to younger population as well.Also Read | Moderna starts clinical trials of Omicron-specific vaccine boosterLast week, the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) said that the Omicron variant is in the community transmission stage in India and has become dominant in multiple metros.It also said BA.2 lineage, an infectious sub-variant of Omicron, has been found in a substantial fraction in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-flurona-isn-t-real-people-can-get-co-infection-say-researchers-101643251343071.html
27-01-2022||World||Can vaccination reduce long effects of Covid-19? Here's what we know||Vaccination can help reduce the long effects of Covid-19 infection, researchers have found based on data collected from those infected with coronavirus. An Israeli report has surfaced that shows that people vaccinated with both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine were much less likely to report long Covid as compared to those unvaccinated.The study, which is yet to be peer reviewed, showed that those vaccinated and infected with Covid-19 can fully recover from the disease showing no more symptoms than a person who has never got Covid.Researchers of the Israeli study, published in the Nature journal, sampled more than 3,000 people whom they asked whether they were experiencing any persistent symptoms of the long Covid. The data was collected between July and November 2021 from people who had tested Covid positive between March 2020 and November 2021.“Here is another reason to get vaccinated, if you needed one,” said co-author Michael Edelstein, an epidemiologist at Bar-Ilan University in Safed, Israel, as quoted by Nature journal.What is long Covid?The term ‘long Covid’ refers to a condition where people continue to experience certain symptoms of the viral infection – such as fatigue, shortness of breath, difficulty in concentration or 'brain fog' – weeks and months, and in some cases years, after being infected by Covid-19.What did the researchers find?According to the study, fully vaccinated participants who had also had Covid-19 were 54 per cent less likely to report headaches, 64 per cent less likely to report fatigue and 68 per cent less likely to report muscle pain than were their unvaccinated counterparts.The result also echoed several other researches conducted around the world, including a UK-based study that found vaccination could halve the risk of long term symptoms of Covid-19.However, this is not to say that fully vaccinated people do not develop  the condition, especially since it is still unclear if the vaccine protects people from Omicron and its after effects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-vaccination-reduce-long-effects-of-covid-19-here-s-what-we-know-101643248685878.html
27-01-2022||World||Ukraine crisis updates: What to know as tensions rise||Russia has placed more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine's border and ratcheted up war games in the region.Moscow denies it is planning an assault, but the United States and its NATO allies fear that Russia is planning for war — and are making preparations of their own.Here are things to know about the international tensions over Ukraine, a crisis reminiscent of the Cold War.THE U.S. SAYS NOThe U.S. has made no concessions to the main Russian demands over Ukraine and NATO in a long-awaited written response delivered to Russia on Wednesday in Moscow, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.Blinken said the U.S. response, delivered to the Russian Foreign Ministry by U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan, gave up no ground on “core principles” such as NATO’s open-door membership policy and the alliance’s military presence in Eastern Europe.Blinken said the document made clear that the U.S. is standing by its oft-stated positions. “There is no change, there will be no change,” he said. But, he said the written response to Russia also contains “serious” offers for a diplomatic path to de-escalate soaring tensions over Ukraine by addressing Russian concerns on other matters.The U.S. response comes as Russia is warning that it would quickly take “retaliatory measures” if the U.S. and its allies reject its security demands and continue their “aggressive” policies over Ukraine.Russia has demanded guarantees that NATO never admit Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations as members and that the alliance roll back troop deployments in former Soviet bloc countries, a region Moscow still views as its sphere of interestWHAT DO UKRAINIAN LEADERS SAY?Ukrainian officials have sought to calm nerves as tensions escalate.Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Wednesday that while the concentration of Russian troops near Ukraine poses a threat, “their number is now insufficient for a large-scale offensive.”“They are still missing some key military elements and systems to mount a big, full-scale offensive,” Kuleba told reporters.He also noted that causing alarm could be an end in itself. Russia, he said, hopes to destabilize Ukraine by “spreading panic, raising pressure on Ukraine’s financial system and launching cyberattacks.”WHAT IS THE MOOD ON UKRAINE'S FRONT LINE?Soldiers and civilians in eastern Ukraine are waiting with helpless anticipation to see if war comes.They understand that their fate is being decided by politicians in distant capitals. Even politicians in their own capital, Kyiv, have found themselves on the sidelines of several rounds of high-stakes diplomacy that so far have not yielded a breakthrough.The battle-weary region has been fighting pro-Russia separatist fighters since 2014. It is an area close to where Russia has massed tens of thousands of soldiers in a troop buildup that U.S. President Joe Biden says could mount the largest invasion since World War II.WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE DIPLOMATIC FRONT?Envoys from Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany met Wednesday for more than eight hours in Paris to discuss the separatist conflict in Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland. Although there was no breakthrough, they promised to meet for new talks in two weeks in Berlin.The French president’s office said afterward in a statement that the parties support “unconditional respect” for a cease-fire in eastern Ukraine.The Ukrainian representative, Andriy Yermak, was cautiously optimistic. He also acknowledged Wednesday’s talks did not directly address current tensions at the border or resolve past differences.WHAT IS BRITAIN'S STANCE?British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has urged European nations to do more to support Ukraine, saying “we would like to see our allies do more to help supply defensive support to Ukraine.”The U.K. has sent anti-tank weapons to Ukraine in response to Russia massing troops near its border. It has ruled out sending combat troops, but Truss said Britain has “ruled nothing out in terms of sanctions.”“In fact, we’ll be legislating to toughen up our sanctions regime and make sure we are fully able to hit both individuals and companies and banks in Russia in the event of an incursion,” she told the BBC.“What’s important is that all of our allies do the same, because it’s by collective action, by showing Vladimir Putin we’re united, that we will help deter a Russian incursion.”WHAT IS GERMANY DOING?Among the NATO allies, Germany in particular has faced calls to help Ukraine more and been faulted for a perception that it is prioritizing its economic ties with Russia over Ukraine's security.Amid that backdrop, German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said Germany will deliver 5,000 military helmets to Ukraine following a request from the country’s embassy. She said that it was “a very clear signal that we stand by your side.”Ukraine’s ambassador to Germany welcomed the planned delivery of the helmets but described it as a “purely symbolic gesture.” Andriy Melnik told German news agency dpa that “this is only a drop in the ocean.”He added that “Ukraine expects a 180-degree turn from the German government, a real paradigm change.”Germany has said that it won’t deliver lethal weapons to Ukraine.Yet German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock insisted Wednesday that the European Union’s common goal in the Ukraine crisis “is and remains the defense of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.”WHAT DO ITALIAN BUSINESSES WANT?Like Germans, some Italians are suspected of putting business ties with Russia ahead of solidarity with Ukraine.On Wednesday, Italian business leaders held a video conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin even though the Rome government asked that the conference be canceled, or at least that companies with government stakes not participate.During the call, Putin underlined Italy’s role as its third-largest EU trading partner, with $5 billion invested by Italian companies in Russia and $3 billion by Russian companies in Italy.The president of the Italian-Russian Chamber of Commerce, Vincenzo Trani, said the two countries have always been able to overcome “challenging outside factors in recent years ... through dialogue.”Participants included Marco Tronchetti Provera, CEO of Pirelli tires, who is president of the Italian Russian entrepreneurs committee. La Repubblica said the CEO of the oil company ENI and the SNAM energy infrastructure company, which are partially state-owned, canceled.WHAT ABOUT THOSE COMMENTS IN CROATIA?Croatia’s prime minister sought Wednesday to defuse an uproar after the country's president said “Ukraine does not belong in NATO" and Croatian troops should not be part of any Western response force in case of a war.President Zoran Milanovic is known for populist-style and undiplomatic statements. His remarks Tuesday angered Ukraine, which summoned Croatia’s ambassador in response.Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic described Milanovic’s comments as “unreal in many ways” and said Croatia, a member of NATO and the EU, will continue to have “friendly and partner” relations with Ukraine.“I can speak for the Croatian government,” Plenkovic said. “Croatia’s core position is respect of Ukraine’s territorial integrity.”WHAT IS CANADA DOING?Canada is extending its mission to train Ukrainian soldiers by three years. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday that Canada will also expand the mission, known as Operation UNIFIER.Trudeau said he has authorized the Canadian Armed Forces to deploy 60 personnel to join 200 troops already on the ground, with further capacity to increase that number up to 400. He said Canada will also provide nonlethal equipment, intelligence-sharing and support to combat cyberattacks.“We are seeing around the world right now a backsliding of democracy, an attack on democratic principles in many different forms," Trudeau said. "But the direct threat of a Russian invasion, to take control of Ukraine, to take away the choice of Ukrainian people to chose their future ... . It’s something that concerns all of us who cherish democracy.”WHAT DOES POPE FRANCIS WANT?Pope Francis prayed that political leaders put aside personal interests and let dialogue prevail amid concerns of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.Francis kicked off a daylong prayer for peace in Ukraine on Wednesday with a special appeal at the end of his weekly general audience. “Please, never again war,” Francis said. “Let us insistently ask the Lord that in this land may fraternity overcome wounds, fears and divisions."Noting that Thursday marks Holocaust Remembrance Day, Francis said Ukrainians had suffered tremendous cruelties during World War II.“They deserve peace,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ukraine-crisis-updates-what-to-know-as-tensions-rise-101643250310432.html
27-01-2022||World||Afghanistan hanging by a thread; cannot abandon Afghan people, says UN Chief||With Afghanistan "hanging by a thread" six months after the Taliban takeover, the world cannot abandon the country now - for the sake of its people and overall global security, said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Wednesday."At this moment, we need the global community - and this Council - to put their hands on the wheel of progress, provide resources, and prevent Afghanistan from spiralling any further," Guterres said in his briefing to the UN Security Council on Afghanistan.Guterres also outlined action for the de facto rulers of the country, the Taliban, calling on the fundamentalists to expand opportunity and security for Afghans, uphold human rights, and demonstrate real commitment to be part of the international community, the UN said in a statement.The Secretary-General said Afghanistan has long been unfairly used as a platform for political agendas, geopolitical advantage, ideological dominance, brutal conflicts and terrorism."As a matter of moral responsibility - and regional and global security and prosperity - we cannot abandon the people of Afghanistan," he said, adding Afghans need peace, hope, and help, and they need it now.The country's economy is collapsing amid another brutal winter, and daily life has become "a frozen hell". Over half of all citizens are facing extreme levels of hunger, and some families have been forced to sell their babies so they can buy food, said the statement.Meanwhile, sanctions and mistrust by the global banking system have frozen nearly USD 9 billion in central bank assets, and vital systems are starved of much-needed funds.As the economy spirals downward, human rights are also losing ground.The UN chief highlighted the situation of women and girls, who are once again shut out of offices and classrooms. He also appealed for the release of women activists who were arrested or abducted recently.Guterres reminded the Council that earlier this month, the UN launched a more than USD 4.4 billion appeal for Afghanistan to keep the food, education and economic systems from collapsing.He urged countries to suspend rules and conditions that constrict both the Afghan economy and lifesaving humanitarian operations.The Secretary-General underscored the need to "jump-start" the Afghan economy through increased liquidity, including by freeing-up frozen currency reserves and through cash injections.The UN chief also urged the Taliban to demonstrate real commitment to be part of the international community. "The window for trust-building is open. But this trust must be earned," he said.Afghanistan has been a fertile breeding ground for terrorist groups for far too long, and the UN chief underscored the critical need to promote security and fight terrorism."If we do not act and help Afghans weather this storm, the region and the world will pay a heavy price," he said, urging the de facto authorities to work together with the global community to suppress the terrorism threat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-hanging-by-a-thread-cannot-abandon-afghan-people-says-un-chief-101643249455024.html
27-01-2022||World||International Holocaust Remembrance Day: Theme, significance, events scheduled||The United Nations will mark the International Holocaust Remembrance Day on Thursday in honour of six million Jews killed in the Holocaust, and millions of other victims of Nazism. On this day, the UN urges every member state to develop educational programs to help prevent future genocides.The theme of this year’s Holocaust remembrance and education is “Memory, Dignity and Justice”. The theme encompasses safeguarding the historical record, remembering the victims, and challenging the distortion of history often expressed in contemporary antisemitism. It encourages action to challenge hatred, strengthen solidarity and champion compassion, according to the UN.“The writing of history and the act of remembering brings dignity and justice to those whom the perpetrators of the Holocaust intended to obliterate,” the UN says on its website.UN approves resolution condemning Holocaust denialThe UN organises Holocaust commemorative and educational activities to draw attention to the actions taken by the survivors to reclaim their rights, history, cultural heritage and traditions, and their dignity.On Thursday, the UN Chamber Music Society will perform a virtual concert in memory of the victims of the Holocaust. The virtual concert will include a classical music programme featuring Jewish composers, special performances from musicians from Maestro Daniel Barenboim’s West–Eastern Divan Orchestra.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will speak at the Holocaust memorial ceremony hosted by Melissa Fleming, UN under-secretary-general for global communications.

27-01-2022||World||North Korea fires 'unidentified projectile', ignores US offer of talks||North Korea fired an "unidentified projectile" early Thursday, Seoul said, its sixth apparent weapons test this year as the nuclear-armed country flexes its military muscles and ignores Washington's offers of talks.The last time North Korea tested this many weapons in a month was in 2019, after high-profile negotiations between leader Kim Jong Un and then-United States president Donald Trump collapsed.Since then, talks with the US have languished, and the country is reeling economically from biting international sanctions and a self-imposed coronavirus blockade."North Korea fired an unidentified projectile into the East Sea," Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said, referring to the Sea of Japan.Pyongyang fired two suspected cruise missiles on Tuesday, which are not banned under current UN sanctions on North Korea.It also tested suspected ballistic missiles on January 14 and 17, and fired what it said were hypersonic missiles on January 5 and 11.The string of sanction-busting tests drew global condemnation, including a closed-door meeting of the UN Security Council meeting.The United States also imposed new sanctions in response, prompting an angry reply from North Korea, which last week hinted that it could resume nuclear and long-range weapons tests.Pyongyang has not tested intercontinental ballistic missiles or nukes since 2017, and has continued to observe a self-imposed moratorium even after diplomacy with the United States stalled.'Offensive weapons'The North's saber-rattling comes at a delicate time in the region, with Kim's sole major ally China set to host the Winter Olympics next month and South Korea gearing up for a presidential election in March."The Kim regime is developing an impressive diversity of offensive weapons despite limited resources and serious economic challenges," said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Seoul's Ewha University."Certain North Korean tests aim to develop new capabilities, especially for evading missile defenses," he added."Other launches are intended to demonstrate the readiness and versatility of missile forces that North Korea has already deployed."After a decade in power, leader Kim has little to celebrate, with a Covid-battered economy causing food shortages at home, diplomacy with the United States stalled and biting sanctions taking their toll.That may explain why North Korea has carried out five weapons tests in the last three weeks, analysts said earlier in the week -- and a dramatic demonstration of the nuclear-armed country's military prowess offers a quick win ahead of important domestic anniversaries.The country is preparing to mark the 80th anniversary of the birth of Kim's father, late leader Kim Jong Il, in February, as well as the 110th birthday of the country's founding leader Kim Il Sung in April.It may also be looking to conduct tests ahead of the start of the Beijing Winter Olympics next week, lest it anger its sole major ally China by raining missiles on its parade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-fires-unidentified-projectile-ignores-us-offer-of-talks-101643245696533.html
27-01-2022||World||Not just Amazon packages: Police say dozens of guns looted from Los Angeles train||Dozens of guns have been stolen from freight trains that have been looted in Los Angeles, the city's police chief has said.Images of the detritus left behind by thieves who break into stationary wagons in the middle of the second biggest city in the United States swept around the world this month.Now the city's top policeman has said that the bandits got away with more than just Amazon packages."People were... breaking into these containers and stealing firearms, tens of firearms," Michael Moore told the Police Commission this week."That gave us great concern as a source again of further violence in the city."An AFP team filmed thousands of gutted boxes on the stretch of tracks near the city center, many from major retailers like Target, and being shipped by carriers including UPS and FedEx.The thieves wait until the long freight trains stop on the tracks and break the locks with bolt cutters.They then help themselves to parcels, ditching anything too difficult to sell.The haul could include anything that moves around the country from or to retailers.And, the police now say, guns.Firearms purchased online in the United States cannot legally be shipped to the customer, but can be sent instead to a licensed dealer for pick-up.Since December 2020, rail operator Union Pacific (UP), whose convoys are being targeted, has seen a 160 percent increase in thefts in Los Angeles County."In October 2021 alone, the increase reaches 356 percent compared to October 2020," the operator said in a letter to local authorities seen by AFP.The phenomenon was accelerated in the run-up to Christmas, as freight volumes rocketed.According to figures reported by UP, more than 90 containers were vandalized on average each day in Los Angeles County in the last quarter of 2021.The operator, which manages nearly 280 miles (450 kilometers) of track in Los Angeles County, puts the cost of the damage incurred over the course of 2021 at about $5 million.The figure does not include losses to customers affected by the thefts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-just-amazon-packages-police-say-dozens-of-guns-looted-from-los-angeles-train-101643245640862.html
27-01-2022||World||Covid-19: Moderna starts clinical trials of Omicron-specific vaccine booster||US biotech company Moderna announced on Wednesday that it has begun clinical trials of a booster dose of vaccine designed specifically to combat the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.The trials will involve a total of 600 adults -- half of whom have already received two doses of Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine at least six months ago, and half of whom have received two doses plus the previously authorized booster dose.The booster specifically targeting Omicron will therefore be evaluated as both a third and a fourth dose.The company also reported results on the efficacy against Omicron of the booster that has already been authorized.It said that six months after the booster injection, the levels of neutralizing antibodies against Omicron were reduced by six times from the peak observed 29 days after the injection -- but remained detectable in all participants.These data were obtained by studying the blood of 20 people who received the 50 microgram booster, half the amount of the first two injections."We are reassured by the antibody persistence against Omicron at six months after the currently authorized" booster, Moderna chief executive Stephane Bancel said in the statement."Nonetheless, given the long-term threat demonstrated by Omicron's immune escape, we are advancing our Omicron-specific variant vaccine booster candidate and we are pleased to begin this part of our Phase 2 study," Bancel continued.Moderna's statement came the day after rivals Pfizer and BioNTech said they had begun enrollment for a clinical trial for an Omicron-specific vaccine.Both vaccines are based on messenger RNA technology, which makes it relatively easy to update them to keep up with mutations specific to new variants.Several countries, including the United States, have begun to see a decline in cases associated with the infection wave caused by Omicron, the most transmissible variant detected so far, but the number of infections worldwide continues to rise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-moderna-starts-clinical-trials-of-omicron-specific-vaccine-booster-101643242927557.html
27-01-2022||World||US, Russia in war of threats over Ukraine||Russia hit back on Wednesday at US threats of direct sanctions against President Vladimir Putin, saying moves against the Russian leader would be ineffective and hurt efforts to lower tensions over Ukraine.Also Read | Ukraine Russia tension: Biden threatens Putin with personal sanctionsThe West has warned Russia of severe consequences if it does invade, and on Tuesday, Washington said there could be sanctions personally targeting Putin.Reacting to the news, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the threats as worthless because senior Russian officials are barred from holding assets abroad. But such a move, he said, would do serious damage to diplomatic efforts to ease rising tensions over Ukraine.
