05-01-2022||World||HT This Day: Jan 6, 1965 – TS Eliot dead||Reuters, APLondon- One of Britain’s greatest literary figures, American-born poet, critic and dramatist T. S. Eliot, died at his London home last night. He was 76. Mr. Eliot, who won, the Nobel Prize for literature in 1948, lived London since World War I. He was one of the creators of modern poetry and is perhaps best remembered for a line that has passed by now into common usage-"this is the way the world ends....not with a bans but a whimper." Mr Eliot, a native of St. Louis, Missouri, spent most of his adult life in Britain. Mr Thomas Stearns Eliot suffered a heart attack aboard the liner Queen Mary in June 1956 but recovered and married his secretary the following January when he was 68 years old. His bride, 30-year-old Valerie Fletcher, was his second wife. His two most successful plays were Murder in the Cathedral, a dramatization of the murder of Archbishop Thomas Becket in Canterbury Cathedral, and The Cocktail Party, the story of a psychiatrist who helped people find peace of mind. Never a prolific writer, Mr Eliot nevertheless was considered a perfect commentator on both poetry and prose and the theatre. He relinquished his U.S. citizenship in 1927 and became a British subject.Mr Eliot celebrated the loneliness of modern man in his poetry. In his later years his critical essays were more and more concerned with problems of Christianity. He was an outspoken member of the Church of England and one of its leading defenders. Long ago be save his three leading ideals in life as classicism in poetry, Anglo-Catholicism a religion and Royalism in politics. In private life, he was a director of Faber and Faber, one of England's leading publishers. Daily he went to his office, tall, slender and stooped, in a dark suit that made him look like a banker. He avoided London's literary whirl and was a churchwarden in his parish in sedate London district of South Kensington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ht-this-day-jan-6-1965-ts-eliot-dead-101641406220961.html
05-01-2022||World||UK authorities ease Covid testing requirements amid surge in infections||Health authorities across the UK simplified Covid-19 testing requirements on Wednesday, a move designed to cut isolation times for many people and that may ease the staffing shortages that are hitting public services from hospitals to garbage collection amid an omicron-fueled surge in infections.In another effort to bolster the economy, Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the House of Commons that pre-departure tests for people traveling to England will no longer be required because the omicron variant is so prevalent that travel restrictions meant to contain its spread are now meaningless. The tests had discouraged people from traveling overseas for fear they would get stuck abroad.The moves came as the Cabinet backed Johnson's decision not to impose any further restrictions despite record Covid-19 infection levels. With indications that omicron is less severe than earlier variants and widespread vaccination curtailing serious illnesses, the government is sticking with light-touch controls imposed in mid-December.“All these measures are balanced and proportionate ways of ensuring we can live with Covid without letting our guard down," Johnson told lawmakers.The UK Health Security Agency said that from Jan. 11 people in England who test positive using a rapid lateral flow test will no longer need to confirm the result with a PCR test if they are asymptomatic.The temporary move, which also was used early last year, will cut the time people who record a positive lateral flow test but don't have Covid-19 symptoms need to self-isolate. They will no longer need to wait for the result of a PCR test and then begin another seven days of isolation.“While cases of Covid continue to rise, this tried-and-tested approach means that LFDs (lateral flow devices) can be used confidently to indicate Covid-19 infection without the need for PCR confirmation," said Jenny Harries, the agency's chief executive.Health authorities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland quickly followed suit, with Northern Ireland making the change immediately. Scotland and Wales plan to introduce it starting Thursday.Epidemiologist John Edmunds, a professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said the move made sense.“When the prevalence is high, and it is incredibly high at the moment, almost everyone who tests positive with a lateral flow test will be a true positive," Edmunds said. “There is really no need to confirm this with a PCR, a step that not only wastes time but costs a lot of money and uses up laboratory resources that could be better used elsewhere."But he cautioned that the change will mean authorities have less data about the spread of different variants as PCR swabs are used for genotyping and sequencing to identify different mutations. The change also will mean that daily updates on confirmed cases — which come from PCR tests — "may need more careful interpretation,” he said.Confirmed new infections over the last seven days jumped 40% from a week earlier, according to the latest government statistics.The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, tested positive for the coronavirus and missed the chance to grill Johnson about the government’s Covid-19 policies on Wednesday.A string of National Health Service local organizations have declared "critical incidents" in recent days amid staff shortages. Hospitals in the Greater Manchester region said they would pause some non-urgent surgeries amid the rising impact of Covid-19 and worker absences.Gillian Keegan, a junior minister at the UK Ministry of Health, acknowledged the strain in an interview with the BBC.“Right now, they are under extreme pressure with the omicron variant, with the number of positive cases and the increase in hospitalizations, and at this point in (winter) time when they always have extreme pressure," Keegan said.There have also been cuts to train services and garbage is piling up on some city streets because of sanitation staff shortages.NHS Confederation Chief Executive Matthew Taylor told the BBC he would support the new testing regime if scientists deem it safe.“Hospitals who have declared critical incidents, for example, are essentially reaching out to staff who are on leave, on rest days or even recently retired and asking them to come back to wards, so the situation is desperate," Taylor said. "Any way of getting staff back into hospital is a good thing."An ambulance service in northeast England began advising patients with non-life-threatening conditions over the New Year's weekend to ask a relative to drive them to a hospital as waiting times for ambulances rose because of staff shortages and extra demand.“It is still taking us too long to get an ambulance to patients. Unfortunately, due to this, patients remain at risk, which is unacceptable," North East Ambulance Service medical director Mathew Beattie said Wednesday.He stressed, however, that "we would never ask anyone to drive themselves to hospital with a life-threatening illness.”Opposition politicians and some public health experts have pressed the government to tighten restrictions on business and personal interactions as omicron sweeps across the country. Johnson has resisted their calls after almost 100 of his party’s lawmakers opposed mask requirements and other infection-control measures imposed last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-authorities-ease-covid-testing-requirements-amid-surge-in-infections-101641405556752.html
05-01-2022||World||France allows some Covid-19 positive medics to keep working||France is allowing health care workers who are infected with the coronavirus but have few or no symptoms to keep treating patients rather than self-isolate, an extraordinary stopgap measure aimed at easing staff shortages at hospitals and other facilities caused by an unprecedented explosion in cases.The special exemption to France's quarantine rules being rolled out to hospitals, elderly care homes, doctors' offices and other essential health services testifies to the growing strain on the French medical system by the fast-spreading omicron variant.It is a calculated risk, with the possibility that health care workers with Covid-19 could infect colleagues and patients being weighed against what the government says is a need to keep essential services running.Outside the health sector, for those not covered by the special exemption, France's quarantine rules require at least five days of self-isolation for the fully vaccinated who test positive. For the unvaccinated, self-isolation is at least seven days.Governments and industries have warned that isolation rules are creating staff shortages across a range of sectors as the omicron variant causes surges in infections in many countries. In some places, quarantines have been shortened, including France, to get workers back to their posts.But in Europe, France appears to be alone in now also opening up the possibility for health care personnel to work while infected.There are increasing signs that the variant causes less-severe disease. But the deluge of infections is still sending increasing numbers of people to hospitals, putting those institutions under pressure, especially when medical workers are absent, too.French hospital authorities said the new flexibility from self-isolation would help them plug staffing holes if and when they open up.“If the system becomes very strained and 50% of our staff are positive, the less symptomatic will come to work because the patients will still need to be cared for,” said Dr. Marc Leone, head of anesthesiology at the North Hospital in the southern city of Marseille.“But we're not in that situation yet,” he said.The new rules were detailed in a Health Ministry alert message that was addressed Sunday to hospitals, care facilities and health authorities and was seen by The Associated Press. The changes are being rolled out this week.The ministry alert said France's deluge of virus infections poses “a major risk of disruption to the offer of care.” It described the measure as “exceptional and temporary" and said it will be lifted when the system isn't so saturated with virus cases.The exemption opens the possibility for doctors, hospital staff, and those working with the disabled and other vulnerable people to stay on the job despite testing positive, on condition that they are fully vaccinated and aren't coughing and sneezing.In the Paris region, hospitals said the measure could be applied as a last resort if infected staff are urgently needed to help keep services open and if they volunteer to work.“If they are tired, have a scratchy throat and prefer to stay at home, nobody will force them to come to work with Covid,” said Romain Eskenazi, communications director for two hospitals in the French capital's northern suburbs.Professor Rémi Salomon, a commission president for the Paris hospitals' authority, said that while staff absences are “a major problem,” allowing infected staff to work is “extremely hard to implement.”“Health workers say to themselves, ‘I’m scared of transmitting the virus to patients,'" he told broadcaster France Info.The Health Ministry instructions say that, where possible, the infected workers shouldn't be in contact with unvaccinated patients or those at greater risk of severe illness with Covid-19.The ministry said they also must limit as much as possible their interactions with colleagues and cannot take part in shared activities where face masks are removed, such as breaks for food and drinks.With Europe’s highest number of confirmed daily virus cases, France is in an increasingly challenging position.France’s average daily case load has more than doubled in a week, and the country reported a record 271,686 daily virus cases Tuesday as the omicron variant burdens hospital staff and threatens to disrupt health care, transportation, schools and other services.More than 20,000 people are hospitalized with the virus in France, a number that has been rising steadily for weeks but not as sharply as infection rates.Covid-19 patients fill more than 72% of France’s ICU beds, and the once-renowned health care system is again showing signs of strain. Most virus patients in ICUs are not vaccinated, though 77% of the population has had at least two doses.More than 124,000 people with the virus have died in France, among the world’s higher recorded death tolls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-allows-some-covid-19-positive-medics-to-keep-working-101641404033547.html

In his first phone conversation with the German leader since he assumed office, Modi congratulated Scholz on his appointment and expressed appreciation for the “immense contribution” of his predecessor Angela Merkel in strengthening the India-Germany strategic partnership. Modi said he looked forward to “continuing this positive momentum under the leadership” of Sholz, according to a readout from the Indian side. “They reviewed the potential of ongoing cooperation initiatives, including for promoting investment and trade links. They agreed on the potential for further diversifying cooperation and exchanges in new areas,” the readout said. “In particular, they expressed the hope to commence new cooperation initiatives in the areas of climate action and green energy, to enable both countries to achieve their respective climate commitments.” Modi and Scholz also agreed there is “significant synergy in the governance priorities announced by the new German government and India’s own economic vision”. Modi also said he looked forward to meeting Sholz soon for the next meeting of the bilateral inter-governmental consultations. “Spoke to @OlafScholz today and congratulated him on assuming charge as German Chancellor. I look forward to working with him to further strengthen the India-Germany Strategic Partnership, and to meeting him soon for the 6th Inter-Governmental Consultations,” Modi tweeted after the conversation. Separately, external affairs minister S Jaishankar spoke to his counterparts from Australia, Bhutan, Indonesia and the Maldives and reviewed bilateral relations. “A New Year call with Australian FM and Quad partner @MarisePayne. Confident that 2022 will see even greater advancement in our ties,” Jaishankar said in a tweet. “A warm conversation and New Year greetings exchanged with @FMBhutan. Assessed the continuing progress in our Development Partnership.

Instead, he has bet that a vaccine booster drive and caution among the population will be enough to constrain the latest wave of infections, despite the arrival of the highly transmissible Omicron variant.More than 220,000 Covid-19 cases were recorded on one day in the last week, and the provision of services and testing capacity is increasingly under strain.Many countries still not sequencing Omicron: WHO chief scientistIn England, the estimated Covid-19 prevalence was one in 15 for the week ending Dec. 31 -- over 6% of the population and up from an estimate of one in 25 for the previous week, the Office for National Statistics said.ONS figures also showed record prevalence in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In all, an estimated nearly 3.75 million people were infected across the United Kingdom.The Omicron variant has had the biggest impact in London, where one in 10 people tested positive.Johnson said on Tuesday that England had a chance to "ride out" the surge in Covid-19 infections without shutting down the economy, thanks to vaccinations and evidence that Omicron is milder than previous variants.Despite this, he warned of substantial disruption from staff absences as people self-isolate. He will update parliament later on Wednesday on his Covid-19 strategy.The UK Health Security Agency said on Wednesday that people without Covid-19 symptoms who test positive on a rapid lateral flow test in England will not need to confirm the result with a PCR test that needs to go to the lab for processing, a move designed to ease pressure on the testing system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-reports-record-covid-prevalence-1-in-15-infected-in-england-last-week-101641397357652.html

I am sure like his predecessors, he will achieve new progress.”“As the host country of the SCO secretariat, China will continue to support the secretariat and the secretary-general and will work with other parties to uphold the Shanghai spirit, deepen political security, trade, connectivity and cultural cooperation,” Wang said.The SCO comprises eight member states: India, Kazakhstan, China, the Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.The security-focused bloc also comprises four countries with “observer” status and six more as “dialogue partners”.India and Pakistan joined SCO at the Astana summit in 2017.Zhang, who had served in Yemen, Oman and Israel among other countries, had earlier served as both assistant minister and vice-minister of foreign affairs at the Chinese ministry of foreign affairs.The senior Chinese diplomat’s takers over SCO head in the backdrop of Pakistan’s frequent efforts to bring up the issue of Kashmir, a bilateral one, at the multilateral forum, going against the mechanism’s charter.In September, NSA Ajit Doval walked out of a virtual meeting of national security advisers of SCO states after his Pakistani counterpart, Moeed Yusuf, projected a map, which inaccurately depicted the borders of the two countries.And, in November, external affairs minister S Jaishankar criticised another attempt to bring up bilateral problems at the 20th meeting of the SCO Council of Heads of Government.“It is unfortunate to note that there have been repeated attempts to deliberately bring bilateral issues into SCO. This violates the well-established principles and norms of SCO Charter. Such acts are counterproductive to the spirit of consensus and cooperation that define this organisation and should be condemned,” Jaishankar then said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/veteran-chinese-diplomat-appointed-sco-secretarygeneral-101641388222528.html
05-01-2022||World||Birth rates in 10 Chinese provinces fell below 1% in 2020: Report||Birth rates in ten Chinese provinces, including Henan - the third most populated province in the country with nearly 100 million people - fell below one percent in the 2020 for the first time in decades, new official statistics showed, according to a news report on Tuesday.The data, released by individual provinces in China, corroborates what central official statistics revealed last November: China’s average birth rate fell below one percent in 2020, marking the lowest rate of childbirth since 1978, according to a report in the Global Times.China recorded a birth rate of 8.52 per 1,000 people in 2020, according to the China Statistical Yearbook 2020 compiled and released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in November, the report said.According to the fresh statistics provided by the local government, between 1.1 million to 1.2 million births were recorded each year from 2002 to 2010 in Henan, a central Chinese province. “However, its birth rate for the first time fell to 9.24 per 1,000 people in 2020, and the number of new babies was 920,000, also a new low since 1978,” the Global Times report said.The birth rates in some developed regions such as eastern China’s Jiangsu province was below even the national level, falling to 6.66 per 1,000 people. Beijing and Tianjin, a city located some 100km from the capital, saw rates of 6.98 and 5.99 per 1,000 people, respectively, the report said.Other regions, like Guizhou province in the southwest and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in the south, saw birth rates above the national average of 8.52 per thousand people, the report said.Demographers in China say fertility rates are falling because of various reasons, including, bur not limited to, an ageing population, changes in people’s choices, and even the upheaval caused by the Covid pandemic.“China faces challenges including an aging population and changes in people’s choices. Low birth rates will continue due to many factors,” Song Jian from the Centre for Population and Development Studies of Renmin University of China, told the Global Times.China in August last year further amended the Population and Family Planning Law, allowing couples to have three children in an attempt to boost falling birth rates. This measure came after Beijing in 2016 scrapped its decades-old one-child policy to replace it with a two-child limit, which failed to deliver the expected upsurge in births.The decision to allow three children was taken after China’s once-in-a-decade census published in May 2021 showed that the country’s population grew at the slowest pace to 1.41 billion until the end of 2020.The new census figures revealed that the demographic crisis China faced was expected to deepen as the population of people above 60 years grew to 264 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/birth-rates-in-10-chinese-provinces-fell-below-1-in-2020-report-101641378862139.html

The strain has reportedly more mutations than Omicron and 12 cases caused by this variant have already been found. The World Health Organization has acknowledged the variant but said it has not become much of a threat as of now.WHO said the variant was first identified in November and it has been on the radar since then. The virus had a lot of chances to pick up, Abdi Mahamud, a WHO incident manager on Covid, said.Explained: When was IHU variant first discovered and its spreadWHO monitors multiple variants and assesses their risk factors. IHU has not been labelled as a 'variant under investigation' by WHO as of now as the cases are limited to France. Conclusion:🟢 Nothing to panic or worry too much at the moment , given the evidence.🟡But clearly something that needs to be watched closely for the coming weeks.Scientists are of the opinion that Omicron which is spreading at an alarming rate is of a higher concern than IHU as it has already been there for some months. Vinod Scaria, a scientist of Delhi's Institute of Genomic and Integrative Biology, tweeted on Tuesday, "Nothing to panic or worry too much (about) at the moment, given the evidence. But clearly, something that needs to be watched closely for the coming weeks."The variant has popped up in discussions because of a week-old study by researchers from Méditerranée Infection in Marseille, part of France’s Instituts hospitalo-universitaires (IHU, or University Hospital Institutes).According to reports, the variant was identified in 12 people in the southern Alps around the same time when Omicron was discovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-covid-variant-ihu-what-who-said-on-this-101641377249233.html

He said physical masses will take place in other provinces and online masses for devotees in the capital.In prior years, devotees clad in yellow and maroon have thronged the life-sized tatute as it is paraded through the streets of Manila aboard a rope-pulled carriage.The health ministry on Wednesday reported 10,775 new COVID-19 cases, the highest daily spike since Oct. 10, and more then 60 times the 168 cases recorded on Dec. 21.The tally, which was nearly double the day before, brought total cases to over 2.86 million, and deaths to more than 51,600, the second highest COVID-19 infections and casualties in Southeast Asia, next to Indonesia.Acting Presidential Spokesperson Karlo Nograles urged areas outside the capital region to step up vaccinations amid the threat of the Omicron variant which had already prompted the government to tighten curbs this week."The numbers clearly show these can prevent serious cases of COVID," Nograles said in a statement.The Philippines has so far detected 14 domestic and imported cases of the highly contagious Omicron variant that has driven up COVID-19 case counts and dampened New Year festivities around much of the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-cancels-black-nazarene-parade-attended-by-millions-covid-concerns-101641376762765.html

It has maintained a strict Covid-zero policy, designed to eliminate all traces of the virus within its borders.The growing number of Omicron cases and a looming expansion of the vaccine mandate has enlivened the city’s stagnant immunisation rollout.

Beijing responded with a stern warning that if Taiwan crossed any red line it would lead to "profound catastrophe".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-air-force-stages-drill-to-intercept-chinese-planes-amid-tensions-101641369626064.html
05-01-2022||World||Kazakhstan government resigns after fierce protests over fuel price||Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev accepted the government's resignation on Wednesday, his office said, after violent protests triggered by a fuel price increase rocked the oil-rich Central Asian country.Police used tear gas and stun grenades late on Tuesday to drive hundreds of protesters out of the main square in Almaty, the former Soviet republic's biggest city, and clashes went on for hours in nearby areas.The protests shook the former Soviet republic's image as a politically stable and tightly-controlled nation - which it has used to attract hundreds of billions of dollars of foreign investment into its oil and metals industries over three decades of independence.Tokayev declared a state of emergency in Almaty and the oil-producing western Mangistau province early on Wednesday and has said that domestic and foreign provocateurs were behind the violence.The protests began in Mangistau province on Sunday following the lifting of price caps on liquefied petroleum gas, a popular car fuel, a day earlier, after which its price more than doubled.Speaking to acting cabinet members on Wednesday, Tokayev ordered them and provincial governors to reinstate LPG price controls and broaden them to gasoline, diesel and other "socially important" consumer goods.He also ordered the government to develop a personal bankruptcy law and consider freezing utilities' prices and subsidising rent payments for poor families.He said the situation was improving in protest-hit cities and towns after the state of emergency was declared which effected a curfew and movement restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kazakhstan-government-resigns-after-fierce-protests-over-fuel-price-101641358304556.html
05-01-2022||World||China’s locked down Xi'an city in chaos after Covid app crash||China’s Covid-19 health code system that strictly governs people’s movements crashed in Xi’an this week, worsening conditions in the locked-down city where the country’s worst outbreak since Wuhan has been unfolding.The crash has complicated efforts to weed out cases through mass testing, created hurdles for people seeking care at hospitals and led to the suspension of a top official, the latest among a slew of bureaucrats to be punished as Beijing fumes over the situation.Liu Jun, head of Xi’an’s big-data bureau, was temporarily dismissed over performance failures, the municipal Communist Party Committee said in a statement. While the committee didn’t explicitly lay out the reason behind its decision, it came after Xi’an’s health code system -- which is under Liu’s purview and tracks individuals’ movements and vaccination status -- broke down on Tuesday.The system crash meant that locals were unable to access their Covid infection status after Xi’an embarked on a new widespread round of nucleic acid tests, according to a media report. The provincial government said in a statement later that the system was temporarily paralyzed due to overwhelming traffic, and being fixed. It had also experienced technical issues in December.People must show their health codes -- which prove that they tested negative for Covid -- to enter hospitals. A mother lost her baby after waiting more than two hours as a hospital wouldn’t let her in without the health code showing that she was infection-free, according to a video trending on Weibo. The provincial women’s federation said it was looking into the matter.Similar complaints and criticisms were seen elsewhere on Chinese social media as patients failed to get timely treatment at hospitals already overwhelmed by the virus.  With more than 1,700 cases, the virus situation in Xi’an has triggered shortages of food and medical care amid a lockdown that has banned its more than 13 million residents from leaving their homes without a special reason. The strict measures -- some of the toughest in the world -- come as Chinese authorities race to curtail the country’s Covid outbreak ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympics next month, and have led to increasingly vocal frustration among locals.A Dozen Days of Lockdown Spurs Angst in Chinese City of Xi’anChina is the only country left practicing a zero-tolerance Covid strategy, which involves ever-escalating measures to bring infections down to zero. While the Xi’an outbreak is of the delta variant, the more-transmissible omicron strain now roiling the world will challenge the approach even further. Mainland China has not yet reported any community spread of omicron.Two other local officials, including the deputy mayor, were removed this week over their handling of the outbreak.“The Xi’an outbreak is the most severe after the Wuhan lockdown,” Zeng Guang, one of China’s top Covid-19 advisers and former chief scientist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, was quoted as saying by a local newspaper Tuesday. “We hope Xi’an can create a new experience in containing an outbreak in the short-term, after losing control at the very initial stage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-locked-down-xi-an-city-in-chaos-after-covid-app-crash-101641356598371.html
05-01-2022||World||Omicron stays unhindered by most antibody treatments, show early tests||Amid an explosive surge of Covid-19 cases around the world majorly caused by the highly transmissible Omicron variant, studies show that antibody treatments that were effective against the previous coronavirus strains may not be effective against the new variant.According to a report by Nature journal, several pre-print publications tell that Omicron is “totally or partially resistant to all currently available treatments based on these monoclonal antibodies”. As a result, many manufacturers of antibody therapy have already conceded their products due to a much lower potency against Omicron, as compared to other variants.The only two antibodies that show strong evidence, the report stated, were sotrovimab, developed by Vir Biotechnology in San Francisco, California, and GSK, headquartered in London; and DXP-604.Also Read | Covid-19 case counts may be losing importance amid OmicronThe US health officials said that they will ration sotrovimab to various states depending on the Covid-19 severity and number of infections and hospitalisations. However, many countries have no access to sotrovimab at all.Generally, monoclonal-antibody treatments for Covid-19, whether from a single antibody or a cocktail of several, prevent the virus from infecting human cells, reducing the risk of the viral infection by up to 85 per cent.Also Read | The more Omicron spreads, the more likely it is to give rise to new variant: WHOIn the case of Omicron, the concentration of the treatment which should cut viral replication in half, could not even reach the threshold, even with increased concentration, researchers quoted in the report said.“We didn’t expect to see such a shift in the antibodies’ effectiveness,” said Olivier Schwartz, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris and a co-author of one of the pre-prints.Sotrovimab is the best available antibody treatment. But the only two antibody treatments that retain some neutralisation power against Omicron are the ones developed by AstraZeneca in Cambridge, United Kingdom, studies found.So far, Omicron has proved to be more contagious but less severe as compared to the highly infectious Delta strain. Although there are fewer hospitalisations from the new variant till now, “if Omicron bites hard, it’ll be a recipe for disaster,” said Stuart Turville, a virologist at the Kirby Institute in Sydney, Australia, and a co-author of one of the preprints.Omicron is the dominant variant in the US. New Covid-19 cases per day have more than tripled over the past two weeks, reaching a record-shattering average of 480,000. Schools, hospitals and airlines in the US are struggling as scores of infected workers went into isolation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-stays-unhindered-by-most-antibody-treatments-show-early-tests-101641353411537.html
05-01-2022||World||The more Omicron spreads, the more likely it is to give rise to new variant: WHO||Soaring Omicron cases around the globe could increase the risk of a newer, more dangerous variant emerging, the World Health Organization in Europe warned on Tuesday.While the variant is spreading like wildfire around the world, it appears to be far less severe than initially feared and has raised hopes that the pandemic could be overcome and life return to more normality.But WHO senior emergencies officer Catherine Smallwood sounded an ominous note of caution, telling AFP that the soaring infection rates could have the opposite effect."The more Omicron spreads, the more it transmits and the more it replicates, the more likely it is to throw out a new variant. Now, Omicron is lethal, it can cause death ... maybe a little bit less than Delta, but who's to say what the next variant might throw out," Smallwood told AFP in an interview.Europe has registered more than 100 million Covid cases since the start of the pandemic, and more than five million new cases in the last week of 2021, "almost dwarfing what we have seen in the past", Smallwood said."We're in a very dangerous phase, we're seeing infection rates rise very significantly in Western Europe, and the full impact of that is not yet clear," she said.Smallwood also noted that while "on an individual level there's probably a decreased risk of hospitalisation" with the Omicron variant compared to Delta, overall, Omicron could pose a greater threat because of the sheer number of cases."When you see the cases rise so significantly, that's likely to generate a lot more people with severe disease, ending up in hospital and possibly going on to die," she said.Britain on Tuesday faced warnings of an impending hospital crisis due to staff shortages caused by a wave of Omicron infections, as the country's daily Covid caseload breached 200,000 for the first time.Smallwood said she expected that scenario to play out in other European countries as well."Even in well-capacitated, sophisticated health systems there are real struggles that are happening at the moment, and it's likely that these will play out across the region as Omicron drives cases upwards."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-more-omicron-spreads-the-more-likely-it-is-to-give-rise-to-new-variant-who-101641347319603.html

05-01-2022||World||China is not expanding nuclear arsenal: Official||A senior Chinese arms control official denied on Tuesday that his government is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal, though he said it is taking steps to modernise its nuclear forces.Fu Cong, the director general of the foreign ministry’s arms control department, said that China is working to ensure its nuclear deterrent meets the minimum level necessary for national defence.“On the assertions made by US officials that China is expanding dramatically its nuclear capabilities, first, let me say that this is untrue,” he said.The news conference was held a day after China, the US, Russia, Great Britain and France issued a joint statement on preventing nuclear war or an arms race. The US defence department said in a report in November that China is expanding its nuclear force faster than previously predicted and could have more than 1,000 warheads by 2030. The US has 3,750 nuclear weapons.“China will continue to modernise its nuclear arsenal for reliability and safety issues,” Fu Cong said.But he said Beijing would “continue to modernise its nuclear arsenal for reliability and safety issues”.China also said Russia and the United States - by far the world’s largest nuclear powers - should make the first move on disarmament. “The US and Russia still possess 90% of the nuclear warheads on Earth,” he said, adding, “They must reduce their nuclear arsenal in an irreversible and legally binding manner.”Tesla criticised for new showroom in XinjiangTesla’s announcement that it has opened a showroom in Xinjiang has attracted criticism from US rights and trade groups on Tuesday. Xinjiang has become a significant point of conflict between Western governments and China in recent years, as UN experts and rights groups estimate more than a million people, mainly Uighurs and members of other Muslim minorities, have been detained in camps there.China has rejected accusations of forced labour or any other abuses there, saying that the camps provide vocational training and that companies should respect its policies there.The US electric car maker announced the showroom’s opening in Xinjiang’s regional capital, Urumqi, on its official Weibo account last Friday. “On the last day of 2021 we meet in Xinjiang,” it said in the post.On Tuesday, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the largest US Muslim advocacy organisation, criticised the move, saying that Tesla was “supporting genocide”.Tiananmen: HK activist gets 15 months in prisonA Hong Kong court sentenced a 36-year-old barrister to 15 months in prison on Tuesday for inciting an unauthorised assembly to commemorate those who died in China’s 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in and around Beijing’s Tiananmen Square.Activist Chow Hang-tung, of the since-closed Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, was arrested the day before the June 4 anniversary of the crackdown last year.Police have banned Hong Kong’s annual Tiananmen vigils for the last two years, citing coronavirus restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-is-not-expanding-nuclear-arsenal-official-101641347001569.html

Both vaccinated with three jabs, they had “mild symptoms” and were “feeling well under the circumstances”, the court said, adding that they were isolating at home.Separately, Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Ghazouani has tested positive for Covid, according to the state news agency, which noted that the 65-year-old’s symptoms were “mild”.Murder fugitive caught after going masklessPolish police on Tuesday said they arrested a man long sought for murder after he was stopped for not wearing a mask at a store in breach of Covid rules.“Police from the neighbourhood of Bielany detained the man because he didn’t have a mask,” Elwira Kozlowska, a Warsaw police spokeswoman, told AFP.

05-01-2022||World||US records 1 million Covid cases in a day||The United States recorded more than one million Covid-19 cases on Monday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, as the Omicron variant spread at a blistering pace.There were 1,080,211 new cases in the country, a global record, with the number of cases doubling on the previous week. It comes a day after top US pandemic adviser Anthony Fauci said the country was experiencing “almost a vertical increase” in Covid-19 cases, adding the peak may be only weeks away.Rates of death and hospitalisation in the US have been far lower in recent weeks than during previous Covid surges. With 9,382 deaths over the past seven days, the nation’s death toll has fallen by 10%, week-on-week.In the last seven days, the country has recorded 3.4 million cases at an average of 486,000 per day with a peak on January 3, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.The US record during previous waves was 258,000 cases per day, for the week of January 5 to 11, 2021. Officials have struggled to find a balance that will protect public health without gravely damaging the economy or slamming key services like policing and air travel.Omicron estimated to be 95.4% of variants in USThe Omicron variant was estimated to be 95.4% of the coronavirus strains circulating in the United States as of January 1, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Tuesday.The variant has swiftly spread across the country since its detection on December 1, replacing Delta as the dominant strain and sparking a new wave of infections.The CDC said the variant accounted for an estimated 77% of cases in the week ended December 25, up from the 58.6% projection it had disclosed last week. The Delta variant accounts for 4.6% of all US cases as of January 1, the data showed.New variant in FranceThe World Health Organization said a coronavirus variant found in France hasn’t become much of a threat since it was first identified in November. sThe variant “has been on our radar,” Abdi Mahamud, a WHO incident manager on Covid, said at a press briefing in Geneva on Tuesday. “That virus had a lot of chances to pick up.”The variant was identified in 12 people in the southern Alps around the same time that omicron was discovered in South Africa last year. The latter mutation has since travelled the globe and kindled record levels of contagion, unlike the French one that researchers at the IHU Mediterranee Infection - helmed by scientist Didier Raoult - dubbed IHU.The first patient identified with the variant was vaccinated and had just returned from Cameroon, IHU researchers wrote in a paper published on the medRxiv server in late December where they first drew attention to the atypical mutations.It’s “too early to speculate on virological, epidemiological or clinical features of this IHU variant based on these 12 cases,” they wrote in the article, which hasn’t been peer reviewed.China locks down city of 1.2mn after 3 virus casesMore than one million people in a city in central China were being confined to their homes on Tuesday after three asymptomatic coronavirus cases were recorded in the country’s latest mass lockdown.Beijing has pursued a “zero Covid” approach with tight border restrictions and targeted lockdowns since the virus first emerged. But the strategy has come under pressure with a series of recent local outbreaks and with just a month to go until the Winter Olympics.Yuzhou, a city with a population of around 1.17 million people in Henan province, announced that from Monday night all citizens were required to stay home to control the spread of the virus.Authorities in the northern Chinese city of Xian say they can provide food, health care and other necessities for the 13 million residents under a now almost two-week-old lockdown.But in social media posts and over the telephone, some citizens describe difficulties obtaining supplies and frustration with the economic impact on the giant city.UK sees record 200k casesThe UK government on Tuesday reported a record of more than 200,000 coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours as Omicron surges through the country.It said it had logged 218,724 infections - the highest daily total since the pandemic began.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson sees no need for further restrictions to curb the spread of Omicron his spokesman Max Blain said on ahead of a press conference on Tuesday.The government continues to monitor the data and is prepared to respond if the situation changes, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-records-1-million-covid-cases-in-a-day-101641346230939.html

05-01-2022||World||Covid-19 case counts may be losing importance amid Omicron||The explosive increase in US coronavirus case counts is raising alarm, but some experts believe the focus should instead be on Covid-19 hospital admissions. And those aren’t climbing as fast.Dr. Anthony Fauci, for one, said Sunday on ABC that with many infections causing few or no symptoms, "it is much more relevant to focus on the hospitalizations as opposed to the total number of cases." Other experts argue that case counts still have value.As the super-contagious omicron variant rages across the US, new Covid-19 cases per day have more than tripled over the past two weeks, reaching a record-shattering average of 480,000. Schools, hospitals and airlines are struggling as infected workers go into isolation.Meanwhile, hospital admissions averaged 14,800 per day last week, up 63% from the week before, but still short of the peak of 16,500 per day a year ago, when the vast majority of the U.S. was unvaccinated. Deaths have been stable over the past two weeks at an average of about 1,200 per day, well below the all-time high of 3,400 last January.Public health experts suspect that those numbers, taken together, reflect the vaccine’s continued effectiveness at preventing serious illness, even against omicron, as well as the possibility that the variant does not make most people as sick as earlier versions.Omicron accounted for 95% of new coronavirus infections in the US last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Tuesday, in another indication of how astonishingly fast the variant has spread since it was first detected in South Africa in late November.Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, director of ICAP, a global health center at Columbia University, said the case count does not appear to be the most important number now.Instead, she said, the US at this stage of the pandemic should be “shifting our focus, especially in an era of vaccination, to really focus on preventing illness, disability and death, and therefore counting those.”Daily case counts and their ups and downs have been one of the most closely watched barometers during the outbreak and have been a reliable early warning sign of severe disease and death in previous coronavirus waves.But they have long been considered an imperfect measure, in part because they consist primarily of laboratory-confirmed cases of Covid-19, not the actual number of infections out there, which is almost certainly many times higher.The daily case counts are also subject to wild swings. The number of new cases recorded on Monday topped an unprecedented 1 million, a figure that may reflect cases that had been held up by reporting delays over the holiday weekend. The seven-day rolling average is considered more reliable.Now, the value of the daily case count is being called into question as never before.For one thing, the skyrocketing increase reflects, at least in part, an omicron-induced stampede among many Americans to get tested before holiday gatherings, and new testing requirements at workplaces and at restaurants, theaters and other sites.Also, the true number of infections is probably much higher than the case count because the results of the at-home tests that Americans are rushing to use are not added to the official tally, and because long waits have discouraged some people from lining up to get swabbed.But also, case numbers seem to yield a less useful picture of the pandemic amid the spread of omicron, which is causing lots of infections but so far does not appear to be as severe in its effects.Case counts have lost relevance, said Andrew Noymer, a public health professor at the University of California, Irvine.“Hospitalizations are where the rubber meets the road,” Noymer said. “It’s a more objective measure." He added: "If I had to choose one metric, I would choose the hospitalization data.”Even hospital numbers aren't a perfect reflection of disease severity because they include patients admitted for other health problems who happen to test positive for the coronavirus.Keeping track of Covid-19 admissions can tell doctors something about the seriousness of the virus and also the capacity of hospitals to deal with the crisis. That, in turn, can help health leaders determine where to shift equipment and other resources.Still, health experts are not prepared to do away with case counts.“We should not abandon looking at case numbers," said Dr. Eric Topol, head of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, "but it is important to acknowledge we’re seeing only a portion of the actual number of cases.”Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle, said that for each new infection detected, the U.S. is missing two cases. But he said tracking the number of positive test results is still important as omicron makes its way across the land.Case numbers can point to future hot spots and indicate whether a wave of infection has peaked, Mokdad said.Also, case counts will continue to be important to people who are vulnerable because of age or health reasons and need a sense of the virus' spread in their communities so they can make decisions about precautions, he said. Hospitals, schools and businesses need to plan for absences.“To give up on knowing if cases are going up or down, it’s flying blind. How can we as a country not know the epidemic curve for infection?” Mokdad said.If testing has lost its relevance, he said, it is because the U.S. never developed a way to consistently and reliably monitor infections.“It’s not acceptable to cover failure by changing the rules," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-case-counts-may-be-losing-importance-amid-omicron-101641341373903.html
05-01-2022||World||New Covid records in US, UK, France as Omicron runs rampant||The US, Britain, France and Australia have all announced record numbers of daily Covid-19 cases as the WHO warned Tuesday that Omicron's dizzying spread increased the risk of newer, more dangerous variants emerging.Britain breached 200,000 cases for the first time on Tuesday, Australia posted almost 50,000 and France registered more than 270,000, all three countries easily topping their previous records.But dwarfing even those numbers was the 1,080,211 reported by the United States on Monday, a global record.The country's Monday figures are usually higher due to delays in weekend tallying -- and were likely inflated further after a three-day New Year's holiday weekend.The rolling average over seven days -- which experts see as more reliable -- was 486,000 cases per day as of Monday evening, Johns Hopkins University said.The heavily mutated Omicron variant, the most transmissible to date, accounted for around 59 percent of US cases near the end of last year.Omicron's rates of deaths and hospitalisations have been lower across the world, raising hopes the virus could be evolving into a relatively benign seasonal illness.But the World Health Organization in Europe sounded an ominous note of caution on Tuesday, warning the soaring infection rates could have the opposite effect."The more Omicron spreads, the more it transmits and the more it replicates, the more likely it is to throw out a new variant," WHO senior emergencies officer Catherine Smallwood told AFP in an interview."Now, Omicron is lethal, it can cause death... maybe a little bit less than Delta, but who's to say what the next variant might throw out," she added."Even in well-capacitated, sophisticated health systems there are real struggles that are happening at the moment."'War footing'Such a scenario was feared in Britain, where the government said Tuesday that hospitals have switched to "war footing" due to staff shortages.After the UK hit a record 218,724 cases in 24-hours, Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised action to plug staffing gaps in the worst-hit areas, including drafting medical volunteers backed by army support.Johnson also defended his decision not to increase restrictions over Christmas in England -- unlike in other parts of the UK -- and ruled out another nationwide lockdown.Australia, which had previously successfully suppressed infections for much of the pandemic, also smashed its previous caseload record with 47,738.The surging infections have driven a rush on increasingly scarce self-administered rapid antigen kits and created hours-long queues at centres providing more reliable PCR tests."I think at this point we all know somebody who has either got Covid or we have got coworkers off work because they are quarantining or isolating," Australia's deputy chief medical officer Sonya Bennett said.Cyprus also posted a new record of 5,457 cases on Tuesady and now has the highest infection rate per capita, according to AFP figures.Wealthy nations have rushed to give their population third booster shots to counteract the rising cases, while many in poorer nations have not yet been able to receive a first.Ahead of the pack, Israel began rolling out fourth doses last week. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said Tuesday that a small Israeli study indicated that fourth coronavirus vaccinations increased antibodies "fivefold".More restrictionsIn China, which has pursued a "zero Covid" approach, just three asymptomatic cases prompted 1.2 million people in the central city of Yuzhou to be confined to their homes.Daily infections have hit a two-month high in the Philippines, which will expand restrictions in Manila from Wednesday to include more than 11 million people living near the capital.Omicron is also fuelling surging cases in India, where authorities said the capital will lock down over the weekend.The sprawling megacity's new restrictions came the same day as its chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, announced he had been infected and was suffering "mild symptoms".Also testing positive on Tuesday were Sweden's king and queen, as well as Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Ghazouani, none suffering serious symptoms.Omicron has also sent the sports world -- only just back on its feet after previous Covid restrictions -- reeling, with many leagues forced to cancel or postpone games.Tennis world number Novak Djokovic -- who has repeatedly refused to confirm whether he has been vaccinated -- said Tuesday that he was heading to the Australian Open after being granted a medical exemption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-covid-records-in-us-uk-france-as-omicron-runs-rampant-101641340888983.html
