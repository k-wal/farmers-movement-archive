You are also aware that currently restrictions are in place on movement and gatherings in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. As the situation normalises, we expect that this time can be utilised to hold discussions under the bilateral Protocol," Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said."It is our hope to facilitate early exchange of visits to all shrines of interest to pilgrims," Arindam Bagchi said in New Delhi.Dr. Ramesh Kumar Vankwani, the Patron-in-chief of Pakistan Hindu Council and lawmaker of Prime Minister Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf party, later on Friday issued a statement saying the trip was delayed.“The visit has been delayed as India needs time to make arrangements due to Covid-19 situation but it has not been cancelled,” he said, urging people to get registered for the trip, amidst a chill in bilateral ties between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir issue and cross-border terrorism.Vankwani had on Monday announced to lead a delegation of Pakistani pilgrims to India on January 29. But it turned out that the announcement was made by him without approval by India.Vankwani in a video message on Wednesday said that a group of 170 pilgrims, who were ready to go to India by a special flight of Pakistan International Airline (PIA), were waiting for approval by New Delhi.He also, through a letter, asked India to urgently issue visas to his delegation of pilgrims.Reacting to Vankwani's initiative, Pakistan's Foreign Office spokesperson Asim Iftikhar Ahmad told the media that the reported trip to India was an initiative by Pakistan Hindu Council to promote faith tourism.He said that at the start of the new year there was a large group of pilgrims from India that visited the Teri Mandir and other religious shrines in Pakistan.“We understand there is a desire on part of the Pakistan Hindu Council to continue with this initiative. We are supportive of the idea and we understand the Indian side has a positive view as well. This obviously needs to be done with agreement and mutual understanding,” he said.Nearly 200 Hindu pilgrims from India visited the 100-year-old renovated Maharaja Paramhans Ji mandir in Teri village, Karak district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on January 1 amidst tight security, one year after the temple was demolished by a mob belonging to a radical Islamist party.Earlier, Vankwani had said that his idea of faith tourism enjoys the support of the governments of both Pakistan and India and the religious tourism had already begun on January 1 when a delegation came from India.He had planned to take the pilgrims on January 29 for a three-day trip on a chartered PIA flight to visit Ajmer Sharif, Jaipur, Agra, New Delhi and Haridwar and then fly back on February 1.He said that a delegation of 170 devotees from India would travel to Pakistan on February 20, followed by another delegation from India on March 1.He also said that the faith tourism initiative has the potential to deepen bilateral relations and in days to come, it will expand from religious tourism to trade and travel and finally work as a big bridge to improve ties between the two countries.The bilateral relations between India and Pakistan have been affected badly over the Kashmir issue and India's decision to withdraw the special powers of Jammu and Kashmir and the bifurcation of the state into two Union Territories in August 2019. Pakistan's support to cross-border terror attacks in India also led to a chill in bilateral ties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/visit-of-pakistani-pilgrims-to-india-delayed-due-to-covid-19-restrictions-101643446787967.html
29-01-2022||World||Covid-19: India hails Canada’s move to ease travel restrictions||India has appreciated the decision by the Canadian government to remove the India-specific Covid-19 testing restrictions that were in place since September last year.India’s high commissioner to Ottawa Ajay Bisaria said, “This is a welcome step towards restoring normal mobility and also ending a regime that discriminated against travellers from India.”Canada updated its travel advisory for India on Thursday by removing the requirements for travellers to get a negative RT-PCR results for a test taken within 18 hours of departure of a flight, from a single laboratory operated by the company Genestrings at Delhi airport. That was applicable to direct flights being operated between the two countries.Canada also required that passengers from India taking a connecting flight take the test in the third country which was the port of departure for a Canadian destination.Both these requirements have been dropped. These amended measures went into force on Friday as Transport Canada announced they were dropping the “modified pre-departure test requirements” for travellers from India on direct or indirect flights. A release from the department said, “All travellers entering Canada are now subject to the same pre-entry test requirements, regardless of their departure country.”India’s high commission had been working with Canadian authorities for normalisation of air travel for the past few months, particularly after Ottawa imposed a ban on all direct flights in April in the wake of the Delta-driven pandemic surge in India. That prohibition was lifted in September but replaced with the onerous testing regime, which only applied to one other country, Morocco.Canada continues to “require that all travellers, unless specifically exempted, have a valid negative pre-departure Covid-19 molecular test result taken no more than 72 hours before a scheduled flight to Canada”.Passengers need to provide proof of being fully vaccinated and, on arrival in Canada, some may be subject to a random Covid-19 test.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-india-hails-canada-s-move-to-ease-travel-restrictions-101643439486666.html

The MIQ is an important step implemented by the New Zealand government to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).It is meant for people who are coming back to New Zealand from abroad, to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in the country.The journalist Charlotte Bellis was reporting on Afghanistan for Al Jazeera. Bellis wrote an open letter in New Zealand Herald in which the reporter said that she discovered she was pregnant in September while in Qatar, where Al Jazeera’s headquarters are. She quit her job in November seeking to return to her home country to give birth to her child. But that's where the problems began, the former reporter said.A post shared by Charlotte Bellis (@charlottebellis)Bellis said that she had to go to her partner’s country Belgium as it is illegal to be unmarried and pregnant in Qatar. She said she kept trying to get to New Zealand but couldn’t succeed in getting an MIQ spot through New Zealand’s lottery system.Bellis said she could not overstay in Belgium since she was not a resident and had nowhere else to go but Afghanistan. So, she organised a meeting with senior Taliban contacts and told them about her situation. The Taliban told her she and her partner will be safe in Afghanistan."No we're happy for you, you can come and you won't have a problem. Just tell people you're married and if it escalates, call us. Don't worry. Everything will be fine," the Taliban told her through a translator, Bellis said in her article.She had gained fame after asking the Taliban, when they seized power in Afghanistan in August last year, what they will do to protect women's rights.The journalist said despite her numerous attempts, and the doctors telling her that it is unsafe to give birth in Afghanistan, her application for an MIQ sport was rejected on January 24. Among the reasons given were that the couple's travel dates were more than 14 days away and she did not provide evidence she had scheduled medical treatment in New Zealand."I thought about sending them a story I did in October at a maternity hospital in Kabul where they had no power so were delivering by cell phones at night. They couldn't do caesarean deliveries and the only medicine they had were tabs of paracetamol wrapped in crinkled newspaper," Bellis said in her open letter, describing her ordeal and the situation in Afghanistan.She further said that New Zealand’s Covid-19 minister Chris Hipkins got involved, after which her application’s status in MIQ website changed to “under review” from “rejected”.Bellis then questioned the entire process and claimed they were getting a preferential treatment “because of who we are and the resources we have”."The decision of who should get an emergency MIQ spot is not made on a level playing field, lacks ethical reasoning and pits our most vulnerable against each other," she said in the article.The New Zealand Herald also published a statement from Hipkins, where he said that a senior National Party MP contacted him after which he asked officials to check Bellis' case. "The rejection of her application appeared at first sight to warrant further explanation," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pregnant-kiwi-reporter-forced-to-ask-taliban-for-refuge-slams-miq-system-101643436504172.html

The USS Carl Vinson along with USS Abraham Lincoln and two landing ships are involved in freedom of navigation operations with the motive of deterring Chinese PLA from attacking Taiwan by taking advantage of US-Russia crisis over Ukraine.Several analysts with so-called think tanks were quoted in the propaganda media as saying that the F-35C accident exposed the exhaustion of the US military, which has been flaunting its prowess against China at the cost of the physical and mental health of its troops and high technical risks. While the pilot of the crashed F-35C was recovered safely, the US Navy is involved in salvaging operation of the stealth fighter lest the Chinese reach there first and copy the latest war fighting technology.While the Chinese media may pass caustic comments on US aircraft carrier operations, fact is that fighter accidents onboard aircraft carriers are part and parcel of flight operations. The cold facts are that US Navy has been operating aircraft carriers for 100 years with some 70-odd carriers serving the nation and another three under construction. Maritime aviation is the most complex part of war fighting with the fighter pilot having only 500 feet of flight deck to land and take off from the aircraft carrier. Apart from handling the aircraft, the pilot must factor in the pitch and roll of the megaship apart from blustery winds, rain, and darkness. The US Navy has not only operated these floating islands for ages but has used them successfully to wage war and project power all over the world.The Chinese military and propaganda media have often passed judgements on Indian military prowess without realising that India has been operating aircraft carriers since 1961 and has an amazing record of maritime aviation including 1971 blockading of Karachi harbour. Many an armchair analysts have argued that carrier-based aviation is prohibitively expensive and outdated due to existence of long distance ballistic missiles. They recommend that shore-based fighters could do the same job as the carrier with mid-air refueling option giving the much-needed operational range. However, the Indian Navy found that the shore-based fighter pilots of the Indian Air Force found themselves disoriented on high seas without land in sight and used as a reference point. The Indian Navy’s sole aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya is currently under maintenance with the new aircraft carrier INS Vikrant expected to be launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 75th year of Indian Independence.While India has already decommissioned two of its aircraft carriers, the PLA Navy carrier operation is still to be born. Its first refitted aircraft carrier Liaoning was declared combat ready only in 2016 with first fighter landing only in 2012. Not much is known about its second aircraft carrier Shandong’s fighter operational capability. The construction of third Chinese aircraft carrier Type 003 only began in February 2017 at Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai. While the Chinese have successfully copied the Russian Su-33 carrier-based aircraft to stand its own J-15 line, the naval aviation cannot be copied, and the only option is training the fighter pilots on high seas and pitch-black darkness. Fact is that Chinese naval aviation has at least a decade to go before it starts to acquire long sea legs.Even though China has deployed long range ballistic missiles on its eastern seaboard to deter US carriers, the flat-top vessels have remarkable survival capabilities with the strike group defended by nuclear powered submarines with intercontinental range ballistic missiles and destroyers armed with long range cruise missiles. Since the carrier is constantly on the move, it is not only difficult to target the vessel and at the same time exposing the fixed missile sites to a lethal counter. The world may be threatened by an aggressive PLA and ever growing war making arsenal of China, but one must remember that the Communist China has only fought a border skirmish with India in 1962 and was taken to task by miniscule Vietnam in 1979. Projecting power on turbulent seas far way from home is a different ball game.

The gambler lost £3.9 million in a 72-hour card game at private members’ club Aspinalls.Malaysian tycoon Han Joeh Lim said that the club breached its responsibilities under the 2005 Gambling Act, the Daily Mail reported.The 62-year-old has a wealth of £40 million and business interests in property, steel and computer chip manufacturing. He also own properties in London.Lim joined the club in 2014, reported Daily Mail and was allowed to cash cheques worth £600,000.He claimed that after losing the sanctioned amount, the club increased his credit to £1.9 million and provided an additional £2 million in credit, which was also lost by the businessman.The incident happened in 2015, when Lim played card game baccarat.The club had initially filed a case against the Malaysian businessman for not paying the amount which he had lost. Aspinalls won the case in 2019, with the judge also imposing a penalty of £100,000 on Lim for breaching four court orders.Now, the tycoon is claiming £3.9 million using a provision in the 2005 act, which he states that “vulnerable people should be protected from being harmed or exploited by gambling”.“Aspinalls took advantage of the claimant's distressed attempts to claw back the losses by allowing further funds and more time to gamble,” he said in the petition.Aspinalls has refused to comment on the matter as it is pending before the court, but its counsels told Daily Mail that the company is seeking that the claim be “struck out”.The club was started by John Aspinall, a zoo owner who moved to gambling in the 1960s. The Aspinall private club was started in 1962.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/businessman-who-lost-nearly-4-million-sues-club-for-not-stopping-him-101643427454732.html
29-01-2022||World||Blogger claims Pakistan behind attempted contract killing||An exiled political blogger on Friday accused Pakistan of being behind a plot to kill him after a would-be hitman was convicted in a British court.Supermarket worker Muhammed Gohir Khan, 31, was found guilty of plotting to kill Ahmad Waqass Goraya after being recruited by middlemen apparently based in Pakistan.The judge in Kingston-upon-Thames, southwest London, adjourned the case for sentencing on March 11, with Khan facing up to life in prison.Khan, from east London, was charged in June last year with conspiring with unknown other people to murder Goraya in the Netherlands.He was arrested after returning to the UK by train.Goraya, an outspoken blogger and liberal activist who has lived outside Pakistan for more than a decade, did not attend the hearings.He said after the verdict that he was "happy that there is at least a new precedent: 'if you come after someone in exile, you will be prosecuted'."He said he was disappointed, however, that the trial did not identify those who commissioned the crime."I hope the real people who sent these guys will be prosecuted one day as well," he told AFP.Pointing to the amount of money involved and the plotters' knowledge of his secret location, he said: "I am sure it is the Pakistani state."Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said the verdict "could serve as a landmark judgement" and was a "rare step towards establishing criminal accountability for transnational crimes against journalists".Rebecca Vincent, RSF's UK bureau director, said: "We call on the relevant authorities to continue their investigations, to identify the middleman and anyone else involved in this horrific plot and ensure full criminal justice is carried out."- 'Enthusiastic' -Prosecutor Alison Morgan said Goraya, who lives with his wife and two children in the Netherlands, appeared to have been targeted for speaking out against the Pakistani government and military in satirical social media posts.Khan was hired by "others who appeared to be based in Pakistan", she told the jury.In 2018, the court was told Goraya had received information from the FBI that he was on a "kill list" and believed some of the threats he received were being led and orchestrated by ISI, Pakistan's intelligence agency.The jury heard that Khan was contacted by a Pakistan-based middleman known as Mudz, who promised a £100,000 ($137,000, 120,000 euros) fee for the "job", of which he would take a £20,000 cut.He also promised riches in "Jannah" or paradise.Khan received several thousand pounds for expenses from a Pakistani bank account, promising: "Bro, I'll make it happen."At the time he had debts amounting to more than £200,000, the court was told.British police liaised with the Dutch authorities to build up a dossier of his encrypted communications with middlemen on WhatsApp and Signal and security camera footage of his movements.After travelling to the Netherlands on Eurostar Khan spent days watching Goraya's home in Rotterdam and bought a professional chef's knife.He returned to Britain after realising the blogger was away.Khan pleaded not guilty at his trial and acknowledged sending the messages and travelling to Rotterdam.But he claimed he was only seeking money and never intended to commit the killing."He was enthusiastic about carrying out the killing to earn the money and to carry out further attacks in the future," Morgan said.Goraya has previously reported violent attacks and threats made against him.In 2017 he said he was held in captivity for weeks in Pakistan along with four other activists and tortured.The Pakistani military denied any involvement.Goraya told AFP on Friday that he and his family had to move immediately after being informed of a threat to his life."You have to change everything, start your life again. You are totally surrounded by strangers, for security," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blogger-claims-pakistan-behind-attempted-contract-killing-101643426101270.html

It plans to send upto 13,000 satellites in space - a ‘megaconstellation’ - that will encircle the Earth in the lower orbit, a report in the Daily Mail said.The company that has got the responsibility of this work has said that the main goal of the mission is to establish supremacy in lower Earth orbit, the report further said.Strengthening of 5G network is the aim: ChinaChina's State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND) has called for orderly development of small satellites, according to the Daily Mail report.It said that the group of satellites will be able to provide surveillance over much of the Earth and strengthen internet facilities.Though the details about what the network will cover and how it will work are vague, the aim is to fill gaps in terrestrial communication, especially in rural areas, to strengthen its 5G network services, the report further said.Similar to SpaceX StarlinkAccording to China’s plan, the 12,992 satellites will orbit in low earth orbit like the satellites of SpaceX-Starlink company - in a ‘megaconstellation’. Their range will be between 498.89 kilometres to 1144.24 kilometres above the surface of the Earth.Some firms have been given the contract to begin the development work in Chongqing, the Daily Mail report claimed.A ‘megaconstellation’ is a network of thousands of satellites which cover the length and breadth of the Earth to deliver internet services. The SpaceX Starlink is currently the most developed, with nearly 2,000 satellites in operation.The satellite internet constellation is a top priority for the Chinese government.What are the concerns?The plan is not a new one. China first applied to the International Telecommunication Union for spectrum allocation for two low Earth orbit satellite constellations back in 2020. But now, after the reports that China has already given the contract, the western governments are concerned.The United States and its allies believe that this is a plan by the Communist government in China to spy on them.The relations between the two sides are frayed, thanks to China’s saber-rattling on the issue of Taiwan and its alleged cover-up of the emergence of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.Not the first timeChina has been monitoring every movement on Earth from space. For this, it has already launched two Earth observation satellites called Gaofen. China claims that these satellites monitor marine disasters, the maritime environment and water conservation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-plans-megaconstellation-of-13-000-satellites-claims-report-101643421318766.html
29-01-2022||World||Russian invasion of Ukraine would be 'horrific': Pentagon||The Pentagon said Friday that the destruction and human cost of a full-scale incursion by Russian forces into Ukraine would be "horrific," but that there was still time for diplomacy to avoid a war."If that was unleashed on Ukraine, it would be significant, very significant, and it would result in a significant amount of casualties," Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley said."And you can imagine what that might look like in dense urban areas, along roads and so on and so forth. It would be horrific, it will be terrible."Speaking alongside Milley, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said conflict in Ukraine could still be avoided, despite Russian President Vladimir Putin amassing more than 100,000 troops along their shared border."Conflict is not inevitable. There is still time and space for diplomacy," said Austin."Mr. Putin can do the right thing as well," he added. "There is no reason that this situation has to devolve into conflict. He can choose to de-escalate. He can order his troops away," he said.The remarks of the US military's two top officials, who had been quiet in recent days over the rise in tensions in Eastern Europe, came as there was no sign of a breakthrough in diplomatic efforts to avoid open conflict.They said Russia continues to add to its forces pointed at Ukraine, with a range of offensive units and capabilities including armor, air power, naval power, missiles, and cyber and political operations.While the Pentagon officials said they do not believe Putin has made a decision to go to war, they said his options have expanded, from provocations that could lead to an attack in the restive southeast Donbass region, to an attempt to overrun the entire country, attacking urban centers like the capital Kyiv."If war were to break out on a scale and scope that is possible, the civilian population will suffer immensely," Milley said.Russia itself will suffer, he added."If Russia chooses to invade Ukraine it will not be cost-free, in terms of casualties or other significant effects."Austin and Milley stressed that Washington has no intention of sending US troops to Ukraine to defend it, but will continue to support the Ukraine military with arms and other materials.However, they stressed, the United States was prepared to send troops to reinforce and protect NATO allies in eastern Europe that faced a potential threat from a Russian attack on Ukraine, which is not part of the Atlantic alliance."An attack on one NATO ally is an attack against all," Milley warned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-invasion-of-ukraine-would-be-horrific-pentagon-101643416398576.html
29-01-2022||World||Russia loses a million people in historic population fall||Russia's population declined by more than one million people in 2021, the statistics agency Rosstat reported Friday, a historic drop not seen since the collapse of the Soviet Union.Ongoing demographic woes have been exacerbated by the pandemic with Rosstat figures showing more than 660,000 had died with coronavirus since health officials recorded the first case in the country.The new figures continue a downward trend from the previous year when Russia's population fell by more than half a million.The Covid-related fatalities figures published monthly by Rosstat are far higher than death figures released by a separate government website, which is dedicated to tracking the pandemic in the country.Those government website figures only take into account fatalities where the virus was established as the primary cause of death after an autopsy and shows just 329,443 total fatalities.The discrepancy has fed into criticism that the Russian government has been downplaying the severity of the pandemic in one of the worst-hit countries by cases in the world.Russia has struggled to curb the pandemic due to a slow vaccination drive coupled with limited restrictive measures and rampant non-compliance with mask-wearing in public places.The pandemic death toll exacerbates the demographic crisis, linked to low birth rates and a short life expectancy, that Russia has faced for the past 30 years.Birth rates have been falling because the generation now becoming parents were born in the 1990s, when the birth rate plunged due to economic uncertainties after the collapse of the Soviet Union.The number of births per woman stands at around 1.5, well short of the minimum of 2.1 necessary to renew the population.Economic concernsRussia's shrinking population has been at the top of President Vladimir Putin's domestic agenda since he came to power over two decades ago.In addresses to the nation, Putin frequently encourages Russians to have more children and live a healthier lifestyle to improve life expectancy.The government has introduced a number of financial incentives for parents with more than one child, such as cash bonuses and favourable mortgage rates.During his annual press conference last December, Putin stressed that 146 million people are not enough for the country from a "geopolitical standpoint" and leave labour shortages.He added that it is important to show that it is a "joy to have children" and that there is "no greater happiness in life and in the world"."The demographic crisis is definitely a failure of the state's policies," said Sergei Zakharov, a demography expert at the Higher School of Economics based in Moscow.He told AFP that measures to increase the birth rate encourage families to have children earlier but do not change how many children they want in total.He said the government's influence on birth rates is "limited" and shifting births to an earlier period will result in a "demographic gap" in the future.For Stepan Goncharov of the independent Levada Centre pollster, the low birth rate is connected to widespread "uncertainty about the future".Living standards in Russia have continuously deteriorated since 2014, with the economy strained by repeated Western sanctions, dependence on the oil and gas sector and widespread corruption."People haven't stopped buying and their income and savings have reduced," Goncharov said.According to last year's survey by recruitment website SuperJob, 43 percent of Russians do not have any savings."People are not setting money aside and are not planning the future of the family," Goncharov added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-loses-a-million-people-in-historic-population-fall-101643414828502.html
