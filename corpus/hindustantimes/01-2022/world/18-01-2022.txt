18-01-2022||World||Endemic Covid would not mean end of danger: WHO||The World Health Organization on Tuesday warned against the notion that the Covid-19 pandemic becoming endemic would mean the disease was no longer dangerous."People talk about pandemic versus endemic," the WHO's emergencies director Michael Ryan told a virtual session of the World Economic Forum."Endemic malaria kills hundreds of thousands of people; endemic HIV; endemic violence in our inner cities."Endemic in itself does not mean good -- endemic just means it's here forever," Ryan told the Davos Agenda roundtable on vaccine equity.The rapidly-spreading Omicron variant of Covid-19 is much more contagious than previous strains but seems to cause less serious disease for vaccinated people.That has triggered a debate on the virus passing from being a pandemic to becoming endemic -- with the implication that the danger will have passed."What we need to do is get to low levels of disease incidence with maximum vaccination of our populations, so nobody has to die," said Ryan."That's the end of the emergency, in my view. That's the end of the pandemic."Ryan added that it was possible to end the waves of death and hospitalisations by the end of 2022 through vaccine-led public health measures.But, he added: "We won't end the virus this year. We may never end the virus. Pandemic viruses end up becoming part of the ecosystem."What we can do is end is the public health emergency."With the exception of the one-shot Janssen product, all the Covid-19 vaccines given emergency approval by the WHO require two injections.Ryan raised the prospect of three to four doses at some point being considered the full course of vaccination for enduring protection against severe Covid disease."As knowledge develops, and as we see the way the immune system matures and responds to either re-exposure or to an extra dose of vaccine, we may end up in a future where the primary course of vaccination for a vulnerable person might be three or four doses," he said."They won't be called boosters. It will be seen that you need three to four doses to develop that long-lasting, robust immunity that protects you from hospitalisation and death over a prolonged period."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/endemic-covid-would-not-mean-end-of-danger-who-101642525486569.html
18-01-2022||World||Omicron, Delta pose dual threat to Beijing||The Chinese capital Beijing on Tuesday reported two more Covid-19 cases of both the Omicron and Delta variants, taking the total to three, as the government said city officials must “operate under the state of emergency” during the three weeks remaining before the Winter Olympic Games begin.Health authorities have urged citizens not to order goods from overseas after the first case of Omicron infection in Beijing was linked to an international parcel from Canada.That patient has passed the virus to at least two close contacts.Separately, a person in a different part of the capital tested positive for the Delta variant, city spokesperson Xu Hejian said at a briefing on Tuesday.In the face of the twin challenges of preventing the coronavirus from entering the country and stemming its domestic resurgence, government bodies of all levels in Beijing must operate under the “state of emergency and beef up measures to curb the spread of Covid-19 in the capital during Beijing 2022”, Xu said earlier.Following the three cases, several Chinese schools in Beijing - a city of nearly 22 million people - were ordered shut ahead of their Lunar New Year holidays while most international schools will move online from WednesdayHealth authorities said parcels from abroad could be potentially contaminated with the virus, a new warning issued days ahead of the Winter Olympics scheduled to begin from February 4 in Beijing and neighbouring Hebei province.Residents are being urged to wear masks and gloves when opening parcels from abroad.The US’ Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said last year that the relative risk of coronavirus infections through contact with contaminated surfaces or objects is considered low.Samples taken from the package and some documents inside the mail and handled by the first patient tested positive for the virus.Beijing health authorities said the findings mean they cannot rule out the possibility of the person getting infected through overseas parcels.“Virologists warned of the high risk of packages from overseas causing domestic Covid-19 flare-ups, when the epidemic overseas is running high, as contaminated packages from epidemic-rampant countries may spread the virus to people with weak immunity through viral particles floating in the air, or people without proper protective gear,” the state-run Global Times reported.The report added that a patient from Shenzhen in southern China, confirmed to be infected with Omicron on Sunday, is likely to have contracted it after being exposed to contaminated goods from overseas.The Chinese mainland on Monday reported 127 new locally transmitted Covid-19 cases, the NHC said in its daily report on Tuesday.Of the new local cases, 102 were reported in Henan, 18 in Tianjin, five in Guangdong, and one each in Beijing and Shaanxi, the commission said.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases on the mainland had reached 105,258 by Monday while the death toll stood 4,636.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-delta-pose-dual-threat-to-beijing-101642522191993.html

We used to use four sacks of flour a day, now we only use one and a half."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/desperate-afghans-queue-for-free-bread-as-poverty-crisis-deepens-101642521553731.html

Russia has angrily denied the charge.Blinken’s “travel and consultations are part of the diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the tension caused by Russia’s military build-up and continued aggression against Ukraine,” the State Department said in a statement.From Kyiv, Blinken will travel to Berlin, where he will meet with his German, British and French counterparts to discuss a possible response to any Russian military action. Russia has massed some 100,000 troops with tanks and other heavy weapons on its own soil near the Ukrainian border in what many observers believe may be preparation for an invasion.Blinken will meet with Zelenskyy and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Wednesday “to reinforce the United States’ commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” the State Department said.“The trip follows extensive diplomacy with our European Allies and partners about a united approach to address the threat Russia poses to Ukraine and our joint efforts to encourage it to choose diplomacy and de-escalation in the interests of security and stability,” the department said.On Monday, Russia’s top diplomat rejected the US allegations that it was preparing a pretext to invade Ukraine. Speaking to reporters, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed the US claim as “total disinformation.”Lavrov reaffirmed that Russia expects a written response this week from the US and its allies to Moscow’s request for binding guarantees that NATO will not embrace Ukraine or any other ex-Soviet nations or station its forces and weapons there.Washington and its allies firmly rejected Moscow’s demands during last week's Russia-US negotiations in Geneva and a related NATO-Russia meeting in Brussels.The White House said Friday that US intelligence officials had concluded that Russia had already deployed operatives to rebel-controlled eastern Ukraine to carry out acts of sabotage there and blame them on Ukraine to create a pretext for possible invasion.Ahead of Blinken's visit to Kyiv, a delegation of US senators was visiting Ukraine to emphasize congressional support for the country.“Our bipartisan congressional delegation sends a clear message to the global community: the United States stands in unwavering support of our Ukrainian partners to defend their sovereignty and in the face of persistent Russian aggression,” Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, said in a statement.Speaking Monday on a visit to Kyiv, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock warned that “any further escalation would carry a high price for the Russian regime — economic, political and strategic," and she emphasized the need to continue negotiations.“We are prepared to have a serious dialogue with Russia, because diplomacy is the only way to defuse this highly dangerous situation at the moment,” she said.Russia seized the Crimean Peninsula after the ouster of Ukraine’s Moscow-friendly leader and in 2014 also threw its weight behind a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine. More than 14,000 people have been killed in nearly eight years of fighting between the Russia-backed rebels and Ukrainian forces in the country’s industrial heartland called Donbas.Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that Moscow will take unspecified “military-technical measures” if the West stonewalls its demands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antony-blinken-to-visit-ukraine-as-us-russia-tensions-escalate-101642510011417.html

The auction house plans to accept cryptocurrency as a possible payment as well.Sophie Stevens, a jewelry specialist at Sotheby's Dubai, told The Associated Press that the number five bears an importance significance to the diamond, which has 55 facets as well.“The shape of the diamond is based on the Middle-Eastern palm symbol of the Khamsa, which stands for strength and it stands for protection,” she said. Khamsa in Arabic means five.“So there's a nice theme of the number five running throughout the diamond," she added.Stevens also said the black diamond is likely from outer space.“With the carbonado diamonds, we believe that they were formed through extraterrestrial origins, with meteorites colliding with the Earth and either forming chemical vapor disposition or indeed coming from the meteorites themselves,” she said.Black diamonds, also known as carbonado, are extremely rare, and are found naturally only in Brazil and Central Africa.The cosmic origin theory is based on their carbon isotopes and high hydrogen content.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/extremely-rare-555-55-carat-black-diamond-the-enigma-to-be-auctioned-101642509469680.html

He has repeatedly attacked his former boss since resigning in November 2020.Johnson's former chief adviser wrote that the party was arranged by the prime minister's principal private secretary, who was told by two senior officials to cancel it and would have checked this with Johnson.Cummings said he himself warned the prime minister over the party, saying Downing Street was becoming a "madhouse", but Johnson "waved it aside"."The events of 20 May alone, never mind the string of other events, mean the PM lied to Parliament about parties," said Cummings."The suggestion that the PM was warned (about the party) is not true," deputy prime minister Dominic Raab insisted to BBC Radio 4, after a presenter said Cummings "threw a grenade in the direction of his former boss".Raab told Sky News that "the prime minister has been very clear that's not true, accurate".Johnson is facing calls to stand down from several senior MPs over allegations of illegal parties during national lockdown measures.Downing Street has apologised to Queen Elizabeth II after it emerged that his staff held leaving parties during a period of national mourning for her husband, Prince Philip, in April 2021.The Times wrote Tuesday that Johnson has "sustained immense damage" from the revelations.Cummings said in his blog that a May 15, 2020 gathering in the Downing Street garden that he himself is pictured attending along with Johnson and his now-wife Carrie, was not a party, however.He said staff were encouraged to hold meetings outside at the time and while there was wine at the table, they were discussing work issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-pm-boris-johnson-lied-about-lockdown-party-ex-aide-claims-101642498731918.html

UAE to allow only those who have taken booster shots||Facing a nationwide surge in coronavirus cases fueled by the spread of the highly transmissible omicron variant, Abu Dhabi is requiring people entering the city to show proof of booster shots.The government's health app said earlier this week that people entering the capital of the United Arab Emirates must show a “green pass," confirming their vaccination status. The app says that visitors are no longer considered fully vaccinated unless they have received a booster at least six months after their second dose.Those wishing to enter Abu Dhabi also must have have tested negative for the virus within the last two weeks to maintain their “green” status.The emirate has taken a stricter approach to the virus than neighboring Dubai, the freewheeling tourism-dependent hub. Abu Dhabi requires that residents show their green pass before entering public places or government buildings.The UAE boasts among the world's highest vaccination rates per capita. The country has fully vaccinated more than 90% of its population, health authorities have said. Although infections had plummeted in December, cases recently have skyrocketed to heights unseen in months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/flying-to-abu-dhabi-uae-to-allow-only-those-who-have-taken-booster-shots-101642495614576.html
18-01-2022||World||Explained: Scientists struggle to monitor Tonga volcano after massive eruption||Scientists are struggling to monitor an active volcano that erupted off the South Pacific island of Tonga at the weekend, after the explosion destroyed its sea-level crater and drowned its mass, obscuring it from satellites.The eruption of Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha'apai volcano, which sits on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, sent tsunami waves across the Pacific Ocean and was heard some 2,300 kms (1,430 miles) away in New Zealand."The concern at the moment is how little information we have and that's scary," said Janine Krippner, a New Zealand-based volcanologist with the Smithsonian Global Volcanism Program."When the vent is below water, nothing can tell us what will happen next."Krippner said on-site instruments were likely destroyed in the eruption and the volcanology community was pooling together the best available data and expertise to review the explosion and predict anticipated future activity.Saturday's eruption was so powerful that space satellites captured not only huge clouds of ash but also an atmospheric shockwave that radiated out from the volcano at close to the speed of sound.Photographs and videos showed grey ash clouds billowing over the South Pacific and metre-high waves surging onto the coast of Tonga.There are no official reports of injuries or deaths in Tonga yet but internet and telephone communications are extremely limited and outlying coastal areas remain cut off.'India felt shockwaves too,' reveals IMD: Why Tonga’s volcanic eruption was a big event | ExplainedExperts said the volcano, which last erupted in 2014, had been puffing away for about a month before rising magma, superheated to around 1,000 degrees Celsius, met with 20-degree seawater on Saturday, causing an instantaneous and massive explosion.The unusual "astounding" speed and force of the eruption indicated a greater force at play than simply magma meeting water, scientists said.As the superheated magma rose quickly and met the cool seawater, so did a huge volume of volcanic gases, intensifying the explosion, said Raymond Cas, a professor of volcanology at Australia's Monash University.Some volcanologists are likening the eruption to the 1991 Pinatubo eruption in the Philippines, the second-largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century, which killed around 800 people.The Tonga Geological Services agency, which was monitoring the volcano, was unreachable on Monday. Most communications to Tonga have been cut after the main undersea communications cable lost power.LIGHTNING STRIKESAmerican meteorologist, Chris Vagasky, studied lightning around the volcano and found it increasing to about 30,000 strikes in the days leading up to the eruption. On the day of the eruption, he detected 400,000 lightning events in just three hours, which comes down to 100 lightning events per second.That compared with 8,000 strikes per hour during the Anak Krakatau eruption in 2018, caused part of the crater to collapse into the Sunda Strait and send a tsunami crashing into western Java, which killed hundreds of people.Cas said it is difficult to predict follow-up activity and that the volcano's vents could continue to release gases and other material for weeks or months."It wouldn't be unusual to get a few more eruptions, though maybe not as big as Saturday," he said. "Once the volcano is de-gassed, it will settle down."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-scientists-struggle-to-monitor-tonga-volcano-after-massive-eruption-101642494315228.html
18-01-2022||World||China suspects Covid-19 might arrive in overseas mail||China is urging people to wear masks and gloves when opening mail, especially from abroad, after authorities suggested the first case of the Omicron coronavirus virus variant found in Beijing could have arrived via a package from Canada.Authorities vowed to step up disinfection of overseas mail and are insisting postal staff handling it are fully vaccinated.The precautions come less than three weeks before the capital opens the Winter Olympic Games and as several cities work to stamp out new outbreaks of coronavirus infections."Minimize purchases of overseas goods or receiving mail from abroad," state broadcaster CCTV said late on Monday in a social media post."Be sure to protect yourself during face-to-face handovers and wear masks and gloves; try to open the package outdoors."Health officials said the person found infected with the Omicron variant opened a package from Canada that had been routed through the United States and Hong Kong and transmission via the package "could not be ruled out".The case highlighted the importance of "personal defence", CCTV said.Similar suggestions on how to handle parcels, not just those from overseas, were made by the National Health Commission on its official WeChat account and reposted by authorities in the cities of Shanghai and Nanjing.China has been an outlier in asserting that Covid-19 can be transmitted via cold-chain imports such as frozen meat and fish, even though the World Health Organization has played down the risk, and has been pushing a narrative via state media that the virus existed abroad before it was discovered in late 2019 in the central city of Wuhan.In recent weeks, China has been battling a resurgence in cases in several cities, some of them of the highly transmissible Omicron variant. On Tuesday, it reported 127 new local cases with confirmed symptoms.The State Post Bureau issued a notice on Monday stating that international mail must be disinfected after reaching China, and staffers who process and deliver international mail must have received Covid-19 vaccinations and a booster.China Post has also been reminding recipients of overseas mail to disinfect the contents "in a timely manner" with stickers pasted on parcels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-suspects-covid-19-might-arrive-in-overseas-mail-101642492848270.html
18-01-2022||World||Big blow to BBC as UK govt freezes network's funding for two years||The UK government on Monday announced a freeze of the BBC licence fee, arguing a new funding model was needed to ease cost of living pressures and reflect a transformed media landscape.Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries told parliament the £159 ($217, 190 euros) annual fee, paid by every television set owner in the country, would be fixed for the next two years.After that it will rise in line with inflation for four years, she said, saying the rising annual cost of the compulsory charge was hurting cash-strapped families.The long-term future of the corporation should not depend on a system which criminalises non-payers, she added.But opposition parties linked the move to efforts to keep Prime Minister Boris Johnson in a job, by offering "red meat" to BBC critics, due to anger at lockdown-breaking parties at Downing Street.Labour media spokeswoman Lucy Powell said monthly payments for the licence fee were small change compared to proposed Tory annual tax increases and soaring energy bills totalling thousands of pounds."Is the licence fee really at the heart of the cost of living crisis or is this really about their long-term vendetta against the BBC?" she asked"It's at the heart of Operation Red Meat to stop the prime minister becoming dead meat," she added, referring to a proposed government fight-back plan of populist measures to boost Johnson's standing.The BBC has come under increasing criticism from right-wingers since Britain's divisive Brexit referendum in 2016 for alleged political bias, and pushing a "woke", London-centric liberal agenda.But the public service broadcaster, which this year marks its 100th anniversary and has editorial independence from government, has faced similar accusations from the political left.Critics accused Johnson loyalist Dorries, who leaked details of the plan on Twitter on Sunday night after a torrid week for the prime minister, of "cultural vandalism", wrecking a world-renowned British institution.The licence fee funds television, radio and online services, including its popular iPlayer on-demand platform, as well as programming, many of which are exported commercially worldwide.Dorries said discussions about the future of the funding model from 2028 will start "shortly" but change was needed because of evolving media consumption and technological advances."This is 2022, not 1922. We need a BBC that is ready to take the challenges of modern broadcasting, a BBC that will continue to engage the British public and that commands support from across the breadth of the UK, not just the London bubble, a BBC that can thrive alongside Netflix and Amazon Prime and all of its other challenges which attract younger viewers."BBC chairman Richard Sharp and director-general Tim Davie said they were disappointed at the move, warning it would hit British cultural industries and "necessitate tougher choices which will impact licence fee payers".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/big-blow-to-bbc-as-uk-govt-freezes-network-s-funding-for-two-years-101642492383806.html
18-01-2022||World||Omicron scare: Do not order items from abroad, China warns citizens||Chinese health authorities have urged citizens not to order items from overseas after the first case of Omicron infection in Beijing, and a secondary case related to the first, were linked to a parcel from Canada.Health authorities said parcels from abroad could be potentially contaminated with the virus, a new warning issued days ahead of the Winter Olympics scheduled to begin from February 4 in Beijing and neighbouring Hebei province.Residents are being urged to wear masks and gloves when opening parcels from abroad.The person hadn’t left Beijing two weeks before testing positive last week but occasionally handled international mail at work, the Beijing Municipal Health Commission said.Samples taken from the package and some documents inside the mail and handled by the first patient tested positive for the virus.Genetic sequencing shows the variant detected in the patient is different from Omicron-infected patients elsewhere in China but bears “high similarity” to infected travellers from North America and Singapore.Beijing health authorities said the findings mean they cannot rule out the possibility of the person getting infected through overseas parcels.On Tuesday, Beijing reported another new locally-transmitted Covid-19 case for Monday; the second case is confirmed to be a close contact of the first Omicron case in Beijing, the national health commission (NHC) said.The new patient was under medical observation in quarantine on Saturday and tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday.“Virologists warned of the high risk of packages from overseas causing domestic Covid-19 flare-ups, when the epidemic overseas is running high, as contaminated packages from epidemic-rampant countries may spread the virus to people with weak immunity through viral particles floating in the air, or people without proper protective gear,” the state-run Global Times reported.The report added that a patient from Shenzhen in southern China, confirmed to be infected with Omicron on Sunday, is likely to have contracted it after being exposed to contaminated goods from overseas.The Chinese mainland on Monday reported 127 new locally transmitted Covid-19 cases, the NHC said in its daily report on Tuesday.Of the new local cases, 102 were reported in Henan, 18 in Tianjin, five in Guangdong, and one each in Beijing and Shaanxi, the commission said.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases on the mainland had reached 105,258 by Monday since the pandemic began while the death toll stood 4,636.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-scare-do-not-order-items-from-abroad-china-warns-citizens-101642492364878.html
18-01-2022||World||One in 10 Covid-19 patients may still infect after quarantine period: Study||One in ten people may still be infectious for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, after the 10 day quarantine period, according to a study.The research, published recently in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases, used a newly adapted test which can detect whether the virus was potentially still active.The test was applied to samples from 176 people in Exeter, UK, who had tested positive on standard PCR tests.The team led by researchers at the University of Exeter found that 13 per cent of people still exhibited clinically-relevant levels of virus after 10 days, meaning they could potentially still be infectious.Some people retained these levels for up to 68 days, the researchers found.They believe this new test should be applied in settings where people are vulnerable, to stop the spread of COVID-19."While this is a relatively small study, our results suggest that potentially active virus may sometimes persist beyond a 10 day period, and could pose a potential risk of onward transmission," said Professor Lorna Harries, of the University of Exeter Medical School, who oversaw the study."Furthermore, there was nothing clinically remarkable about these people, which means we wouldn't be able to predict who they are," Harries said.Conventional PCR tests work by testing for the presence of viral fragments.While these tests can tell if someone has recently had the virus, they cannot detect whether it is still active, and the person is infectious.However, the test used in the latest study gives a positive result only when the virus is active and potentially capable of onward transmission."In some settings, such as people returning to care homes after illness, people continuing to be infectious after ten days could pose a serious public health risk," said study lead author Merlin Davies, of the University of Exeter Medical School."We may need to ensure people in those setting have a negative active virus test to ensure people are no longer infectious," Davies added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-in-10-covid-19-patients-may-still-infect-after-quarantine-period-study-101642489440760.html

Canada Post has addressed the matter in its section on the coronavirus, saying, “The World Health Organization (WHO) and Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) have made public assurances that the risk when handling mail, including international mail, is low”.“In general, because of poor survivability of coronaviruses on surfaces, there is a low risk of spread from products or packaging shipped over a period of days or weeks. Currently, there is no evidence of Covid-19 being transmitted by imported goods or packages,” it noted.The leader of the opposition in Canada Erin O’Toole described the Chinese version as “comical”.The case was detected in a young resident of Beijing who received a parcel from Canada that reached her on January 10, three days after it was posted, and travelled there via the United States and Hong Kong.China has adopted a zero Covid policy as it prepares to host the Winter Olympics in Beijing and an outbreak could disrupt its plans, especially due to high transmissibility of the Omicron variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/health-authorities-dismiss-canada-link-to-1st-omicron-case-in-beijing-101642485768393.html
18-01-2022||World||North Korean missile tests signal return to brinkmanship||Grappling with pandemic difficulties and U.S.-led sanctions over his nuclear ambitions, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un could be reviving his 2017 playbook of nuclear and missile brinkmanship to wrest concessions from Washington and his neighbors.North Korea’s short-range missile launches on Monday were its fourth round of missile tests this month and signaled a refusal to be ignored by the Biden administration, which has focused more on confronting bigger adversaries such as China and Russia.The tests could also reflect a growing urgency in its need for outside relief after its economy decayed further under the severe sanctions and two years of pandemic border closures, experts say.The two missiles launched Monday near the capital, Pyongyang, followed a resumption of railroad freight traffic with China that had been suspended over pandemic concerns, in what is likely an attempt to revive the desperate economy.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said Monday that trade between Dandong in China and Sinuiju in North Korea will be maintained while pandemic controls stay in place.While North Korea is likely to continue showcasing its weapons in the coming weeks, it could keep things relatively quiet before the opening of the February Winter Olympics in China, its main ally and economic lifeline, launching known short-range missiles rather than more provocative systems.But it could dramatically raise the ante once the Beijing Games end. Du Hyeogn Cha, an analyst at Seoul’s Asan Institute for Policy Studies, said Kim could resume testing nuclear explosives and intercontinental ballistic missiles.Kim suspended nuclear and ICBM tests in 2018 while engaging in talks with former U.S. President Donald Trump. But the diplomacy remains derailed since their second summit in 2019, when the Americans rejected North Korea’s demand for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities.North Korea in recent months has ramped up tests of short-range missiles designed to defeat missile defenses in the region.Its leaders may think it needs to stage more provocative tests to move the needle with the Biden administration, which has offered open-ended talks but has shown no willingness to ease sanctions unless Kim takes real steps to abandon his nuclear weapons program.It’s unclear whether nuclear or ICBM tests would extract a compromise from Washington, which is more likely to respond with further sanctions and military pressure, possibly including a resumption of major military drills with South Korea, Cha said.Nam Sung-wook, a North Korea expert at Seoul’s Korea University, said a nuclear test is more likely than an ICBM test because it would send a greater level of shock. The North may use that test to claim it has acquired an ability to produce a nuclear warhead small enough to fit on its purported hypersonic missile, which it first tested in September.Nam said North Korea would time the test to maximize its political effect, with South Korean presidential elections scheduled in March and President Joe Biden facing crucial midterm elections in November. North Korea conducted its sixth and last test of a nuclear explosive device in September 2017.“In Pyongyang’s mind, there is no other way to grab Washington’s attention than a major provocation,” Nam said.North Korea strengthened efforts to expand its weapons capabilities following Kim’s 2021 announcement of a new five-year plan to develop his military forces, with an ambitious wish list that included hypersonic missiles, solid-fuel ICBMs, spy satellites and submarine-launched nuclear missiles.However, the frequency of tests since then exceeds usual technological timelines and apparently reflects Kim’s desire to break out of the country’s current deepening economic problems and international isolation — what appears to be the toughest period of his decade-long rule.“Externally, North Korea is trying to make a statement that it will continue to go its own way regardless of sanctions. Internally, the leadership is trying to tell its people that the supreme leader’s promises will be realized no matter what, whether they be weapons development or overcoming sanctions through a self-reliant economy,” Cha said.“But they are proceeding with the tests at a very fast pace, and this reveals a sense of alarm within Pyongyang’s leadership, that they must get something done with the United States in 2022 or there could be trouble.”According to South Korean estimates, North Korea’s trade with China shrank by about 80% in 2020 before plunging again by two-thirds in the first nine months of 2021. The contraction in 2020 was the biggest since 1997 as grain production dropped to the lowest level since Kim took power in 2011.Describing its anti-coronavirus campaign as a matter of “national existence,” North Korea has severely restricted cross-border traffic and trade for the past two years and is even believed to have ordered troops to shoot on sight any trespassers who cross its borders.Experts say a major COVID-19 outbreak would have devastating consequences because of North Korea’s poor health care system, and could even trigger instability.Its resumption of the train route with China indicates how hard it has become for its leadership to withstand the economic strain caused by border closures, said Park Won Gon, a professor of North Korea studies at Seoul’s Ewha Womans University.For decades, North Korea has mastered the art of brinkmanship, manufacturing diplomatic crises with weapons tests and threats before offering negotiations aimed at extracting concessions. Kim sped up the process in 2017 with a highly provocative run of nuclear and ICBM tests while exchanging threats of nuclear annihilation with Trump before beginning their diplomacy in 2018.North Korea began 2022 with what it claimed were two successful tests of a hypersonic missile, which Kim said would significantly enhance his “war deterrent.” After the Biden administration imposed new sanctions over those launches, North Korea vowed stronger and more explicit action and fired two missiles from a train on Friday.State media photos of Monday’s launch suggest the North tested a weapon that looks similar in appearance with the U.S. MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System. The missiles, which North Korea first tested in 2019, are part of the country's expanding short-range weaponry designed to be maneuverable and fly at low altitudes, which potentially improves their chances of evading missile defense systems in South Korea and Japan.Park said North Korea’s push to develop and mass-produce such missiles is a key part of its efforts to cement its status as a nuclear power. Its pressure campaign is not only aimed at winning economic benefits but also to negotiate with Washington from a position of power and convert the nuclear diplomacy into talks for mutual arms reduction, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korean-missile-tests-signal-return-to-brinkmanship-101642480122284.html
18-01-2022||World||Imran Khan batted for Afia Siddiqui in his PTI manifesto so did Pak Senate||The involvement of a Pakistani-origin UK national Malik Faisal Akram in the siege at a synagogue in the US state of Texas shows the deep-seated religious radicalisation within Pakistan and UK among Muslim community. If Akram was the spearhead, the Pakistan government has been instrumental in radicalising their own towards pan-Islamic jihadi causes since President Zia-ul-Haq days.The siege at the Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville was led by Akram, who demanded the release of convicted Pakistani neuroscientist Afia Siddiqui, suspected of ties with Al Qaeda and currently serving an 86-year sentence in the Fort Worth prison after being convicted in 2010 of trying to kill US military officers while in custody in Afghanistan.In the past, the Pakistani government too has tried to free ‘Lady al Qaeda’ - as she is known in the counterterrorism circles. A few years ago, when Barack Obama was the President of the United States, the Pakistan officials had sent a proposal to release the woman in exchange of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl.In 2018, the Pakistani Senate unanimously passed a resolution to take up the matter of Siddiqui’s release with the US, referring to her as the “daughter of the nation”.Imran Khan, who is now the Prime Minister of Pakistan, competed with other Islamist political parties and jihadist groups to spearhead the campaign to free Siddiqui.The manifesto of Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) grouped Siddiqui among the Overseas Pakistanis and said their “patriotic spirit” is valued by the party.“Overseas Pakistanis are one of our biggest assets, who have consistently been denied access to their citizens' rights and to the opportunity to contribute to Pakistan's economy due to inefficient and incomplete processes along with poor quality infrastructure and services by previous governments. We will ensure voting rights for overseas Pakistanis,” the PTI manifesto said.“We will provide consular and legal services to all Pakistanis jailed abroad. We make best efforts to bring prisoners like Dr. Afia Siddiqui and others back to Pakistan,” it further said.Even the Taliban, which now rules Afghanistan, had shown their keen interest in Siddiqui’s release in exchange of Warren Weinstein, an American aid worker who was kidnapped by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011. Weinstein was killed in a US drone strike after being captive for four years.Siddiqui comes from a well-educated Pakistan family with strong religious convictions. She graduated from the prestigious Massachusetts Information of Technology (MIT), and also received a doctorate degree in neurology from Brandeis University.According to US intelligence officials, she appeared to be radicalised after the 9/11 attacks. She was connected to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks and believed to be acting as Al Qaeda’s courier to facilitate the shipping process of ammunition and weapons for a planned attack.US officials say she disappeared in 2003 and re-appeared in 2008 in Afghanistan with the detailed information about American targets.The family of 44-year-old Malik Faisal Akram, the latest to demand Siddiqui’s release, belongs to Jhelum district in Punjab and emigrated to the UK nearly 50 years ago. Malik was a member of Tabligh Jamaat and had travelled abroad earlier on work related to it, according to intelligence officials. He was married to a Gujrati Muslim lady and has five sons and a daughter.His father is a known member of Muslim community in London and the family has political links through Malik Irfan, a Councillor linked to Labor Party, the officials further said.Before carrying out the attack on the synagogue in Texas, he posted a Facebook Live video where Akram talked about his plans.US President Joe Biden called the hostage-taking an "act of terror", with the UK condemning the attack soon after.

"Despite the challenges, they are not unique to the rest of the world," he said.Amid rising hospitalisations, Victoria on Tuesday declared a "code brown" in hospitals, typically reserved for shorter-term emergencies, that would give hospitals the power to cancel non-urgent health services and cancel staff leave.Authorities have said unvaccinated younger people form a "significant number" of the country's hospital admissions.Even as states look to avoid lockdowns and keep businesses open, Australian consumer confidence took a battering last week, an ANZ survey out on Tuesday showed, as the Omicron surge triggered self-imposed lockdowns and stifled spending.Omicron has also dented Prime Minister Scott Morrison's approval ratings, according to a widely watched poll on Tuesday, putting opposition Labor into a leading position months out from a federal election.Just over 67,000 new infections were reported in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania, down from a national high of 150,000 last Thursday. Other states are due to report later.Australia has reported about 1.6 million infections since the pandemic began, of which around 1.3 million were in the last two weeks. Total deaths stood at 2,757. (Reporting by Renju Jose; editing by Richard Pullin)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-with-74-fatalities-australia-suffers-deadliest-day-of-covid-pandemic-101642470307073.html

But its approach has come under pressure in recent weeks. On Monday there were 223 more cases reported, including another 80 in the virus-hit port city of Tianjin, and nine more - including cases of the highly transmissible Omicron variant - in the southern manufacturing hub of Guangdong.Another 68 cases were reported across central Henan province, where partial lockdowns and mass testing have been rolled out for millions of residents.Zhuhai, the mainland city bordering the gambling hub of Macau, has told residents to avoid leaving the city after detecting a handful of Omicron cases and started testing the whole city from Monday.China on Monday cancelled plans to sell tickets to the public for the Winter Olympics in Beijing, allowing only invitees to view the action as part of strict virus control measures.Pakistani health authorities on Monday announced the completion of a successful clinical trial of Chinese traditional herbal medicine for treating Covid-19. The Chinese medicine, Jinhua Qinggan Granules manufactured by Juxiechang (Beijing) pharmaceutical, is already being used in treatment of Covid-19 patients in China.Top US general tests +veUS joint chiefs chairman General Mark Milley tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday and is experiencing very minor symptoms while isolating and working remotely, a spokesman said on Monday.US Covid adviser Anthony Fauci said it’s too soon to know whether the rapid spread of the Omicron variant will hasten the end of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-virus-cases-at-highest-level-in-nearly-two-years-101642467043791.html

The asteroid 7482, also known as 1994 PC1, is about 1.6 km wide and has been categorised by US space agency Nasa as a “potentially hazardous object” due to its relative proximity to the Earth while shooting past.Nasa identifies asteroids as potentially hazardous if the asteroids are more than about 140 meters in size with orbits that bring them as close as within 4.6 million miles of Earth’s orbit around the Sun. It is also a Near-Earth Object since it is closer than 1.3au astronomical units, little over the distance between the Earth and the Sun. One au is the equivalent of 93 million miles.While an asteroid of such size can cause huge damage on Earth, Nasa assured that 1994 PC1 will safely fly past the planet 1.2 million miles away. Near-Earth #asteroid 1994 PC1 (~1 km wide) is very well known and has been studied for decades by our #PlanetaryDefense experts. Rest assured, 1994 PC1 will safely fly past our planet 1.2 million miles away next Tues., Jan. 18.Track it yourself here: https://t.co/JMAPWiirZh pic.twitter.com/35pgUb1anqThe closest approach of the potentially dangerous asteroid to Earth will occur at 4.51pm EST on January 18 (3.21am IST on January 19). It will be the closest for this asteroid for at least the next 200 years for which astronomers have calculated its orbit, according to EarthSky.The most recent asteroid to hit the planet was eight years ago in Russia which exploded in the atmosphere.Nasa recently launched a mission to deliberately smash a spacecraft into an asteroid as a test run to stop a giant space rock from wiping out life on Earth. The spacecraft is expected to hit the asteroid in the fall of 2022, when the binary asteroid system of Dimorphos and Didymos is 11 million kilometres from Earth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/asteroid-twice-the-size-of-burj-khalifa-fly-past-earth-on-january-18-101642465214654.html
18-01-2022||World||4th vaccine dose provides limited defence against Omicron, shows Israel study||An Israeli hospital on Monday said preliminary research indicates a fourth dose of the coronavirus vaccine provides only limited defense against the omicron variant that is raging around the world.Sheba Hospital last month began administering a fourth vaccine to more than 270 medical workers — 154 who received a Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine and 120 others who received Moderna's. All had previously been vaccinated three times with the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine.The clinical trial found that both groups showed increases in antibodies “slightly higher” than following the third vaccine last year. But it said the increased antibodies did not prevent the spread of omicron.“Despite increased antibody levels, the fourth vaccine only offers a partial defense against the virus,” said Dr. Gili Regev-Yochay, director of the hospital's infection disease unit. “The vaccines, which were more effective against previous variants, offer less protection versus omicron."The preliminary results raised questions about Israel's decision to offer a second booster shot — and fourth overall — to its over-60 population. The government says over 500,000 people have received the second booster in recent weeks.Dr. Nahman Ash, director of Israel's Health Ministry, said the research did not mean the fourth vaccine effort was a mistake. “It returns the level of antibodies to what it was at the beginning of the third booster. That has great importance, especially among the older population,” he told Channel 13 TV.But he said the research would be taken into account as authorities debate whether to expand the additional booster campaign to the broader population.Israel was one of the first countries last year to widely vaccinate its population and last summer became the first to offer a booster shot. The latest booster campaign for older Israelis also is believed to be the first of its kind in the world.Israel's aggressive vaccination efforts have not been able to stop an omicron outbreak in recent weeks. The variant has caused record-setting infection levels and sent a growing number of people to the hospital, though the numbers of seriously ill remain below previous waves.It has also forced large numbers of Israelis into quarantine, straining schools and businesses.Omicron is already dominant in many countries and can also infect those who have been vaccinated or had previously been infected by prior versions of the virus. Early studies, however, show it is less likely to cause severe illness than the previous delta variant. Vaccination and a booster still offer strong protection from serious illness, hospitalization and death.On Tuesday, the Israeli government said it was shortening the mandatory quarantine period from seven days to five days in order to help keep the economy running."This decision will enable us to continue safeguarding public health on the one hand and to keep the economy going at this time on the other, even though it is difficult, so that we can get through this wave safely,” said Prime Minister Naftali Bennett.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/4th-vaccine-dose-provides-limited-defence-against-omicron-shows-israel-study-101642463092019.html
18-01-2022||World||US airlines warn of 'calamity' if 5G deployed near airports||The chief executives of America's largest airlines warned of a "catastrophic disruption" to travel and shipping operations if telecommunication firms roll out their 5G technology as planned Wednesday without limiting the technology near US airports.Verizon and AT&T have already twice delayed the launch of their new C-Band 5G service, due to warnings from airlines and aircraft manufacturers concerned that the new system might interfere with the devices planes use to measure altitude."We are writing with urgency to request that 5G be implemented everywhere in the country except within the approximate two miles of airport runways as defined by the FAA on January 19, 2022," the CEOs said in a Monday letter obtained by AFP.The executives, writing to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and other US government officials, highlighted the risk of "economic calamity" should Verizon and AT&T proceed with deploying the new technology before the necessary upgrades and changes have been made to aviation equipment."To be blunt, the nation's commerce will grind to a halt," they said.The Federal Aviation Administration said Sunday it had approved some transponders to be safely operated within areas where 5G will be deployed, clearing "as many as 48 of the 88 airports most directly affected by 5G C-Band interference."But the airlines are worried that remaining limitations at those airports, as well as a large amount of equipment still uncertified, could trigger a crisis including the grounding of thousands of flights.In addition to the transport secretary, their letter was addressed to the head of the FAA, the head of the Federal Communications Commission and the White House's National Economic Council.US airlines also have protested against the potential costs incurred.The executives called on authorities to "take whatever action necessary to ensure that 5G is deployed except when towers are too close to airport runways until the FAA can determine how that can be safely accomplished without catastrophic disruption."The letter was signed by CEOs of major airlines including American, United, Delta and Southwest, as well as the leaders of shipping giants FedEx and UPS."Immediate intervention is needed to avoid significant operational disruption to air passengers, shippers, supply chain and delivery of needed medical supplies," they wrote."In addition to the chaos caused domestically," the letter continues, the lack of certified planes "could potentially strand tens of thousands of Americans overseas."Verizon and AT&T won contracts worth tens of billions of dollars last February to operate 5G in the 3.7-3.98 GHz frequency bands, and the rollout of the service was due to begin on December 5.Unless the major telecommunications companies are blocked by federal regulators or reach an agreement with the airlines, they are now scheduled to turn on their 5G service nationwide on January 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-airlines-warn-of-calamity-if-5g-deployed-near-airports-101642462671046.html
18-01-2022||World||Boris Johnson’s ex-aide accuses him of lying to UK Parliament||Boris Johnson’s former top aide Dominic Cummings accused the premier of lying to Parliament, saying he would “swear under oath” that the premier both was aware of and allowed a drinks party at Downing Street at the height of lockdown during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.It’s the latest tirade by Cummings against his former boss since he was forced from his position 14 months ago. His Jan. 7 post about a Downing Street party on May 20, 2020 attended by Johnson forced the prime minister to apologize in the House of Commons and left him fighting to save his career.Now Cummings is again upping the ante, by saying Johnson misled lawmakers.In his statement last week, Johnson said he thought he was attending a “work” gathering and that he only stayed for 25 minutes. His office has also repeatedly said the prime minister was not aware of the event beforehand, and did not receive the widely reported “bring your own booze” email invitation from his principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds. After several newspapers reported over the weekend Johnson had been urged not to let party go ahead, his spokesman Max Blain reiterated it was “not accurate” to suggest he knew about the May 20 event. “It’s untrue to say that the prime minister was told or warned ahead of that,” he said.Yet hours later, Cummings wrote on his blog that Johnson not only knew about the party but agreed with Reynolds it should go ahead after “at least two” people raised concerns. “Not only me but other eyewitnesses who discussed this at the time would swear under oath this is what happened.”“The events of 20 May alone, never mind the string of other events, mean the PM lied to Parliament about parties,” Cummings said.The charge is especially sensitive because many Tory MPs have said they are waiting for the result of a government probe into the party -- as well as other allegations of pandemic rule-breaking in Downing Street -- before deciding whether Johnson has misled them and whether they still back his leadership.Rules banning social gatherings were still in place in May 2020 as the U.K., which suffered one of the world’s biggest death tolls from coronavirus, battled to contain the first wave of the pandemic. Johnson’s administration has been dogged by reports of other parties that broke regulations. In December, the prime minister told the House of Commons he had been “furious” to see a clip of Downing Street aides joking about a Christmas party during the second lockdown -- but said he had been “repeatedly assured” there was “no party and no Covid rules were broken.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-s-ex-aide-accuses-him-of-lying-to-uk-parliament-101642462650956.html

Government sources put the death toll from Monday at three.Huge crowds have regularly taken to the streets demanding a return to civilian rule since the military coup on Oct. 25 ended a power-sharing arrangement agreed after Islamist autocrat Omar al-Bashir fell during a popular uprising in 2019.Medics say at least 70 people have died in clashes with security forces since the coup.A security and defence committee formed under the ruling council commended security services on Monday for their "restraint" and protection of civilians, paying tribute to a police officer killed in protests on Thursday.It said in a statement that it would establish an anti-terrorism force to counter "potential threats", but did not elaborate. State Department spokesman Ned Price said on Twitter the United States is "concerned by reports of escalating violence against protesters in Sudan."He noted Assistant Secretary of State Molly Phee and new Special Envoy David Satterfield "are headed to Khartoum and will reiterate our call for security forces to end violence and respect freedom of expression and peaceful assembly."On Monday, protesters had gathered some two km (1.25 mile) from the palace, blocking a main road in the Al Diyum neighbourhood and burning tires before starting their march.Civilian political parties announced two days of civil disobedience in protest against Monday's violence. Resistance committees organising protests in Khartoum and in its twin city of Omdurman across the Nile called on people to blockade local streets.Last week the United Nations began consultations to try to break a deadlock between military leaders and pro-democracy civilian groups and avert the risk of further instability.After the coup military leaders reinstated Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok in an attempt to safeguard economic reforms, but he resigned earlier this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seven-killed-in-crackdown-on-rallies-in-sudan-s-capital-report-101642452945735.html

"The UAE reserves the right to respond to these terrorist attacks and criminal escalation."National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in a statement said "The United States strongly condemns today’s terrorist attack in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, which killed three innocent civilians. The Houthis have claimed responsibility for this attack, and we will work with the UAE and international partners to hold them accountable."The Houthi group said that missiles and drones carried out the strike.The UAE, a member of the Saudi-led coalition, has armed and trained local Yemeni forces that recently joined fighting against the Houthis in Yemen's energy-producing Shabwa and Marib regions."With (nuclear) negotiators running out of time, the risk of a deterioration in the region's security climate is rising," said Torbjorn Soltvedt, principal MENA analyst at risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft.The Houthi movement has frequently launched cross-border missile and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia, but has claimed few such attacks on the UAE, mostly denied by Emirati authorities.Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said the group launched five ballistic missiles and "a large number" of drones at Dubai and Abu Dhabi airports, an oil refinery in Musaffah and several "sensitive and important" sites in the UAE. Abu Dhabi police said three people were killed and six wounded when three fuel tanker trucks exploded in the industrial Musaffah area near storage facilities of oil firm ADNOC. State media said those killed were two Indians and a Pakistani.Abu Dhabi police said initial investigations found parts of small planes that could possibly be drones at the sites in Musaffah and Abu Dhabi airport, but they made no mention of missiles.ADNOC said an incident at its Mussafah Fuel Depot at 10 a.m. local time had resulted in a fire. Police closed the road leading to the area, where unverified footage on social media had shown thick black smoke."ADNOC is deeply saddened to confirm that three colleagues have died. A further six colleagues were injured and received immediate specialist medical care," it said.An Etihad Airways spokesperson said a small number of flights were briefly disrupted at Abu Dhabi airport due to "precautionary measures", but normal operations quickly resumed.The Houthi military spokesman warned the group could target "more important" facilities in the UAE next.PROXY FIGHTUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned Monday's attack and called "upon all parties to exercise maximum restraint and prevent any escalation amid heightened tensions in the region," his spokesperson said.Riyadh and Abu Dhabi had moved to engage directly with Iran in recent months to avoid any wider conflict that could hurt regional economic ambitions. The Yemen war is widely seen as a proxy war between Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and Shi'ite Iran.The Houthi strike could derail UAE and wider Gulf dialogue with Iran, said UAE political analyst Abdulkhaleq Abdulla."The UAE is not going to take this very lightly," he said.The attack coincided with a visit to the UAE by South Korean President Moon Jae-in. A Blue House official said a summit between Moon and Abu Dhabi's crown prince was cancelled.Given the range of Houthi attacks against Saudi Arabia it was not "technically surprising" the group would be able to hit UAE targets, said Jean-Loup Samaan, senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore's Middle East Institute.Other Gulf Arab states condemned the attack.

The intelligence has succeeded to do so to a certain extent because they are using different methods as a threat, force, and pressures," Khaama Press quoted the statement.The Home of Freedom of Speech has claimed that the Taliban go to the newsrooms of media and tell the journalists to cover stories in their favor as they live under their rule, Khaama Press reported.It further stated that most of the prominent journalists have left jobs because they did not want to be used for propaganda for the Taliban.The Home of Freedom of Speech has asked the IEA to stop censoring media and putting pressure on Afghan journalists and also asked international media advocates so that the lives of journalists are protected and the gain of past two decades are preserved.The Taliban took over control of Kabul on August 15 and following this the country has been battered by deepening economic, humanitarian and security crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/media-journalists-lost-independence-after-taliban-takeover-last-yr-report-101642481053820.html
