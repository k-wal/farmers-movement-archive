23-01-2022||World||Who is Yevhen Murayev, named by Britain as Kremlin's pick to lead Ukraine?||Britain has accused the Kremlin of wanting to install a pro-Russian leader in Ukraine, and said Russian intelligence officers had been in contact with former Ukrainian politicians as part of plans for a military offensive.Britain's foreign ministry said Russia was considering the Ukrainian politician Yevhen Murayev to lead a new government, in comments that Russia has denied. Murayev also poured cold water on the claim in comments to the Observer newspaper.Who is Yevhen Murayev?Born in the eastern city of Kharkiv near the Russian border in 1976, Murayev is part of a group of politicians in opposition to the pro-Western leadership that took power after the 2014 Maidan street protests.He began his political career in Kharkiv as an ally of the former President Viktor Yanukovich, who fled to Russia after the Maidan uprising.In 2014-2019, Murayev was a lawmaker. He started in the Opposition Bloc faction, a party formed from fragments of the Moscow-backed Yanukovich's Party of Regions. But in June 2016 he distanced himself from Opposition Bloc and founded his own party For Life, with a similar ideology.In 2018, he launched another party called Nashi. Murayev registered as a presidential candidate in the 2019 elections but withdrew his candidacy before the vote.What are Murayev's political views?Murayev has promoted views that closely align with Russian narratives on Ukraine. He considered the Maidan protests a Western-backed coup d'etat.Last year, he referred to the war in Ukraine's eastern Donbass region as an internal conflict between the government and rebels, counter to Ukraine and the West's view that the conflict is between Ukraine and Russian-backed proxies.In 2021, he said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was controlled by the West and suggested, as Russia has, that Ukraine might try to regain territory held by Russian-backed separatists by force. Kyiv denies any such plan."Zelenskiy is a hostage and he is being blackmailed by MI6, the CIA, anyone. Tomorrow they can force him to launch an offensive against the Donbass, which will lead to a full-scale war," he said.Drawing Russia into an escalation "will mean the death of thousands of Ukrainians on one side and the other of the line of demarcation."How much influence does Murayev have?Murayev is less prominent than Viktor Medvedchuk, a pro-Moscow businessman and lawmaker who says Russian President Vladimir Putin is godfather to his daughter and who was thrown under house arrest last year in a treason case.Murayev nevertheless holds sway through his TV channel, called Nash, which began broadcasting in November 2018 and is officially owned by his father, Volodymyr.According to a poll by the Razumkov Centre think tank in December 2021, Murayev ranked seventh with 6.3% support among prospective candidates in the next presidential election in 2024. Another poll by the Rating group put him in fifth place.In 2017 he filed an asset declaration, a mandatory requirement as a lawmaker. He declared cash assets of $2 million, 1 million euros ($1.13 million), and 13 million hryvnias ($460,971).What do Murayev and the others say about Britain's allegations?Murayev rubbished Britain's claim, telling the Observer newspaper that the accusation "isn't very logical". He promised more comments in a Facebook post, accompanied by a photoshopped image of him mocked up as James Bond.In a later post, he called for an end to dividing Ukraine into pro-Western and pro-Russian politicians and said the country needed new leaders.Russia dismissed Britain's accusation as "disinformation". Ukraine's government had no immediate comment.Volodymyr Fesenko, a Ukrainian political analyst, found Murayev an odd candidate."Murayev, for all his pro-Russianness, is not a figure who is very close to the Kremlin, especially compared to Medvedchuk," Fesenko wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-is-yevhen-murayev-named-by-britain-as-kremlin-s-pick-to-lead-ukraine-101642946431718.html

But it is not a Pakistan-specific issue, Imran Khan said. "There are two phases of inflation. When we came into government, we had to deal with a massive current account deficit due to this, the prices of imports soared drastically. That was at that time and now the inflation is global because of Corona," Imran Khan said during his live air programme 'Aap ka Wazir-e-Azam, Aap key Saath'. Imran Khan said the United Kingdom has been facing 30-year record inflation because of the pandemic.Watch video “The biggest challenge we face today is inflation & rising prices of commodities. I am well aware and cognisant of the issues being faced by the common man due to rising prices.” - Prime Minister @ImranKhanPTI #آپکا_وزیراعظم_آپکے_ساتھ pic.twitter.com/Y7qDjMA3v2Answering other questions, Imran Khan said he sees Shehbaz Sharif as the nation's criminal. "I get called out for not meeting Shehbaz as he is the leader of the opposition. But I see him as the nation's criminal," he said.Talking about Nawaz Sharif, Imran Khan said he is waiting for him to come to Pakistan. "They say he will come from London today, tomorrow. I pray he comes back. He will not come because he loves money and does not want to lose it by coming back to Pakistan. These are the people whose time is over," Imran Khan said."Some people are playing polo there, riding Rolls Royce. Even royal families don't spend so much money. Why will they come to Pakistan?" Imran Khan said. "They are in London since 2017 and we came to power in 2018," the PM said.Imran Khan's comments come a day after federal minister for planning, development and special initiatives Asad Umar said Imran Khan sent Nawaz Sharif to London. "PM Imran Khan conducted a meeting which held discussions on whether or not to allow Nawaz Sharif to travel abroad," the minister said adding that Imran Khan took the decision to let him go, Geo News reported.Maryam Nawaz Sharif reacted to Imran Khan's on-air speech and tweeted, "Imran Khan sounds like a person who is not only defeated but has also accepted his defeat. Four years into the govt and he is still only whining.""Every word that Imran Khan has uttered today reeks of failure, dashed hopes and no faith in his or PTI's future. This was inevitable, man," Maryam added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-says-he-stays-awake-at-night-worrying-about-price-rise-101642945270223.html
23-01-2022||World||UK MP says she was sacked from govt over 'Muslimness'||British minister Nadhim Zahawi on Sunday urged a probe into claims by a fellow Conservative MP that she lost her ministerial role because of her 'Muslimness', piling further pressure on the government.Nusrat Ghani, 49, was sacked as a transport minister in 2020, and told the Sunday Times that a whip said her "Muslimness was raised as an issue" at a meeting in Downing Street.She was also told her "Muslim woman minister status was making colleagues feel uncomfortable", she claimed.Chief whip Mark Spencer, whose role it is to keep MPs on board with the government's agenda, took the unusual step of identifying himself as the person at the centre of the claims, and denied the allegations."These accusations are completely false and I consider them to be defamatory," he wrote on Twitter."I have never used those words attributed to me. It is disappointing that when this issue was raised before Ms Ghani declined to refer the matter to the Conservative Party for a formal investigation," he added.The government whips are in the spotlight at the moment after they were accused by Tory MP William Wragg of "blackmailing" critics of under-fire Prime Minister Boris Johnson in order to prevent them from trying to oust him.Ghani, vice-chairwoman of the influential 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, told the paper that "it was like being punched in the stomach. I felt humiliated and powerless."She said she remained quiet for fear of being "ostracised by colleagues".Vaccine minister Zahawi demanded an investigation."There is no place for Islamophobia or any form of racism in our @Conservatives party," he tweeted, calling Ghani a "friend, a colleague & a brilliant parliamentarian.""This has to be investigated properly & racism rooted out."Justice minister Dominic Raab called it a "very serious claim" but told BBC's "Sunday Morning" that there would only likely be an investigation if Ghani made a formal complaint, which she has so far not done.Former equality and human rights commissioner Swaran Singh carried out an inquiry into claims of Islamophobia in the Conservative Party two years ago.He analysed 727 separate incidents as recorded between 2015 and 2020 and found no evidence of "institutional Islamophobia", but criticised senior Tory figures including now prime minister Johnson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-mp-says-she-was-sacked-from-govt-over-muslimness-101642933704146.html

23-01-2022||World||Canada: Three-decade high inflation hits Justin Trudeau’s popularity||Just four months after his Liberal Party returned to power in Canada after mid-term elections in September, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s popularity is taking a battering due to high levels of inflation.The government’s data agency, Statistics Canada has reported that the consumer price index for December was at 4.8%, the highest point it has reached in three decades.That has led to what is being described an “inflation anxiety”. Justin Trudeau’s opponents have used the hashtag #JustinFlation to good effect on social media.As a result, for the first time since he formed another minority government in September, after precipitating snap polls, Trudeau’s Liberals are trailing the principal opposition Conservatives in tracking polls. As per numbers released by Nanos Research, the ruling party has 28.2% support marginally behind the Conservatives who have 28.5%.A majority of Canadians, 57%, “say that it is currently difficult to feed their household”, according to a new poll from the non-profit, non-partisan polling agency Angus Reid Institute (ARI). In contrast, the number stood at 36% in 2019. More of the respondents, 29%, believed their financial standing will worsen in the next 12 months, six points higher than those who believed it will improve.As the dominant political issue, even amidst a fifth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic driven by the Omicron variant, there is concern that inflation, particularly for groceries, could escalate further as Canada has announced it will only allow in fully-vaccinated truckers from the United States, and experts expect a resultant supply crunch.Opposition finance critic and Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre tweeted, “Trudeau’s vaccine vendetta is emptying grocery shelves and ballooning food prices.”Justin Trudeau is likely to try and address the matter in the days ahead. Bringing down costs will be on the agenda as he heads a virtual Cabinet retreat this week, as “making life more affordable” was listed on the priorities, in a release from the Prime Minister’s Office.In addition, the Bank of Canada is expected to announce an increase in interest rates next week, as well, which could curb the inflationary trend.Such measures will be necessary politically for Trudeau, as 39% of those sampled in the ARI survey stated they were worse off now than they were last year. “This represents the largest group saying this in 13 years of tracking by ARI,” the agency noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-three-decade-high-inflation-hits-justin-trudeau-s-popularity-101642920357557.html

There's no doubt this is disappointing and will upset many holiday plans, but it's important to set these changes out clearly today so they can have time to consider those plans."Hipkins also said New Zealand's Cabinet has agreed to other precautionary measures, including reducing the interval between a second Covid-19 vaccine dose and a booster shot from six months to four months, and increasing the required length of stay for returning travelers from seven to 10 days in managed isolation and quarantine, as per CNN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/such-is-life-new-zealand-pm-jacinda-ardern-cancels-wedding-amid-omicron-surge-101642912896872.html

An investigation into the matter is ongoing, it added. “With the Philippine elections taking place this May, we remain vigilant about identifying and eliminating suspected information campaigns targeting election conversations,” a Twitter spokesperson said in an emailed statement.Marcos, who led last month’s presidential preference survey, has a dominant online presence. Independent fact-checker VERA Files said he benefited most from election-related disinformation last year.“While it is true that there could have been hundreds of Twitter accounts that were suspended, there is no certainty that all of them belong to the supporters of Bongbong Marcos,” his spokesman Vic Rodriguez said in a statement.The late dictator’s son has said he doesn’t employ online trolls and isn’t boosting his social media pages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-suspends-300-accounts-promoting-philippines-marcos-101642911673697.html

23-01-2022||World||‘Deeply concerning’: US on alleged Russia plot to install pro-Kremlin leader in Ukraine||The White House on Saturday called the UK government assessment of the Kremlin’s plan to install pro-Russian leader in Kyiv “deeply concerning”, saying it stands with the democratically elected Ukrainian government."This kind of plotting is deeply concerning," said National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne. "The Ukrainian people have the sovereign right to determine their own future, and we stand with our democratically-elected partners in Ukraine."The UK Foreign Office has accused Moscow of seeking to replace Ukraine’s government with a pro-Russia administration as tensions swell between the two neighbours. The British government said that Yevhen Murayev, a former Ukrainian member of parliament, is a potential candidate. The assertions, based on an intelligence assessment, were made without providing details or a timeframe on the intelligence to back it up.German navy chief resigns over ‘Putin deserves respect’ remark in New DelhiBritain also claimed that the Russian intelligence services maintain links with “numerous” former Ukrainian politicians. The four former Ukrainian officials mentioned by the UK – Serhiy Arbuzov, Mykola Azarov, Andriy Kluyev and Volodymyr Sivkovych – are already subject to Western sanctions. They are believed to reside in Russia.“Russia must de-escalate, end its campaigns of aggression and disinformation, and pursue a path of diplomacy,” UK foreign secretary Liz Truss said in the statement. “Any Russian military incursion into Ukraine would be a massive strategic mistake with severe costs.”Russia's foreign ministry has rejected the allegations as "disinformation" from Britain."Disinformation circulated by @FCDOGovUK is yet another indication that it is the @NATO Members led by the Anglo-Saxon nations who are escalating tensions around #Ukraine," the ministry said in a tweet."We urge the Foreign Office to stop spreading nonsense."The US and the UK have started sending military aid to Ukraine as part of their effort to bolster its defences against a potential Russian invasion. Meanwhile, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania plan to send US-made anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine, a move fully endorsed by the United States."I expedited and authorized and we fully endorse transfers of defensive equipment @NATO Allies Estonia Latvia Lithuania are providing to Ukraine to strengthen its ability to defend itself against Russia's unprovoked and irresponsible aggression," US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deeply-concerning-us-on-alleged-russia-plot-to-install-pro-kremlin-leader-in-ukraine-101642895601702.html

Russia has denied it plans to invade but the White House believes an attack could now come "at any point".Britain's Foreign Office on Saturday advised against all travel to two pro-Moscow separatist territories Donetsk and Lugansk, as well as Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.It also advised against all but essential travel to the rest of Ukraine and recommended that British nationals should register their presence in the country.A US State Department spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Saturday that they had no plans to evacuate US citizens from Ukraine, adding that commercial flights were currently available.'Quagmire'Few military experts believe that Kyiv's smaller forces -- although rapidly modernising -- could repel an outright Russian invasion.But British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss warned on Friday that Moscow still risked becoming embroiled in a "terrible quagmire" if it invaded.In a speech in Australia, the UK's top diplomat issued a blunt and personal warning to Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying he was on the brink of making a major strategic blunder.He "has not learned the lessons of history", Truss told Sydney's Lowy Institute."The Ukrainians will fight this, it could be a quagmire" she said.Russia has put pressure on Ukraine since an uprising nearly a decade ago toppled a government that had resisted calls to move closer to the West.Moscow seized the Crimean peninsula in 2014 when a pro-Russian insurgency broke out in eastern Ukraine that has since claimed more than 13,000 lives.Ukraine's calls to Western allies to bolster its defence capabilities have seen the United States, Britain and the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania agree to send Kyiv weapons, including anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles.Moscow insists it has no plans to invade Ukraine but has at the same time laid down a series of security demands -- including a ban on Ukraine joining NATO -- in exchange for de-escalation.Ukraine 'disappointed' in GermanyBut Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Saturday condemned Germany for its refusal to supply weapons to Kyiv, urging Berlin to stop "undermining unity" and "encouraging Vladimir Putin".Kuleba said on Twitter that Germany's statements "about the impossibility of supplying defence weapons to Ukraine" did not match "the current security situation".Ukraine's minister stressed that "today the unity of the West in relation to Russia is more important than ever".Ukraine is "grateful" to Germany for the support it has already provided, but its "current statements are disappointing", he added.Ukraine's foreign ministry meanwhile summoned the German ambassador to Ukraine to stress "the categorical unacceptability" of comments by German naval chief Kay-Achim Schoenbach.Schoenbach had said the idea that Russia wanted to invade Ukraine was "nonsense" and that what Putin wanted was "to be respected".Schoenbach made it clear in a subsequent tweet that his comments to a think-tank gathering in New Delhi on Friday, did not represent the government's view and had been ill-advised.But a German defence ministry spokesman said Saturday he would be asked to explain himself to the army chief of staff.Also Saturday, German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht said that Berlin would send a field hospital to Ukraine, but once again rejected Kiev's calls for weapons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-russian-defence-ministers-to-discuss-ukraine-situation-101642889944296.html

Fanned by wind gusts of up to 50 mph (80 kph), it quickly burned at least 2.3 square miles (6 square kilometers) of brush and redwood trees, said Cecile Juliette, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.“The fire lined up with the wind and the terrain and that gave the fire a lot of energy to make a big run,” she said Saturday.Authorities made contact with about 500 residents, urging them to evacuate the sparsely populated area between Carmel and Big Sur. More than 250 firefighters from multiple agencies and volunteer groups, aided by water-dropping aircraft, contained 5% of the blaze.“The winds have died down and that has worked in our favor,” she said.Authorities shut a stretch of Highway 1 with no estimated time for reopening. The highway along Big Sur is prone to closures due to fire and mudslides from heavy rain that made portions of the roadway collapse to the sea last year and in 2017.Evacuees shared on social media dramatic images of flames burning behind iconic Bixby Bridge. The tall concrete span has been the backdrop of many car commercials, movies and TV shows, most recently the HBO drama “Big Little Lies.”Strong winds were recorded across the San Francisco Bay Area overnight, knocking down trees and power lines and causing outages to at least 18,000 Pacific Gas & Electric customers in the region, the utility said. There were no immediate reports of injuries.In Sonoma County, firefighters extinguished a 5-acre fire on Geyser Peak, where gusts above 90 mph (145 kph) were recorded.The National Weather Service said a similar windy event happened in the region nearly a year ago on the night of Jan. 18. A red flag warning of extreme fire danger was issued then due to the strong winds and much drier conditions.This time, the region was still moist after December storms dumped heavy snow in the mountains and partially refilled parched reservoirs, providing some relief from what had been an exceptionally dry year.However, Juliette said the winds quickly dried up vegetation weakened by a prolonged drought and lowered humidity level.“It's unusual to have fire this size here on the coast at the end of January,” she said. “The fact that we had a fire this size is of great concern.”The cause of the fire was under investigation.Warnings of gusts from 50 mph to 70 mph (80-113 kph) were set to go into effect in much of Southern California by midafternoon Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wildfire-along-california-s-big-sur-forces-hundreds-to-evacuate-highway-shut-101642889169941.html

The assault on the Ghwayran prison in the northern city of Hasakeh is one of IS’s most significant since its “caliphate” was declared defeated in Syria nearly three years ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-coalition-denies-yemen-prison-airstrike-101642888283733.html
23-01-2022||World||Canada’s Trudeau vows action after four Indians freeze to death at US border||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday vowed action on human trafficking after the “mind-blowing” death of four Indian nationals, who froze to death while allegedly trying to illegally cross the border between Canada and the United States.“It was an absolutely mind-blowing story. It’s so tragic to see a family die like that, victims of human traffickers...and of people who took advantage of their desire to build a better life,” Trudeau said.“This is why we are doing all we can to discourage people from crossing the border in an irregular or illicit manner. We know there are great risks in doing so,” he added. Canada, Trudeau said, was working very closely with the United States to stop smuggling and help people “taking unacceptable risks”.The four victims - an infant, a teenage boy and two adults - were found in the Canadian province of Manitoba, just about 10km from the American border in Minnesota, where they were said to be walking across snow-covered fields during blizzard-like conditions.India’s consulate in Toronto has sent a team of officials to Winnipeg in Manitoba to coordinate with local officials and law enforcement. Canadian police have also briefed Indian officials in Ottawa.However, the identities of the four victims have yet to be established as the Manitoba Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) continues its investigation, with a post-mortem likely to take place on Monday.Seven other Indian nationals, linked to the tragic quartet found dead on the Canadian side of the border, were apprehended in the United States, and, according to an affidavit filed by a Homeland Security agent before the US district court for Minnesota, “all of the foreign nationals spoke Gujarati”. That makes it likely the victims were also from Gujarat, though that has yet to be confirmed by the police. One of those caught in the US told agents there he “paid a significant amount of money to enter Canada from India under a fraudulently obtained student visa”.One person, a 47-year-old resident of Florida Steve Shand was arrested by US authorities for allegedly “smuggling undocumented foreign nationals”. Two Indian nationals were found travelling with him in a passenger van, while five others were found wandering nearby, apparently seeking to rendezvous with Shand. One of them, a female, is in hospital suffering from severe frostbite that could lead to partial amputation.The bodies of the four victims were discovered on Wednesday after Manitoba RCMP in the morning received “concerning information” from their counterparts that the US Customs and Border Protection (USCBP) had apprehended a group of individuals who had crossed into the US from Canada, near the town of Emerson in Manitoba. According to a release from the Manitoba RCMP, they also found that one of the adults was carrying items meant for an infant, but that no infant was with the group.A search began and four hours later, at about 1:30pm, RCMP officers found the bodies of three individuals located on the Canadian side of the border, close to the town of Emerson. “Fearing there may be additional victims, officers continued their search and located the body of an additional male, believed at this time to be in his mid-teens,” the release stated.In a statement released on Friday, Jane MacLatchy, commanding officer of Manitoba RCMP, said the force has continued its search for survivors or additional victims, but no more have been located thus far.
