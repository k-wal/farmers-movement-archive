07-01-2022||World||US Supreme Court hears challenges to Covid vaccine mandates||The US Supreme Court heard challenges on Friday to Covid vaccination mandates imposed by the Biden administration on millions of American workers to curb the spread of the disease."Why isn't this necessary to abate the grave risk,?" Justice Elena Kagan asked the lawyer representing business associations opposed to the policy."This is a pandemic in which nearly a million people have died," Kagan said. "It is by far the greatest public health danger that this country has faced in the last century."And this is the policy that is most geared to stopping all this."Scott Keller, a former Texas solicitor general representing the business associations, said the rule requiring Covid vaccinations at businesses that employ 100 people would lead many workers to quit."An economy-wide mandate would cause permanent worker displacement, rippling through our national economy," Keller said."Part of the problems we're seeing with this rule is it's not truly intended to regulate a workplace danger," Keller said. "It's a danger that we all face simply as a matter of waking up in the morning."Justice Stephen Breyer said "some people may quit, maybe three percent.""But more may quit when they discover they have to work together with unvaccinated others because that means they may get the disease," Breyer said. "And more will quit because they'll maybe die or maybe they'll be in the hospital."After months of public appeals to Americans to get their shots, President Joe Biden announced in September that he was making Covid vaccinations compulsory at companies that employ 100 workers or more.Unvaccinated employees would have to present weekly negative tests and wear face masks at work.Biden also said vaccinations would be required for health care workers at facilities receiving federal funding.The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has given businesses until February 9 to be in compliance with the rules or face the possibility of fines.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the policies are "critical to our nation's Covid-19 response.""Unvaccinated Americans continue to face a real threat of severe illness and death -- including from Omicron," Psaki said in a statement.'Irreparable harm'The vaccine mandates came under immediate attack from some Republican lawmakers and business owners as an infringement on individual rights and an abuse of government power.A flurry of lawsuits ensued, and the conservative-majority Supreme Court is holding a special hearing to decide whether the mandates can be implemented while the legal challenges continue.A decision is expected within a few weeks.Businesses with 100 employees or more represent about two-thirds of the private sector workforce in the United States, or some 80 million people.The health care worker mandate would apply to roughly 10 million people.The group of 26 business associations opposed to the mandates said they will "inflict irreparable harm upon hundreds of thousands of businesses."Companies will be forced to pass the costs of testing on to consumers, resulting in "yet higher prices at a time of record inflation," they argued.Republican-ruled states led by Missouri said forcing health care workers to be vaccinated "threatens to create a crisis in health care facilities in rural America.""The mandate would force millions of workers to choose between losing their jobs or complying with an unlawful federal mandate," they argued.Several large US corporations, including meat giant Tyson Foods and United Airlines, imposed vaccination mandates in September without suffering major disruptions.The Supreme Court has six conservative justices and three liberal justices, and all of them have been vaccinated and received booster shots, according to the court.The nation's highest court has previously upheld vaccination mandates imposed on college students and health care workers by local authorities.But the court has curtailed federal actions linked to the pandemic, notably by throwing out a moratorium prohibiting evictions.If the court blocks the vaccination mandates, it would be a major blow to Biden, who has made bringing the pandemic under control one of his priorities but is battling a surge in cases from the Omicron variant.Vaccination has become a politically polarizing issue in the United States, where 62 percent of the population are vaccinated.There have been more than 58 million cases of coronavirus in the United States and more than 830,000 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-hears-challenges-to-covid-vaccine-mandates-101641579287061.html
07-01-2022||World||Kazakh leader rejects talks, tells forces to 'shoot to kill'||Kazakhstan's president on Friday rejected calls for talks with protesters after days of unprecedented unrest, vowing to destroy "armed bandits" and authorising his forces to shoot to kill without warning.In a hardline address to the nation, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev also gave "special thanks" to Russian President Vladimir Putin after a Moscow-led military alliance sent troops to Kazakhstan to help quell the unrest.Security forces had blocked off strategic areas of Almaty -- the country's largest city and epicentre of the recent violence -- and were firing into the air if anyone approached, an AFP correspondent said.Elsewhere the city was like a ghost town, with banks, supermarkets and restaurants closed. The few small shops still open were quickly running out of food.Tokayev said order had mostly been restored across the country, after protests this week over fuel prices escalated into widespread violence."Terrorists continue to damage property... and use weapons against civilians. I have given the order to law enforcement to shoot to kill without warning," Tokayev said in his third televised address this week.He ridiculed calls from abroad for negotiations as "nonsense"."We are dealing with armed and trained bandits, both local and foreign. With bandits and terrorists. So they must be destroyed. This will be done shortly."Airport closedLong seen as one of the most stable of the ex-Soviet republics of Central Asia, energy-rich Kazakhstan is facing its biggest crisis in decades.The violence erupted late Tuesday, when police fired tear gas and stun grenades at a thousands-strong protest in Almaty.The next day protesters stormed government buildings including the city administration headquarters and presidential residence, setting them ablaze.The interior ministry said 26 "armed criminals" had been killed in the unrest.It said 18 security officers had been killed and more than 740 wounded, and more than 3,800 people detained.The numbers could not be independently verified and there was no official information about casualties among civilian bystanders.The full picture of the chaos has often been unclear, with widespread disruptions to communications including mobile phone signals and hours-long internet shutdowns.Most flights into the country have been cancelled, and Russian news agencies quoted Almaty airport officials saying it would be closed to all but military flights until Sunday.Western countries have called for restraint on all sides and for the respect of people's right to protest peacefully.China's President Xi Jinping however praised Tokayev for taking "strong measures".Russian paratroopers landTokayev said Almaty had been under assault from "20,000 bandits" with a "clear plan of attack, coordination of actions and high combat readiness".He blamed "so-called free media" and unnamed foreign figures for instigating the violence, adding: "Democracy is not permissiveness."Tokayev on Wednesday declared a nationwide state of emergency and appealed for help from the Russia-dominated Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO).Russia's defence ministry said Friday nine planes carrying paratroopers and hardware had landed in Almaty and Russian forces had helped to secure the airport.It is not clear how many troops are being sent in the force -- which includes units from ex-Soviet states Russia, Belarus, Armenia, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan -- but media in Moscow have said the Russian contingent is expected to number less than 5,000.Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian news agencies the Russian leader and Tokayev had spoken several times in recent days to discuss "the situation in Kazakhstan and joint actions within the framework of the CSTO".Anger at ex-leaderProtests spread across the nation of 19 million this week in outrage over a New Year increase in prices for liquid petroleum gas (LPG), which is used to fuel many cars in the country.Thousands took to the streets in Almaty and in the western province of Mangystau, saying the price rise was unfair given oil and gas exporter Kazakhstan's vast energy reserves.The protests are the biggest threat so far to the regime established by Kazakhstan's founding president Nursultan Nazarbayev, who stepped down in 2019 and hand-picked Tokayev as his successor.Tokayev has announced several moves to head off unrest, including the resignation of the cabinet and six-month fuel price limits.Much of the anger appeared directed at Nazarbayev, who is 81 and had ruled Kazakhstan since 1989 before handing over power.Many protesters shouted "Old Man Out!" in reference to Nazarbayev, and a statue of him was torn down in the southern city of Taldykorgan.Critics have accused Nazarbayev and his family of staying in control behind the scenes and accumulating vast wealth at the expense of ordinary citizens.The ex-president has not made an appearance since the start of the crisis and there were unconfirmed reports of him and members of his family fleeing the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kazakh-leader-rejects-talks-tells-forces-to-shoot-to-kill-101641579045766.html
07-01-2022||World||Covid-19 cases top 300 million worldwide||The total number of Covid-19 registered worldwide since the start of the pandemic topped 300 million on Friday, according to an AFP count based on official figures.The figure stood at 300,042,439 cases at 15:45 GMT, including all the cases announced since the World Health Organization office in China first reported the outbreak of the disease in late December 2019.Case numbers have been on the rise since late last year due to the fast-spreading Omicron variant, first identified in Botswana and South Africa.As Omicron brings the fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic, many countries are reporting record numbers of infections.Over 13.5 million virus cases have been detected worldwide in the past week, a massive rise of 64 percent over the previous seven days, averaging out at 1,938,395 new infections per day.A total of 34 countries have seen record weekly cases numbers. Eighteen of those are in Europe, seven in Africa and six in Latin America and the Caribbean.The US and Canada have also seen record numbers, as has Australia.Europe has been particularly badly hit by the new variant with Cyprus registering 3,468 cases per 100,000 residents over the past seven days while the rate for Ireland is 2,840. In Greece the rate is 2,415 while the figure for Denmark is 2,362 and France 2,137.In 12th place on the recent incidence list is Australia, with 1,361 cases per 100,000 people over the past week.However the acceleration of the Covid spread has not, so far, translated into increased mortality figures.In fact the daily global average of deaths over the past seven days, 6,172, is a three percent dip on the previous week.A month after it was first detected in southern Africa, Omicron is now known to be far more contagious than previous variants of Covid-19 but appears to cause a less severe illness than its predecessors.The figures collated by AFP are based on daily reports from national health authorities.A significant proportion of the less severe or asymptomatic cases remain undetected despite intensified screening in many countries.In addition, testing policies differ from country to country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-cases-top-300-million-worldwide-101641578860712.html
07-01-2022||World||Germany tightens Covid rules for bars and restaurants||Germany will tighten curbs on bars and restaurants and ease quarantine rules in a bid to tackle the surging Omicron variant of Covid-19, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Friday.Speaking after talks with Germany's 16 regional leaders, Scholz said access to bars and restaurants will be limited to people who are fully vaccinated or recovered and can also provide a negative test.However, people who have received a booster shot will be exempted from the test requirement.Scholz said the rules -- known as "2G Plus" -- were "strict" but necessary "to help us progress more quickly" in the fight against Omicron, which he said "will be with us for a long time".Quarantine rules will also be relaxed to protect vital services and infrastructure from shutting down due to expected staff shortages, he said.Anyone infected with Covid as well as their close contacts will be able to end their quarantine after 10 days if they have no symptoms.They can be released after seven days if they provide a negative test.Those who have received a booster will no longer have to quarantine if they have come into close contact with an infected person.Germany has so far reported modest case numbers since the start of the year compared to many of its European neighbours, which have been engulfed by record surges.The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) health agency recorded 56,335 new infections in the past 24 hours on Friday, with an incidence rate of 303.4 new cases per 100,000 people over the past seven days.But Scholz said he expected that "the Omicron variant will cause infections to increase, and we will see larger numbers in the coming days and weeks than we are already seeing today".Germany's new government under Scholz, who took over from Angela Merkel as chancellor in December, has so far ruled out imposing a lockdown.However, it has limited private gatherings to 10 people, or two households if an unvaccinated person is present, as well as banning spectators from football games.Unvaccinated people have also been barred from large parts of public life, including cultural events, gyms and leisure facilities.Scholz urged as many people as possible to get their booster, describing the jab as "the best protection against Omicron".Almost 42 percent of Germans have already received a booster, while 71.6 percent have received a first and second dose.Scholz said last year he was in favour of compulsory vaccination in Germany, with parliament due to start debating the issue at the end of January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-tightens-covid-rules-for-bars-and-restaurants-101641578716088.html
07-01-2022||World||At least 16 dead in SW China building collapse||At least 16 people died when an explosion triggered by a suspected gas leak caused a building to collapse Friday in the Chinese city of Chongqing, state media said.The blast at 12:10 pm (0410 GMT) brought down a neighbourhood committee building housing a canteen, trapping 26 people, the Xinhua news agency said.In the early hours of Saturday, Xinhua put the new death toll at 16, with 10 more injured, one of them critically.On Friday, the Chongqing government had put the initial death toll at nine.Videos and photos from Xinhua showed orange-clad workers in hard hats climbing through the rubble on Friday night under floodlights.Xinhua said in its latest update that as of midnight, all those trapped had been pulled out.The injured people are receiving medical treatment, Chongqing authorities said through their verified account on the Twitter-like Weibo platform.Footage posted by state broadcaster CCTV on social media showed smoke and dust billowing from the collapsed building in Wulong district on the outskirts of the southwestern megacity.The scene of the blast appeared to be in the middle of other buildings and was surrounded by a crowd of bystanders earlier on Friday.Another clip by Xinhua showed dozens of rescuers in military fatigues jogging along a road to the site carrying shovels over their shoulders.More than 150 fire and rescue workers have been deployed to the site, CCTV said.Heavy lifting and excavation equipment have also been sent to the scene.The cause of the blast remains under investigation.'Blown to pieces'Local authorities set up an "on-site emergency response headquarters" to direct the rescue work and provide medical treatment, the state-run People's Daily newspaper reported.An eyewitness told state-run Phoenix TV that the blast was "very scary... our windows have all been blown to pieces". Xinhua said people were having lunch when the blast occurred.Officials have demanded the "fastest possible rescue" and ordered service personnel to "spare no effort to rescue the injured and strictly guard against secondary disasters", the newspaper said.Gas leaks and explosions are not uncommon in China, due to weak safety standards and corruption among officials tasked with enforcement.In June, 25 people were killed in a gas blast that ripped through a residential compound and struck a busy two-storey building packed with shoppers.Eight suspects, including the general manager of the company that owned the gas pipe, were detained after the government said "the company's safety management system was unsound".The same month, 18 people were killed and more injured when a fire broke out at a martial arts school, with state media reporting that all the victims were boarding school pupils.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-16-dead-in-sw-china-building-collapse-101641578484140.html
07-01-2022||World||Biden to deliver first State of the Union address on March 1||President Joe Biden will deliver his first State of the Union address on March 1, the White House confirmed Friday, after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent the president a formal invitation to speak to Congress and the American public one year into his term.It will mark the latest any president has delivered a State of the Union address. The speech is normally timed for January, and occasionally for February. The delay is driven in part by a busy legislative calendar, a winter spike in Covid19 cases from the more transmissible omicron variant and the upcoming Winter Olympics, which ties up broadcast network time.The last State of the Union address was delivered by then-President Donald Trump on the eve of his acquittal by the Senate in his first impeachment trial.Biden first addressed a joint session of Congress in April 2020, about 100 days into his time in the White House, which he used to promote twin infrastructure and domestic spending bills. Biden signed a slimmed-down and bipartisan version of the infrastructure proposal into law last year in crowning first-year legislative achievements. The larger expansion of the social safety net passed the House, but Biden has struggled to secure enough Democratic support in the Senate for passage.“Thank you for your bold vision and patriotic leadership which have guided America out of crisis and into an era of great progress, as we not only recover from the pandemic but Build Back Better!," Pelosi wrote in her letter to Biden. “In that spirit, I am writing to invite you to address a Joint Session of Congress on Tuesday, March 1, to share your vision of the State of the Union.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-deliver-first-state-of-the-union-address-on-march-1-101641578204518.html

He added that the prime minister would personally be taking briefings on progress on CPEC projects every 15 days, said The Express Tribune.It comes as Pakistan trade deficit surged to USD 24.79 billion during the first half of the current fiscal year, mainly on the back of a 63 per cent year-on-year increase in imports. The surge in trade deficit came from a massive rise in exports.Data for the July-December period showed that imports jumped to USD 39.91 bn from USD 24.47 bn a year ago. In contrast, exports during July-December also grew 25 per cent to USD 15.13bn compared to the year-ago period, reported Dawn.Pakistan is currently marred with financial challenges with opposition targetting the government over the mini-budget.

07-01-2022||World||China: PLA to gift Galwan Valley stones to netizens||China’s People’s Liberation Army’s western theatre command (WTC) which oversees the disputed border with India will offer stones from the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh to netizens on February 1.The WTC opened its official account on Twitter-like Sina Weibo on Friday and released a notice that on February 1 it will “..randomly choose 10 lucky netizens from those who reposted the notice and send them a stone from the Galwan Valley as a present,” the tabloid Global Times said in a report on Friday evening.“A picture with Chinese soldiers patrolling the Galwan Valley, with a rock face seen in the post reading in Chinese characters ‘Splendid landscape, no inch to give up’ was posted together with the notice,” the report added.This is the Chinese government’s latest effort to use the brutal clash between Indian and Chinese soldiers on the night of June 15 in Galwan Valley as propaganda to push through its narrative, painting India as the aggressor.While India lost 20 troops in the clash, four Chinese soldiers were also killed.Indian and Chinese militaries have been locked in a border standoff in eastern Ladakh since May, 2020, when a violent clash in Pangong Lake area led to both sides gradually deploying tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry along the border.Several rounds of military and diplomatic talks have only resulted in partial disengagement of troops until now.India has consistently rejected China’s allegations that Indian troops crossed over to the Chinese side of the LAC in eastern Ladakh asserting instead that New Delhi has always taken a responsible approach towards boundary management and maintaining peace and tranquillity in the border areas.That hasn’t stopped the Chinese government from pushing through its narrative through nationalistic videos and commentaries.On January 1, Chinese official media released a video showing Chinese PLA soldiers unfurling the country’s flag somewhere in the Galwan valley.Last October, it had released another video showing hundreds of PLA soldiers from unit 7895 of the Xinjiang military command standing in rows and shouting military slogans on the rocky banks of a river, flowing through a ravine, between cliffs.“On the National Martyr’s Day Officers and soldiers of a regiment in Xinjiang Military Command Went to the place where the martyrs fought to remember the heroes and to inherit their legacy,” the report accompanying the video said.Earlier, China’s official English channel, CGTN, had uploaded a video on one of the four PLA soldiers who died, Chen Hongjun, on social media and its website to mark the armed forces’ founding day on August 1.Besides interviews of Chen’s family members including his wife, the video showed edited footage of the clash between the two armies; Chinese equipment on the banks of the fast flowing river, soldiers, mostly Chinese, precariously wading in knee-deep water and personnel from the two sides charging at each other.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-pla-to-gift-galwan-valley-stones-to-netizens-101641573287107.html
07-01-2022||World||Sino-India dispute: Building infra on territory within our ‘sovereignty’, says China||China on Friday said it was building infrastructure within its “sovereignty”, a day after New Delhi accused Beijing of constructing a bridge across a portion of the strategic Pangong Lake in eastern Ladakh it has illegally occupied for 60 years.Dismissing India’s indignation over the new construction in a disputed area, the Chinese foreign ministry said the infrastructure was also aimed at maintaining peace and stability in the Sino-India border.The exchange of words over developments in a sensitive and highly-militarised region comes in the backdrop of the ongoing 20-month long border tension between the two countries in eastern Ladakh, which has plunged bilateral ties to its worst in decades.India’s external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi on Thursday said New Delhi has been closely monitoring the construction of a bridge on Pangong Lake by China.The de facto Sino-India border, the Line of Actual Control (LAC) passes through the lake and part of it is occupied by China but claimed by India.Responding to a question on the topic in Beijing on Friday, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin declined to go into details but said China was within its rights to build infrastructure on its territory.“I am not aware of the situation you mentioned. I want to stress that China’s infrastructure construction on its territory entirely falls within its sovereignty and is aimed at safeguarding China’s territorial sovereignty and security as well as peace and stability in the China-India border area,” Wang said.In New Delhi, Bagchi on Thursday had said that the bridge is being “…constructed in areas that have been under illegal occupation by China for around 60 years now. As you are well aware India has never accepted such illegal occupation”.“Recent satellite imagery has shown that the Chinese bridge spanning a narrow section of the 134km lake is nearly complete. Experts believe it will drastically reduce the time needed by the Chinese side to move troops and equipment from in-depth bases to forward locations near the LAC,” an HT report from New Delhi said.The Chinese official media seldom publishes news about specific infrastructure projects near the border with India though it does share news about how the living conditions and facilities for People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers deployed near the LAC are being strengthened.In September, Chinese official media announced that both Xinjiang and Tibet, bordering India, will soon have 30 airports at the disposal of the Western Theatre Command (WTC) to facilitate the movement of PLA personnel.The WTC is the largest military command of the PLA and oversees the disputed border with India. While some of these airports have already been built and are functional, the remaining are under construction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sinoindia-dispute-building-infra-on-territory-within-our-sovereignty-says-china-101641570946896.html
07-01-2022||World||China’s Xi extends support, lauds Kazakhstan’s president for decisive action||Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday lent strong support to Kazakhstan President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev facing a country-wide rebellion, saying Tokayev has taken decisive and effective actions at a critical moment to quickly calm the situation.In a verbal message to Tokayev, published by the Xinhua news agency on Friday, Xi said China strongly rejects any attempt by external forces to provoke unrest and instigate “colour revolutions” in Kazakhstan “…as well as any attempt to harm the friendship between China and Kazakhstan and disrupt the two countries’ cooperation”.Xi Jinping’s unequivocal support to Tokayev was extended on a day when the Russia-backed president said he had ordered his troops to shoot to kill to put down the uprising.Kazakhstan is part of the China-led eight-member bloc, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), of which India is also a member.The Chinese president said Tokayev has shown the “…sense of responsibility as a statesman, and demonstrated a highly responsible attitude to the country and the people”.As a fraternal neighbour and permanent comprehensive strategic partner of Kazakhstan, China is ready to provide necessary support to help it overcome the difficulties, Xi assured his Kazakh counterpart.China, Xi Jinping said, firmly opposes any force undermining Kazakhstan’s stability, threatening the country’s security, and sabotaging the peaceful life of the Kazakh people.No matter what risks and challenges Kazakhstan encounters, China is always a trustworthy friend and reliable partner of Kazakhstan, and the Chinese people will always stand together with the Kazakh people, Xi said.Earlier, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin said that China has noticed that the Kazakh authorities are taking a series of powerful measures to combat violence and terrorism and maintain social stability.Wang said China supports all efforts that are “…conducive to the Kazakh authorities calming the situation as soon as possible, and firmly opposes the deliberate creation of social unrest and incitement of violence in Kazakhstan by external forces”.Dozens of people have died and public buildings across the country have been ransacked and torched in the worst violence in its 30 years of independence.Tokayev has said foreign-trained terrorists were responsible for the unrest.“The militants have not laid down their arms, they continue to commit crimes or are preparing for them,” he said in a televised address, according to a Reuters copy from Almaty.“Whoever does not surrender will be destroyed. I have given the order to law enforcement agencies and the army to shoot to kill, without warning,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-xi-extends-support-lauds-kazakhstan-s-president-for-decisive-action-101641567826447.html

07-01-2022||World||Covid-19: Chinese vice-premier ‘ashamed’ after woman loses baby in Xian lockdown||A top Chinese official expressing “shame” has warned hospitals treating those infected with Covid-19 not to turn away other patients after a woman suffered a miscarriage and a man died from cardiac arrest during the ongoing lockdown in Xian city in northwest China.The pregnant woman and the man who died were turned away from hospitals in Xian - a city of 13 million in its 16th day of lockdown - as they could not furnish negative nucleic acid test certificates.Since December 9, Xian has recorded more than 1,800 locally transmitted Covid-19 cases.Chinese vice-premier Sun Chunlan said she felt deeply ashamed and heartbroken about the woman’s miscarriage. “That this problem arose was very heart-wrenching and I feel deeply ashamed,” she was quoted as saying by the South China Morning Post. “It showed that outbreak prevention work had problems with not being sufficiently strict or down to earth. The lesson learned was deep.”“With the medical personnel under proper protection, patients in serious or critical conditions must be treated immediately, with or without the proof of nucleic acid tests,” Sun said, calling for “…designated hospitals to provide continuous service to patients in urgent need”.An investigation is being conducted into the difficulties people face in getting through to the emergency hotline, and measures have been taken to fix the problem, Sun added.While authorities were dealing with the angry aftermath of the woman losing her unborn child, the case of a 39-year-old man dying of a heart attack after being rejected by three hospitals on December 31 was reported by local Chinese media on Friday, leading to more online outrage.Identified by his pseudonym Li Hai, the man suffered severe chest pain and was taken to three separate hospitals before the fourth admitted him only to pronounce him dead.“If you have a sudden illness during this period, you can only wait for death,” was one of the many angry comments from netizens.China, meanwhile, reported 116 domestically transmitted infections for Thursday, mostly in Xian and the central province of Henan, down from 132 a day earlier, data from the national health commission (NHC) showed on Friday.“While more cases might be reported in the future, the threat of a major resurgence in Xian has been basically brought under control,” Li Qun from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention told Xinhua in an interview.While the number of cases in China remain small compared globally, health authorities are scrambling to contain the ongoing flare-up in multiple provinces as Beijing and adjoining Hebei province get ready to host the 2022 Winter Olympics in February, and the whole country prepare for Chinese New Year holidays.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases on the mainland had reached 103,295 by Thursday since the pandemic began in 2019 with 3,359 patients still receiving treatment.

07-01-2022||World||How China is keeping to its strict 'zero Covid' strategy||The distressing case of a pregnant Chinese woman miscarrying after a strict lockdown delayed her access to medical treatment has reignited debate over the limits of China's zero-tolerance approach to Covid-19.The country where the coronavirus was first detected in 2019 is now among the last places still hewing to "zero Covid", placing millions under quarantine even as Beijing prepares to host next month's Winter Olympics.- How is China maintaining 'zero Covid'? -China has a formula it calls "dynamic zero" for curbing outbreaks: strict lockdowns and immediate mass testing.Unlike softer lockdowns elsewhere, people in China can be banned from leaving their buildings or forced to remain inside hotel rooms if they are considered high-risk contacts.The historic city of Xi'an, home to the famed Terracotta Warriors, was locked down in December, forcing its 13 million residents indoors after around 150 cases were detected.The similarly sized city of Zhengzhou tested every resident after just 11 cases.International flights are a fraction of pre-pandemic levels with arrivals undergoing strict weeks-long quarantine.Mandatory track-and-trace apps mean close contacts are usually detected and quarantined quickly.- Does it work? -China's official tally since the start of the pandemic -- just over 100,000 -- is a fraction of the record one million cases logged by the US in a single day earlier this month.The official death toll has stayed under 5,000.Although cases from the chaotic initial outbreak in Wuhan in early 2020 are widely believed to have been under-reported, life since then has largely returned to normal."There is still no ability to stop single local cases from appearing, but we have the ability and confidence to quickly extinguish the outbreak when a local case is found," National Health Commission official Liang Wannian told reporters last month.- Who pays the price? -"Zero Covid" comes at a cost.Border areas, especially near Myanmar, have endured almost constant lockdowns and seen an exodus of businesses.Locked-down communities have complained of poor access to food, supplies and medical treatment.Meanwhile, migrant workers have been left stranded from families for months due to onerous travel rules and restrictions.Heavy-handed enforcement has sometimes sparked outrage, such as when health workers beat a corgi to death after the owners were sent to quarantine.Analysts say repeated shutdowns of factories and businesses have contributed to the country's slowdown, despite China being the only major economy to expand in 2020.- Will China ever reopen? -"China certainly has shown it is feasible to continue the zero Covid strategy almost indefinitely," Ben Cowling, an epidemiologist at Hong Kong University, told AFP.The country effectively cut itself off from the world in March 2020 and virtually banned foreigners from entering.Since then, travel restrictions have eased slightly.But international tourism is non-existent and the government has said it will not renew expiring Chinese passports unless the holder has a good reason for travel.The country will not reopen until at least after the upcoming Winter Olympics and Paralympics in Beijing, with the government anxiously guarding the capital and tightening restrictions ahead of the Games.Those who question "zero Covid" have faced a nationalistic backlash.Prominent Chinese medical expert Zhang Wenhong wrote in July that countries must eventually "learn to coexist with the virus" -- prompting attacks from online trolls.- What will happen if China opens up? -Peking University researchers have warned China could suffer a "colossal outbreak" that would overwhelm its medical system if it relaxed restrictions to a similar level as Europe and the US.But Ivan Hung, an infectious diseases expert at Hong Kong University, said second-generation vaccines targeting the Delta and Omicron variants -- as well as close to 100 per cent vaccination rates -- could ward off a disaster.In this scenario, "it's likely that Covid will turn out to be similar to influenza," Hung said.But letting the virus in could be risky for President Xi Jinping as he seeks a third term in October after billing himself as a leader that will always keep China safe."When it does come, the transition may not be easy because Chinese society has gotten quite used to a low level of transmission," University of Oxford's Thomas Hale told AFP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-china-is-keeping-to-its-strict-zero-covid-strategy-101641533501988.html
07-01-2022||World||Brazil's Bolsonaro slams health regulator for approving Covid-19 vaccines for kids||Brazil president Jair Bolsonaro criticized the country's health regulator Anvisa on Thursday for authorizing the vaccination of children aged 5 to 11 years against Covid-19, one day after his health minister unveiled plans to inoculate that age group.Bolsonaro, who has bragged about not being vaccinated himself and has consistently cast doubt on the efficacy and safety of coronavirus vaccines, said in a radio interview that he had not heard of children dying of Covid-19 and repeated that his daughter Laura, 11, would not be vaccinated.Bolsonaro said vaccines could have side effects on children, but gave no evidence. Anvisa and health regulators around the world have found that Covid-19 vaccines are safe for those from age 5 and up."Are you going to vaccinate your child when the possibility of dying is almost zero? What is behind this? What are the interests of vaccine maniacs?" Bolsonaro stated.The Ministry of Health announced on Wednesday that it had bought 20 million pediatric vaccines developed by Pfizer Inc and voluntary vaccination of children 5 to 11 years old would begin by the end of the month.In a social media broadcast later on Thursday, Bolsonaro stressed that the vaccination was not obligatory. "No town mayor or state governor can prevent a child from going to school for not being vaccinated," he said.Bolsonaro warned that Pfizer has not assumed responsibility for any side effects the vaccine could have in children and said parents should immediately seek a doctor if their child developed chest pains or a shortage of breath.The Brazilian Society of Pediatrics rejected that view and said in a statement that Brazilians should fear the virus and not the vaccines, which can save lives at any age.Anvisa approved the Pfizer vaccine for children on Dec. 16, drawing heated criticism from people opposed to vaccines and the president, who suggested that children only be vaccinated with a doctor's prescription.The ministry dropped the idea as impractical. Requiring a written prescription would discourage vaccination at a time when the more transmissible coronavirus variant Omicron is starting to spread in Brazil, health experts said at a public hearing.According to the national council of state health secretaries, at least 300 children aged 5 to 11 had died in Brazil from Covid-19 by the start of December.Brazil's Army differed from the president this week on how to deal with Covid-19. It ordered soldiers to get vaccinated, wear masks and maintain social distance and warned them against spreading false news about the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazils-bolsonaro-slams-health-regulator-for-approving-covid-19-vaccines-for-kids-101641531453085.html
07-01-2022||World||Australia's most populous state to reinstate some Covid-19 curbs - report||Australia's New South Wales state, home to Sydney and a third of Australia's 25 million population will reinstate restrictions including shutting nightclubs and cancelling non-urgent surgeries because of record coronavirus infections, the Sydney Morning Herald reported on Friday.The measures are expected to be approved by the state government's economic recovery committee on Friday in a bid to ease pressure on hospitals, the report said, citing senior government sources.Cafes and restaurants will have capacity limits and all patrons must be seated while singing and dancing at pubs banned, the newspaper said. Restrictions will be branded as safety measures rather than a lockdown.New South Wales (NSW), the worst affected Australian state from the fast-spreading Omicron coronavirus variant, has registered record daily infections over the past few days overwhelming its testing facilities, emergency services and hospitals.People admitted to NSW hospitals with Covid-19 have nearly doubled to a record 1,609 in just over a week. There were around 150 daily cases in the state in late November when the first Omicron case was detected. That shot up to 35,000 on Thursday.NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet had steadfastly refused to bring back restrictions, dismissing calls by doctors and health workers, saying it was time to live with Covid-19.The Premier's office did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment on the Herald report.Neighbouring Victoria state a day earlier brought back restrictions that would limit people at pubs and clubs.Having successfully kept a lid on its Covid-19 caseload through snap lockdowns, tough border rules and strict social distancing rules earlier in the pandemic, Australia is suffering infections rates far higher than elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region. Authorities have warned those numbers would rise further over the next several weeks.Australia has recorded more than 684,000 cases and 2,301 deaths since the pandemic began, with more than half of those infections reported over the past two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australias-most-populous-state-to-reinstate-some-covid-19-curbs-report-101641528006468.html
07-01-2022||World||‘Absolutely wrong, counterproductive, mumbo jumbo’: UK's Johnson calls out anti-vaxxers||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday hit out at anti-vaccine groups who spread "mumbo jumbo" on social media but ruled out the UK following some European countries in making Covid-19 vaccination a mandatory legal requirement.Speaking during a visit to a vaccination centre in Northampton in eastern England, Johnson said the UK will maintain a “voluntary approach” to its vaccination programme as opposed to "coercion". However, he condemned anti-vaxxers for spreading complete nonsense and urged people to take up their booster doses to protect against the surging Omicron variant."They (anti-vaxxers) are totally wrong and I think it is time that I, the government, call them out on what they are doing,” Johnson told reporters."It is absolutely wrong, it is totally counterproductive, and the stuff they're putting out on social media is completely mumbo jumbo… You haven't heard me say that before, because I think it's important we have a voluntary approach in this country and we're going to keep a voluntary approach,” he said.Italy is the latest country to make vaccination compulsory for some, with all over-50s now being told to have a jab. Earlier, Austria was among the first countries to make vaccination a legal requirement.Johnson said while Omicron is milder than previous variants, "the pressures on hospitals are clear". He pointed out that the National Health Service (NHS) was under "huge pressure" at the moment and that it was a “tragedy” that some people were refusing what would keep them safe and out of hospital."What a tragedy that we've got all this pressure on the NHS, all the difficulties that our doctors and nurses are experiencing, and we've got people out there spouting complete nonsense about vaccination,” he said."The saddest words in the English language are 'too late'. When you're in ICU and you haven't been vaccinated, sadly it's too late to get vaccinated, so get boosted now," he added.NHS England announced that around 90 per cent of over-50s have now received their third top up booster dose of a Covid-19 vaccine and that millions of appointments remain available for anyone yet to get boosted."It is brilliant to see so many people getting their vital top-up dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, with 90 per cent of those eligible aged 50 and over now boosted, and more than 29 million boosters given in total,” said Dr Emily Lawson, head of the NHS Covid-19 vaccination programme."Vaccination gives the best protection for you and your loved ones against coronavirus, so if you’re eligible – please get boosted now,” she said.Meanwhile, the government hopes that the peak of the Omicron variant wave will be hit quite soon after the UK recorded over 190,000 daily infections. The requirement for a confirmatory PCR test to follow a positive lateral flow test conducted on a home testing kit has been scrapped in an attempt to relieve some of the pressures on testing laboratories and also to address staff absences by containing self-isolation for milder cases to seven days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/absolutely-wrong-counterproductive-mumbo-jumbo-uk-s-johnson-calls-out-antivaxxers-101641524459449.html
07-01-2022||World||In response threat, Taliban to recruit suicide bombers in armed forces||The Taliban will officially recruit suicide bombers to become part of the army as the militant group tries to contain its biggest security threat from rival Islamic State since forming government in Afghanistan four months ago.Before sweeping into power last year, the Taliban used suicide bombers as a key weapon to attack and defeat US and Afghan troops in the 20-year war.Now the group wants to reform and organise the scattered squads of suicide bombers across the country to operate under a single unit and protect Afghanistan, said the Taliban’s deputy spokesman Bilal Karimi.Their main target now would be the local offshoot of the Islamic State, which has carried out at least five major attacks as the Taliban looked to consolidate power after the United States withdrew from Afghanistan in August.Several of those attacks were carried out by suicide bombers. “The special forces that include martyrdom seekers will be used for more sophisticated and special operations,” Karimi said.Meanwhile, Taliban regime has said that it will not allow fencing by Pakistan along the Durand Line, amid escalating tensions between the neighbouring countries on the contentious issue of border fencing, a media report said.“We (Taliban) will not allow the fencing anytime, in any form. Whatever they (Pakistan) did before, they did, but we will not allow it anymore. There will be no fencing anymore,” Mawllawi Sanaullah Sangin, commander of the Taliban, told Afghanistan’s Tolo News on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-response-threat-taliban-to-recruit-suicide-bombers-in-armed-forces-101641519626611.html
07-01-2022||World||‘Tsunami’ of new Covid-19 cases clog global health systems, WHO sounds alarm||In view of the rising number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases around the globe, World Health Organisation (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Thursday said the “tsunami of cases” – driven by the new, highly transmissible Omicron variant – has now started to overwhelm health systems all across the globe.In a new high, a record number of 9.5 million fresh Covid-19 cases were reported globally in the week between December 27, 2021, and January 2, 2022. The weekly epidemiological update issued by the WHO showed that the daily tally of global cases had increased sharply during this duration by 71 per cent as compared to the week prior.The number of new deaths, too, took a 10 per cent hike during this span. This corresponds to just under 9.5 million new cases and over 41,000 new deaths being reported during the last week.Pointing to the sudden surge in global Covid-19 cases, Ghebreyesus said, “Last week, the highest number of Covid-19 cases so far in the pandemic were reported. And we know, for certain, that this is an underestimate of cases because reported numbers do not reflect the backlog of testing around the holidays, the number of positive self-tests not registered, and burdened surveillance systems that miss cases around the world.”“Just like the previous variants, Omicron is hospitalising people and it is killing people,” he added. “In fact, the tsunami of cases is so huge and quick, that it is overwhelming health systems around the world.”Regarding vaccination, the WHO chief said that while the first-generation of Covid-19 vaccines may not be capable of stopping all infections and transmissions, especially in light of emerging new variants, they are still highly effective in reducing the number of hospitalisations and deaths.He said the key things to keep in mind, as always, are vaccination, public health social measures, including the wearing of well-fitting masks, distancing, avoiding crowds, and improving and investing in ventilation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tsunami-of-new-covid-19-cases-clog-global-health-systems-who-sounds-the-alarm-101641514076739.html
07-01-2022||World||India joins Quad partners, Japan and South Korea for Sea Dragon exercise||NEW DELHI: India and its partners in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad along with Canada and South Korea are participating in the multinational exercise Sea Dragon at Guam in the Western Pacific. The exercise, primarily focused on anti-submarine warfare (ASW) training, will involve more than 270 hours of in-flight training and activities ranging from tracking simulated targets to tracking a US Navy submarine. Each event will be graded and the country scoring the highest points will receive the Dragon Belt award. The wargame, being held at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam, includes contingents from the Indian Navy, the US Navy, Royal Australian Air Force, Royal Canadian Air Force, Japan’s Maritime Self-Defense Force and the South Korean Navy. Two P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft of the US Navy are participating in the drill. During classroom training sessions, pilots and flight officers from all the countries will build plans and discuss tactics incorporating the capabilities and equipment of their nations, the US Pacific Fleet said in a statement. “As [officer-in-charge], I am eager for the opportunity to further develop our partnerships with Australia, Canada, India, Japan, and Korea while at Sea Dragon 2022,” said Lt Cmdr Braz Kennedy, officer-in-charge of the US detachment from Patrol Squadron 47. The Royal Canadian Air Force won the Dragon Belt at last year’s exercise and is defending the title at Sea Dragon 2022. “This exercise is an annual, multi-national high-end ASW training exercise,” said Cmdr Tomoyuki Michiyama, commanding officer of Flight Division 31 of Air Patrol Squadron 3 of Japan’s Maritime Self-Defense Force. “I believe that by conducting a wide range of training, from classroom training on the ground to actual training targeting a submarine, we will be able to improve our tactical skills. In addition, through training, exchange of opinions, and various types of exchanges, we expect to strengthen cooperation and deepen mutual understanding among the participating navies and air forces.” The P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft will conduct maritime patrols and reconnaissance and theatre outreach operations within the US Pacific Fleet area of operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-joins-quad-partners-japan-and-south-korea-for-sea-dragon-exercise-101641496355667.html
07-01-2022||World||Biden blames Trump for the Capitol riot in a Jan 6 speech||President Joe Biden on Thursday directly and bluntly blamed his predecessor former President Donald Trump for the January 6 insurrection in a speech on its first anniversary and called him a “liar” who had spun a web of lies about his defeat because of his “bruised ego” and because he “values power over principle”.“He’s not just a former president,” Biden said training his sights on his predecessor and adding as he leaned into the microphone, “He’s a defeated former president.” He did not name Trump even once though he referred to him at least 16 times in a speech lasting nearly 25 minutes.President Biden spoke forcefully and bluntly to mark the anniversary of the insurrection by a mob of Trump’s supporters who had attacked US Capitol, home to American congress, on January 6 to prevent a joint sitting of lawmakers from certifying Biden’s election as the next president, a routine practice. He spoke from the Statuary Hall, a portion of the US Capitol building that had been ransacked by the rioters that day.“For the first time in our history, a president had not just lost an election,” Biden said focusing on Trump’s role in the insurrection. “He tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob reached the Capitol.”The president then slammed his predecessor for doing nothing as the rioters menaced the building, kicking down doors, marching through the halls of the seat of US democracy with the flag of the separatist Confederacy, which, he reminded listeners, did not happen even during the Civil War.“We didn’t see a former president, who had just rallied the mob to attack, sitting in the private dining room off the Oval Office in the White House, watching it all on television and doing nothing,” the American president said.He added: “A former president United States of America has created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election. He’s done so because he values power over principle because he sees his own interest is more important than his country’s interests than America’s interest. And because his bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy.”Vice-president Kamala Harris, who introduced the president at the event, said, “On January 6th, we all saw what our nation would look like if the forces who seek to dismantle our democracy are successful. The lawlessness, the violence, the chaos. What was at stake then, and now, is the right to have our future decided the way the Constitution prescribes it: by we, the people -- all the people.”Trump said in a statement: “Biden is working hard to try and deflect the incompetent job he is doing, and has done, on the horrible Afghanistan withdrawal (surrender), the Borders, Covid, Inflation, loss of Energy Independence, and much more. Everything he touches turns to failure. That’s what you get when you have a rigged Election.”Trump’s role in inciting the insurrection, which the former president has still not condemned, is coming under increasing scrutiny and Attorney General Merrick Garland’s remarks on Wednesday, the eve of the anniversary, are being seen as an indicator that he may not escape legal jeopardy altogether.“The Justice Department remains committed to holding all January 6th perpetrators, at any level, accountable under law — whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy,” Garland said, adding, “We will follow the facts wherever they lead.”Key takeaways from this remark were the use of certain phrases from the usually careful and mild-manner attorney general — such as “perpetrators, at any level” and “whether they were present that day” or not. Trump had spoken to the mob and sent them on their way saying he will walk with them but then headed back to the White House and, as Biden recounted, he had watched the violence unfold from his office.Trump did eventually call for calm and urge the rioters to leave, but that he did hours after and under sustained pressure from his aides, including his daughter Ivanka Trump.Trump’s role is also being examined by a select committee of the House of Representatives, which is investigating the insurrection and has heard testimonies from several of the former president’s close aides. Former chief of staff Mark Meadows first agreed to testify and then flipped, but not before he had handed over thousands of documents that shed a lot of light on Trump’s role.The US department of justice is also investigating the attack as a criminal act. Up till Wednesday, it had arrested and charged more than 725 defendants, in nearly all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Approximately 40 defendants have been charged with conspiracy to obstruct a congressional proceeding and/or to obstruct law enforcement. Seventeen defendants are already scheduled to go to trial for their role in felony conspiracies, and more could follow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-blames-trump-for-the-capitol-riot-in-a-jan-6-speech-101641491014975.html
