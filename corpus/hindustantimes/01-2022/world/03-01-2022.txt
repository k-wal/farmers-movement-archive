Figures for Wales and Northern Ireland were not released.“I think we’ve got to recognize that the pressure on our NHS, on our hospitals, is going to be considerable in the course the next couple of weeks, and maybe more,” Johnson said during a visit to a vaccination center in Aylesbury, 85 kilometers (53 miles) northwest of London.Johnson was speaking after The Sunday Times newspaper reported that a group of hospitals in the eastern county of Lincolnshire had declared a “critical incident” due to “extreme and unprecedented” staff shortages.Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents health trusts that run hospitals around the country, told the BBC: “We’re seeing increasing staff absences, and that’s coming on top of a very significant amount of wider pressure.”And Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation that represents 1.5 million health workers, said much of the health service is in “a state of crisis” that's exacerbated by a high demand for services and staff absences.“Some hospitals are making urgent calls to exhausted staff to give up rest days and leave to enable them to sustain core services. Many more hospitals are having to ban visitors to try to reduce the spread of infection," he said.Johnson’s government removed almost all coronavirus restrictions in July, but last month reversed course and triggered its “Plan B” for England — ordering face coverings be worn in indoor public places, requiring proof of vaccination or a negative test to enter nightclubs and asking people to work from home if they can.Johnson on Monday urged people to adhere to those rules and get a booster vaccination shot, as the government seeks to shore up staffing shortages.“So do all the things that I’ve said, make sure we follow a Plan B, get boosted but also help the NHS with their staffing requirements, and we’re looking at what we can do to move people into those areas that are particularly badly affected," he said.But Johnson appeared to rule out any tightening of measures in coming days.“I think the way forward for the country as a whole is to continue with the path that we’re on. We’ll will keep everything under review," he said.“The mixture of things that we’re doing at the moment is, I think, the right one."Earlier, Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi told the BBC that data from London, which has seen surging infection rates in recent weeks, appear to show a “plateauing” of rates, but he added, "we are seeing leakage into the over-50s in terms of infections, and it’s generally the over-50s who end up with severe infection and hospitalization.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-new-covid-measures-in-uk-even-as-pm-johnson-says-health-services-under-strain-101641232306165.html
03-01-2022||World||Fire reignites at South Africa's Parliament in Cape Town||The fire that has already destroyed South Africa's main Parliament chamber flared up again Monday about 36 hours after it started in the 130-year-old complex of historic buildings, authorities said.Firefighters have been sent back to the Parliament precinct in the center of Cape Town after flames re-appeared on the roof of the main Parliament building in the late afternoon. More than 30 firefighters were battling the fire again, Cape Town Fire and Rescue Service spokesman Jermaine Carelse told the News 24 website.Before the blaze reignited, authorities had said it had been contained and had begun to assess the damage. The fire had started around 6 a.m. on Sunday morning.Still a mystery is the role of a man who has been arrested and is being questioned by police in connection with the fire. The man is due to appear in court on Tuesday and authorities weren't commenting further on his involvement or any possible motives, other than to say he would likely be charged with breaking and entering, theft and arson.The man is also facing charges under South Africa's National Key Points Act, a security law that restricts access to government buildings and other places of national importance.The man, who has not been named, was arrested Sunday at the scene, authorities said. South African media reported he had to be rescued from the fire, while questions have been raised over if there was a deliberate attack on the seat of South Africa's democracy.Parliament was closed for the holidays and no injuries have been reported in the fire.Extensive damage has been done to the stately white and red brick buildings in the Parliament precinct. The fire had already burned down the chamber in the National Assembly building where South African legislators meet to pass laws, Parliament said in a statement.“We are indeed devastated,” Parliament said.“We stand in front of a broken Parliament, a burnt down Parliament,” lawmaker Natasha Mazzone said at the gates of the complex before the fire reignited. “Look at our roof, our beautiful roof, burnt, collapsed.”“The National Assembly chamber is completely destroyed. I’ve seen it for myself. Everything is destroyed. This will take an operation second to none to rebuild," she said.Two other buildings had also been badly damaged in the inferno, Parliament said, including the original Parliament building that had been built in the 1880s and had weathered much of South Africa's tumultuous history, including British colonialism and the apartheid regime.The South African Parliament moved to the New Assembly building, built in the style of the old building, in the 1980s and it had been the seat of the national legislature for the momentous end of apartheid and the country's transition to democracy under the presidency of Nelson Mandela.Firefighters had been working on “hotspots” in the National Assembly building on Monday morning, Carelse said, but it was largely contained at that stage and the fire crews had been scaled back.As the fire was originally brought under control, what was left was blackened, unrecognizable ruins inside some of the rooms.“This is an incredibly sad day if you are a normal human being, to stand in front of this building and realize what we’ve lost,” lawmaker Mazzone said.Patricia de Lille, the Minister of Public Works and Infrastructure, said that someone had turned off a valve which prevented a fire sprinkler system from functioning.She said the investigation into the cause of the fire has been taken over by the Hawks, a South African police unit that deals with serious and high-profile crimes. An initial report on the fire from a special fire investigating team would be completed by Friday, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fire-reignites-at-south-africa-s-parliament-in-cape-town-101641231445397.html
03-01-2022||World||US, allies will ‘respond decisively’ to Russian invasion: Joe Biden to Ukraine||US President Joe Biden assured Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a phone call on Sunday that the United States and its allies will “respond decisively” if Russia invades Ukraine any further.The stern warning for Moscow came just days after Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin exchanged warnings over Ukraine. Biden told Putin in a video call the US and allies will inflict “serious costs and consequences” and Putin warned of a “complete rupture” in ties.“President Biden made clear that the United States and its allies and partners will respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine,” the White House said in a readout of Biden’s call with Zelenskyy.Biden underscored the commitment of the United States and its allies and partners to the principle of “nothing about you without you” and “reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.In a Tweet, Zelenskyy praised the “unwavering support” that Ukraine has received from the US.President Biden has called for Russia and Ukraine to resolve their differences through established diplomatic channels and has sought to keep open his channels of communications with Putin while making it clear to him that America and its allies will respond with unprecedented sanctions that will potentially cripple the Russia economy.“We made it clear to President Putin that if he makes any more moves and goes into Ukraine, we will have severe sanctions. We will increase our presence in Europe with our Nato allies and it will be a heavy price to pay for it,” Biden told reporters in a day after the call on New Year’s eve.The United States and its western allies have watched with alarm Russia amass more than 100,000 troops along the border with Ukraine raising fears of an imminent attack. The build-up appears to be a repeat of a similar deployment preceding the 2014 invasion when Russia annexed Crime from Ukraine.The Russia lead is seeking guarantees that Ukraine will not be inducted - or joins - Nato, which will bring alliance troops right up the Russian border.The Ukrainian Parliament adopted legislation in June 2017 reinstating membership in Nato as a strategic foreign and security policy objective. In 2019, a corresponding amendment in its Constitution went into force.And in September 2020, President Zelenskyy approved Ukraine’s new National Security Strategy, which provides for the development of the distinctive partnership with Nato with the aim of membership in the alliance.American and Russian officials will hold talks in Geneva, Switzerland on January 10 - which will not be attended by Biden and Putin - and a meeting between Russia and Nato is scheduled for January 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-allies-will-respond-decisively-to-russian-invasion-joe-biden-to-ukraine-101641231691910.html

And on Saturday there were more than 2,700 US flights cancelled and more than 4,700 worldwide.A winter storm is expected to bring as much as 10 inches (25 centimeters) of snow for the District of Columbia, northern Virginia and central Maryland through Monday afternoon.The cancellations, coupled with more than 5,000 flight delays on Monday, just add to the despair felt over the weekend by holidays travelers trying to get home.“It was absolute mayhem,” said Natasha Enos, who spent a sleepless Saturday night and Sunday morning at Denver International Airport during what was supposed to be a short layover on a cross-country trip from Washington to San Francisco.Saturday’s single-day US toll of grounded flights was the highest since just before Christmas, when airlines began blaming staffing shortages on increasing Covid-19 infections among crews.A winter storm that hit the Midwest on Saturday made Chicago the worst place in the country for travelers throughout the weekend. About a quarter of all flights at O’Hare Airport were canceled Sunday.Denver’s airport also faced significant disruptions. Enos, who was flying on Frontier Airlines, didn’t learn that her connecting flight home to California was canceled until she had already landed in Denver. Then it was a rush to find alternative flights and navigate through baggage claims packed with stranded and confused travelers, amid concerns about the spread of the highly transmissible omicron variant of Covid-19.“It was a lot of people in a very small space and not everybody was masking,” said the 28-year-old financial analyst. “There were a lot of exhausted kids and some families were so stressed out.”In Michigan, the authority that runs Detroit International Airport said crews were working around the clock to remove snow and maintain the airfield. Atlanta’s airport authority advised travelers to arrive earlier than usual because of high passenger volume, potential weather issues and pandemic-fueled staffing shortages that could lengthen the time it takes to get through security gates.And thousands of miles from the closest snow storms, Hawaiian Airlines said it had to cancel several flights between islands and across the Pacific due to staffing shortages.Southwest Airlines said it was working to help customers affected by about 400 flights canceled around the country Sunday, about 11% of its schedule. The Dallas-based airline anticipates even more operational challenges to come as the storm system pushes into the Eastern seaboard.Delta Air Lines said Sunday it was issuing a travel waiver for planned flights this week out of mid-Atlantic airports in Baltimore and Washington in preparation for forecasted winter weather.American Airlines said most of Sunday’s canceled flights had been canceled ahead of time to avoid last-minute disruptions at the airport.SkyWest, a regional carrier that operates flights under the names American Eagle, Delta Connection and United Express, grounded more than 500 flights Sunday, about 20% of its schedule, according to FlightAware.Airlines have said they are taking steps to reduce cancellations caused by workers affected by the pandemic. United is offering to pay pilots triple or more of their usual wages for picking up open flights through most of January. Spirit Airlines reached a deal with the Association of Flight Attendants for double pay for cabin crews through Tuesday, a union spokesperson said.Airlines hope that extra pay and reduced schedules get them through the holiday crush and into the heart of January, when travel demand usually drops off. The seasonal decline could be sharper than normal this year because most business travelers are still grounded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-winter-storm-delay-thousands-of-flights-on-first-working-day-of-2022-101641220189566.html

They would continue bilateral and multilateral approaches to nuclear arms control, it said.The statement comes amid increased geopolitical tensions between Moscow and Western nations over concerns about Russia's military build-up near neighbouring Ukraine. Moscow says it can move its army around its own territory as it deems necessary.Last Thursday US President Joe Biden told his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin that a possible move on Ukraine will draw sanctions and an increased US presence in Europe, where tensions are high after Russia's military buildup at the border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-russia-britain-us-and-france-say-no-one-can-win-nuclear-war-101641220100664.html

03-01-2022||World||Sudan's PM announces resignation amid political deadlock||Sudan's Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok announced his resignation Sunday amid a political deadlock and widespread pro-democracy protests following a military coup that derailed the country's fragile transition to democratic rule.Hamdok, a former UN official seen as the civilian face of Sudan's transitional government, had been reinstated as prime minister in November as part of an agreement with the military following the October coup. In that time he had failed to name a Cabinet and his resignation throws Sudan into political uncertainty amid uphill security and economic challenges.In a televised national address Sunday, Hamdok called for a dialogue to agree on a “national charter” and to “draw a roadmap” to complete the transition to democracy in accordance with the 2019 constitutional document governing the transitional period.“I decided to return the responsibility and declare my resignation as prime minister," he said, adding that his stepping down would allow a chance for another person to lead the nation and complete its transition to a “civilian, democratic country.” He did not name a successor.The prime minister said his efforts to bridge the widening gap and settle disputes among the political forces have failed.He warned that the ongoing political stalemate since the military takeover could become a full-blown crisis and damage the country's already battered economy.“I tried as much as I possibly could to prevent our country from sliding into a disaster. Now, our nation is going through a dangerous turning point that could threaten its survival unless it is urgently rectified,” he said.The October coup had upended Sudan's plans to move to democracy after a popular uprising forced the military's overthrow of longtime autocrat Omar al-Bashir and his Islamist government in April 2019.Four months after al-Bashir's ouster, the generals and the protesters reached a power-sharing deal to rule the country through elections in 2023. However, military-civilian ties have been frayed by the military takeover that has threatened to return Sudan to international isolation.Hamdok's resignation comes amid a heavy security crackdown on protesters denouncing not only the takeover but the subsequent deal that reinstated him and sidelined the pro-democracy movement. He was returned to office in November amid international pressure in a deal that calls for an independent technocratic Cabinet under military oversight led by him.“I have had the honour of serving my country people for more than two years. And during his period I have sometimes done well, and I have sometimes failed,” Hamdok said.The Forces for the Declaration of Freedom and Change, an umbrella group of Sudanese political parties and pro-democracy organizations, has rejected the November deal and sa remains committed to ending military rule. The alliance accused Hamdok of allowing the military to dominate the government and continued to organize anti-coup street protests which were met with a heavy crackdown.Over the past two weeks, there was increasing speculation that he would step down. National and international efforts have failed to convince him to stay in office.The US State Department urged on Twitter Sudan's leaders to “set aside differences, find consensus, and ensure continued civilian rule” following Hamdok's resignation.It also called for the appointment of the next premier and Cabinet to “be in line with the (2019) constitutional declaration to meet the people's goals of freedom, peace, and justice.”Hours before Hamdok's resignation speech, Sudanese security forces violently dispersed pro-democracy protesters, killing at least three people, according to the Sudan Doctors Committee, which is part of the pro-democracy movement. The group said dozens of protesters were injured.The protests came despite tightened security and blocked bridges and roads in Khartoum and Omdurman. Internet connections were also disrupted ahead of the protests, according to advocacy group NetBlocs. Authorities have used such tactics repeatedly since the October 25 coup.Sunday's fatalities have brought the death toll among protesters since the coup to at least 57, according to the medical group. Hundreds have also been wounded.Allegations surfaced last month of sexual violence, including rape and gang rape by security forces against female protesters, according to the United Nations.The ruling sovereign council has vowed to investigate violence against the protesters.On Saturday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged security forces to “immediately cease the use of deadly force against protesters" and to hold those responsible for the violence accountable.“We do not want to return to the past, and are prepared to respond to those who seek to block the aspirations of the Sudanese people for a civilian-led, democratic government,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sudans-pm-announces-resignation-amid-political-deadlock-101641202047883.html
03-01-2022||World||Hong Kong news site shuts as pro-Beijing lawmakers sworn in||Hong Kong welcomed a new batch of pro-Beijing lawmakers in its Legislative Council on Monday who were chosen in an election without opposition candidates, as the editors of one of the city's last remaining pro-democracy news outlets announced its closure.They are the latest in a series of events in the past year in which the local government has been reshaping Hong Kong, with Beijing's backing, in an effort to stamp out dissent in a city once renowned for its freedoms of expression.The founders of news outlet Citizen News said Monday that although they have not been contacted by the Hong Kong national security police, the deteriorating media freedoms in the financial hub make it unclear whether their reporting violates the law. They said the news site will stop publishing on Tuesday.“We all love this place, deeply. Regrettably, what was ahead of us is not just pouring rains or blowing winds, but hurricanes and tsunamis,” Citizen News said in a statement on Sunday, when it originally announced the closure.Citizen News is the third news outlet to close in recent months, following pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily and online site Stand News.The outlet was founded in 2017 by a group of veteran journalists. While small, it focused on political news and analysis pieces, as well as investigations.The space for doing those types of stories has shrunk since China's central legislature imposed a sweeping National Security Law in Hong Kong in 2019 following massive anti-government protests. As authorities stepped up arrests of political activists, civil rights groups and unions disbanded, and some activists fled.Independent media have been one of the more prominent casualties of the ongoing crackdown.“What we understood about press freedom has changed a lot,” said Chris Yeung, founder and chief writer at Citizen News. “What's the line between, say, freedom and what the government has always emphasized responsibilities or obligations like upholding national security, public order, etc.”Yeung said at a news conference on Monday that the trigger for their decision to shut down was what happened to Stand News. Last week, authorities raided Stand News and arrested seven people — including editors and former board members — for allegedly conspiring to publish seditious material. Stand News announced on the same day that it would cease to operate.Two of Stand News' former editors who were arrested were later formally charged with sedition.In the summer, authorities forced the closure of Apple Daily, the newspaper owned by media tycoon and democracy activist Jimmy Lai. Lai is currently in jail and was newly charged with sedition last week.The U.S. and other Western governments have condemned the limits on media and civil freedoms that Beijing promised to uphold for 50 years following Hong Kong's 1997 handover from Britain.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam last week defended the raid on Stand News, telling reporters that “inciting other people ... could not be condoned under the guise of news reporting.”The only remaining pro-democracy news media in the city are Hong Kong Free Press, an English-language news outlet, and Initium, a Chinese-language news outlet which moved its headquarters to Singapore in August, but still has staff in the city.Citizen News likened itself to a small dinghy in rough waters.“At the center of a brewing storm, we found (ourselves) in a critical situation. In the face of a crisis, we must ensure the safety and well-being of everyone who are on board," it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-news-site-shuts-as-pro-beijing-lawmakers-sworn-in-101641200823067.html

The island also has French-made Mirage jets and its own indigenous warplane.A fourth-generation multi-role fighter, the F-16V boasts more advanced radar systems as well as more sophisticated weaponry, navigation and electronic warfare systems.It is however less advanced than fifth-generation fighters like China's J-20, Russia's Su-57 as well as the US-made F-22 and F-35 warplanes.Taiwan is in the middle of upgrading 141 older F-16s to make them the V version and has also ordered 66 new F-16Vs.The deployment of the first squadron comes at a time of soaring tensions between Beijing and Washington over Taiwan's fate.The self-ruled democracy of 23 million is claimed by Beijing which has vowed to one day take the island, by force if needs.The ceremony prompted a fiery response from Beijing at a press briefing, with an official saying "China opposes any official contact between the US and Taiwan".Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian urged the United States not to send "wrong signals to separatist forces", adding that those supporting Taiwan's independence "have spared no effort to split the motherland and collude with foreign forces"."Their actions are akin to throwing an egg against a rock," he said.Chinese sabre-rattling has reached new heights under President Xi Jinping with Beijing sending record numbers of warplanes routinely crossing into Taiwan's air defence zone and state media regularly publicising invasion drills.In the last decade, China has built up its military to the point where Taiwanese and US military officials have publicly voiced fears it could soon pull off an invasion.Washington diplomatically recognises Beijing over Taiwan.But it opposes any attempt to change Taiwan's status by force and is bound by an act of Congress to help the island maintain its own defences.The F-16V deal was approved by the administration of Donald Trump as he feuded with China on a host of issues but his successor Joe Biden has maintained similar support for Taipei.Maintaining Taiwan's defences has become a rare bipartisan issue in Washington.China has lambasted military sales to Taiwan and imposed sanctions on US arms giants such as Boeing, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin in response.jta-bys/axnBOEINGLOCKHEED MARTINRAYTHEON||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-deploys-first-advanced-f-16v-fighter-squadron-101637241886532.html
03-01-2022||World||Jerusalem Post hacked on Iran general Qassem Soleimani's killing anniversary||Hackers targeted the website of an Israeli newspaper on Monday, the anniversary of the 2020 killing of a top Iranian general, replacing its content with an image threatening a site associated with Israel's undeclared nuclear weapons program.No group immediately claimed responsibility for the hacking. The image posted on the Jerusalem Post's website depicts a missile coming down from a fist bearing a ring long associated with Qassem Soleimani, the Iranian general killed by a U.S. drone strike in Iraq two years ago.Also Monday, a Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen accused the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels there of seizing an Emirati-flagged vessel off the port of Hodeida in the Red Sea. The rebels did not immediately acknowledge the incident.Also Monday, a group overseen by the British military said it had reports of a possible attack on a ship off the coast of Yemen in the Red Sea, a crucial route for international trade. Yemen remains mired in a yearslong war pitting Iranian-backed rebels against a Saudi-led coalition.The image posted in the hack depicts an exploding target from a recent Iranian military drill designed to look like the Shimon Peres Negev Nuclear Research Center near the city of Dimona. The facility is already home to decades-old underground laboratories that reprocess the reactor’s spent rods to obtain weapons-grade plutonium for Israel’s nuclear bomb program.Under its policy of nuclear ambiguity, Israel neither confirms nor denies having atomic weapons.In a tweet, the Jerusalem Post acknowledged being the target of hackers.“We are aware of the apparent hacking of our website, alongside a direct threat to Israel,” the English-language newspaper wrote. “We are working to resolve the issue & thank readers for your patience and understanding.”The newspaper later restored its website. It noted Iran-supporting hackers previously targeted its homepage in 2020 “with an illustration of Tel Aviv burning as then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu swam" with a life preserver.There was no immediate response from the Israeli government. The hack comes after Israel’s former military intelligence chief in late December publicly acknowledged his country was involved in Soleimani's killing.Iran also did not immediately acknowledge the hack. However, the country has in recent days stepped up its commemorations of the slain Revolutionary Guard general. Memorial services were scheduled to be held Monday marking his death.Meanwhile, the British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations said it had received reports of an attack on a ship, giving its location as off the coast of Yemen, near the contested port city of Hodeida. The British military did not elaborate.The coordinates it offered corresponded to the Emirati-flagged landing craft Rwabee, which hadn't given its location via satellite-tracking data for hours, according to the website MarineTraffic.com.A statement from the Saudi-led coalition, carried by state media in the kingdom, later acknowledged the attack, saying the Houthis had committed an act of “armed piracy” involving the vessel. The coalition asserted the ship carried medical equipment from a dismantled Saudi field hospital in the distant island of Socotra, without offering evidence.“The Houthi militia must immediately release the ship, otherwise the coalition forces shall take all necessary measures and procedures to deal with this violation, including the use of force,” Brig. Gen. Turki al-Malki said in a statement.A similar incident happened in 2016 involving the Emirati vessel SWIFT-1, which had been sailing back and forth in the Red Sea between an Emirati troop base in Eritrea and Yemen. The vessel came under attack by Houthi forces in 2016. The Emirati government asserted the SWIFT-1 had carried humanitarian aid; U.N. experts later said of the claim that they were “unconvinced of its veracity.”An employee at the vessel's owners, Abu Dhabi-based Liwa Marine Services, told The Associated Press that the Rwabee appeared to have been the target but said they had no other information and declined to comment further. The employee did not give her name and hung up.As the head of the Quds, or Jerusalem, Force of the Revolutionary Guard, Soleimani led all of its expeditionary forces and frequently shuttled between Iraq, Lebanon and Syria. Quds Force members have deployed into Syria’s long war to support President Bashar Assad, as well as into Iraq in the wake of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein, a longtime foe of Tehran.Soleimani rose to prominence by advising forces fighting the Islamic State group in Iraq and in Syria on behalf of the embattled Assad.U.S. officials say the Guard under Soleimani taught Iraqi militants how to manufacture and use especially deadly roadside bombs against U.S. troops after the invasion of Iraq. Iran has denied that. Many Iranians to this day see Soleimani as a hero who fought Iran’s enemies abroad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jerusalem-post-hacked-on-iran-general-qassem-soleimani-s-killing-anniversary-101641199354653.html

Children over the age of 12 are being offered vaccinations at their schools.The first case of the Omicron variant was reported on Dec. 13 in Karachi and a total of 75 cases were confirmed up to Dec. 27, according to National Institute of Health (NIH).Twelve of the cases were linked to international travel, it said.The provincial government of Sindh, of which Karachi is capital, is working on a strategy to contain the variant, which has included a partial lockdown of a Karachi neighbourhood last week after about a dozen Omicron cases were detected in a family.

03-01-2022||World||Sudan PM resigns as deadly crackdown on protesters goes on: Report||Sudan's civilian Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok resigned Sunday, more than two months after a coup and following another deadly crackdown on protesters, with the military now firmly in control.Sudan had been undergoing a fragile journey toward civilian rule since the 2019 ouster of autocrat Omar al-Bashir, but was plunged into turmoil when military leader General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan launched his coup on October 25 and detained Hamdok.Hamdok was reinstated on November 21 under a deal promising elections for mid-2023, but local media had recently reported he had been absent from his office for days, with rumours swirling over his possible resignation."I have tried my best to stop the country from sliding towards disaster," Hamdok said Sunday evening, addressing the nation on state television.Sudan "is crossing a dangerous turning point that threatens its whole survival," he said.Hamdok was the civilian face of the country's fragile transition, while Burhan has been the country's de facto leader following Bashir's ouster.Hamdok cited "the fragmentation of the political forces and conflicts between the (military and civilian) components of the transition" and said that "despite everything that has been done to reach a consensus... it has not happened".Mass protests against the coup have continued even after Hamdok was reinstated, as demonstrators have distrusted veteran general Burhan and his promise to guide the country toward full democracy.Protesters have also charged that the deal to reinstate Hamdok simply aimed to give a cloak of legitimacy to the generals, whom they accuse of trying to continue the regime built by Bashir.- 'No to military rule' -Thousands of demonstrators on Sunday braved tear gas, a heavy troop deployment and a telecommunications blackout to demand a civilian government.They lambasted the coup, shouting "power to the people" and demanding the military return to the barracks, at protests near the presidential palace in the capital Khartoum and in its twin city Omdurman.The pro-democracy Doctors' Committee said security forces killed three protesters, including one who was shot in the chest and another who suffered a "severe head wound".As with previous demonstrations, which have become regular since the coup, the authorities had erected roadblocks, with shipping containers blocking Nile River bridges between the capital and outlying areas.But thousands still came out to demonstrate "in memory of the martyrs", with at least 57 protesters now killed since the coup, according to pro-democracy medics.Young men on motorcycles were seen ferrying wounded protesters to hospitals as security forces blocked ambulances from reaching them.Web monitoring group NetBlocks said mobile internet services were cut from mid-morning ahead of the protests, the first of the year. They were restored in the evening.Activists use the internet for organising demonstrations and broadcasting live footage of the rallies.Protests since the army's takeover have been repeatedly broken up by security forces firing rounds of tear gas, as well as charges by police wielding batons.- 'Year of resistance' -Sudan has a long history of military takeovers, but Burhan has insisted the armed forces' move "was not a coup" but a push to "rectify the course of the transition".On Friday an official advisor warned that the demonstrations are "a waste of energy and time" which will not produce "any political solution".Activists have said on social media that 2022 will be "the year of the continuation of the resistance".They demand justice for those killed since the coup as well as the more than 250 who died during the months of mass protests that paved the way for the toppling of Bashir.Activists have also condemned sexual attacks during December 19 protests, in which the UN said at least 13 women and girls were victims of rape or gang-rape.The European Union and the United States issued a joint statement condemning the use of sexual violence "as a weapon to drive women away from demonstrations and silence their voices".On Saturday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned that Washington was "prepared to respond to those who seek to block the aspirations of the Sudanese people for a civilian-led, democratic government and who would stand in the way of accountability, justice, and peace".Over 14 million people, one in three Sudanese, will need humanitarian aid during the coming year, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs -- the highest level for a decade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sudan-pm-resigns-as-deadly-crackdown-on-protesters-goes-on-report-101641196285990.html
03-01-2022||World||Australian PM Morrison says ‘well equipped’ to tackle Covid amid surge in cases||Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Monday said his country's health system can cope with the new wave of coronavirus infections as Victoria state reported a record number of new cases and hospitalizations surged in New South Wales.Morrison spoke in two television interviews before Monday's figures were released.Victoria reported 8,577 new cases, a record for the state which eclipsed the previous peak of 7,442 on New Year's Day.New South Wales, Australia's most populous state, saw a slight decline in case of numbers from a record 22,577 on Saturday to 20,794 on Monday. But the number of people in hospitals rose to 1,204 from 1,066 the day before. There were 95 people in intensive care, a rise of 12 on the previous day.Speaking with the Seven Network, Prime Minister Morrison said Australia's health system is well equipped to deal with the surge in case numbers caused by the spread of the omicron variant.“It's important that with the rising case numbers, we see that the severeness of this illness is already being shown to be around 75 per cent less than what we saw with delta,” Morrison said. “Rising case numbers is part of the omicron period, it's part of the new phase of the pandemic we're in.”“That doesn't mean to say it can't put pressure on the hospital system. It can and that's why we're working very closely with the (state) premiers and chief ministers to make sure those resources are there," Morrison added.Morrison said the federal government would take steps to ensure hospitals had the resources they need to cope with rising admissions. His government last week changed the definition of “close contact” to ensure health workers who might have been exposed to an active case do not have to isolate and can return to work.“We're looking to make further changes on that this week to get more staff back into our hospitals and deal with the need,” Morrison told 9 News.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-pm-morrison-says-well-equipped-to-tackle-covid-amid-surge-in-cases-101641186642291.html

I requested the test today after exhibiting symptoms while at home on leave," Austin said, adding that his "symptoms are mild" and he is following his physician's directions."In keeping with those directions, and in accordance with CDC guidelines, I will quarantine myself at home for the next five days," he added.The Pentagon chief said that he is going to attend upcoming key meetings virtually."Stemming the spread of this virus, safeguarding our workforce and ensuring my own speedy and safe recovery remain my priorities. To the degree possible, I plan to attend virtually this coming week those key meetings and discussions required to inform my situational awareness and decision making. I will retain all authorities. Deputy Secretary Hicks will represent me as appropriate in other matters," the statement read.He specified that the last time he met with US President Joe Biden was on December 21 and the last time he visited the Pentagon was on Thursday."My last meeting with President Biden occurred on Tuesday, December 21st, more than a week before I began to experience symptoms. I tested negative that very morning. I have not been in the Pentagon since Thursday, where I met briefly - and only - with a few members of my staff. We were properly masked and socially distanced throughout," Austin said in the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-defense-secretary-lloyd-austin-tests-positive-for-covid-19-symptoms-mild-101641185048509.html
03-01-2022||World||South Korea's president Moon Jae-in promises final push for North Korea peace||South Korean president Moon Jae-in vowed on Monday to use his last months in office to press for a diplomatic breakthrough with North Korea, despite public silence from Pyongyang over his attempts for a declaration of peace between the two sides.“The government will pursue normalisation of inter-Korean relations and an irreversible path to peace until the end,” Moon said in his final New Year's address before his five-year term ends in May. “I hope efforts for dialogue will continue in the next administration too.”In his own address on New Year's Eve, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made no mention of Moon's calls for a declaration officially ending the 1950-1953 Korean War, or of stalled denuclearisation talks with the United States.Moon held multiple summits with Kim, including once in Pyongyang, during a flurry of negotiations in 2018 and 2019, before talks stalled amid disagreements over international demands that the North surrender its arsenal of nuclear weapons, and Pyongyang's call for Washington and Seoul to ease sanctions and drop other “hostile policies.”Moon is pushing an “end of war declaration” as a way to jumpstart those stalled negotiations and his administration has hinted at backchannel discussions.But North Korea has not publicly responded to the latest push, and the United States has said it supports the idea but may disagree with the South over its timing.“It is true that there is still a long way to go,” Moon acknowledged but argued that if inter-Korean relations improve, the international community will follow.Moon said his outreach to North Korea had been enabled by a large military buildup that helped make South Korea safer.“Peace is possible on strong security,” he said.The Covid-19 pandemic overshadowed the standoff with North Korea, as Pyongyang put the country into an unprecedented lockdown and Moon faced domestic pressure to tamp down the first major coronavirus outbreak outside of China in early 2020.Since then, South Korea used aggressive tracking and tracing, as well as social distancing rules and a belated but thorough vaccination campaign to keep overall cases and deaths relatively low by global standards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-s-president-moon-jae-in-promises-final-push-for-north-korea-peace-101641184883215.html

He gave the message in his New Year address, as the world entered in its third year of the pandemic.Latest updates: Curbs return, cases surge as world copes with Omicron in 2022"While no country is out of the woods from the pandemic, we have many new tools to prevent and treat COVID-19. The longer inequity continues, the higher the risks of this virus evolving in ways we can't prevent or predict. If we end inequity, we end the pandemic," he said.Highlighting that Covid-19 is not the only health threat the world's people will face next year, Tedros said that millions of people have missed out on routine vaccination, services for family planning, treatment for communicable and non-communicable diseases.He further stated that to help prepare the world for future epidemics and pandemics, “we established the new WHO BioHub System for countries to share novel biological materials”.All the countries must focus on vaccinating more and more of their populations, added the WHO chief. "We need all countries to work together to reach the global target of vaccinating 70 per cent of people in all countries by the middle of 2022," said Tedros.A new variant of coronavirus, named Omicron, recently emerged in South Africa and has been causing a surge in Covid-19 infection across the world. It has already been classified as a ‘variant of concern’ by the WHO.A few days ago, Tedros had said at a media briefing that "2022 must be the year we end the pandemic".The remarks were made after the WHO gave emergency use authorisation to ninth vaccine produced by Serum Institute of India (SII) under license from Novavax. The WHO chief said that the new vaccine is part of the COVAX portfolio, and hoped that it will play an important role in achieving global vaccination targets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-will-end-in-2022-if-who-chief-lists-one-condition-101641180781852.html
03-01-2022||World||‘A hero’: Hockey fan spots cancerous mole during NHL game, saves staffer's life||In an intriguing development from North America, a hockey fan ended up saving the life of a team staffer after happening to spot a cancerous mole on the latter's neck. Describing the fan as “a hero”, Brian Hamilton – the assistant equipment manager for the Vancouver Canucks ice hockey team – expressed his gratitude and noted how one message had changed his entire life and saved him from near-certain death a few years down the line.Vancouver Canucks, a professional ice hockey team based in Canada, was competing in a National Hockey League (NHL) game against the Seattle Kraken on October 23 when Nadia Popovici, a fan sitting close to a team bench, spotted a small mole on the back of Hamilton's neck.The mole, measuring “about two centimeters and was irregularly shaped and red-brown in color”, would probably have gone unnoticed had it been anyone else, but on that day it did come across Popovici, a future medical student volunteering at hospitals as a nursing assistant and trained to spot such potentially cancerous moles.The 22-year-old Popovici told her parents “I need to tell him” and, in a brief second, typed a message on her phone – "The mole on the back of your neck is possibly cancerous. Please go see a doctor!”She patiently waited for the game to end, waved several times to draw Hamilton's attention, and finally placed her phone against the plexiglass for the Nucks staffer to read her text, which had the words “mole,” “cancer” and “doctor” colored in bright red.“Well, that's weird,” Hamilton remembered saying to himself after he saw the message, according to recollections later narrated to The New York Times. However, he didn't entirely dismiss the text, later going home and consulting his partner if the mole was indeed there.It only took a subsequent biopsy result to confirm that the fan sitting behind the team’s bench had been right and that she indeed just saved his life.In a press conference this Saturday, Hamilton broke down in gratitude for the young fan. “She took me out of a slow fire,” he said. “And the words out of the doctor’s mouth were if I ignored that for four to five years, I wouldn’t be here.”The mole, according to Hamilton's physicians, was a type-2 malignant melanoma, a form of skin cancer that can be removed and treated safely once detected early, but also has the potential to turn fatal if left unchecked.Hamilton later sought out his “hero”, the 22-year-old Popovici, and met her in person. The young fan, too, acknowledged the rare happenstance and said that she will “just cherish” the entire experience.In the meanwhile, both Vancouver Canucks and the Seattle Kraken have decided to present Popovici with a combined scholarship of $10,000 for her medical school expenses in acceptance of the miraculous, lifesaving diagnosis during the match.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-hero-hockey-fan-spots-cancerous-mole-during-nhl-game-saves-staffer-s-life-101641177495723.html

Contingency plans are already in place in the United Kingdom to prepare for a scenario where the Omicron variant leads to alarming staff shortages in hospitals and schools.

03-01-2022||World||Israel PM warns of coming Covid-19 ‘storm’||Israel’s prime minister is warning that the country will soon see tens of thousands of new coronavirus cases a day.Prime Minister Naftali Bennett spoke at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting in Jerusalem. He said that despite rolling out more than 4.2 million coronavirus booster shots to the country’s population of 9.3 million since July, “the storm is coming to us these very days”.Daily cases in Israel have risen in the past two weeks from around 700 to the more than 4,000 reported on Sunday.“These are numbers that the world has not known, and that we also haven’t known,” Bennett said. He said that the government’s aim is “to allow the economy to function as much as possible, while protecting the most vulnerable among us.”Israel has recorded at least 8,244 deaths from coronavirus since the start of the pandemic.A surge of Omicron infections could see Israel reaching herd immunity, the country’s top health official said on Sunday.Until late December, Israel managed to stave off Omicron to some degree but with infection rates now gaining pace, daily cases are expected to reach record highs in the coming three weeks. This could result in herd immunity, said director-general of the health ministry, Nachman Ash. “The cost will be a great many infections,” Ash told 103FM Radio.“The numbers will have to be very high in order to reach herd immunity. This is possible but we don’t want to reach it by means of infections, we want it to happen as a result of many people vaccinating,” he said.Meanwhile, secondary school students in England will be required to wear face masks when they return to classes after the Christmas holidays.Education secretary Nadhim Zahawi said on Sunday the move was an attempt to “minimise disruption” in schools as Omicron variant drives infections in the UK to record levels. Students and teachers are set to return to classrooms on Tuesday after more than two weeks off.The government has urged schools and other public sector workplaces to be prepared for staff absences as Covid sickens more people or forces them to isolate.Two-thirds of the 25 workers at a scientific outpost in Antarctica have contracted Covid-19, the BBC reported. The cases are so far mild, and the infected have opted not to leave the Princess Elisabeth Polar Station.“While it has been an inconvenience to have to quarantine certain members of the staff who caught the virus, it hasn’t significantly affected our work,” Joseph Cheek, a project manager for Belgium-led outpost, told the BBC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-pm-warns-of-coming-covid-19-storm-101641171529131.html
03-01-2022||World||A year after Capitol riot, Americans fear for their democracy: Polls||One year after the violent assault on the US Capitol, Americans remain deeply concerned about the health of their democracy and about a third say violence against the government can sometimes be justified, according to two polls published Sunday.The January 6 attack on the seat of Congress, led by supporters of Donald Trump, was "a harbinger of increasing political violence," and American democracy "is threatened," according to two-thirds of those surveyed for a CBS News poll.Meantime, Americans' "pride" in their democracy has dropped sharply, from 90 percent in 2002 to 54 percent now, a Washington Post/University of Maryland survey found.With the January 6 anniversary nearing, the polls offer specific causes for concern: CBS found that 28 percent of respondents believe force can be used to defend the result of an election, while 34 percent told The Washington Post that violent action against the government can sometimes be justified -- the largest percentage in decades.The results underscore the seemingly almost irreconcilable views dividing American society, which President Joe Biden -- who took office 14 days after the Capitol rioting -- has promised to overcome.Two-thirds of Trump supporters continue to believe his baseless charge that Biden is not the legitimately elected president.Trump had addressed thousands of supporters shortly before the Capitol assault, telling them the election had been "rigged" and that they should "fight like hell."Some 60 percent of those polled say Trump bears a heavy responsibility for the invasion of the Capitol just as lawmakers were set to certify Biden's victory.'Coordinated effort'There again, opinion follows partisan lines: 83 percent of Trump voters placed his level of responsibility at only "some" or "none," the Post survey found.And 26 percent of Americans want him to run again in 2024, according to CBS.A select committee of the House of Representatives has spent months working to establish the roles and responsibilities of those who incited or may have organized the protest.Despite limited cooperation from Trump's inner circle, the panel has conducted more than 300 interviews and collected thousands of documents."We have uncovered some things that cause us real concern, things like people trying to ... undermine the integrity of our democracy," the panel's chairman, Representative Bennie Thompson, said Sunday on ABC."It appeared to be a coordinated effort on the part of a number of people to undermine the election," he said."It could be people in the executive branch. It could be people in the Department of Defense... and some very wealthy individuals."He said he would not hesitate to refer any evidence of illegality to the Justice Department.Liz Cheney, one of only two Republicans on the panel, on Sunday strongly condemned Trump for waiting hours before urging the Capitol rioters to stand down.He could easily have issued such a call, she told ABC."He failed to do so. It's hard to imagine a more significant and more serious dereliction of duty."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-year-after-capitol-riot-americans-fear-for-their-democracy-polls-101641171657110.html
