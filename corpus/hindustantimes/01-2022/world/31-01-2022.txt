The infrastructure deal is unique in its scope as it goes beyond roads and bridges to include such initiatives as broadband internet, replacement of lead water pipes and resilience against climate change.Administration officials assembled the book quickly as the infrastructure package became law on Nov. 15. Copies are available online at build.gov, though the administration is working with associations and direct contacts to make sure it reaches government officials in communities of all sizes. Landrieu said he has already spoken with 43 governors and more than 250 mayors as part of the push.The infrastructure package includes 375 distinct programs, of which 125 are new. And while the guidebook is more than twice the size of the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel “The Great Gatsby,” it's considerably shorter and easier to navigate than the infrastructure law, which stretched for more than 1,000 pages.About 60% of the funds are available through formula and 40% through competitive applications. Not all the infrastructure money is able to go out as the federal government is operating on a continuing resolution that runs through Feb. 18, instead of an annual budget. Still, not all of the money will go out immediately as the programs are generally operating on a five- to seven-year timeline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prez-joe-biden-issues-an-infrastructure-roadmap-to-help-spend-1-trillion-101643652141171.html
31-01-2022||World||Ukraine: At United Nations, India calls for immediate de-escalation of tensions||In its continued attempt to balance its close strategic ties with both the United States (US) and Russia, India has called for an immediate de-escalation of tensions related to Ukraine.India reiterated its support for a peaceful resolution of the issue for long-term peace and stability, appealed for quiet and constructive diplomacy, supported the ongoing diplomatic talks between various stakeholders (US, European countries, Ukraine and Russia) under various formats, asked all sides to avoid steps that may increase tension, called for the implementation of existing agreements, and prioritised the safety of over 20,000 Indians in Ukraine.India’s permanent representative to the United Nations (UN), T S Tirumurti, articulated New Delhi’s most detailed position on the issue so far, building up on a ministry of external affairs (MEA) statement on Friday, at a meeting of the UN Security Council (UNSC) in New York on Monday. The council witnessed a stormy confrontation between the US and Russia.Earlier, India was among the three countries that abstained from a vote on whether the Council should take up the situation in Ukraine as a possible threat to international peace and security. But with 10 of the 15 members voting in favor of the agenda - only Russia and China opposed it - the UNSC saw a discussion on the geopolitical crisis that has created the most serious rift between the US and Russia in years.The US had requested an open Council meeting, citing the threat posed by what it alleges is Russia’s military build-up along the Ukrainian border. India was joined in its abstention by Kenya and Gabon. Russia subsequently thanked the countries which opposed or abstained from the vote to discuss the proposal.Tirumurti said India had been closely following evolving developments related to Ukraine, including talks between the US and Russia and under the Normandy Format in Paris (the format includes Germany, France, Ukraine and Russia). “India’s interest is in finding a solution that can provide for immediate de-escalation of tensions, taking into account the legitimate security interests of all countries and aimed towards securing long-term peace and stability in the region and beyond.”He reiterated that India believed the issues could only be resolved through diplomatic dialogue. “We welcome the efforts under way, including under the Minsk Agreement and Normandy Format…we also welcome the unconditional observance of the July 2020 ceasefire…we also welcome their agreement to meet in Berlin in two weeks.”The Minsk agreement of 2014 and 2015 outlines steps to end the conflict in Ukraine through a political settlement. Moscow has blamed Kiev for not implementing the agreement, while Kiev has placed the blame on Moscow’s interference and its support for separatists in the eastern region.India “urged all parties to continue to engage through all diplomatic channels and keep working towards the full implementation of the Minsk package”.Tirumurti said that “quiet and constructive diplomacy” was the need of the hour. “Any steps that increase tensions may best be avoided by all sides.”He added that 20,000 Indian nationals, including students, lived in Ukraine, including in its bordering areas, and their safety was India’s priority.The debate at the Council however saw a blame game between the US and Russia on who exactly was escalating tensions.The US permanent representative to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, reiterated America’s allegations that Russia had amassed 100,000 troops along the Ukrainian border; it had sent additional troops to Belarus; it had launched cyber attacks and disinformation campaigns; and its actions show an intent to further invade Ukraine, in what was an attack on the principle of state sovereignty under the UN charter.The Russian permanent representative to the UN, Vassily Alekseevich Nebenzia, argued that Russian troops were in Russian territory; accused the US of making allegations without proof and creating hysteria when there was no threat; cited American claims in the run to the 2003 Iraq war in the Security Council about weapons of mass destruction as evidence of the US’s track record; reiterated the Russian claim that it had no intention of invading Ukraine; and blamed western powers of encouraging Kiev to sabotage the Minsk agreement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ukraine-at-un-india-calls-for-immediate-de-escalation-of-tensions-101643651252134.html

The sanctions also hit the KT Services and Logistics Company, which operates a major port in Myanmar's economic hub of Yangon, and its CEO as well as the procurement department of the country's defense ministry.“The United States will continue to work with our international partners to address human rights abuses and press the regime to cease the violence, release all those unjustly detained, allow unhindered humanitarian access, and restore Burma’s path to democracy,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sanctions-myanmar-judiciary-officials-on-feb-1-coup-anniversary-101643650531032.html

The 2008 Constitution required him to seek the president’s permission at the council’s meeting to formally extend the state of emergency. To mark the one-year anniversary of taking office, Min Aung Hlaing will deliver a public speech at 8 a.m. local time on Tuesday. He’s expected to face a spiraling economy in the second year of his reign, given international pressures.More than 1,500 civilians were killed and nearly 12,000 others were arrested by the junta since the coup, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. The U.S. on Monday issued fresh sanctions against seven people and two entities linked to the junta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-extends-state-of-emergency-as-coup-anniversary-nears-101643647345686.html
31-01-2022||World||‘Time to look ourselves in mirror’: Johnson vows to overhaul top team after ‘partygate’ criticism||Boris Johnson pledged an overhaul of his top team in government after an interim report into rule-breaking parties during lockdown found “failures of leadership and judgment” and criticized “excessive” drinking.“I get it, and I will fix it,” the UK prime minister told parliament on Monday. He apologized “for the things we simply didn’t get right” and said it was time to “look ourselves in the mirror and learn.”London’s Metropolitan Police is investigating 12 gatherings in Downing Street on eight dates, according to the report published by Sue Gray. The outcome of the police probe will prove a moment of extreme danger for Johnson, as many Tory lawmakers are waiting for its findings before deciding whether to topple their leader.Johnson pledged to make changes to the way Downing Street and the Cabinet Office were run, including by creating an “office of the prime minister” with a permanent secretary to lead Number 10.Johnson also vowed to say more in the coming days on “improving the operations of Number 10”, hinting at potential staffing changes. He will address Conservative MPs privately later on Monday.In her 12-page interim report, Gray said some of the gatherings “should not have been allowed to take place” while “other events should not have been allowed to develop as they did.”“Against the backdrop of the pandemic, when the government was asking citizens to accept far-reaching restrictions on their lives, some of the behavior surrounding these gatherings is difficult to justify,” she said in a damning set of conclusions that she described as “general limited findings.”While the probe represents a moment of political peril for the prime minister, Johnson himself escaped direct censure for now. Gray stressed she was unable to provide a “meaningful report” outlining the “extensive factual information I have been able to gather” due to the Metropolitan Police starting their own investigation last week. The police asked Gray last week to make only “minimal reference” to the gatherings they are investigating, thought to be the most damaging allegations. Gray said she had decided not to publish “factual accounts” of the four events she was allowed to report on, as it would affect the overall balance of her findings.Events subject to the police probe include a gathering in the Downing Street garden in May 2020 which Johnson has said he attended, and an event to apparently celebrate the premier’s birthday the following month.The prime minister is trying to draw a line under the steady drip-drip of allegations, dubbed “Partygate” by the U.K. media. They have undermined his leadership in recent months, leading some lawmakers within his own ruling Conservatives to talk openly about ousting the prime minister and causing his party to plunge in the polls.‘Excessive’ DrinkingIn her partial report, Gray said “at least some of the gatherings” represented “a serious failure to observe not just the high standards expected of those working at the heart of government but also of the standards expected of the entire British population at the time.” She said “too little thought” was given to the conditions faced by people across the U.K. under lockdown.There were “failures of leadership and judgment by different parts of Number 10 and the Cabinet Office at different times,” she said.Gray also criticized the “excessive consumption of alcohol” in government buildings, saying steps must be taken to ensure every department has a “clear and robust policy” to cover drinking in the workplace.She said some staff had wanted to raise concerns about behaviors at work “but at times felt unable to do so” and also warned there were too many people working in Johnson’s Downing Street office.“There is significant learning to be drawn from these events which must be addressed immediately across government,” Gray concluded. “This does not need to wait for the police investigations to be concluded.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/-look-ourselves-in-mirror-johnson-vows-to-overhaul-top-team-after-partygate-criticism-101643645193926.html

"I am feeling fine – and I’ll continue to work remotely this week while following public health guidelines," Trudeau wrote on Twitter.This morning, I tested positive for COVID-19. I’m feeling fine – and I’ll continue to work remotely this week while following public health guidelines. Everyone, please get vaccinated and get boosted.The development came amid reports that he was "shifted to a secret location" after a large-scale protest opposing Covid vaccine mandates converged on Parliament Hill.On Saturday, thousands of protesters with trucks converged in the capital city of Ottawa, calling for an end to Covid-19 vaccine mandates and other public health restrictions.The demonstration had started as a protest against a vaccine requirement for cross-border drivers, but developed into a demonstration against the Trudeau government with a strong anti-vaccination streak.Canada has one of the world's highest rates of vaccination against the Covid-19 — shots which are primarily designed to keep those who become infected from falling seriously ill. In January, the leader got his third dose of vaccine as booster shot. Canada has recorded more than 2.9 million cases of Covid-19 and more than 33,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-pm-trudeau-in-hiding-over-vaccine-stir-says-he-s-covid-19-positive-101643641150329.html

31-01-2022||World||In a first, UAE to lift tax-free status, brings new rules on corporate earning||The United Arab Emirates plans to introduce a federal tax on corporate earnings for the first time next year, in its latest step toward dismantling a levy-free regime that helped make it a magnet for businesses from across the world.The government’s set to introduce a 9% federal corporate tax on business profits from June 2023, state-run WAM news agency said Monday. Corporate tax won’t apply on personal income from employment, real estate and other investments, and incentives for free-zone companies that don’t do business with the mainland will continue.“Introducing a CT regime reaffirms the UAE’s commitment to meeting international standards for tax transparency and preventing harmful tax practices,” the UAE ministry of finance said on its website.UAE Faces Risk of Inclusion on Global Watchlist Over Dirty MoneyThe move comes despite rising competition from neighboring Saudi Arabia, which has been offering new incentives to encourage international firms to shift their Middle East headquarters to the kingdom. Amid a gradual introduction of taxes that’s made the UAE a more expensive place to live than it once was, the government took several significant steps during the pandemic to encourage the foreigners who make up most of its population to stay for the long haul. In 2020, the government abolished the need for companies to have Emirati shareholders -- a major shake-up of foreign-ownership laws -- and last year it unveiled plans to offer citizenship to a select group of foreigners.This month, the UAE switched to a Saturday-Sunday weekend to synchronize better with the global economy. It wasn’t immediately clear how the latest measures fit into that broader trend or whether they might prompt some companies to relocate to Saudi Arabia or elsewhere. Saudi Arabia Eyes 7,000 Global Firms as Dubai Rivalry Heats UpEarlier measures had already dented the UAE’s status as a tariff-free haven for both businesses and individuals. The Gulf oil exporter introduced a 5% value-added tax in 2018 and later imposed a 5% customs duty on imports. It already taxes banks and insurance companies operating outside of the country’s vast network of free zones as much as 20% on their profits. The oil and gas sector of OPEC’s third-biggest producer is also taxed under a separate scheme. “This was the logical next step although it came much earlier than many of us had expected,” said David Daly, a partner at Gulf Tax Accounting Group. “There is quite a bit of detail that needs to come out still but for large companies operating in the UAE, corporate taxes were expected and now they know the rate.”  The new rules, and the relatively low tax threshold of 375,000 dirhams ($102,100) in annual profits, will require thousands of companies to pay tax for the first time and will likely hit net incomes, according to Tarek Fadlallah, head of Nomura Asset Management’s Middle East unit. “The introduction of corporate tax will apply from June 2023 so there is an adjustment period for listed companies to prepare,” he said. “But this will necessarily impact net profit forecasts going forward.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-a-first-uae-to-lift-tax-free-status-bring-new-rules-on-corporate-earning-101643634252259.html

I urge you to reject any diplomatic credentials presented to you by Masood Khan and reject any effort by the Government of Pakistan to install this jihadist as Pakistan’s Ambassador to the United States,” the Pennsylvania wrote in the letter.He said the Imran Khan government’s “nomination of a bona fide terrorist sympathiser working to undermine our interests in the region – as well as the security of our Indian allies – can only be described as a breathtaking lack of judgment at best, and a demonstration of Islamabad’s unmitigated contempt for the United States at worst.”Perry said Khan has praised both terrorists and foreign terrorist organisations, including Hizbul Mujahideen. “He has encouraged young men to emulate jihadists like Burhan Wani, a former commander of Hizbul Mujahideen who dedicated his life to a holy war against India.”Khan has also on the United States to free would-be mass murderer Aafia Siddiqui. “In 2010, Siddiqui was convicted of attempting to murder American troops. Since then, jihadists have regularly clamored for her release – to include the perpetrator behind the anti-Semitic hostage crisis in Colleyville, Texas earlier this month,” the letter read.

Security Council Resolutions, but analysts say land-attack cruise missiles can be no less a threat than ballistic missiles.HWASONG-12North Korea first launched the Hwasong-12 IRBM in April 2017, in a test that “pinwheeled” out of control and was considered a failure by U.S. and South Korean officials.Two more test flights that month also ended in apparent failure, with the missiles exploding seconds after launch or breaking up in flight.The first successful flight was in May 2017, and North Korea went on to launch two more Hwasong-12s that year, flying them over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido.In Sunday's test, North Korea said it fired the missile on an elevated trajectory "in consideration of the safety of neighbouring countries."The test "confirmed the accuracy, safety, and operational effectiveness of the produced Hwasong-12 type weapon system," KCNA said. South Korea reported the missile reached an altitude of about 2,000 km (1,243 miles) and flew to a distance of 800 km.The Hwasong-12 has an estimated range of 4,500 km (2,800 miles), which would put the U.S. territory of Guam and the far western tip of Alaska's Aleutian Islands chain within reach, according to the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.It can carry a "large-size heavy nuclear warhead," according to state media, and in 2017 North Korea threatened to use it to target Guam with "enveloping fire."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-hypersonics-to-workhorse-weapons-northa-korea-showcases-missile-diversity-101643602398847.html
31-01-2022||World||North Korea confirms test of Hwasong-12 missile capable of striking Guam||North Korea confirmed it had fired a Hwasong-12 "mid-range ballistic missile", state media reported Monday, the first time it has tested a weapon that powerful since 2017.Seoul's military said it had detected the launch Sunday of an intermediate-range ballistic missile -- Pyongyang's seventh weapons test in January.North Korea has never test-fired this many missiles in a calendar month before and last week threatened to abandon a nearly five-year-long self-imposed moratorium on testing long-range and nuclear weapons, blaming US "hostile" policy for forcing its hand."The evaluation test-fire of Hwasong 12-type ground-to-ground intermediate- and long-range ballistic missile was conducted Sunday," the official Korean Central News Agency said.The test "confirmed the accuracy, security and effectiveness of the operation of the Hwasong 12-type weapon system under production," KCNA added.KCNA said the test was carried out using the "highest-angle launch system" to ensure the safety of neighboring countries, and that the warhead carried a camera that took photos while it was in space.With peace talks with Washington stalled, North Korea has doubled down on leader Kim Jong Un's vow to modernise the regime's armed forces, flexing Pyongyang's military muscles despite biting international sanctions.South Korea said Sunday that North Korea appeared to be following a "similar pattern" to 2017 -- when tensions were last at breaking point on the peninsula -- warning Pyongyang could soon restart nuclear and intercontinental missile tests.The last time Pyongyang tested an intermediate-range missile was the Hwasong-12 in 2017, which analysts said at the time was powerful enough to put the US territory of Guam in range.The string of launches in 2022 comes at a delicate time in the region, with Kim's sole major ally China set to host the Winter Olympics next month and South Korea gearing up for a presidential election in March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-confirms-test-of-hwasong-12-missile-capable-of-striking-guam-101643594566297.html

"To our knowledge, this content advisory is the first of its kind by a major podcast platform."Britain's Prince Harry and his wife Meghan also expressed their concern to Spotify about Covid-19 misinformation on its platform and are committed to continuing to work with the company, a spokesperson for their Archewell foundation said on Sunday.The advisory will direct listeners to a Covid-19 hub that contains facts and information from medical and health experts, as well as links to trusted sources.The move comes after singer-songwriters Neil Young and Joni Mitchell announced they are removing their music from Spotify in protest that the popular streaming service has allowed the airing of misinformation about Covid-19 vaccines.Young objected to his music being played on the same platform as Joe Rogan's top-rated podcast "The Joe Rogan Experience." A prominent vaccine skeptic, Rogan has stirred controversy with his views on the pandemic, government mandates and vaccines to control the spread of the coronavirus.Earlier this month, 270 scientists and medical professionals signed a letter urging Spotify to take action against Rogan, accusing him of spreading falsehoods on the podcast.In a tweet on Saturday best-selling author Brene Brown -- host of the Spotify-exclusive podcasts "Unlocking Us" and "Dare to Lead" -- said she would "not be releasing any podcasts until further notice."Brown could not immediately be reached for comment.Spotify is also publishing platform rules for its creators, according to Ek's post."We know we have a critical role to play in supporting creator expression while balancing it with the safety of our users," he wrote. "In that role, it is important to me that we don’t take on the position of being content censor while also making sure that there are rules in place and consequences for those who violate them."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spotify-to-add-content-advisory-to-podcasts-discussing-covid19-101643593961675.html
31-01-2022||World||US Navy veteran's release ‘non-negotiable’ for Taliban's legitimacy: Biden||US President Joe Biden on Sunday called on the Taliban to release US Navy veteran Mark Frerichs, who has been held captive for two years. Biden said in a statement Frerichs’s release was non-negotiable before the Taliban can expect any consideration of its aspirations for legitimacy.Frerichs, a native of Illinois, was helping with construction projects in Afghanistan when he was taken captive. Biden assured all the Americans held hostage and wrongfully detained overseas that his administration will continue to work steadfastly until every American being unjustly held against their wish returns home.“A civil engineer, he spent a decade helping the people of Afghanistan. He has done nothing wrong," Biden said in a statement.The statement added, “Threatening the safety of Americans or any innocent civilians is always unacceptable, and hostage-taking is an act of particular cruelty and cowardice. The Taliban must immediately release Mark before it can expect any consideration of its aspirations for legitimacy. This is not negotiable.”Over 100 ex-Afghan and international forces killed, UN saysState Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement that the US has raised Frerichs's case in every meeting with the Taliban."[W]e have been clear that the legitimacy the Taliban seek is impossible to consider while they hold a US citizen hostage. His release is among our core, non-negotiable priorities. We will continue to send a clear message to Taliban leadership: immediately and safely release Mark and disavow the practice of hostage-taking," Price said.The Sunni Pashtun group took control of Afghanistan in August last year but is yet to receive recognition from the international community given its history of human rights violations. Afghanistan is facing a grave humanitarian crisis following the ouster of the Western-back government, compounded by suspension of foreign aid, the freezing of Afghan government assets, and international sanctions on the Taliban.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-navy-veteran-s-release-non-negotiable-for-taliban-s-legitimacy-biden-101643588187263.html
31-01-2022||World||UAE intercepts Yemen missile as Israeli president visits||The United Arab Emirates intercepted a ballistic missile fired by Yemen's Houthi rebels early Monday as the Israeli president visited the country, authorities said, the third such attack in recent weeks.The missile fire further escalates tensions across the Persian Gulf, which previously had seen a series of assaults near — but never indisputably on — Emirati soil. It comes during Yemen's years-long war and the collapse of Iran's nuclear deal with world powers.The UAE's state-run WAM news agency reported the interception, saying that “the attack did not result in any losses, as the remnants of the ballistic missile fell outside the populated areas.”It wasn't immediately clear where the missile remnants fell. The country's civilian air traffic control agency said there was no immediate effect on air travel in the UAE, home to the long-haul carriers Emirates and Etihad.Already, the country's top prosecutor has threatened that people who film or post images of such an incident would face criminal charges in the UAE, an autocratic federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula. That makes reporting on such incidents even more complicated for journalists.Houthi military spokesman Yehia Sarei wrote on Twitter that the rebels would make an announcement about an attack in the coming hours that reached into “the depths of the UAE."He did not elaborate and there was nothing immediately reported on the Houthis' Al-Masirah satellite news channel.Israeli President Isaac Herzog is in the country on a state visit. The ceremonial leader met Sunday with Abu Dhabi's powerful crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.It wasn't immediately clear how the missile attack would affect the rest of Herzog's trip. Israeli officials could not be immediately reached for comment.Last week, a similar attack saw both Emirati and US forces fire interceptor missiles to bring down a Houthi attack. The week before that saw a Houthi drone-and-missile attack strike an Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. fuel depot, killing three people and wounding six others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-intercepts-yemen-missile-as-israeli-president-visits-101643586245337.html
31-01-2022||World||Thousands stage protest in Ottawa against Canada’s vaccine mandates||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his family were taken to an undisclosed location as thousands of demonstrators protesting Covid-19 vaccine mandates gathered in Ottawa, the country’s capital, on Saturday.The prime minister’s office updated Trudeau’s itinerary to say he was somewhere in the National Capital Region, when usually he is at Rideau Cottage in Ottawa. Trudeau recently went into isolation, and has been working remotely, after one of his children tested positive for Covid-19. The so-called “Freedom Convoy” started out as a rally of truckers against a vaccine mandates for cross-border drivers, but turned into a demonstration against government overreach, including vaccine passports and lockdowns, during the pandemic. Many arrived in the capital from various part of the country and laid siege to Parliament Hill, the seat of power.The group has organised itself under the name Canadian Unity, managing to raise more than CAN$8.4 million. “We are taking our fight to the doorsteps of our Federal Government and demanding that they cease all mandates against its people,” a declaration on the website said. The protestors have threatened to camp in Ottawa till their demands are met.Trudeau on Thursday, ahead of the demonstrations, described the protesters as belonging to a “fringe minority”.Much of the capital was shut down due to the arrival of the protesters. However, Ottawa police service said on Saturday night that there “have been no incidents of violence or injuries reported,” adding that “many streets in the downtown core are closed or impassable to vehicles.”Concerns were raised over the possible presence of extremist elements in the group after at least one Nazi flag was seen, and protesters danced at and desecrated sites like the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and National War Memorial.This drew a sharp reaction from minister of national defence Anita Anand, who said that these were “sacred sites” for the country and the “behaviour” seen was “beyond reprehensible” in a post on Twitter.Even though more than a quarter of Canadian truckers are of Indian origin - mainly immigrants from Punjab - their presence at the protests was muted, barring some videos and photographs of their joining the participants, including serving food.The Ottawa Sikh Society (OSS) said the Gurdwara Sahib would be closed over the weekend after several social media posts said truckers could find food and shelter at the gurdwara. It said on Facebook that posts suggesting that the gurdwara “will accommodate truckers’ convoy” were “false and unauthorised”, and OSS was “not associated with this protest in any shape or form”.The Canadian Truckers’ Alliance (CTA) has already disassociated itself from the protest and has said nearly 90% of its approximately 300,000 members were vaccinated.Referring to the vaccine mandate on truckers shuttling between Canada and the United States, which went into force on January 15, the CTA said, “The only way to cross the border, in a commercial truck or any other vehicle, is to get vaccinated. As an industry we must adapt and comply with this mandate and the vast majority have.”In a statement on Saturday, it added, “To those in the trucking industry that have chosen to participate in this protest regarding cross-border mandates, we ask that you engage in a peaceful demonstration today then leave the City of Ottawa to avoid any issues to the welfare and safety of the citizens of Ottawa.”While the protests will continue, authorities could face challenges as the work week commences, particularly as the House of Commons is scheduled to convene on Monday.
