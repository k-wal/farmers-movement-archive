No group has so far claimed the attack.Security in Afghanistan has vastly improved since a two-decade long insurgency by the Taliban ended with the hardline Islamist group's capture of the capital Kabul in August.However, several attacks are reported each week throughout the country, including some claimed by the regional chapter of the Islamic State group.IS has regularly targeted the country's Shiite Hazara community with deadly attacks, and the area where Saturday's blast occurred near a bus station is also inhabited by the community.Herat is the country's third-biggest city, close to the border with Iran, but had remained relatively peaceful in recent months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bomb-on-bus-kills-7-in-afghanistan-s-herat-city-officials-101642871529272.html

Indian authorities are working with their Canadian counterparts to investigate the death of the Indian nationals during an apparent human smuggling operation to take people from the Canadian side to the US. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) found the bodies of the four Indians – an infant, a male teenager, an adult male and an adult female – on Wednesday, shortly after the US Customs and Border Protection (USBP) apprehended a group of Indians who allegedly crossed into the US from Canada near the town of Emerson in Manitoba. People familiar with the matter said on Saturday that US authorities had detained a US citizen and seven other people without proper documentation for allegedly being involved in human smuggling activity. Two of these eight people were hospitalised with cold-related injuries, they said. Earlier reports had identified the US citizen detained by authorities as Steve Shand, a 47-year-old resident of Florida. The people cited above said the four dead people and the others detained without proper documentation in the US appeared to be Indian nationals. “However, further efforts are underway to identify them and confirm their nationalities. Post-mortem of the victims is likely to be carried out on January 24,” one of the people said. A team sent by the Indian consulate in Toronto to Manitoba is liaising with Canadian authorities to render consular help regarding the four dead people. The consulate and the high commission in Ottawa are in touch with Canada’s provincial and federal authorities to ascertain more details about the incident. In the US, the Indian consulate in Chicago has sent a team to Minneapolis to coordinate with local authorities and to provide consular assistance. This team has sought consular access to the detained people. The consulate and the embassy in Washington are also in touch with the US department of justice and USBP. External affairs minister S Jaishankar had on Friday directed the Indian envoys to the US and Canada to respond to the situation. Ajay Bisaria, India’s high commissioner to Canada, described the incident as a “grave tragedy” and said Indian authorities will work with their Canadian counterparts to investigate the disturbing event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eight-detained-in-us-following-death-of-4-indians-in-human-smuggling-operation-101642862923715.html

Grateful to have served @POTUS and for the friendships that were forged in the tough days of the early primaries,when we were counted out but bounced back to win it all."Grateful to @BidenInaugural for giving the country a day to celebrate despite all the challenges we faced. Grateful to the men and women of the White House Military Office for taking me in and teaching me about service and sacrifice," he said.An Obama administration alum, Varghese joined the Biden White House after leading the president's inauguration efforts and serving as a senior adviser and chief operating officer for Biden's 2020 presidential campaign, the CNN reported on Friday.Varghese "is departing his post Friday after several years working in President Joe Biden's orbit," it said.The White House declined to say whether a replacement has been selected."One thing I learned during two tours here is it's a demanding place to work and it's because the work is really important, and we throw all of ourselves into this...Right now, it's best for me and my family that I kind of just try to strike a little bit more of a balance," Varghese, who is in his early forties, was quoted as saying to CNN.He, however, did not detail his next endeavours.As head of the military office, Varghese used to coordinate with the military branches responsible for supporting presidential operations at the White House and on the road domestically and abroad, including Air Force One missions, secure communications via the White House Communications Agency, food services, the medical unit and Camp David, the presidential retreat frequented often by the Biden family, the report said.A lawyer by training, Varghese was born in the US to parents who immigrated from Thiruvalla, Kerala. He has a bachelor's degree in political science and economics from the University of Massachusetts, Amherts.Among the chief challenges confronting Varghese over the past two years was crafting strategies for operating a campaign, inauguration and White House military support in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, the report said.Deputy White House chief of staff Jen O'Malley Dillon called Varghese "one of the most tested, trusted and talented leaders on Team Biden"."As the country faced confounding crises one year ago, he led the team that orchestrated a historic, unforgettable inauguration that defined the tone of our first year in office."Maju not only embodies the President's core values, but instils them in all of us through his service, optimism, and heart," Dillon was quoted as saying in the report.In his tweets, Varghese thanked Dhillon and others for trusting him to lead teams "throughout this incredible ride"."In the service of two Presidents and in the spirit of my father, I tried to lead with my whole heart. Thanks for everything, team! You’ll always have me as a friend and ally," he said.Varghese previously served in the White House under president Barack Obama in various roles, including as the assistant to the president for management and administration and deputy director of advance.

22-01-2022||World||Canada’s Omicron wave may have peaked||Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam on Friday struck a cautiously optimistic note that the surge of Covid-19 cases, driven by the more transmissible Omicron variant, may have peaked.Tam, in a statement released on Friday, said that a modelling update from last week had suggested that the Omicron surge would peak in January and recede by February, but the latest data has “early indications that infections may have peaked at the national level, including daily case counts, test positivity, Rt (or effective reproduction number), and wastewater surveillance trends”.Despite this, hospitals and intensive care units continue to be under strain given the large number of cases in Canada.Multiple Canadian provinces, including Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia, have started easing restrictions that were imposed as the Omicron-driven fifth wave mounted.However, there could still be “some difficult weeks ahead and potential for more bumps along the way”, Dr. Tam said, adding that vaccinations and several effective treatments have led to health authorities to “remain hopeful” these would change the nature of the pandemic to “reduce severity going forward”.In the latest seven-day period between January 14 - 20, an average of 25,821 new cases were reported across Canada daily. While this is a 28% decrease compared to the week prior, “infection rates remain elevated and are increasing in some jurisdictions”, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC).Laboratory test positivity rate remains elevated at 23% “indicating continued widespread community transmission”, it said.An average of 10,041 people were being treated for Covid in hospitals each day during that period, which was 38% higher than last week and exceeds all previous peaks.Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 2,868,862 cases of Covid-19 and 32,220 deaths reported in Canada.
22-01-2022||World||1 New York City police officer killed, 1 severely injured in Harlem shooting||A New York City police officer was killed and another critically wounded Friday night while answering a call about an argument between a woman and her adult son, officials said, making four officers shot in the city in as many days.Just three weeks into their jobs, Mayor Eric Adams — a former police captain himself — and Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell stood before the media at a Harlem hospital, denouncing the spate of violence against the New York Police Department.“Countless officers lined this hallway after carrying him in and grieve for their brother while praying with everything they have for the other” officer, Sewell said. “I am struggling to find the words to express the tragedy we are enduring. We’re mourning, and we’re angry.”Adams said, “This was just not an attack on these brave officers. This was an attack on the city of New York.”Adams called for federal authorities to do more to round up stolen guns like the one used in Friday’s shooting inside a Harlem apartment.“There are no gun manufacturers in New York City,” he said. “We don’t make guns here. How are we removing thousands of guns off the street and they still find their way into New York City, in the hands of people who are killers?”Authorities said the officers, along with a third officer, went to the apartment on 135th Street after a call came in from a woman needing help with her son, identified by police as Lashawn J. McNeil, 47.Authorities said the officers spoke with the woman and another son, but there was no mention of a weapon. Then two of them walked from the front of the apartment down a narrow, 30-foot (9-meter) hallway.NYPD Chief of Detectives James Essig said McNeil swung open a bedroom door and opened fire at the officers, striking them.The officer who was killed was identified as 22-year-old Jason Rivera, who joined the force in November 2020, and the wounded officer as Wilbert Mora, 27, who's been with the NYPD for four years.As McNeil tried to flee, a third officer who’d stayed with McNeil’s mother in the front of the apartment shot at McNeil and wounded him in the head and arm, Essig said.McNeil is alive and hospitalized in critical condition, NYPD spokesperson Lt. John Grimpel said, correcting earlier reports that he had been killed. Sewell and Adams did not take questions at the hospital press conference.McNeil's last known address is in Allentown, Pennsylvania, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) west of New York City.McNeil was on probation for a 2003 drug conviction in New York City. He also had several out of state arrests. In 1998, he was arrested in South Carolina for unlawfully carrying a pistol, but records show the matter was later dismissed. In 2002, he was arrested in Pennsylvania for assaulting a police officer, Essig said.Police said the gun used in Friday night's shooting, a .45-caliber Glock with a high-capacity magazine capable of holding up to 40 extra rounds, had been stolen in Baltimore in 2017.Friday night's shooting happened in a street-level apartment in a six-story apartment building on a block between two iconic Harlem avenues: Malcolm X Boulevard and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard.It came three nights after an officer was wounded in the leg in the Bronx during a struggle with a teenager who also shot himself. On Thursday, a narcotics detective was shot in the leg on Staten Island.Under Adams, the NYPD has reinstated a plainclothes anti-crime unit aimed at getting guns off the streets. The unit had been disbanded in 2020 over concerns it accounted for a disproportionate number of shootings and complaints.The NYPD has also partnered with prosecutors, city and federal agencies in recent months on a task force that meets daily and works to track gun violence, accelerate gun tracing and build cases against shooters and gun traffickers.Before Friday, the last NYPD officer killed in the line of duty was Anastasios Tsakos, who was struck by a suspected drunken driver in May 2021 while assisting officers at the scene of an earlier crash on a Queens highway.The last NYPD officer fatally shot in the line of duty, Brian Mulkeen, was hit by friendly fire while struggling with an armed man after chasing and shooting at him in the Bronx in September 2019.Mulkeen’s death came about seven months after Det. Brian Simonsen was killed by friendly fire while he and other officers were confronting a robbery suspect at a cell phone store in Queens.In 2017, Officer Miosotis Familia was ambushed by a gunman as she wrote in a notebook in a mobile command post. In 2016, Sgt. Paul Tuozzolo was killed in a gunfight with a man who’d broken into his estranged wife’s home.In 2015, Officer Randolph Holder was shot and killed by a man riding a stolen bicycle in Manhattan and Officer Brian Moore died after he was shot by a man in Queens.The year before, Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were fatally shot by a man who ambushed them as they sat in their patrol car in Brooklyn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1-new-york-city-police-officer-killed-1-severely-injured-in-harlem-shooting-101642838894342.html

But it was never signed.It is among 750-plus records turned over to the House of Representatives select committee investigating the 2021 Capitol assault after the Supreme Court rejected Trump's appeal to block their release."Effective immediately, the Secretary of Defense shall seize, collect, retain and analyze all machines, equipment, electronically stored information, and material records required for retention," says the three-page draft.The document reprises many of the debunked conspiracy theories about hacked voting machines that were pushed by figures in Trump's orbit now being targeted by congressional investigators, including right-wing attorney Sidney Powell.She falsely told reporters the election had been targeted by "communist money through Venezuela, Cuba, and likely China."Powell and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani led unsuccessful efforts to have courts throw out election results in key swing states in the weeks after Trump's defeat.The ex-president and his allies spent months pressing false claims of widespread fraud, despite experts in his own government affirming that it was the most secure vote in US history.The claims were also rejected by Trump-appointed attorney general Bill Barr, and Trump was eventually impeached for inciting the attack on the Capitol by a mob of his supporters.The draft order bears similarities with a plot outlined in a Powerpoint presentation to keep Trump in office that former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows turned over to the select committee last year.That document envisaged US Marshals seizing ballots for a 50-state hand recount.The draft executive order that emerged Friday focuses specifically on touchscreen ballot-marking devices made by Dominion that were used in Georgia, where a hand recount and machine recount affirmed Biden's win.It repeats false allegations about Dominion being "owned or heavily controlled and influenced by foreign agents, countries, and interests" and alleging that its machines are deliberately designed to create "systemic fraud."Powell and Giuliani are fighting billion-dollar defamation lawsuits from Dominion and Smartmatic, another voting machine company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-told-pentagon-to-seize-voting-machines-after-poll-defeat-report-101642820564884.html
22-01-2022||World||US lawmakers urge Biden to release frozen Afghan funds 'to prevent humanitarian disaster'||Three US lawmakers have urged US President Joe Biden to release Afghanistan's assets worth billions of dollars to prevent a humanitarian disaster that is unfolding. The South Asian country is on the verge of an economic collapse months after the United States with its NATO allies withdrew forces and the Taliban took over the reins.The lawmakers from the US House of Representatives made the recommendation in a letter to the US President. In the letter, they suggested a focused release of humanitarian funds to help the Afghan residents. They also underlined that the US has a moral obligation to Afghanistan who partnered with them in their war against terrorism."When the last American troops left Afghanistan, the United States promised that we would not abandon Afghanistan," the lawmakers stated in the letter, as cited by news agency ANI. "That is a mistake we made once before with grave consequences for our own security, as well as for the Afghan people. We must uphold our promise and do what is necessary to ensure that the progress made over the last 20 years is not lost," the lawmakers added.They also stressed that the US cannot allow Afghanistan to "once again become a breeding ground for terrorist organisations intent on killing Americans and attacking our nation."In December last year as well, 40 lawmakers had written to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen to release humanitarian aid to Afghans as the United Nations warned about a major humanitarian crisis prevailing in the war-torn nation.In August last year, the Taliban completed the capture of power in Afghanistan by seizing the presidential palace in Kabul in a rapid military offensive as foreign troops were leaving. The chaotic exit caused a major crisis for Afghans, with many security experts claiming it brought the country back to 1991 when the Taliban were ousted by the US troops.Following the Taliban takeover, the US froze nearly $10 billion in assets belonging to the Afghan central bank.Last week, Antonio Guterres warned about a "nightmare unfolding in Afghanistan" and said that the world is in a race against time to help the Afghan people. "Babies being sold to feed their siblings. Freezing health facilities overflowing with malnourished children. People burning their possessions to keep warm. Livelihoods across the country have been lost," the UN chief also said, while asking the global community to come together to help Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-lawmakers-urge-biden-to-release-frozen-afghan-funds-to-prevent-humanitarian-disaster-101642821921543.html

22-01-2022||World||‘Stealth Omicron’: All you need to know about fast-spreading sub-strain||A new sub-variant of Omicron has raised fears that more transmissible strains of the coronavirus could spark larger Covid-19 waves globally.The health authorities in the UK have designated the sub-variant, called BA.2, as ‘variant under investigation’. It is the initial step of investigation before being designated a ‘variant of concern’ (VOC), which the original Omicron BA.1 currently is.The sub-lineage, dubbed ‘stealth Omicron’, was designated in early December last year and as of January 10 this year, 53 sequences of BA.2 had been identified in the UK.How many sub-strains dose the Omicron variant have?According to World Health Organization (WHO), the Omicron variant has three sub-strains: BA.1, BA.2 and BA.3. It further said that as many as 99 per cent of the cases sequenced were found to be containing the BA.1 sub-strain.The WHO further said that the knowledge about B.1.1.529 is still developing, but this lineage is more diverse.But now, more sub-variants have been emerging, especially in one of the worst-affected regions by the spread of Covid-19, Europe.Where have the cases of the BA.2 sub-variant been detected?Apart from the UK, the BA.2 has been found in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Scientists in France and India have also warned about the quick spread of the BA.2 sub-variant, which is expected to outpace other Omicron strains.The situation is particularly bad in Denmark where BA.2 has gone from accounting 20 per cent of the cases to 45 per cent between late December and mid-January.Denmark has been reporting over 30,000 cases this week, 10 times more than the peak in previous Covid-19 wave.BA.2 vs BA.1 vs BA.3Researchers have pointed to the probable reason why the new sub-strain is expected to become the dominant cause of Covid-19 in months to come.Vipin M Vashishtha, Member of WHO’s Vaccine Safety Net, said on Twitter that BA.2 shares 32 mutations with BA.1 but also has 28 unique mutations of its own.What do we know about BA.2-sub-lineage of Omicron? Is BA.2 different? BA.2 shares 32 mutations w/ BA.1, but it also has 28 unique mutations. Some diff in S1. E is the same, N & M are diff in 1 mutation between the two variants.And...quite a difference when we go to ORF1ab. 1/ https://t.co/qMjHUsV4J4 pic.twitter.com/sn0TB8avx3The BA.3 sub-strain is probably antigenically similar to BA.1 as it shares mutations at 417, 446, 484 and other key sites, added Vashishtha.However, Denmark has said that it is too early to tell what the mutations of BA.2 mean. “So far there is no information as to whether BA.1 and BA.2 have different properties," said the Statens Serum Institut, a government-run infectious disease research centre.Denmark’s government also said that their initial analysis shows there is no difference in hospitalisations for BA.2 compared to BA.1. The government announced that it is easing restrictions as the number of people needing intensive care is decreasing.Why is it called ‘stealth Omicron’?When the scientists discovered the Omicron variant, they noted that its original strain - the BA.1 - has a mutation in the form of a deletion in the “S” or spike gene which was detected by the PCR tests. The BA.2 sub-strain, however, does not have the same mutation, due to which it was called ‘stealth Omicron’.But in recent weeks, many experts have claimed that the sub-strain does show up on PCR tests. “BA.2 _is_ detectable by PCR, these news reports are totally wrong.

22-01-2022||World||Can you get infected with Omicron twice? White House medical adviser answers||Top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci on Friday said it is extremely unlikely for people to get re-infected with the Omicron variant of coronavirus for at least several months. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was asked during a press briefing whether vaccinated people who got infected with Omicron are protected against reinfection from the new variant of concern.“Sure, there are reinfections. But it is unlikely that if you mount a good immune response, at least over a period of several months, it is extremely unlikely that you will be re-infected with the same variant,” the top immunologist said.Fauci stressed that the unpredictable nature of the variants of concerns has prompted authorities to chalk out the best-case and the worst-case scenarios. He said cases of reinfections have occurred mostly in people who fell ill with one variant and then later contracted a different variant, calling it the best-case scenario.“The worst-case scenario is something we have to be prepared for, and that is: We do get down to a level that we would say would be “adequate control,” but we’re faced with another surprise with a variant that’s so different that it eludes the accumulation of the immune protection that we’ve gotten from vaccinations and from prior infections,” he added.Omicron-driven Covid cases dip in US, some areas may still see rise: CDCRochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, informed that the seven-day daily average of Covid-19 cases is about 744,600 per day, a 5% decline over the previous week. The hospital admissions, however, with an increase of about 1% over the previous week, remain near all time-highs.“As we have seen during other phases of this pandemic, the surge in cases started at different times in different regions, and may continue to see high case counts in some areas of the country in the days and weeks ahead,” Walensky said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-you-get-infected-with-omicron-twice-white-house-medical-adviser-answers-101642816717127.html

And the superlatives have piled up really quickly.With the Federal Reserve intending to withdraw stimulus from the market, riskier assets the world over have suffered. Bitcoin, the largest digital asset, lost more than 12% Friday and dropped below $36,000 to its lowest level since July. Since its peak in November, it has lost over 45% of its value. Other digital currencies have suffered just as much, if not more, with Ether and meme coins mired in similar drawdowns. Bitcoin’s decline since that November high has wiped out more than $600 billion in market value, and over $1 trillion has been lost from the aggregate crypto market. While there have been much larger percentage drawdowns for both Bitcoin and the aggregate market, this marks the second-largest ever decline in dollar terms for both, according to Bespoke Investment Group.“It gives an idea of the scale of value destruction that percentage declines can mask,” wrote Bespoke analysts in a note. “Crypto is, of course, vulnerable to these sorts of selloffs given its naturally higher volatility historically, but given how large market caps have gotten, the volatility is worth thinking about both in raw dollar terms as well as in percentage terms.”With the Fed’s intentions rocking both cryptocurrencies and stocks, a dominant theme has emerged in the digital-asset space: cryptos have twisted and turned in nearly exactly the same way as equities have. “Crypto is reacting to the same kind of dynamics that are weighing on risk-assets globally,” said Stephane Ouellette, chief executive and co-founder of institutional crypto-platform FRNT Financial. “Unfortunately for some of the mature projects like BTC, there is so much cross-correlation within the crypto asset class it’s almost a certainty that it falls, at least temporarily in a broader alt-coin valuation contraction.”Crypto-centric stocks also dropped on Friday, with Coinbase Global Inc. at one point losing nearly 16% and falling to its lowest level since its public debut in the spring of 2021, Bloomberg data show.MicroStrategy Inc. tumbled 18% while the Securities and Exchange Commission said the company can’t strip out Bitcoin’s wild swings from the unofficial accounting measures it touts to investors. The enterprise software company’s pile of Bitcoin has effectively made its shares a proxy for the digital asset.   Meanwhile, the Biden administration is preparing to release an initial government-wide strategy for digital assets as soon as next month and task federal agencies with assessing the risks and opportunities that they pose, according to people familiar with the matter.Antoni Trenchev, Nexo co-founder and managing partner, cites Bitcoin’s correlation to the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, which right now is near the highest in a decade. “Bitcoin is being battered by a wave of risk-off sentiment. For further cues, keep an eye on traditional markets,” he said. “Fear and unease among investors is palpable.”Take also the correlation between Bitcoin and Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF (ticker ARKK), a pandemic poster-child of speculative risk-taking. That correlation stands at around 60% year-to-date, versus about 14% for the price of gold, according to Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, a research firm focused on technical analysis. It’s “reminding us to categorize Bitcoin and altcoins as risk assets rather than safe havens,” she said. Meanwhile, more than 239,000 traders had their positions closed over the past 24 hours, with liquidations totaling roughly $874 million, according to data from Coinglass, a cryptocurrency futures trading and information platform. Though liquidations have spiked, the numbers are relatively muted when compared to previous declines, according to Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at Genesis Global Trading. Acheson points out that Bitcoin’s one-week skew, which compares the cost of bearish options to bullish ones, spiked to almost 15% on Wednesday compared to an average of about 6% in the past seven days.“This flagged a jump in bearish sentiment, in line with overall market jitters given the current macro uncertainty,” she said. Kara Murphy, chief investment officer at Kestra Investment Management, said cryptocurrencies have a life of their own but that the recent slump is rational. “It makes sense as people start to retrench a little bit, look for something that’s a little bit more solid, they’re gonna move away from crypto,” she said. “On the margin, with folks becoming more risk averse, crypto will suffer from that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/crypto-crash-erases-more-than-1-trillion-in-market-value-101642815455334.html
