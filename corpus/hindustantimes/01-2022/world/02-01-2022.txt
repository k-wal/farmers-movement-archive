The US is experiencing almost a vertical increase in Covid cases but the peak has not yet come, Fauci said. The peak may be weeks away, he said in his interview to CNN.Here are 5 things that Fauci said:1. "We are definitely in the middle of a very severe surge and an uptick in cases," Fauci said. But the short-lived wave in South Africa offers some home that the surge will not last long.2. Omicron is milder than previous variants, now there is mounting evidence, Fauci said. The US rates of death and hospitalisations have been far lower so far, Fauci observed.3. However, there is still a danger of a surge in hospitalisation due to a large number of coronavirus cases. "There will certainly be a lot more cases because this is a much more transmissible virus than Delta is," Fauci said.4. For children, it's not unsafe to get back to school, Fauci said. "I think all those things put together, it's safe enough to get those kids back to school, balanced against the deleterious effects of keeping them out," he added.5. Because of the increase in cases, the system will be put under stress, he said. “When I say major disruption, you’re certainly going to see stresses on the system and the system being people with any kind of jobs ... particularly with critical jobs to keep society functioning normally,” Fauci said. “We already know that there are reports from fire departments, from police departments in different cities that 10, 20, 25 and sometimes 30% of the people are ill. And that’s something that we need to be concerned about because we want to make sure that we don’t have such an impact on society that there really is a disruption. I hope that doesn’t happen.”On the recent CDC isolation guideline, Fauci said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now considering including the negative test as part of its guidance after getting significant “pushback” on its updated recommendations last week.Under that December. 27 guidance, isolation restrictions for people infected with COVID-19 were shortened from 10 days to five days if they are no longer feeling symptoms or running a fever. After that period, they are asked to spend the following five days wearing a mask when around others.The guidelines have since received criticism from many health professionals for not specifying a negative antigen test as a requirement for leaving isolation.“There has been some concern about why we don't ask people at that five-day period to get tested,” Fauci said. “Looking at it again, there may be an option in that, that testing could be a part of that, and I think we're going to be hearing more about that in the next day or so from the CDC.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/near-vertical-rise-in-covid-in-us-5-things-fauci-observes-about-omicron-surge-101641144848060.html
02-01-2022||World||‘Hospitalisations might stress healthcare systems’: Anthony Fauci's warning on Omicron||The omicron variant of Covid-19 shows signs of causing milder illness but the “really unprecedented” rise in cases is still likely to cause serious sickness in many unvaccinated Americans, Anthony Fauci said. “When you have so, so many cases, even if the rate of hospitalization is lower with omicron than it is with delta, there’s still the danger that you’re going to have a surge in hospitalizations that might stress the health-care system,” U.S. President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “We’re still going to get a lot of hospitalizations.”Fauci was referring to the delta variant of the coronavirus, which caused a deadly wave of infections around the U.S. last year. Now hospitalizations are rising again, and average daily infections are at a record 400,000, Fauci said on ABC’s “This Week.” Several states have mobilized their National Guards to help provide medical care amid staffing shortages and, like Texas, asked for federal help. Almost 73% of U.S. adults are fully vaccinated, and 36.3% of adults have received a booster shot, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.SchoolsFauci said that despite omicron’s rapid spread, schools should remain open, though with masking and other rules, and he urged parents to get eligible children vaccinated. Mitigation strategies including masking and vaccines are working in schools, which should remain open if possible, U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said Sunday.“Our default should be in-person learning,” Cardona said on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” citing the benefits of classroom education over virtual learning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hospitalisations-might-stress-healthcare-systems-anthony-fauci-s-warning-on-omicron-101641140832714.html
02-01-2022||World||South Africa's national assembly completely destroyed in massive fire||A massive fire in South Africa's houses of parliament in Cape Town has completely destroyed the National Assembly where parliamentarians sit, a spokesman said on Sunday as the blaze continued to rage."The entire chamber where the members sit... has burned down," Moloto Mothapo said, adding that the blaze had still not been extinguished.No casualties have been reported so far but President Cyril Ramaphosa told reporters at the scene an arrest had been made."Someone has been held right now and is being questioned," he said.As day dawned, smoke could be seen billowing from the building against a blue sky."The roof of the Old Assembly building has collapsed and is gone," Jean-Pierre Smith, Cape Town's mayoral committee member for safety and security, told reporters earlier.The historic building houses a collection of rare books and the original copy of the former Afrikaans national anthem "Die Stem van Suid-Afrika" ("The Voice of South Africa"), which was already damaged."The entire building has suffered extensive smoke and water damage," Smith said, adding "the fire has not been contained".After ravaging the older wing of the building, the flames spread to newer parts of the complex which are currently in use."Firefighters are currently trying to control the fire in the New Wing, where the fire has affected the National Assembly Chamber," parliamentary spokesman Mothapo told an online news conference earlier in the day.The imposing red and white building was still shrouded in a thick cloud of black at midday.Metres from Tutu's burialA team of firefighters who were first to arrive at the scene battled the flames for several hours before being forced to retreat and call for reinforcements.Around 70 firefighters were later deployed, some using a crane to spray water on the blaze.Former Cape Town mayor and current minister Patricia de Lille warned it would still be several hours before the fire was brought under control.Inside the rooms, fine showers of grey ash fell from the ceiling to the floor, which was already littered with debris.Emergency services said they feared the fire could spread swiftly through the old rooms, which are decorated with wood, thick carpets, and curtains.Images broadcast on television had earlier shown giant flames leaping from the roof.The area around the fire in the upmarket neighbourhood was quickly cordoned off.The cordon stretched to a square where flowers were still displayed in front of the nearby St. George's Cathedral, where anti-apartheid icon Archbishop Desmond Tutu's funeral took place on Saturday.After a simple, no-frills mass, with a cheap coffin -- according to the famously modest Tutu's instructions -- his ashes were interred in the cathedral on Sunday.The second fire in a yearCape Town has been home to South Africa's houses of parliament since 1910 when separate administrations formed a union under British dominion and became a predecessor to the modern South African republic.The site includes the National Assembly and the upper house National Council of Provinces, while the government is based in Pretoria.It was in parliament where South Africa's last apartheid president FW de Klerk announced in 1990 plans to dismantle the brutal white-minority regime.The houses of parliament in Cape Town consist of three sections, with the newer additions constructed in the 1920s and 1980s.Another fire also broke out in the older wings of parliament in March, but it was quickly contained.Cape Town suffered another major fire in April when a blaze on the famed Table Mountain which overlooks the city spread, ravaging part of The University of Cape Town's library holding a unique collection of African archives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-s-national-assembly-completely-destroyed-in-massive-fire-101641139855585.html

The Tesla Autopilot AI team is extremely talented. Some of the smartest people in the world,” he said.Before joining Tesla, Elluswamy was associated with Volkswagen Electronic Research Lab and WABCO Vehicle Control System.He holds a bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the College of Engineering Guindy, Chennai and a Master's degree in Robotics System Development from Carnegie Mellon University.Musk recently tweeted that Tesla is looking for hardcore Artificial Intelligence (AI) engineers who care about solving problems that directly affect people’s lives in a major way.The job application was simple with interested candidates being asked to fill fields like name, email, exceptional work done in software, hardware or AI and drop their resume in the PDF format.Musk is the wealthiest person in the world, according to Forbes, with a net worth of around USD 282 billion, most of it in Tesla stock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-elon-musk-hired-indian-origin-ashok-elluswamy-as-tessa-s-autopilot-head-101641123630667.html
02-01-2022||World||South Korea: Unidentified individual crosses border into North Korea||South Korea’s military said Sunday that an unidentified person crossed the heavily fortified border into North Korea.South Korea had earlier spotted the person with surveillance equipment at the eastern portion of the border and sent troops to capture him or her on Saturday night. But the troops failed to find the person and the surveillance equipment detected the person crossing over the border, Joint Chiefs of Staff officers said.South Korea sent a message to North Korea on Sunday morning to ensure the safety of the person, but the North hasn’t responded, the officers said requesting anonymity citing department rules.It was unclear if this was a rare case of a South Korean hoping to defect to the North, or it could be a North Korean who briefly entered the South Korean territory for some reason before returning to the North.In September 2020, North Korea fatally shot a South Korean fisheries official found floating in its waters along a poorly marked sea boundary. South Korea said that North Korea troops were under orders to shoot anyone illegally crossing the border to protect against the coronavirus pandemic.Earlier in 2020, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un placed a border city under total lockdown after a North Korean defector with COVID-19-like symptoms sneaked back home. The fate of that defector, who had lived in South Korea, is not known.On Saturday, North Korea announced it had decided to place top priority on strict virus restrictions at a high-profile ruling party meeting last week.The two Koreas are split along the world’s most heavily armed border, called the Demilitarized Zone. An estimated 2 million mines are peppered inside and near the 248-kilometer (155-mile) -long, 4-kilometer (2.5-mile) -wide DMZ, which is also guarded by barbed wire fences, tank traps and combat troops on both sides.Defecting via the DMZ is rare. At the height of their Cold War rivalry, both Koreas sent agents and spies to each other’s territory through the DMZ, but no such incidents have been reported in recent years.About 34,000 North Koreans have defected to South Korea since the late 1990s to avoid poverty or political oppression, but a vast majority of them have come via China and Southeast Asian countries.North Korea has yet to report any cases of the coronavirus while experts have questioned its claim of a perfect record.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-unidentified-individual-crosses-border-into-north-korea-101641122629582.html
02-01-2022||World||France to ease Covid isolation rules: government||France will relax Covid isolation rules from Monday, the government announced, in a bid to ease their impact on society and the economy.Fully vaccinated people who test positive will only have to isolate for seven days regardless of the coronavirus variant they were infected with, but can leave quarantine after five days if they show an antigen or negative PCR test.There will be no quarantine for fully inoculated individuals who have a close contact test positive.However, people must respect protective measures and "undergo regular testing", health minister Olivier Veran said in an interview with Le Journal du Dimanche.Until now, those who tested positive in France had to isolate for 10 days with their close contracts also quarantined for a week.The maximum isolation period could be up to 17 days -- regardless of the variant -- if a household contains a positive case.The change in rules responds to the need "to take into account the extremely rapid evolution of the spread of the Omicron variant in France".It should allow a "benefit-risk balance aimed at ensuring the virus is controlled while maintaining socio-economic life", said the Ministry of Health.Additionally, "the first available virological data" showed "the incubation period of Omicron appears to be faster than previous variants, favouring a possible reduction in the length of isolation".Meanwhile, people who test positive for the virus -- but who are not fully vaccinated -- must complete a 10-day quarantine, according to the same rules, but shortened to seven should they present a positive antigen or negative PCR test.The seven-day quarantine remains for close unvaccinated contacts, who must show a negative test to leave isolation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-to-ease-covid-isolation-rules-government-101641108936857.html

The number of newly infected people living in Gyeonggi province and the western port city of Incheon was 1,244 and 231 respectively.The virus spread also raged in the non-metropolitan region. The number of new infections in the non-capital areas was 1,081, or 29.4 percent of the total local transmission.Among the new cases, 150 were imported, lifting the total to 17,595.The number of the Omicron variant infections was 1,207 so far, including 602 imported cases and 605 domestic transmissions, up 93 from the prior day.The number of infected people who were in a serious condition stood at 1,024, down 25 from the previous day.Sixty-nine more deaths were confirmed, leaving the death toll at 5,694.

Denmark scored worst with 2,045, followed by Cyprus with 1,969 and Ireland with 1,964.AFP's calculations are based on official figures, but some infections could have gone undetected, for example if patients were asymptomatic.Covid-related deaths are however decreasing in Europe.Europe recorded on average 3,413 coronavirus deaths a day over the past week, a seven percent drop from the previous week. At its worst, that average saw 5,735 deaths a day in January last year.People on the European continent are now, on the whole, more vaccinated than the worldwide average.Sixty-five percent of Europeans are partially vaccinated, while 61 percent are fully vaccinated -- more than 58 and 49 percent respectively worldwide, according to the "Our World in Data" website.Taking into account excess mortality linked to Covid-19, the World Health Organization estimates the overall death toll worldwide could be two to three times higher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-records-over-100-million-covid-19-cases-more-than-third-of-entire-global-tally-101641099662596.html

It counted almost 163,000 new cases Saturday, a slight dip after days of unprecedented daily tallies.The UK government, which has responsibility for health policies in England only, has so far refused to curb socialising and large events, unlike the rest of Britain.Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have all rolled out new rules since Christmas limiting gatherings, as the Omicron variant fuels an unprecedented nationwide surge in infections.But Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government in London insists the data does not yet justify such measures in England."Curbs on our freedom must be an absolute last resort and the British people rightly expect us to do everything in our power to avert them," Health Secretary Sajid Javid wrote in the Daily Mail newspaper."I've been determined that we must give ourselves the best chance of living alongside the virus," he added, noting the "enormous health, social and economic costs of lockdowns".Despite the record rise in infections, there has been a less dramatic rise in numbers admitted to hospital and then intensive care units, fuelling hopes that Omicron is less severe."I've been working closely with the NHS, to make sure it is ready and resilient for what lies ahead," Javid vowed.- 'Watch and wait' -In England, the government last month mandated mask-wearing in most settings, working from home if possible and a Covid pass system for nightclubs and large events.But it has stopped short of the further measures seen in other parts of the UK.Instead, it is relying on a stepped-up vaccination programme, which saw every adult offered a third dose by end-2021 and around 60 percent of the eligible population getting a booster jab.However, Education Secretary Nadim Zahawi said late Saturday the government would recommend secondary school students wear face coverings in classrooms and teaching spaces when they return next week as a "temporary" measure.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, he also conceded that "some remote learning will be necessary" as staff and pupil absences rise.Meanwhile, the state-run National Health Service (NHS) is under increasing strain across Britain as hospital admissions reach levels not seen since last March.Nearly 2,000 new patients were admitted in a single day earlier this week, according to the latest data released Saturday.At the same time, more than 110,000 staff -- nearly one in ten NHS workers nationwide -- were absent from work Friday, the Sunday Times newspaper reported.The Times said around 50,000 of those absent NHS workers were sick or self-isolating because of Covid-19."We still need to watch and wait," Chris Hopson, the head of NHS Providers which represents hospitals in England, tweeted.But he added: "Govt must be ready to introduce new restrictions at pace if they're needed."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-covid-19-curbs-in-england-last-resort-minister-101641083315541.html
