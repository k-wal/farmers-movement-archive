quell mass unrest that left dozens dead and hundreds detained.Fighting in Almaty continued a day after protesters stormed several government buildings, with an AFP correspondent hearing regular eruptions of gunfire from the direction of a central square.Local media reports said security forces had cleared demonstrators from the square and other key government buildings, but there were also reports of gunfire elsewhere in the city.The first units of Russian forces from a Moscow-led peacekeeping force had meanwhile arrived in Kazakhstan, the Russian defence ministry said, after the Kazakh government appealed for help.Long seen as one the most stable of the ex-Soviet republics of Central Asia, energy-rich Kazakhstan is facing its biggest crisis in decades after days of protests over rising fuel prices escalated into widespread unrest.Armed protesters have fought running battles with government forces, with officials saying 748 security officers have been wounded and 18 killed, including two who had their heads cut off.'So terrifying'Burnt-out vehicles littered Almaty's streets, several government buildings were in ruins and bullet casings were strewn over the grounds of the presidential residence, which was stormed and looted by protesters on Wednesday."I didn't know our people could be so terrifying," Samal, a 29-year-old nursery-school teacher, told AFP near the residence.Under increasing pressure, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev appealed overnight to the Russia-dominated Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), which includes five other ex-Soviet states, to combat what he called "terrorist groups" that had "received extensive training abroad".Within hours the alliance said the first troops had been sent -- including Russian paratroopers and military units from the other CSTO members -- in its first major joint action since its founding in 1999."Peacekeeping forces... were sent to the Republic of Kazakhstan for a limited time to stabilise and normalise the situation," the CSTO said in a statement, without specifying the number of troops involved.The Russian foreign ministry said it saw the unrest as "an attempt inspired from outside to undermine the security and integrity" of Kazakhstan.In the worst reported violence so far, police said dozens of people were "eliminated" in overnight battles with security forces at government buildings in Almaty.Over 2,000 detainedThe interior ministry said police had "moved forward to clear the streets" and detained about 2,300 people so far.Officials said more than 1,000 people had been wounded in the unrest, with nearly 400 admitted to hospital and 62 in intensive care.Protests spread across the nation of 19 million this week in outrage over a New Year increase in prices for liquid petroleum gas (LPG), which is widely used to fuel cars in the west of the country.Thousands took to the streets in Almaty and in the western province of Mangystau, saying the price rise was unfair given oil and gas exporter Kazakhstan's vast energy reserves.The full picture of the chaos was unclear, with widespread disruptions to communications including mobile phone signals, the blocking of online messengers and hours-long internet shutdowns.The protests are the biggest threat so far to the regime established by Kazakhstan's founding president Nursultan Nazarbayev, who stepped down in 2019 and hand-picked Tokayev as his successor.Tokayev tried to head off further unrest by announcing the resignation of the cabinet early on Wednesday, but protests continued.New fuel price limitsAs protests escalated, authorities declared a nationwide state of emergency until January 19, with curfews, restrictions on movements and bans on mass gatherings.The government made another concession on Thursday, setting new fuel price limits for six months, saying "urgent" measures were needed "to stabilise the socio-economic situation".Much of the anger appeared directed at Nazarbayev, who is 81 and had ruled Kazakhstan since 1989 before handing power to Tokayev.Many protesters shouted "Old Man Out!" in reference to Nazarbayev and several witnesses confirmed to AFP that a statue of the ex-leader had been torn down in the southern city of Taldykorgan.Western countries have called for restraint on all sides, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken calling his Kazakh counterpart to urge a "peaceful, rights-respecting resolution to the crisis".Kazakhstan, which tolerates little real opposition, is a key ally of Russia but has also sought good ties with the West and China.A major oil and gas exporter and one of the world's biggest producers of uranium, the country has signed lucrative deals with international energy companies.Critics say widespread corruption has meant little of that money reaching ordinary people, with average monthly salaries in the country of less than $600 (530 euros).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/clashes-in-largest-kazakh-city-moscow-led-troops-arrive-101641492049767.html
06-01-2022||World||One year on, Trump backers recall 'incredible' Capitol siege||One year ago to the day, they descended upon Washington in the thousands, gathering to protest the result of a presidential election they claim was rigged.The US Capitol came under attack, leaving the country wounded.As President Joe Biden delivered a speech assailing Donald Trump for the mayhem, people who participated in the events of January 6, 2021 gave AFP their accounts of a day that shocked the world.Republican recalls 'euphoria'"January 6 was incredible," says Samson Racioppi, a 40-year-old Republican Party stalwart who rented several buses to drive people to Washington from his home state of Massachusetts.The day began with outgoing Republican president Trump addressing a sea of supporters waving "Trump 2020" flags in the biting cold near the White House.Trump fired up the crowd with a defiant speech, repeating his false claims that he won the November election over Democrat Joe Biden."I remember the actual feeling of that day of euphoria," said Jim Wood, a military veteran who came to Washington from New Hampshire. "Seeing all the people."Before Trump finished speaking, Wood, who is in his 60s, headed towards the Capitol, where Congress was certifying Biden's election victory.Thousands of others did the same and an enormous crowd quickly assembled around the brilliant white dome of the Capitol building.'Let's go!' as crowd surges"Then all of a sudden, you heard, I guess, from my remembrance, screams of, you know, 'Let's go, let's go, let's go,'" said Glen Montfalcone, who also came to Washington from Massachusetts."And then kind of anarchy started happening," Montfalcone added."People were pushing, pushing, pushing. 'Go go, forge forward, forge forward,'" he said. "And so we all did, we all forged forward and just started entering into the area, and then up the stairs."All three men insist they did not enter the Capitol itself. They could be risking prison if they admitted they did.Hundreds did swarm the building, however, including a tattooed, half-naked man wearing horns and a fur hat.One protester was shot dead by police.The world watched live, aghast, as the citadel of American democracy came under assault.Wood said the televised images he saw broadcast the next day at breakfast were "demonizing" and that the vast majority of the protesters remained outside the Capitol.During the next few months, two competing narratives would arise.Trump supporters claim it was a peaceful protest against a "stolen" election.Police officers who fought with the mob, Democratic lawmakers and even some Republicans called it "terrorism."FBI at the doorIn the wake of January 6, law enforcement launched a nationwide sweep for participants in the assault on the Capitol.Montfalcone has had FBI agents turn up at his door. Several friends have been arrested.At his law school, students unsuccessfully attempted to have Racioppi thrown out.In Washington, a House of Representatives committee is investigating what has been described as an insurrection or a coup attempt.The January 6 participants reject this characterization of the day.On the contrary, Racioppi says proudly, "this is something I'm going to tell my grandkids about."He remains convinced, like many Republicans, that the 2020 election was "stolen" from Trump, despite the absence of any credible evidence this occurred.Likewise Wood, an Air Force mechanic who spent years working on B-52 bombers, insists the election was fraudulent.Of Biden, he says, "I don't consider him the president of the United States."Racioppi said January 6 was just a skirmish in an ongoing conflict."We're looking at it as if it's a war, right?" he said. "We're going to cause as much political damage to the left and the people who support tyranny as possible."Would he do it again?"Of course I would do it again," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-year-on-trump-backers-recall-incredible-capitol-siege-101641491549261.html
06-01-2022||World||2 killed in Sudan as thousands protest against military||Two Sudanese protesters were killed on Thursday while taking part in the latest mass demonstrations demanding a transition to civilian rule after a coup, medics said.One of the slain demonstrators took a "live bullet to the head by the putschist forces as he took part in demonstrations" in the capital's twin city of Omdurman, said the Central Committee of Sudan Doctors, part of the pro-democracy movement.The second, who also has not been identified, "was hit by a live bullet to the pelvis" during the Omdurman protests, the medics added.The latest killings bring to 59 the overall death toll since the October 25 military coup, the committee added.Their deaths came a day after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken appealed on Twitter for Sudanese security forces to "cease using lethal force against demonstrators & commit to an independent investigation."Singing, beating drums, and holding up posters of others killed in demonstrations since the military takeover, protesters in the capital Khartoum shouted defiant slogans against the army.Many protesters in Khartoum were seen wounded and struggling with breathing difficulties due to the heavy firing of tear gas, according to the witnesses.The military takeover -- one of several in Sudan's post-independence history -- has been accompanied by a security forces crackdown that has also wounded hundreds.Demonstrators -- who have at times marched in the tens of thousands -- remain undeterred."We will not stop until we get our country back," shouted one protester, Samar al-Tayeb, 22.Other demonstrators set fire to tyres to create burning barricades on the streets.Crowds were marching towards the presidential palace in Khartoum when security forces fired volleys of tear gas that formed thick and choking clouds, witnesses said.Protesters hurled back stones at security forces, they added."Our marches will continue until we restore our revolution and our civilian government, even if martyrs fall among us," said Mojataba Hussein, a 23-year-old protester.Call for dialogueThe power grab by military chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan more than two months ago dismantled a precarious power-sharing arrangement between the military and civilians established in the wake of the April 2019 ouster of longtime autocrat Omar al-Bashir.The protests on Thursday came days after prime minister Abdalla Hamdok resigned, leaving the military fully in charge. Hamdok had been held under house arrest for weeks following the coup, before being reinstated in a November 21 deal after international pressure.The protest movement called the November pact a "betrayal" for providing what they said was a cloak of legitimacy for Burhan's coup, and kept up its rallies.When Hamdok stepped down on Sunday, he said Sudan was at a "dangerous crossroads threatening its very survival".Western nations say the solution is dialogue, a point made in a tweet Wednesday by Blinken.He said: "To overcome the current crisis in Sudan, we and our partners strongly urge stakeholders to commit to an immediate, Sudanese-led, and internationally facilitated dialogue."Protests in several citiesDemonstrations on Thursday again took place in other cities as well as the capital, witnesses said."The authority is that of the people," protesters chanted in Wad Madani, demanding soldiers "go back to the barracks".In Atbara, protesters called on Burhan to "hand over the country's keys and leave," witnesses said.Crowds in the central state of North Kordofan chanted "No, no to military rule" while waving and draped in the national flag.Others also took to the streets in Central and South Darfur states, according to witnesses.On Tuesday the United States, European Union, Britain and Norway warned the military against naming their own successor to Hamdok, saying that without involvement of "a broad range of civilian stakeholders" such a move could plunge the country into conflict.On Thursday, state-media quoted Burhan's media adviser Taher Abouhaga as saying, in an apparent reference to the absence of a government: "The void must be filled in the least possible time."Burhan last month issued a decree allowing security forces to arrest individuals "over crimes related to the state of emergency", effectively banning street protests.But the rallies continue.Web monitoring group NetBlocks said the mobile internet was cut from mid-morning Thursday, and wider internet access and phone lines were also disrupted, a tactic repeatedly used in an attempt to disrupt activists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-killed-in-sudan-as-thousands-protest-against-military-101641491339607.html
06-01-2022||World||Dozens of protesters, 12 police personnel dead in Kazakhstan protests||Security forces killed dozens of protesters and 12 police died during extraordinarily violent demonstrations in Kazakhstan that saw government buildings stormed and set ablaze, authorities said Thursday. One police officer was found beheaded in escalating unrest that poses a growing challenge to authoritarian rule in the Central Asian nation.Despite the severe response by authorities, protesters took the streets again in the country’s largest city, Almaty, a day after breaking into the presidential residence and the mayor’s office there. Police were also out in force, including in the capital of Nur-Sultan, which was reportedly quiet, and Russian troops were on their way.Video from the Russian news agency Tass showed police firing intensely on a street near Republic Square, where demonstrators had gathered, though they could not be seen in the footage. Late Thursday, Tass said protesters had been swept from the square but that sporadic gunfire in the area continued.Earlier, Russia’s Sputnik news service reported that shots were fired as police surrounded one group of about 200 protesters in the city.In the unrest on Wednesday, “dozens of attackers were liquidated,” police spokeswoman Saltanat Azirbek told state news channel Khabar-24, using a term common to describe the killing of people thought to be extremists by law enforcement. Twelve police officers were killed and 353 injured, according to city officials cited by the channel. The Interior Ministry said 2,000 people have been arrested.Tens of thousands of people, some reportedly carrying clubs and shields, have taken to the streets in recent days in the worst protests the country has seen since gaining independence from the Soviet Union three decades ago. Although the demonstrations began over a near-doubling of prices for a type of vehicle fuel, their size and rapid spread suggest they reflect wider discontent in the country that has been under the rule of the same party since independence.The government on Thursday announced a 180-day price cap on vehicle fuel and a moratorium on raising utility rates — an attempt to address the economic issues that catalyzed the protests, though it was unclear what, if any, effect the moves would have.The president has vacillated between attempts at mollifying the protesters, including accepting the resignation of his government, and promising harsh measures to quell the unrest, which he blamed on “terrorist bands.”Worries that a broader crackdown could be on the horizon grew after he called on a Russia-led military alliance for help. Severe interruptions to internet service and cellphone service also raised concern and made it difficult — sometimes impossible — for news of what was happening inside Kazakhstan to get out.The airports in Almaty and one other city have also been shut.The military alliance, the Collective Security Treaty Organization, said early Thursday that it would send peacekeeper troops to Kazakhstan at Tokayev's request.The operation is the first military action by the CSTO — an indication that Kazakhstan's neighbors, particularly Russia, are concerned that the unrest could spread.Russia and Kazakhstan share close relations and a 7600-kilometer (4700-mile) border, much of it along open steppes. Russia's manned space-launch facility, the Baikonur Cosmodrome, is in Kazakhstan.The size and duties of the force have not been specified. Russia has already begun sending forces, according to the CSTO, which also includes Kazakhstan, Armenia, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. But Kyrgyzstan's presidential spokesman, Erbol Sutanbaev, said his country's contingent must be approved by parliament and said that the troops would not take actions involving demonstrators.It was not immediately clear if any of the Russian forces had arrived in Kazakhstan.The unrest was also causing worry elsewhere. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke by telephone with his Kazakh counterpart, Mukhtar Tileuberdi, and “reiterated the United States’ full support for Kazakhstan’s constitutional institutions and media freedom and advocated for a peaceful, rights-respecting resolution to the crisis,” said State Department spokesman Ned Price.France condemned the violence and called for “de-escalation and responsibility” from all parties involved, including the CSTO.China is also likely to be concerned. Kazakhstan shares a 1,800 kilometer (1,000 mile)-long border with China’s Xinjiang region, where Beijing has launched an all-out campaign to quash separatist sentiment among Muslim minority groups who share cultural, religious and linguistic links with the peoples of Central Asia.However, at a daily briefing Thursday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin appeared to dismiss any possibility of China becoming involved in the current crisis, in line with Beijing strict official non-interventionist policy.“What is happening in Kazakhstan is the country’s internal affair (and) we believe that the Kazakh authorities can solve the issue properly,” he said.Tokayev has imposed a two-week state of emergency for the whole country, including an overnight curfew and a ban on religious services. That is a blow to Kazakhstan's sizable Orthodox Christian population who observe Christmas on Friday.Of the five Central Asian republics that gained independence following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan is by far the largest and the wealthiest, spanning a territory the size of Western Europe and sitting atop colossal reserves of oil, natural gas, uranium and precious metals. In addition to its long border with Russia, it also shares one with China, and its oil and mineral wealth make it strategically and economically important.But despite Kazakhstan’s natural riches and a solid middle class, financial hardship is widespread, and discontent over poor living conditions is strong in some parts of the country. Many Kazakhs also chafe at the dominance of the ruling party, which holds more than 80% of the seats in parliament.The protests appear to have no identifiable leader or demands. Much of the anger displayed in recent days was directed not at Tokayev, but at Nursultan Nazarbayev, the country’s first president who continued to wield enormous influence after his 2019 resignation. Protesters shouted “Shal ket!” (“Old man go”), an apparent reference to Nazarbayev, who dominated Kazakhstan’s politics and whose rule was marked by a moderate cult of personality.At the start of the year, prices for the fuel called liquefied petroleum gas roughly doubled as the government moved away from price controls as part of efforts to move to a market economy.The price cap for LPG announced by the government Thursday is 75 tenge (17 cents) per liter; at the start of the year, the average price was about 120 tenge (27 cents).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dozens-of-protesters-12-police-personnel-dead-in-kazakhstan-protests-101641490499731.html
06-01-2022||World||Omicron may be less severe in young and old, but not 'mild': WHO||The more infectious Omicron variant of Covid-19 appears to produce less severe disease than the globally dominant Delta strain, but should not be categorised as "mild", World Health Organization (WHO) officials said on Thursday.Janet Diaz, WHO lead on clinical management, said early studies showed there was a reduced risk of hospitalisation from the variant first identified in southern Africa and Hong Kong in November compared with Delta.There appears also to be a reduced risk of severity in both younger and older people, she told a media briefing from WHO headquarters in Geneva.The remarks on the reduced risks of severe disease chime with other data, including studies from South Africa and England, although she did not give further details about the studies or ages of the cases analysed.The impact on the elderly is one of the big unanswered questions about the new variant as most of the cases studied so far have been in younger people."While Omicron does appear to be less severe compared to Delta, especially in those vaccinated, it does not mean it should be categorised as mild," director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at the same briefing in Geneva."Just like previous variants, Omicron is hospitalising people and it is killing people."He warned of a "tsunami" of cases as global infections soar to records fuelled by both Omicron and Delta, healthcare systems are overwhelmed, and governments struggle to tame the virus, which has killed more than 5.8 million people.'BILLIONS COMPLETELY UNPROTECTED'Tedros repeated his call for greater equity globally in the distribution of and access to vaccines.Based on the current rate of vaccine rollout, 109 countries will miss the WHO's target for 70% of the world's population to be fully vaccinated by July, Tedros added. That aim is seen as helping end the acute phase of the pandemic."Booster after booster in a small number of countries will not end a pandemic while billions remain completely unprotected," he said.WHO adviser Bruce Aylward said 36 nations had not even reached 10 percent vaccination cover. Among severe patients worldwide, 80% were unvaccinated, he added.In its weekly epidemiological report on Thursday, the WHO said cases increased by 71%, or 9.5 million, in the week to Jan. 2 from a week earlier, while deaths fell by 10%, or 41,000.Another variant B.1.640 - first documented in multiple countries in September 2021 - is among those being monitored by the WHO but is not circulating widely, said the WHO's technical lead on Covid-19, Maria van Kerkhove.There are two other categories of greater significance the WHO uses to track variants: "variant of concern", which includes Delta and Omicron, and "variant of interest".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-may-be-less-severe-in-young-and-old-but-not-mild-who-101641486556133.html
06-01-2022||World||It takes only 20 minutes to get Covid if you are wearing a cloth mask: Study||The effectiveness of different types of masks is again on the radar as the spread of Omicron has once again proved the necessity of an effective first shield of defence. According to recent observations made by scientists and experts, cloth mask may not provide enough protection against the virus.According to American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, N95 masks are the best to offer maximum protection against the transmission of the virus. It takes at least 2.5 hours to transmit the infection from one person to another person if the infected person is not even wearing a mask. If both are wearing N95 masks, then the virus will take 25 hours to transmit. Surgical masks offer better protection than the cloth mask though data shows that if the infected person is not wearing a mask and the second person is wearing a surgical mask, then the infection can transmit in 30 minutes.As Omicron spreads, time to upgrade your mask. Why? Experts explainWhile many people choose cloth mask over N95 for comfort, experts recommend pairing cloth masks with surgical models. Cloth masks with just one layer can block larger droplets but small aerosols don't get blocked by a cloth shield. A cloth mask or a surgical mask won't make much of a difference if the variant is highly transmissible.Why cloth masks may not be effective against OmicronOmicron is the most fast-spreading variant of SARs-CoV-2. People with two and three doses of vaccinations are getting infected by the infection. So, the first line of defence needs to be activated with Covid-appropriate behaviour starting with masking. Data shows if two persons are not wearing the mask and one of them is infected, then the infection will spread in 15 minutes. If the second person wears a cloth mask, then the virus will take 20 minutes. If both are wearing cloth masks, then the infection will spread in 27 minutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-takes-only-20-minutes-to-get-covid-if-you-are-wearing-a-cloth-mask-study-101641485254024.html
06-01-2022||World||China to complete space station, plans 40 launches in 2022||China will complete building the country’s space station in 2022 and has planned more than 40 launches for the year including manned flights.The launches for the year include two Shenzhou crewed missions, two Tianzhou cargo spacecraft and the under-construction space station’s additional two modules, the Xinhua News Agency reported on Thursday, citing a recent announcement by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC).Other missions relating to the space station include in-orbital rendezvous and docking, extravehicular activities and spacecraft return, the CASC said, adding that the Long March-6A carrier rocket will also make its maiden flight in 2022.In recent times, China has returned rock and soil samples to earth from the surface of the moon and landed a six-wheeled robot on Mars; it also landed a craft on the far side of the moon in 2019.Once built, China’s space station will be the only alternative to the two-decade-old, US-led International Space Station (ISS), which may be retired in 2024, Reuters news agency reported.The ISS - from which China is excluded - comprises Canada, Japan, the Russian Federation, the US, and 11 member states of the European Space Agency.Meanwhile, the under-construction space station has successfully moved a cargo spaceship with its giant robotic arm.The 47-minute manoeuvre on Thursday morning was the first test for Tiangong’s 10-metre robotic arm. “The robotic arm attached to China’s space station successfully grabbed and moved the Tianzhou-2 cargo ship in a test on Thursday,” the China Manned Space Engineering Office (CMSEO) said.“The operation tested the feasibility and effectiveness of using the mechanical arm to manoeuvre a section of the space station while in orbit and verified the arm’s capability of handling heavy loads,” China’s official English broadcaster, CGTN reported.The success has paved the way for follow-up in-orbit assembly work for the construction of the space station later this year, the report added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-complete-space-station-plans-40-launches-in-2022-101641477093194.html

But its proximity to the Middle East, its location on the energy transit roads, and its position on the Bab al-Mandab Strait all make this country of great importance for global powers,” the foreign affairs website The Diplomat had reported earlier.The region, according to Reuters, is threatened by instability in South Sudan, where China has substantial oil investments, and by Islamist militancy in Somalia, which frequently spills over into deadly attacks on civilians in neighbouring Kenya, where China also has substantial investments.Wang’s announcement comes as US Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa Jeffrey Feltman, a veteran diplomat, prepares to step down this month after more than nine months in the job, dominated by the crisis in Ethiopia and a coup in Sudan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eye-on-india-china-to-appoint-special-envoy-to-horn-of-africa-101641474392999.html
06-01-2022||World||Sundance Film Festival to go virtual due to Omicron surge||The in-person return of the Sundance Film Festival has been cancelled due to a surge in COVID-19 cases spurred by the Omicron variant, with the festival going completely virtual.As per Variety, the festival was scheduled to take place from January 20-30, and offer a virtual component for those who could not attend in person.However, due to the rise in COVID-19 cases, fuelled by the Omicron variant, the film festival had to do away with the in-person event. The organisers of the festival made the announcement on Wednesday."Despite the most ambitious protocols, the Omicron variant with its unexpectedly high transmissibility rates is pushing the limits of health safety, travel and other infrastructures across the country," organisers said in a statement.They added, "The festival's in-person Utah elements will be moving online this year. While we're disappointed to not provide the full hybrid experience and gather in-person as intended, audiences this year will still experience the magic and energy of our festival."The Sundance Institute added how difficult the decision was to make given that "as a nonprofit, our Sundance spirit is in making something work against the odds. But with case numbers forecasted to peak in our host community the week of the festival we cannot knowingly put our staff and community at risk. The undue stress to Summit County's health services and our more than 1,500 staff and volunteers would be irresponsible in this climate."New films, extended reality ("XR") programming, artists conversations and more content will all be accessible through virtual portals, they added.Sundance had planned to institute COVID safety measures such as requiring booster shots as well as negative test results, plus banning food and drink at screenings.Organisers were hopeful that Sundance could proceed in person, given that domestic movie theatres have not yet closed in the wake of the new variant -- and in fact, Sony's 'Spider-Man: No Way Home' continues to drive the public to the cineplex in record pandemic numbers.Sundance, of course, is not just a series of spartan film screenings.

Ransoms for hostages sometimes run into hundreds of thousands of dollars.In November, Chinese authorities issued a travel advisory warning their citizens and companies against travel to “high-risk” areas in Nigeria and other parts of Africa.The state of security across Nigeria has deteriorated under President Muhammadu Buhari, a retired military general who served as Nigeria’s military head of state during 1983-1985 before returning to power in 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/three-chinese-nationals-abducted-in-nigeria-police-say-101641468784227.html

"Rejecting cookies should be as easy as accepting them".In its statement, the watchdog said it had found that the facebook.com, google.fr and youtube.com websites didn't allow the refusal of cookies easily, citing Google's video-streaming platform.The CNIL said the two companies had three months to comply with its orders or face an extra penalty payment of 100,000 euros per day of delay.These include the obligation for Google and Facebook to provide French internet users simpler tools for refusing cookies, in order to guarantee their consent.The CNIL said that while Google and Facebook provided a virtual button to allow the immediate acceptance of cookies, there was no equivalent to refuse them as easily."People trust us to respect their right to privacy and keep them safe. We understand our responsibility to protect that trust and are committing to further changes and active work with the CNIL in light of this decision," a Google spokesperson said.Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.CNIL's previous record fine in 2020 also targeted Google and amounted to 100 million euros.At the time, the CNIL found that Google's French websites didn't seek the prior consent of visitors before advertising cookies were saved on computers and failed to provide clear information about how it intended to make use of them.Kiefer said the issues have been resolved since then.In 2020, the CNIL strengthened consent rights over ad trackers, saying websites operating in France should keep a register of internet users' refusal to accept cookies for at least six months.It also said internet users should be able to easily reconsider any initial agreement concerning cookies via a web link or an icon that should be visible on all the website pages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-hit-with-150-million-euro-french-fine-over-cookie-breaches-101641466847727.html

It drew the ire of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as well. During a press conference on Wednesday addressing the ongoing fifth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic due to the Omicron variant, he described the behaviour of the passengers as “completely irresponsible”.That approximately 150 passengers who were aboard that flight on December 30 are now stuck in Mexico. Sunwing has cancelled their return flight following the uproar. Other carriers have followed suit, including Air Canada and Air Transat. The latter tweeted that it confirmed that the unruly passengers “will be denied boarding based on our legal and regulatory obligations to ensure the safety of both our passengers and crew, which is our top priority”.The partying group, which included prominent social media influencers and participants in reality TV programmes and others, may face further action from Canadian authorities.In a joint statement, minister of transport Omar Alghabra, minister of health Jean-Yves Duclos, and minister of public safety Marco Mendicino said they were “aware of unacceptable behaviour and cases of non-compliance with mask wearing and other air safety requirements that occurred on a privately chartered flight from Montréal to Cancun on December 30, 2021”.“Our government takes reported incidents such as these very seriously. We have directed our respective departmental officials to immediately launch an investigation into these allegations of non-compliance with Covid-19 and air safety rules and regulations,” they added.The actions of the passengers have angers many Canadians as the incident came to light as several provinces are reimposing restrictions and Quebec has also reintroduced an overnight curfew.The ministers warned that if non-compliance was determined, passengers could face fines of up to 5,000 Canadian dollars ($3,917).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trip-to-mexico-for-violating-covid-norms-canadian-airlines-refuse-to-fly-back-150-passengers-101641467191614.html

Africa CDC director John Nkengasong told a news conference that he was encouraged by the way South Africa, the first to detect Omicron strain, handled the latest Covid-19 wave driven by the new variant of concern."We are very encouraged with what we saw in South Africa in this period," Africa's top public health official said."The period where we are using severe lockdowns as a tool is over, we should actually be looking at how we use public health and social measures more carefully and in a balanced way as the vaccination increases," he added.Countries around the world are tightening restrictions amid the spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant but have avoided severe lockdowns given the low level of hospitalisations. South Africa first identified Omicron in November last year when the country was witnessing a worrying surge in Covid-19 cases. While South Africa is past its peak of Omicron-driven Covid cases, West is reporting record new infections.'Cannot afford doctors falling sick': AIIMS doctor as Covid spreads among medicsIndia is also reporting an exponential surge in Covid-19 cases, with Maharashtra and Delhi leading the Omicron tally.

Yuzhou, a city of 1.1 million in the same province, is also under a lockdown.The northwestern city of Xian, already locked down for two weeks, reported 63 local Covid-19 cases for Wednesday, up from 35 a day earlier.More than 42,000 residents of Xian including close contacts continue to be under quarantine.All international flights in Xian’s Xianyang International Airport were halted from Wednesday, the Xinhua news agency reported on Thursday; domestic flights had been suspended earlier.The ongoing outbreak in the city has been linked to a passenger who came on a flight from Pakistan.In a rare admission, state media reports said Xian epidemic prevention policy has come under criticism for being too strict.“We were woken up in the middle of the night by a knock on the door and told to pack up and leave, without further explanation,” an anonymous resident was quoted as saying in Chinese state-run media.Posts about a pregnant woman who lost her baby after waiting outside of a local hospital, bleeding, triggered an outcry on Chinese social media. Two Xian health officials were given warnings for not doing their job well due to the incident.The general manager of the hospital was suspended, with a few other staffers removed from their roles, the reports said.The mainland reported 132 new locally transmitted Covid-19 cases in all, the national health commission (NHC) said in its daily report on Thursday.Besides the cases in Henan and Shaanxi, five local infections were reported from the eastern province of Zhejiang.Flights for Beijing from Yiwu, a global hub for small commodities in Zhejiang province, were indefinitely suspended on Thursday.More regions and cities are taking pre-emptive measures ahead of the Games and the Chinese New Year holidays.The central Chinese city of Wuhan where the first cases of Covid-19 were detected in late 2019 announced closer monitoring of people entering the city with those responsible for manning inter-provincial highways being put on alert.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases on the mainland had reached 103,121 by Wednesday till date with the death toll remaining at 4,636, according to the NHC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-more-curbs-in-central-china-xian-suspends-international-flights-101641465760583.html

This has led to the resignation of Kazakhstan's government, news agency Reuters reported. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev called the demonstrators "a band of international terrorists", and requested the intervention of peacekeeping troops from Russia and allied countries.Demonstrations are rare in the country but took place infrequently in the 2000s.January 2021 - The protests beginning on January 2 have left Kazakhstan’s largest metropolis, Almaty, in flames as protesters took down the statue of first President Nursultan Nazarbayev. Kazakh protests have been sparked by the steep hike in the price of liquified petroleum gas (LPG), the country's main car fuel. This is accompanied by higher interest rates and explosive inflation in recent years.Twelve cops have been killed as thousands of people take on the street holding violent protests.Also Read | Explained: How Kazakhstan protests started and the bigger pictureJune 2019 - As protests broke out against the change of president from longtime leader Nursultan Nazarbayev to Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, about 500 people were arrested in 2019. Young activists were at the forefront of this movement as they chanted mantras like "No to the dictatorship" and “shame, shame, shame!”, exclaiming they have a choice on how the country should be run and who should run it.April 2016 - Fuelled by the change in Kazakhstan’s Land Code, around 4,000 people holding unauthorised protests across the country. The new law allowed foreigners to buy Kazakh agricultural lands for 25 years.One protestor in Aktobe city told BBC, "After 25 years, they will stay for 65. After 65 their descendants will take Kazakhstan's citizenship and our descendants will be their slaves."Police detained several people including two Reuters reporters for a short duration before releasing them.On May 5, almost two weeks after the protests began, the government had to concede defeat and order a moratorium on some provisions of the land code.December 2011 - Known as the Zhanaozen massacre, 14 protestors were killed as during a clash with the police in the oil town of Zhanaozen on Kazaksatan’s independence day. Workers demanding unpaid danger money, higher wages and better working conditions were key forces.

06-01-2022||World||Canada: Rise in admissions of infants with Covid-19 in hospitals||Four major Canadian paediatric hospitals have warned that with “the rise of Omicron, hospitals are starting to see a disturbing, potential new trend - admissions of infants with Covid-19”.The four hospitals, CHEO in Ottawa, The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, McMaster Children’s Hospital in Hamilton and Kingston Health Sciences Centre in Kingston, made that statement in a joint release issued on Wednesday.Since the middle of December, two of the hospitals, CHEO and McMaster admitted six babies under the age of 12 with COVID-19 infections. Prior to that, the statement said, “it was a rare occurrence that an infant was hospitalised for Covid-19 infection”. At CHEO, it added, vaccination status in these particular cases is being tracked, all the admitted infants’ mothers had not been jabbed against the coronavirus.The joint statement was also an appeal to expectant women to get vaccinated for the health of their children. The hospitals said they are “encouraging anyone who is pregnant to get vaccinated against Covid-19 for the protection of their baby, as well as themselves”. There are as yet no vaccines available for infants.“Infants are especially at risk because they have an immature immune system that has difficulty in combating disease. And if the mother has not been vaccinated or infected, they do not have the protection of maternal antibodies transferred during the third trimester of pregnancy,” it noted. They also said that it had been well studied in other infectious diseases like flu and whooping cough that maternal antibodies resulting from vaccination provided protection for the first six months of a child’s life.Addressing a concern that may have led to vaccine hesitancy among some pregnant women, they also pointed out that research showed there was “no evidence that Covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy is associated with any adverse pregnancy outcomes”.“Pregnant individuals are considered a high-risk population for Covid-19 complications, based on higher rates of Covid-19 hospitalisation, ICU admission, and death compared with non-pregnant individuals of the same age,” the statement also said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-rise-in-admissions-of-infants-with-covid-19-in-hospitals-101641453806804.html
06-01-2022||World||Covid-19 in Canada: Justin Trudeau criticises anti-vaxxers||As the fifth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic caused mainly by the Omicron variant continues in Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau attacked those who still refused to get vaccinated, saying Canadians were “angry” and “frustrated” with the anti-vaxxers.Addressing a press conference on Wednesday on the health crisis facing the country, Justin Trudeau said, “It’s not just about governments and health workers frustrated that there are Canadians who still continue to choose to not get vaccinated. It’s fellow Canadians as well.”The Canadian government has also instituted vaccine mandates requiring proof of being jabbed for travelling by air, train and on cruise ships, and some provinces bar those without vaccination certificates from accessing some facilities like gyms, bars, nightclubs, restaurants, as well as sports and entertainment events.Case levels in Canada continue to be of concern as its chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam tweeted on Wednesday, “Covid-19 cases have rapidly accelerated, with #Omicron now predominating and widespread across much of the country. The latest 7-day average of 40,696 cases/day is a 78% increase over last week.”According to official data, about 82% of the population has received one dose of a Covid-19 jab, with nearly 77% being fully vaccinated. A booster programme is also under way for those aged above 18 years. Vaccination uptake in Canada is among the highest worldwide.In his criticism of those choosing not to get vaccinated, Justin Trudeau added, “When people are seeing cancer treatments and elective surgeries put off because beds are filled with people who chose not to get vaccinated, they’re frustrated.”“When people see that we are in lockdowns or serious public health restrictions right now because of the risk posed to all of us by unvaccinated people, people get angry,” he said.Canada’s healthcare system has come under pressure in the latest wave: While hospitalisations and deaths remain lower than previous outbreaks, the very transmissible Omicron variant has led to large numbers of medical personnel infected and unavailable.With molecular tests now restricted in several jurisdictions to symptomatic or hospitalised patients, Canada has been struggling to meet the demand for testing and has turned to rapid antigen kits. Trudeau also announced that 140 million such kits will be distributed to the provinces and territories this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-in-canada-justin-trudeau-criticises-antivaxxers-101641450087129.html
06-01-2022||World||Why AUKUS is good for containing Chinese belligerence in Indo-Pacific?||France is still nursing a grievance over Australia nullifying a USD 59 billion air independent propulsion (AIP) submarine deal and opting out for nuclear powered conventional weapon attack or SSNs submarines with US and UK under the September 15, 2021 AUKUS pact.While Paris may have legitimate reasons for being upset with Australia for renegading on the submarine deal, the emerging picture in Indo-Pacific clearly shows that AIP submarines would have been a half-measure in containing a belligerent China under all powerful President Xi Jinping. Given the strategic environment in Indo-Pacific and South China Sea in particular, the Australian choice for an SSN is definitely a better option in tackling a rapidly growing PLA Navy and Chinese intermediate range ballistic missile arsenal.The state of strategic play is such that India also has no choice but to go for long-range nuclear-powered submarines and delivery platforms as it is only a matter of time when the Chinese carrier force will be patrolling the Indian Ocean. With two nuclear submarines already operational and third one a work in progress, India also is building a leverage in case PLA decides strong arm tactics on the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control (LAC), like it did in May 2020.If one overlooks the noise over Australia scuttling the French submarine deal, it is not very difficult to understand why Canberra decided the nuclear option as it is a deterrent to Chinese Taiwan ambitions. Today’s signing of security pact between Japan and Australia, once World War II adversaries, with the bottom line on convergence in Indo-Pacific is also a step in the direction to ask China to mend its aggression. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison described the agreement “will underpin greater and more complex practical engagement between the Australian Defence Force and the Japanese Self-Defence Forces.” Juxtapose the new security pact with AUKUS and Quad and the larger picture emerges on the Indo-Pacific with India having a logistics agreement with all the Quad partners.Rather than viewing AUKUS from a French commercial perspective, the Australian nuclear powered conventional attack submarines will be an answer to the massive deployment of DF-21 and DF 26 series of ballistic missiles by the PLA on Chinese east coast to prevent US aircraft carrier enter the South China Sea in the worst case scenario over Taiwan. Given the range of these ballistic missiles, the US aircraft carrier force will have to operate outside the first chain of islands after China or else be on the cross-hairs of these PLA delivery platforms. While US and Russia were bound by the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty since 1987 and before suspension in 2019, the PLA has built a massive intermediate range ballistic missile arsenal with its propaganda media nick-naming DF-21 and DF 26 as carrier killer and Guam killer weapons.With the advent of Australian nuclear submarines, the Chinese missile sites on east coast will be threatened by the sub-surface attack platforms which can stay under water for months together in South China Sea or the Indo-Pacific. Fact is that AUKUS is a game-changer for Indo-Pacific as even the latest AIP diesel submarines must surface, in effect betraying their positions, in weeks for charging their batteries. Thus, from a strategic perspective, the Australian nuclear attack submarines with conventional ballistic missiles as deterrents will allow US aircraft carrier to operate between Chinese coast and first island chain and also enforce laws of the seas and freedom of navigation in South China Sea. As China is threatening Taiwan on a daily basis by breaching its air defence identification zone, it is for the US to speed up the SSN production for Australia as time is running out for Taipei and the security of Indo-Pacific.
06-01-2022||World||Explained: How Kazakhstan protests started and the bigger picture||Many cities across Kazakhstan have been witnessing unrest as thousands of protesters took to streets against the sharp increase in price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), which most Kazakhs use as car fuel.The price rise came as the country ended a gradual transition to electronic trading for LPG to halt state subsidies for fuel and let the market dictate prices.Even though the government announced on Tuesday that fuel prices will be reduced to a level even lower than before the increase, and on Wednesday President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev sacked his cabinet, the protests are continuing.What is the main issue?The fuel market reform was first broached in 2015 came into effect at the start of the month. It sought to remove state price caps for butane and propane - often referred to as 'road fuels for the poor' due to their low cost - while making sure the local market was well supplied.Previous subsidies had created a situation when Kazakhstan, a major oil producer, regularly faced shortages of butane and propane.When prices were fully liberalised on January 1 (Saturday), the government expectations were that supplies to the domestic market would rise and help address the chronic shortages.But the measure backfired, as prices nearly doubled overnight to 120 tenge per litre.Where did the protest start?The popular anger spilled over first in western Kazakhstan, an oil-rich area, over the weekend. By Tuesday, the entire country was under its grip.The anger among the public was already running high because of rising inflation which was closing in on 9% year-on-year - the highest in more than five years - leading the central bank to raise interest rates to 9.75%.The resource-rich country of 19 million is estimated to have a million people living below the poverty line.The protests have yet to have an impact on Kazakhstan's oil production.Eight cops killed in protestsEight police and national guard troops were killed in the unrest on Tuesday and Wednesday, according to Russian news agency Sputnik.Demonstrators have taken control of the airport in Almaty, Kazakhstan's biggest city, news agency Reuters reported, leading to cancellation of flights.President Tokayev said in a televised speech that foreign-trained "terrorist" gangs were seizing buildings, infrastructure and weapons, and had taken five aircraft, including foreign ones, at Almaty airport.A resident of Almaty told Reuters that vodka was being distributed at the main square in Almaty. "There is complete anarchy in the street," he added.A Russia-led security alliance of ex-Soviet states will send peacekeeping forces to Kazakhstan, Armenia's prime minister said on Thursday.The Nazarbayev angleInitially sparked by anger at a fuel price rise, the protests have quickly spread to take in wider opposition to President Tokayev's predecessor Nursultan Nazarbayev, who retained significant power as “Leader of the Nation” despite quitting in 2019 after a nearly three-decade rule.Nazarbayev, 81, has been widely seen as the main political force in Nur-Sultan, the capital which bears his name. His family is believed to control much of the economy, the largest in Central Asia. He has not been seen or heard from since the protests began.Footage emerged on social media which showed protesters chanting below a giant bronze statue of Nazarbayev, strung with ropes, which they later pulled down.Nazarbayev, who has been removed from his powerful position by Tokayev in a bid to placate the protesters, still has the support or Russian president Vladimir Putin.The government response to the protestKazakh authorities imposed a nationwide state of emergency and sent military units to fight what Tokayev called “terrorists”.The state of emergency gives Tokayev the power to impose a curfew, ban protests, and restrict internet access to quell the rare show of dissent in Kazakhstan.There was an internet blackout around the country by Wednesday after a day of mobile internet disruptions and partial restrictions, according to NetBlocks, a London-based monitoring agency.The bigger pictureThe action marks the second major move by the Kremlin in as many years to shore up an ally facing upheaval. In 2020, President Vladimir Putin stepped in to back Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko’s crackdown on popular protests, which drew sanctions from the US and its allies.The Kremlin has regularly condemned street protests in former Soviet states, labeling them attempts by the West to use “colour revolutions” to overthrow governments.Russia is facing “strategic instability on both flanks and it can’t afford to get distracted,” Alexander Baunov, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center, wrote on Facebook. “Just as Russia was encroaching on Ukraine, suddenly there are protests across Kazakhstan, which might need saving.”State Department spokesman Ned Price called Kazakhstan a “valued partner” and said the US was following the situation closely.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-how-kazakhstan-protests-started-and-the-bigger-picture-101641437247491.html
06-01-2022||World||Kazakhstan declares state of emergency nationwide||Kazakhstan on Wed-nesday declared a nationwide state of emergency after protests over a fuel price hike erupted into clashes and saw demonstrators storm government buildings.Russian news agencies Interfax, TASS and RIA Novosti reported the state of emergency, quoting a statement shown on Kazakh state television. States of emergency had earlier been imposed in the epicentres of the rallies - financial capital Almaty, the Mangystau province, and capital Nur-Sultan.Earlier in the day, Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev vowed to take tough action to quell deadly protests that posed into the biggest challenge to the country’s leadership in decades. The demonstrations started over the weekend in western Kazakhstan over a jump in fuel prices but quickly spilled into broader discontent drawing thousands to the streets across the country.In the former capital, Almaty, both city hall and the president’s residence were ablaze after protesters stormed the buildings on Wednesday, Interfax reported.“I intend to act as harshly as possible,” Tokayev said in a national address, law-enforcement officers were killed in the line of duty, he said, blaming the protests on “financially motivated conspirators”.Some of the protesters called for the country’s first president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who for over three decades has been the major political force in the country, to let go of the reins of power and chose Tokayev as successor in 2019. Tokayev, whose primary residence is in the capital Nur-Sultan, initially sought to appease protesters by imposing price caps on motor fuels for the next six months and accepting his government’s resignation. He also declared a state of emergency in and around Almaty, Nur-Sultan and the oil-rich Mangystau region, but the measures failed to ease the tensions.Tokayev also announced that he was taking over as head of the Security Council from Nazarbayev and pledged to stay in the capital “whatever happens”.Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko discussed the unrest in Kazakhstan in separate conversations on Wednesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, the Belarusian news agency Belta said.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said that Kazakhstan could solve its own problems and it was important that no one interfered from the outside.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kazakhstan-declares-state-of-emergency-nationwide-101641435028329.html

06-01-2022||World||Novak Djokovic denied entry to Australia amid Covid-19 vaccine outcry||Novak Djokovic was denied entry to Australia after border officials overruled a vaccine exemption that sparked a national uproar and underlines the complex alignment of federal and state Covid-19 policies that’s become a hallmark of the nation’s pandemic journey.The tennis star, who was due to contest the Australian Open this month despite doubts over his vaccine status, provided insufficient proof to enter the country under current pandemic rules, the Australian Border Force said Thursday. While he was earlier granted a medical exemption to enter the state of Victoria, the federal government revoked that decision after officials questioned the athlete for hours at Melbourne Airport.“Mr Djokovic failed to provide appropriate evidence to meet the entry requirements to Australia, and his visa has been subsequently canceled,” the ABF statement said. “Non-citizens who do not hold a valid visa on entry or who have had their visa canceled will be detained and removed from Australia.”Djokovic’s lawyers are appealing the decision and he’s been moved to a Melbourne hotel while that process takes place, the ABC and Sydney Morning Herald reported. He is chasing a record 21st Grand Slam victory after winning nine Australian Open singles titles, including the past three tournaments.The backflip is the latest example of the confusion surrounding Covid guidelines that are plaguing both officials and citizens as case numbers continue to surge. Throughout the pandemic, states have largely set their own policies on the entry of overseas and local visitors, as well as lockdowns, but the federal government ultimately decides on who can enter the country. “There are no special cases: rules are rules,” Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters in Canberra. “If you are not double vaccinated and not an Australian resident or citizen, you cannot come.” The disparity between state policies has caused upheaval during the holiday period, with some states demanding tests and different requirements for residents from other regions. The two most populous states, New South Wales and Victoria have loosened entry restrictions for both overseas and local visitors even as the omicron variant has seen case numbers surge in recent weeks, with hospitalizations also slowly climbing. Melbourne AngerThe initial exemption for Djokovic, who has previously criticized vaccine mandates, sparked criticism and anger in host-city Melbourne, which became the world’s most locked-down city during the pandemic. The player was among a handful of competitors granted medical exemptions for the tournament, the first of the four annual Grand Slam events, which begins Jan. 17. Arriving players and support staff from overseas who have a valid medical exemption can follow the same rules for travelers into Victoria state who are fully vaccinated, though face some greater restrictions on entering sensitive settings such as schools. It’s a marked departure from the experience of the world’s tennis elite in 2021 where 14-day hotel quarantine in Melbourne was required with strict rules around daily testing and close contacts. Australia’s Covid-Zero strategy to eliminate coronavirus infections in the community has now been abandoned in all but one of the eight states and territories, with the nation recording more than 64,000 new cases on Wednesday.Victoria state, which includes Melbourne, has a double-dose vaccination level of 93% for those over 12 years of age. On Thursday the state reported a record 21,997 new Covid-19 infections, with hospitalizations rising to 631. While many Victorians will welcome the Covid rules being applied to overseas sportspeople as well as themselves, the denial of Djokovic’s entry into the state hasn’t gone down well in his native Serbia.  “I told our Novak that the whole of Serbia is with him and that our authorities are taking all measures to stop the maltreatment of the world’s best tennis player in the shortest possible time,” President Aleksandar Vucic said in an Instagram post translated from Serbian. (Updates with PM comment, more detail from 6th paragraph)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2022 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/novak-djokovic-denied-entry-to-australia-amid-covid-19-vaccine-outcry-101641434052023.html
06-01-2022||World||Bases housing US troops in Iraq, Syria come under attack||Iraqi military bases hosting US troops in Iraq's western Anbar province and the capital of Baghdad were hit by Katyusha rockets Wednesday while in Syria, eight rounds of indirect fire landed inside a base with members of the US-led coalition, the Iraqi and US militaries said.No casualties were reported in the three attacks, part of a series that began on Monday, the anniversary of a US airstrike that killed top Iranian general Qassim Soleimani in Baghdad two years ago.According to an Iraqi officer, an Iraqi base housing US troops in the western Anbar province was hit with five Katyusha rockets on Wednesday evening; three other rockets fell outside the base's parameter. The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said US-led coalition forces at the base were forced into shelters by the barrage.There was no immediate comment from the coalition, which is in Iraq to help fight the Islamic State group.Later Wednesday, a previously-unheard of group in Iraq calling itself Qassem al-Jabarayn claimed responsibility for the Ain al-Asad attack. The group vowed in an online post to keep up attacks until the full withdrawal of U.S. forces.Since Soleimani’s death, Iran-backed militias in Iraq have become increasingly unruly and disparate, although some analysts argue the militias have splintered only to allow them to claim attacks under different names to mask their involvement.Earlier Wednesday, the Iraqi military said a rocket launcher with one rocket was located in a residential district in western Baghdad, an area used in the past by Iran-backed militias to fire at the airport.In eastern Syria, the rounds hit a base run by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces with a small coalition advisory presence. The coalition said in a statement there was minor damage.Coalition forces, acting on intelligence, responded by firing six rounds of artillery towards the point of origin of the attack just outside the eastern town of Mayadeen, a stronghold of Iran-backed fighters, the statement said.The statement said “Iran-supported malign actors fired ... from within civilian infrastructure with no regard for civilian safety.” It said that hours earlier, U.S.-led coalition forces had observed several launch sites near the base known as Green Village. Coalition forces conducted several strikes to eliminate the threats, it added.“The Coalition reserves the right to defend itself and partner forces against any threat, and will continue to do everything within its power to protect those forces,” said Maj. Gen. John W. Brennan, Jr., commander of the joint task force.John Kirby, Pentagon press secretary, said Wednesday that the military has been preparing for stepped-up attacks in Iraq around the end of the year.“We’re very mindful of the threat environment and it is very dynamic right now,” he said. Kirby said the attacks could be related to the anniversary of Soleimani's killing or a reaction to the continuing presence of American forces in Iraq — but likely are a combination of both.Iranian-backed militias have wanted all US troops out of the country, and many believed that would happen by the end of the year.On Monday, two armed drones were shot down as they headed toward a facility housing US advisors at Baghdad airport. Two explosives-laden drones targeting an Iraqi military base housing US troops in western Anbar province were destroyed on Tuesday.The 2020 US drone strike at Baghdad’s airport killed Soleimani, who was the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force, and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy commander of Iran-backed militias in Iraq known as the Popular Mobilization Forces.Pro-Iran Shiite factions in Iraq have vowed revenge for the killing and have conditioned the end of attacks against the US presence in Iraq on the full exit of American troops from the country.The US-led coalition formally ended its combat mission supporting Iraqi forces in the ongoing fight against the Islamic State group last month. Some 2,500 troops will remain as the coalition shifts to an advisory mission to continue supporting Iraqi forces.The top US commander for the Middle East Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie warned in an interview with The Associated Press last month that he expects increasing attacks on US and Iraqi personnel by Iranian-backed militias determined to get American forces out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bases-housing-us-troops-in-iraq-syria-come-under-attack-101641428123195.html
06-01-2022||World||North Korea says hypersonic missile tested to modernise weaponry||North Korea said Thursday it has successfully launched a hypersonic missile as part of efforts to modernise its strategic weapons systems, days after leader Kim Jong Un vowed to bolster his military forces despite pandemic-related difficulties.Wednesday's test, the North's first known weapons tests in about two months, indicates that the country will press ahead with plans to build powerful, sophisticated missiles rather than returning to disarmament talks anytime soon.The official Korean Central News Agency said the Central Committee of the ruling Workers' Party expressed “great satisfaction” at the results of the missile test observed by leading weapons officials.It's the second known test-flight of a hypersonic missile since North Korea first tested such a weapon last September. It wasn't immediately known if both are the exactly same type of hypersonic missile.“The successive successes in the test launches in the hypersonic missile sector have strategic significance in that they hasten a task for modernizing strategic armed force of the state,” a KCNA dispatch said. The word “strategic” implies the missile is being developed to deliver nuclear weapons.Hypersonic weapons, which fly at speeds in excess of Mach 5, or five times the speed of sound, could pose crucial challenges to missile defence systems because of their speed and maneuverability.It's unclear whether and how soon North Korea could manufacture such a high-tech missile, but it was among a wish-list of sophisticated military assets that Kim disclosed early last year, along with a multi-warhead missile, spy satellites, solid-fuelled long-range missiles and underwater-launched nuclear missiles.The North's latest launch was first detected by its neighbours.The US military called it a ballistic missile launch that “highlights the destabilising impact of (North Korea's) illicit weapons programme”. South Korea and Japan expressed concerns or regrets over the launch. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reiterated that North Korea should resume talks with other countries.A US-led diplomacy on North Korea's nuclear programme remains stalled since 2019 due to disputes over international sanctions on the North. The Biden administration has repeatedly called for resuming the nuclear diplomacy “anywhere and at any time” without preconditions, but North Korea has argued the US must first withdraw its hostility against it before any talks can restart.During last week's plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers' Party, Kim repeated his vow to expand his country's military capabilities without publicly presenting any new positions on Washington and Seoul.The North's advancing nuclear arsenal is the core of Kim's rule, and he's called it “a powerful treasured sword” that thwarts potential US aggressions. During his 10-year rule, he's conducted an unusually large number of weapons tests to acquire an ability to launch nuclear strikes on the American mainland.But his country's economy has been faltering severely in the past two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the sanctions and his government's own mismanagement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-says-hypersonic-missile-tested-to-modernise-weaponry-101641428163099.html
