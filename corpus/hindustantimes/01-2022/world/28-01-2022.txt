Pictures posted by the first lady on Twitter showed the gray-and-white-striped pet prowling in the red-carpeted splendor of the presidential residence.It was the kind of soft, even cuddly Friday news the White House might need in these days of tension with Russia, soaring inflation and a stubborn, if receding, Covid-19 pandemic."We're waiting for a bad news day," Press Secretary Jen Psaki joked back in June about going through with the long-expected cat plan. "If you see a tail wagging coming out of the briefing room, you'll know something bad is about to happen."Willow brings serious political chops: she's a farm cat from Pennsylvania -- ground zero in tight presidential elections -- and was first encountered in 2020 when she jumped onto a stage where the future first lady was campaigning."Willow made quite an impression on Dr Biden," Michael LaRosa, the first lady's press secretary, said."Seeing their immediate bond, the owner of the farm knew that Willow belonged with Dr Biden."LaRosa said, "Willow is settling into the White House with her favorite toys, treats, and plenty of room to smell and explore."There was no answer to questions on Willow's ability to bridge the bipartisan divide with dogs, but Washington probably won't have to wait long to find out: the Bidens got a new German Shepherd puppy, Commander, just before Christmas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/meet-willow-bidens-welcome-first-family-cat-to-white-house-101643380126259.html
28-01-2022||World||UN rights chief welcome to visit Xinjiang, only for cooperation: China||China on Friday said it welcomes a visit by the UN’s top rights official to Xinjiang but only for exchange and cooperation and not for “political manipulation”, essentially ruling out any probe by the global body to investigate allegations of human rights abuse against Muslim minorities.China has been accused of running massive internment camps where more than a million people from Muslim minority groups, majority of them Uighurs, have been held in mass detention.Beijing denies the allegations, saying the camps are for vocational training and deradicalisation.Responding to questions about a possible visit by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, to Xinjiang, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said an invitation had been issued long ago and was being discussed.“China welcomes UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Madame Michelle Bachelet to visit China and take a trip to Xinjiang. The invitation was extended a long time ago. Since then, the two sides have maintained communication over this,” Zhao said on Friday.“China’s position is consistent and clear. The purpose of the visit is to promote exchange and cooperation. We oppose any attempt to exploit this matter for political manipulation,” he added.To a related question, Zhao said: “I can assure you that Xinjiang enjoys stability and prosperity and residents there lead happy and fulfilling lives with their human rights fully protected.”“We firmly oppose acts that use issues relating to Xinjiang to attack and smear China in disregard of the fact that the region enjoys stability, development, prosperity and constant progress in its human rights cause,” the spokesperson added.The Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post had reported on Friday that approval for Bachelet’s visit was given only after the end of the Beijing Winter Olympics - to be held between February 4 and 20 - and on condition that it should be “friendly” and not framed as an investigation.Beijing also insisted that Bachelet’s office hold off on publishing a report on Xinjiang ahead of the Games, as requested by Washington, anonymous sources told the newspaper.The report is expected to be the UN’s first comprehensive ruling on the allegations of systematic abuse of rights, which western governments, including the US have called genocide.In December, a UN spokesperson said the human rights office was finalising its assessment of the situation in China’s Xinjiang, adding that Bachelet hoped to publish its report in the coming weeks and that there had been “no concrete progress” in long-running talks with Chinese officials on a proposed visit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-rights-chief-welcome-to-visit-xinjiang-only-for-cooperation-china-101643377804087.html

If I put a gun on the table and say that I come in peace, that's threatening," Sullivan told reporters. "And that's what we see now.""We hope that the Russian government is true to its word, and does not plan to, and will not, further invade Ukraine. But the facts suggest that it has the present ability to do that," he said.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Russian radio stations earlier on Friday that Moscow was not seeking war.Sullivan said Washington was now waiting for Russia's response to written documents by the United States and NATO sketching a diplomatic path out of the Ukraine crisis, and urged Russia to withdraw troops from near Ukraine's borders.He said those documents contained ways to calm the crisis with proposals for greater transparency around military drills in Europe, as well as on Ukrainian arms sales."We've addressed the possibility of reciprocal transparency measures with the Russian government, including on offensive weapons systems in Ukraine, as well as measures to increase confidence regarding military exercises and manoeuvres in Europe," Sullivan said.He said he hoped phone conversations or a physical meeting between American and Russian diplomats could then follow, reiterating that diplomacy was the only way forward.Sullivan also said economic sanctions on Russia after an invasion of Ukraine would be just one part of the West's response.Other measures would include export controls and greater defence of allies in Europe, and the United States would also prevent the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany from operating, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-says-it-wants-peace-but-has-gun-on-the-table-us-envoy-101643372537791.html

In some of the worst-hit areas, people had to wait for days on rooftops of flooded houses before finally being rescued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysian-floods-caused-1-4-billion-in-losses-government-101643371333965.html

"Whether the virus detected in the study will pose a risk for humans will require further study," WHO told Russian news agency Tass. WHO is aware of the new finding of Wuhan scientists and is in touch with the World Organization for Animal Health, the Food and Agriculture Organization to respond to this."Animals, particularly wild animals are the source of more than 75% of all emerging infectious diseases in humans, many of which are caused by novel viruses. Coronaviruses are often found in animals, including in bats which have been identified as a natural reservoir of many of these viruses," WHO said.The World Health Organization has said that whether NeoCov coronavirus, reportedly found among bats in South Africa, poses a threat to humans requires further study.

Coronaviruses are often found in animals, including in bats which have been identified as a natural reservoir of many of these viruses," WHO said.Chinese researchers have mentioned this new variant in a research paper that is yet to be peer-reviewed. They claimed that this virus has a high death and transmission rate. It is not SARS-CoV-2 but associated with the MERS Coronavirus which could kill 1 in 3 infected people.What is MERS-Coronavirus?MERS Coronavirus is Middles East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus. It is a zoonotic virus which means that it is transmitted between animals and people.It was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. According to WHO data, approximately 35% of reported patients with MERS-CoV have died. Typical MERS symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. Pneumonia, gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, are also reported as symptoms, but not very common. Most of the human cases of MERS-CoV infections spread through human to human infections.Florona, Deltacron, Omicron BA.2, NeoCov: ExplainedIn the recent few days, words like Florona, Deltacron have become a part of the Covid terminology, as scientists are engaged in tracking newer variants of SARS-CoV-2. However, Florona and Deltacron are not real variants. While Florona is a combination of flu and coronavirus, Deltacron, a combination of Delta and Omicron, never existed and might be a result of contamination. Omicron BA.2 is a sub-strain of Omicron, the variant which is driving the present surge of the pandemic.Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron are the variants of concern as classified by the WHO.NeoCov is not SARS-CoV-2; it is a separate virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/neocov-what-who-says-on-this-new-coronavirus-variant-found-among-bats-in-wuhan-101643366536512.html
28-01-2022||World||Thailand adopts guidelines for declaring Covid-19 endemic||Thai health authorities approved new guidelines Friday outlining the parameters for declaring the coronavirus pandemic an endemic disease.Official figures show that the country already meets the three criteria, but Ministry of Public Health spokesman Rungrueng Kitphati said it would still be between six months and a year before the government would be able to make the decision to start treating Covid-19 as an illness that is here to stay, like the flu or measles.Among other things, he said data from all of Thailand's provinces need to be checked, and authorities need to be sure that the figures remain at the current levels or improve before it can be declared endemic.The guidelines drawn up by the ministry's National Communicable Disease Committee are made up of three criteria: that there are fewer than 10,000 new cases per day; that the fatality rate is no higher than 0.1% of those who are admitted to the hospital with an infection; and that more than 80% of at-risk people have had at least two vaccinations.Currently, Thailand's daily new cases range between 7,000-9,000, and the fatality rate, which was more than 3% in the beginning of the pandemic, has declined to 0.1%, and more than 80% of at-risk people have been fully vaccinated, Rungrueng said.Thailand joins other countries in preparing to consider the virus endemic, though the World Health Organization has said it's currently too early to consider any immediate shift.The organization does not have clearly defined criteria for declaring Covid-19 an endemic disease, but its experts have previously said it will happen when the virus is more predictable and there are no sustained outbreaks.Speaking last week at a World Economic Forum panel, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious diseases doctor in the US, said Covid-19 could not be considered endemic until it drops to “a level that it doesn’t disrupt society.”Thailand reported 8,078 new cases and 22 deaths on Friday, for a total of 2.4 million confirmed cases and 22,098 deaths since the pandemic started in 2020.To date, it has administered 113.6 million doses of the vaccine and around 48.3 million people, or 70% of its population, are fully vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-adopts-guidelines-for-declaring-covid-19-endemic-101643365590549.html
28-01-2022||World||EU chief told to look for secret text messages to Pfizer CEO||An official EU watchdog on Friday slammed European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen for keeping secret text messages with Pfizer's CEO about purchasing Covid vaccine doses, saying it "constituted maladministration".The EU ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, issued a formal recommendation telling von der Leyen's office to search for and hand over the texts under a freedom of information request lodged by a journalist.Von der Leyen's Commission spearheaded the pre-purchase of Covid vaccines for the 27 EU countries.More than half the 4.2 billion doses the commission has bought or optioned are sourced from BioNTech-Pfizer, making it by far the biggest supplier to the bloc's inoculation efforts.The commission refuses to divulge key aspects of its contracts with Covid vaccine suppliers, notably on pricing, citing commercial confidentiality.Von der Leyen's active public role in ensuring vaccine access included one-on-one conversations with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, a dual Greek-American.Her commission rebuffed a freedom-of-information request last year for the text messages, refusing to say whether the texts existed -- even though von der Leyen had referred to them herself in a media interview.It argued to the ombudsman's service that it was only obligated to hand over archived documents and that text messages or other forms of instant messages did not qualify, being "short-lived" and unlikely to "contain in principle important information" on its policies, activities or decisions.The ombudsman strongly disagreed, saying in her recommendation "it is clear that text messages fall within the scope of the EU's law on public access to documents" and that EU case-law upholds the duty by EU institutions to retain documentation related to its activities."The case concerns whether, if the messages concern the commission's work and if it holds them, the commission should have granted public access to them. How the commission dealt with this matter did not allow those questions to be answered. The ombudsman considers that this constituted maladministration," it said.The ombudsman said the commission should ask von der Leyen's office to again look for the texts, and if it found them, "the Commission should assess whether public access can be granted to them" in line with EU rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-chief-told-to-look-for-secret-text-messages-to-pfizer-ceo-101643361803123.html

Beijing continues to deny all allegations of abuse.Since September 2018, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet was in talks with Chinese authorities over a possible visit to the province in the northwest part of China.In June last year, the UN rights chief had expressed hope to agree on terms for Xinjiang visit to look into reports of rights abuse against Uyghurs.Media reports said the approval for a UN visit has been granted, for a period, after the conclusion of the Beijing Winter Games. However, reports also add that Bejing has placed a condition that the trip should not be framed as a probe.Addressing the 47th session of the Human Rights Council, Bachelet in June 2021 had said that the United Nations is discussing with China modalities for a visit to the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.Along with a visit, Bachelet had said she will also seek "meaningful access" to the province.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-allows-un-rights-chief-to-visit-xinjiang-after-winter-olympics-conclude-101643359649129.html
28-01-2022||World||NeoCov: Wuhan scientists warn of deadlier Covid variant. All you need to know||Even as the fast-spreading Omicron strain started waning in parts of the world, another variant of the coronavirus disease – NeoCov – is creating a buzz after scientists from Wuhan in China, where the Covid-19 pandemic originated, flagged concerns that it may have much higher rate of transmission compared to previous strains and could potentially be the deadliest of them all.According to a research paper submitted by scientists in Wuhan, NeoCov is related to the Middle East respiratory syndrome or MERS-coronavirus. The paper was published on the bioRxiv website and is yet to be peer reviewed.Discovered in a bat population in South Africa, the virus was known to be spreading only among animals. However, it has now been found that NeoCoV and PDF-2180-CoV use some types of angiotensin-converting enzyme, including bat ACE2 and human ACE2 for entry.Although not a new variant, the MERS-CoV virus is similar to SARS-CoV-2 in terms of symptoms like fever, cough and shortness of breath and was prevalent in the middle-eastern countries in 2012 and 2015. Many people died due to the infection.Also Read | China quietly locks down area near Beijing week ahead of Winter OlympicsBased on the findings, the research said MERS-CoV belongs to the lineage C of Beta-CoV (Merbecoviruses), which poses a great threat considering its high case-fatality rate of approximately 35 per cent.“Our study demonstrates the first case of ACE2 usage in MERS-related viruses, shedding light on a potential bio-safety threat of the human emergence of an ACE2 using “MERS-CoV-2” with both high fatality and transmission rate,” the scientists wrote in the study.“Immunity triggered by prior infection or vaccination of other coronaviruses might be inadequate to protect humans from NeoCoV and PDF-2180-CoV infections because neither SARS-CoV-2 anti-sera nor ten tested anti-MERS-CoV nanobodies can cross-inhibit the infection caused by these two viruses,” the researchers stated.In the Middle East respiratory syndrome, the virus was transferred to humans from infected dromedary camels. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the origins of the virus are not fully understood but based on genome analysis of the virus, it is believed to have originated in bats and later transmitted to camels at some point in the distant past.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/neocov-wuhan-scientists-warn-of-deadlier-covid-variant-all-you-need-to-know-101643354985208.html
28-01-2022||World||Canada border deaths: 4 Indian victims were from Gujarat||Canadian law enforcement has formally identified the four Indian nationals who died from exposure to extreme cold near the United States border on January 19 in an apparent human smuggling operation gone wrong.Manitoba Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) has identified them as 39-year-old Jagdishkumar Baldevbhai Patel, his wife 37-year-old Vaishaliben Jagdishkumar Patel, their daughter 11-year-old Vihangi Jagdishkumar Patel, and son, three-year-old Dharmik Jagdishkumar Patel.All of them are from Gujarat. The autopsy conducted confirmed that “based on the circumstances, the death of all the persons have been determined to be consistent with exposure to the outdoor elements”.This information was conveyed to the Indian government on Thursday. Next of kin of the deceased have been informed and the consulate general of India in Toronto is in touch with the family of the deceased and is providing consular support, according to a release from India’s High Commission in Ottawa.Manitoba RCMP has also launched an investigation into how the family reached Canada and ultimately Emerson, a town near the border.In a statement, chief superintendent Rob Hill, Manitoba RCMP’s office in charge of criminal operations, said that the Patel family arrived in Toronto on January 12 and this was their first point of entry into Canada. From Toronto, the family made their way to Manitoba and eventually to Emerson on, or about, January 18.“There was no abandoned vehicle located on the Canadian side of the border - this clearly indicates that someone drove the family to the border and then left the scene,” he said.“With what we know so far of their activities in Canada, along with the arrest that occurred in the United States, we believe this to be a case of human smuggling,” he stressed.Manitoba RCMP is working closely with RCMP liaison officers stationed in New Delhi, India, and Washington, and are in regular contact with the US Customs and Border Protection and Homeland Security Investigations.He apologised for the initial identification of one of the victims as a male teen and said the error was due to “the frozen state in which the bodies were found and the clothing worn by the family made the initial identification difficult”.The High Commission’s statement noted that on “longer term issues that this tragedy has brought into focus the need to ensure that migration and mobility are made safe and legal and that such tragedies do not recur”.A number of ideas are under discussion between India and Canada in this context, including India’s proposal of a comprehensive Migration and Mobility Partnership Agreement (MMPA) to Canada, so as to “prevent and suppress irregular migration, smuggling of migrants and trafficking in human being and to facilitate sustainable and circular mobility”. The matter remains under consideration with Canada.A special team from India’s consulate in Toronto is camping in Manitoba “to assist ongoing investigations by Canadian agencies and to render any consular services for the victims”, the statement added.The Office of the Medical Examiner is in possession of the deceased persons and will coordinate with Indian officials for the release of the bodies to their next of kin. Thereafter, arrangements will be made for transport of the remains back to India.The bodies of the four victims were found just about 10km from the American border and they may have succumbed due to a human smuggling operation gone wrong.Seven other Indian nationals, linked to the tragic quartet found dead on the Canadian side of the border, were apprehended in the United States. One person, a 47-year-old resident of Florida Steve Shand was arrested by US authorities (though later released on bail) for allegedly “smuggling undocumented foreign nationals”.Last Wednesday morning, Manitoba RCMP received “concerning information” from their counterparts that the US Customs and Border Protection (USCBP) had apprehended a group of individuals who had crossed into the US from Canada, near the town of Emerson in Manitoba.A search began and four hours later, at about 1.30pm, RCMP officers found the bodies of three individuals were located on the Canadian side of the border, close to Emerson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-border-deaths-4-indian-victims-were-from-gujarat-101643349722521.html
28-01-2022||World||China quietly locks down area near Beijing week ahead of Winter Olympics||Chinese authorities locked down an area neighbouring the capital city of Beijing this week following a handful of reported Covid cases, but made no public announcements about the fresh restrictions with just a week until the Winter Olympics.Around 1.2 million people in Xiong'an New Area -- a new economic zone 100 kilometres southwest of Beijing -- are no longer allowed to enter or leave their residential compounds, local virus prevention staff confirmed to AFP on Friday.While recent lockdowns in China are publicly announced and widely reported by state media, the Xiong'an restrictions appear to have been introduced by stealth with no public announcements -- sparking confusion among some residents of the area."We expect this (lockdown) to last around a week, but the exact timing is uncertain," said virus prevention staff in Xiong County, one of three counties in the area.The restrictions kicked in on Tuesday, they added -- the same day authorities in another district noted five confirmed coronavirus infections had been discovered to date.With the Winter Olympics beginning next week, Chinese authorities have scrambled to eradicate flare-ups in several major cities, including Beijing.Cities such as Xi'an and Anyang have experienced hard lockdowns in recent weeks, with residents confined to their homes until multiple rounds of mass testing are completed and the outbreak suppressed.Some users on China's Twitter-like Weibo were seen asking for further information about restrictions, while others questioned the extent of measures."Is there a need? Why can't we go home if the area is deemed low-risk? Don't make this one-size-fits-all," said a Weibo user this week.Another said Thursday: "I don't think I'll be able to go home for the Lunar New Year."While there have been a number of national-level "New Areas" across China, Xiong'an stands out with its location personally designated by President Xi Jinping, according to state media.China, where the coronavirus first emerged, has upheld a strict "zero-Covid" strategy involving targeted lockdowns, tight border controls and mass testing.Its case numbers are tiny in comparison to the rest of the world.A month-long lockdown on the megacity of Xi'an was lifted earlier this week after a cluster that grew to more than 2,100 cases -- China's largest outbreak in months -- was largely stamped out.But stubborn flare-ups have persisted, including in Beijing and the nearby port city of Tianjin.China reported 39 domestic Covid cases on Friday.The Winter Olympics will be held in a strict "closed loop" bubble that separates everyone involved in the Games from the wider Chinese population in a bid to reduce the risk of infections leaking out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-quietly-locks-down-area-near-beijing-week-ahead-of-winter-olympics-101643346507982.html

The norms applicable to passengers flying from India to Canada will be those implemented overall.|#+|Given restrictions due to the Omicron variant of Covid-19, a negative RT-PCR test result prior to boarding will still be necessary but this can now be obtained from an Indian Council of Medical Research-recognised lab.Entry into Canada is restricted to fully vaccinated passengers though both vaccines used in India, Covishield and Covaxin, are now recognised in Canada for travel purposes.Passengers from India will also not be required a get a negative test result from a third country prior to leaving for Canada if they are taking a connecting flight.Passengers arriving in Canada may also be subject to random Covid-19 testing.The travel advisory for India earlier limited pre-departure testing to a single laboratory of the company Genestrings located at Delhi airport. Travellers had to provide a negative test result before they are allowed boarding for any Canadian destination, making the process problematic to those connecting via Delhi as getting the test taken and results received consumed up to eight or nine hours. That test had to be done within 18 hours of scheduled departure.The previous norms also read: “Passengers who travel from India to Canada via an indirect route still need to provide a pre-departure negative Covid-19 molecular test result from a third country before continuing their journey to Canada.”However, Canada still has in place a warning against any non-essential travel abroad due to concerns over the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. That, though, is relevant to those departing Canada rather than incoming passengers.The testing norms specific to India were introduced in September when Canada lifted its ban on direct flights between the two countries, which was imposed in April last year amid concerns over the Delta-driven wave in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-removes-india-specific-covid-19-testing-rules-for-travellers-101643347022405.html
28-01-2022||World||Ukraine: Will tensions with Russia dilute the US focus on Indo-Pacific, China?||With the United States (US) focused on the crisis with Russia over Ukraine, and diplomatic talks with Moscow yielding no breakthrough, there is a debate in the wider American strategic community about the possible impact of a conflict in the European theatre on the US role in Indo-Pacific region.Three questions, in particular, have animated both officials and experts. Is the Joe Biden administration’s focus on Russia at a time when China is the real strategic challenge of the present and the future smart? Will the US policy focus on Russia lead to a diversion in geopolitical attention and material resources from Indo-Pacific to Europe, or can Washington multi-task? And what does this mean for other countries in Asia, including India?Battling Russia or China - or Russia and ChinaWhile there is a broad bipartisan consensus in the US Congress against Russia’s actions in Ukraine, Congressman Ro Khanna, a member of the House of Representatives from California, recently said that the US’s interest was in “long-term de-escalation in the region especially with the rise of China”. He supported the threat of US sanctions against Russia, but warned against a conflict. “With the rise of China and the economic and military threat of invading Taiwan, the US cannot afford to embroiled in a draining war and conflict in Ukraine.” US national security interest, Khanna reiterated, lay in not getting “significantly entangled in a conflict that would weaken us vis-a-vis China”.Khanna’s comments triggered a backlash against him on Twitter from those who advocate the exercise of more coercive options against Russia. But key former US officials acknowledged that the Congressman had a point.When asked if tensions with Russia risked diverting the US’s geopolitical focus from the China challenge, Elbridge A Colby, a former assistant secretary of defence for strategy and force development, said, “Yes, without question.” Colby, who helped draft the US’s National Defence Strategy in 2018 - a key document that recognised the re-emergence of long term strategic inter-state competition as the US’s primary challenge – warned, “We need to keep the focus on Asia even as crisis flares in Europe. Asia is far more important, and China a much greater threat than Russia. We don’t have the military capacity and likely lack the diplomatic capital and geo-economic leverage to focus on Asia while sustaining our traditional posture in Europe - let alone doubling down. Indeed, doubling down in Europe now would be a historic mistake, and one we will likely rue in the future.”But there is a counter-view that sending a strong message to Russia over Ukraine is essential to sending a message to China too, since what is at stake in Ukraine are broader principles of state sovereignty. A weak US response, in fact, may embolden Beijing.At a press briefing earlier this week, the US state department spokesperson Ned Price said, “In some ways, this is, as important as Ukraine is, even bigger than the question of a conflict, a Russia-produced conflict, between Russia and Ukraine. This is what about what should be the inviolable rules of the so-called rules-based international order.” Alluding to China, without specifically naming it, Price added, “You hear us talk about the rules-based international order not only in the case of Europe and what Russia is doing to undermine it, but in other regions too, notably the Indo-Pacific, where we have similar concerns about what certain countries have also sought to do to undermine, to erode that rules-based international order.” Price claimed this was why the implications of what Russia was doing went beyond Ukraine.Colby, who has recently authored The Strategy of Denial: American Defense in an Age of Great Power Conflict, disagreed. “I don’t buy this, fundamentally. Look, obviously Beijing is watching to learn more about how the Biden administration does things. But much more important is the reality that we face real constraints on our power.” Colby said that what advocates of a hawkish approach in Ukraine missed the fact that US did not have enough military power to go around. “They seem to think it’s all just about our willpower. But willpower without strength is feckless. So what would actually probably most embolden Beijing is doubling down in Europe, since that will mean that we’re not going to strengthen our position in Asia.”Then, there is the question of whether China and Russia can be seen separately or as a part of a common nexus of US adversaries. Those who support a strong US position against Russia point to the deep, and deepening, Moscow-Beijing nexus and argue that US has to contend with both. Indeed, in a call on Wednesday with US secretary of state Antony J Blinken, his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, spoke about taking into account Russia’s “legitimate security interests”. Others, however, suggest that the US will have to identify whether its core contradiction is with Moscow or Beijing, stay focused on that adversary, and find creative diplomatic ways to split the China-Russia nexus and play on Moscow’s fears of Beijing encroaching on its sphere of influence in central Asia.But these choices aren’t easy, especially when no US administration can be seen as allowing Russia to undermine the entire post-Cold War architecture in Europe - which is what Putin has sought in his treaty proposals by asking Nato and the US to limit their engagement, presence, posture, and activities in eastern Europe.What it means for Indo-Pacific and IndiaIrrespective of whether the US should have escalated tensions with Russia over Ukraine, or whether the it could have adopted any other course given that it is Russia that has stepped up the ante in recent months, the fact is that US-Russia tensions have deepened; there is a strong possibility of Russian action in Ukraine; and both sides are preparing for a prolonged geopolitical and economic confrontation.How will this alter Washington’s mood?Ashley Tellis, the Tata chair for Strategic Studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a former US administration official, and among the foremost strategic experts on Asia in Washington DC, believes that these renewed tensions will indeed lead to a shift in focus for the US national security establishment - and have two implications.“One, the US gets easily distracted. In this case, thinking about the Indo-Pacific is far ahead of the practical implementation. For all the accentuated rhetoric, the administration’s engagement and investment in Indo-Pacific is still relatively modest and involves pursuing low-hanging fruit, such as investing in the Quad or holding summit-level meetings. There is a big deficit in terms of both the military investments in the Indo-Pacific strategy and, more visibly, the trade dimension, at a time when the regional economies are still deeply integrated with China.” A military crisis with Russia, Tellis argued, will end up weakening US capacity in the Indo-Pacific and lead to greater resource allocation in Europe.The second implication is with regard to India, and how it emerges out of the crisis. “There are already anxieties in the Congress about India, including vis-à-vis its relationship with Russia. If Delhi feels compelled to be mildly sympathetic to Russia, or even excessively neutral, it will not find a receptive audience for its position in Washington. India is admittedly in a hard place,” said Tellis.Unlike Australia and Japan, the other members of the Quad, who are US allies, India is a partner, prides itself on its “strategic autonomy”, and has a robust relationship with Russia. India has maintained a studied silence on the escalating confrontation, with policymakers hoping that that the crisis gets defused, given their desire to sustain India’s close links with both Washington and Moscow. But if the crisis escalates, New Delhi’s position on the issue may well play into the debate in the US on whether India merits a sanctions waiver for its acquisition of the S-400 missile system from Russia - which would otherwise apply under the Countering America’s Adversaries through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), a US Congress law passed in 2017 to deter countries from engaging with Moscow.Most observers of India-US ties in Washington DC believe that an executive waiver of sanctions is likely for three reasons. One, Delhi is banking on the fact that the US recognises that India’s security imperatives vis-a-vis China - a shared concern - requires it to engage with Russia - a long-standing defence partner. Two, sanctions will set back India-US ties by conveying a message that Washington is not reliable and strengthen the sceptics within the Indian system who have viewed deepening ties with caution - both within India’s defence and intelligence set-ups, the memory of US’s hostility towards India during the Cold War is alive and Pentagon’s continued ties with Rawalpindi are viewed with suspicion. And three, it will potentially reverse the deepening defence engagement between India and the US, with implications for the US defence industry, and ironically, enhance Indian dependence on Russia, even as Delhi has sought to diversify its defence relationships in recent years. None of these outcomes would suit the US, which has made substantial investments in the India relationship in the past three decades.But an outright conflict in Europe will make it difficult for the administration to justify a sanctions waiver when the mood on the Hill is particularly hostile to Moscow. A major sanctions bill against Russia, brought by chair of the Senate foreign relations committee, Robert Menendez, and backed by the White House, is in the offing if Moscow does invade Ukraine. Delhi has also lost a degree of goodwill on the Hill due to what it is widely perceived to be an erosion in its democratic record - this doesn’t necessarily play out in direct ways in policymaking but does make asking for a concession more difficult. The balance is still pretty strongly tilted towards a sanctions waiver, but till it is done, it is not done.Can the US multi-task?Despite US’s new dilemmas due to Russia’s actions, there remains a view in DC that the administration knows that across military, economic, technological, strategic, and political spheres, China is US’s greatest challenge. All national security documents, messaging, and appointments in the administration over the past year have reflected this policy conclusion.Indeed, even as the attention is on the Russia front, the China challenge has not been forgotten. Just in the past week, President Biden has held a bilateral meeting (virtually) with Japan’s new Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, where both reiterated their commitment to a shared vision for the region. There have been indications that the next Quad summit is scheduled to held in Japan this summer. The US has conducted strong naval drills in East Asia as a message to Beijing not to engage in adventurism on Taiwan. The state department held a briefing to reiterate its opposition to China’s illegal and coercive activities in the South China Sea. And the China director of the National Security Council outlined the administration’s five-point strategy to compete with Beijing over the past year of Biden’s presidency.Jeff Smith, research fellow, South Asia, at Heritage Foundation and author of Cold Peace: China-India Rivalry in the 21st Century, said that since the Barack Obama administration’s infamous “Pivot to Asia”, several consecutive US administrations had sought to prioritise the Indo-Pacific and shift resources and attention from legacy theatres such as Europe and West Asia to the “super theatre” of Indo-Pacific. “Of course, America’s adversaries get a vote too and Russia’s provocative moves in and around Ukraine are indeed drawing US attention back to the Eurasian landmass when the US government would rather be focusing on the China challenge.”But Smith said he was sceptical that the ongoing Ukraine crisis would have “more than a marginal impact on America’s posture or strategy” in the Indo-Pacific. “The US government is accustomed to, and capable of, managing instability in multiple theatres simultaneously. To date, there are no indications that the US government is pursuing a major deployment of redistribution of resources, manpower and platforms to the European theatre.” Smith pointed out that the US had already ruled out sending troops to Ukraine, and suggested that the envisioned contingencies involving additional deployment Nato’s eastern flank were not on a scale consequential to US’s Indo-Pacific posture.Frank O’Donnell, the deputy director of the South Asia programme at Stimson Centre, agreed and said that as serious as the Ukraine crisis was, it would not divert American attention from China. “The administration’s deep engagement with Asian allies and partners, and comparably more limited interactions with European counterparts prior to the crisis, is a significant indication of where it sees its geopolitical priorities.”As the world watches what happens in Kiev, and Washington figures out a way to tame Moscow’s ambitions and compete with Beijing, developments in the next few weeks will have implications in capitals as far as Canberra, Tokyo, and of course, New Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ukraine-will-tensions-with-russia-dilute-the-us-focus-on-indo-pacific-china-101643346242881.html
28-01-2022||World||No decision on CAATSA vis-a-vis India yet: US||The United States is continuing to talk to India about the risks of sanctions for its acquisition of the S-400 missile system from Russia under the Countering America’s Adversaries through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), but hasn’t made a determination “with regard to this transaction”, the state department said on Thursday.Speaking at a regular press briefing, the state department spokesperson Ned Price, was asked whether, given US’s renewed tensions with Russia, India’s purchase of the missile system will affect the India-US bilateral relationship.He said, “In many ways, this doesn’t change the concerns that we have with the S-400 system. I think it shines a spotlight on the destabilising role that Russia is playing not only in the region, but potentially beyond as well. When it comes to CAATSA sanctions, you’ve heard me say before we haven’t made a determination with regard to this transaction, but it’s something we continue to discuss with the Government of India, given the risk of sanctions for this particular transaction under CAATSA.”Price added that whether it was India or any other country, the US continued to “urge all countries to avoid major new transactions for Russian weapon systems”. When asked if the US had a timeline on the decision on CAATSA, Price said, “I don’t have a timeline to offer, but these are issues that we continue to discuss with our partners in India.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-decision-on-caatsa-vis-a-vis-india-yet-us-101643344022250.html
28-01-2022||World||'Major gas pipeline at stake if...': US, Germany warn Russia amid Ukraine row||The United States and Germany on Thursday warned Russia that a major gas pipeline was at stake if it invades Ukraine, as Washington voiced hope for a diplomatic way out despite frigid statements from Moscow.A day after the United States and its allies formally responded to security demands issued by Russia, top officials in Moscow said their chief concerns were not addressed but notably did not rule out new talks.The United States has warned Russia of swift and severe consequences if it invades Ukraine after Moscow amassed tens of thousands of troops on the border with its Western-leaning neighbor.Following talk of divisions within Europe, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told parliament that her government was "working on a strong package of sanctions" alongside allies that would include Nord Stream 2.The pipeline, which Germany has defiantly built despite criticism by the United States and Eastern Europeans, will more than double supplies of Russian natural gas to Europe's largest economy.In Washington, a top official voiced confidence that an invasion would stop Germany from activating the multibillion-dollar project, which was completed in September but still requires testing and regulatory approval."If Russia invades Ukraine, one way or another, Nord Stream 2 will not move forward," said Victoria Nuland, the undersecretary of state for political affairs."I think the statements coming out of Berlin even today are very, very strong," she told reporters.The White House announced that Germany's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will visit on February 7 and discuss the crisis with President Joe Biden.Stepping up the diplomatic offensive, the United States called a public meeting Monday at the UN Security Council on Russia's "threatening behavior," hoping to bring condemnation even though Moscow can veto any resolutions.Biden also spoke Thursday by telephone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and said the United States was considering economic support after $650 million in military assistance over the past year.Biden "reaffirmed the readiness of the United States along with its allies and partners to respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine," a White House statement said.But Biden, in a recognition of the dangers of the moment, repeated his warning that Ukraine could indeed face a Russian invasion next month."President Biden said that there is a distinct possibility that the Russians could invade Ukraine in February," National Security Council spokesperson Emily Horne told AFP.NATO has put 8,500 troops on standby over the Ukraine crisis, in scenes reminiscent of the Cold War with the Soviet Union.'Only one decider'Russia denies any plans to invade but last month demanded wide-ranging security guarantees from the West, including that Ukraine never be allowed to join the US-led NATO military alliance.Washington on Wednesday delivered a reply in coordination with NATO allies, saying Ukraine had the right to determine its own allies but offering Russia talks on missile placements and other mutual concerns.In a first reaction, the Kremlin was unimpressed but cautious."It cannot be said that our views were taken into account," President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters."Let's not rush into assessments; it takes time to analyze."Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow's chief concern -- the potential for Ukraine to join NATO -- had been ignored, but that it would be possible to move forward on other issues."There is a response which gives hope for the start of a serious conversation on secondary questions," said Lavrov, who is expected to hold new talks soon with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken."There's only one decider in Moscow and that is President Putin," Nuland said for her part."We hope he will see here a real opportunity for a legacy of security and arms control rather than a legacy of war," she said."The ball is in their court."'Ukraine in the middle'On the streets of Kyiv, there were concerns that Ukraine had been forgotten amid high-level talks between Moscow, NATO and Washington."The United States is provoking Russia and Russia is provoking the United States. And somewhere in the middle is Ukraine," said Dmytro Sylenko, a 23-year-old businessman."Honestly, I don't care who is provoking whom, what matters to me is that there is peace," he told AFP.Russia, which has a fraught historical relationship with Ukraine, has fueled an insurgency in the former Soviet republic's east that has killed more than 13,000 people since 2014.That year Russia also seized Crimea after the overthrow of a pro-Russian government in Kyiv.In a separate bid to defuse tensions, senior Russian and Ukrainian officials held a marathon eight hours of talks Wednesday in Paris and agreed to meet again in two weeks in Berlin.Zelensky's office in a statement praised the "constructive nature" of the meeting, which recommitted to a fragile ceasefire in eastern Ukraine between government forces and pro-Moscow separatists.Adding to tensions, a 21-year-old Ukrainian national guard conscript opened fire at an aerospace factory Thursday, killing five people, although there was no indication of a link to the Russia standoff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/major-gas-pipeline-at-stake-if-us-germany-warn-russia-101643334355200.html

It began administering vaccines to children aged 5-11 from early this month.TGA said the country's vaccination advisory group will soon give more information on when the 16-17 age group will be eligible to receive their booster doses.Omicron has spiralled Australia's total infections to around 2.4 million, with about 2 million detected in the last four weeks, though its less lethal impact and a booster rollout gathering pace has resulted in a lower death rate.A total of 3,402 deaths have been registered in the country since the pandemic began, far lower than numbers seen in many comparable countries.Australia reported fewer COVID-19 deaths https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-reports-fewer-covid-19-deaths-hospitalisations-steady-2022-01-27 on Thursday, a day after recording a pandemic high of 87 deaths, while hospital cases remained steady, raising hopes the country's worst outbreak may have peaked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-australia-gives-green-signal-to-boosters-for-16-17-age-group-101643330785471.html
28-01-2022||World||Patient without Covid shot denied heart transplant, family says 'need to have a choice'||A Boston hospital is defending itself after a man's family claimed he was denied a new heart for refusing to be vaccinated against Covid-19, saying most transplant programs around the country set similar requirements to improve patients' chances of survival.The family of DJ Ferguson said in a crowdfunding appeal this week that officials at Brigham and Women's Hospital told the 31-year-old father of two that he was ineligible for the procedure because he hasn't been vaccinated against the coronavirus.“We are literally in a corner right now. This is extremely time sensitive,” the family said in its fundraising appeal, which has raised tens of thousands of dollars.“This is not just a political issue. People need to have a choice!”DJ's mother, Tracey Ferguson, insists that her son isn't against vaccinations, noting he's had other immunisations in the past.But the trained nurse said Wednesday that he's been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation — an irregular and often rapid heart rhythm — and that he has concerns about the side effects of the Covid-19 vaccine.“DJ is an informed patient,” Tracey Ferguson said in a brief interview at her home in Mendon, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southwest of Boston.“He wants to be assured by his doctors that his condition would not be worse or fatal with this Covid vaccine.”Brigham and Women's Hospital declined to comment on DJ Ferguson's case, citing patient privacy laws. But it pointed to a response that it posted on its website in which it said the Covid-19 vaccine is one of several immunizations required by most US transplant programs, including a flu shot and hepatitis B vaccines.The hospital said research has shown that transplant recipients are at higher risk than non-transplant patients of dying from Covid-19, and that its policies are in line with the recommendations of the American Society of Transplantation and other health organizations.Patients also must meet other health and lifestyle criteria to receive donated organs, and it's unknown if DJ Ferguson did or would have met them.Brigham & Womens Hospital also stressed that no patient is placed on an organ waitlist without meeting those criteria, and rejected the notion that a transplant candidate could be considered “first on the list” for an organ — a claim Ferguson's family made in its fundraising post.“There are currently more than 100,000 candidates on waitlists for organ transplantation and a shortage of available organs — around half of people on waiting lists will not receive an organ within five years,” the hospital said.Hospitals in other states have faced similar criticism for denying transplants to patients who weren't vaccinated against Covid-19.In Colorado last year, a woman suffering from late-stage kidney disease said she was denied a transplant by her hospital because she was unvaccinated. Leilani Lutali, a born-again Christian, said she opposed immunisation because of the role that fetal cell lines play in some vaccines' development.There is a scarcity of donor organs, so transplant centers only place patients on the waiting list whom they deem the most likely to survive with a new organ.“A donor heart is a precious and scarce gift which must be cared for well,” said Dr. Howard Eisen, medical director for the advanced heart failure program at Penn State University in Hershey, Pennsylvania. “Our goal is to preserve patient survival and good outcomes post-transplant.”The United Network for Organ Sharing, the nonprofit that manages the country's organ transplant system, doesn't track how many patients refusing to get a Covid-19 vaccine have been denied transplants, said Anne Paschke, an organisation spokesperson.She said patients who are denied organ transplants still have the right to go elsewhere, though individual hospitals ultimately decide which patients to add to the national waitlist.According to the online fundraiser, DJ Ferguson was hospitalised in late November for a heart ailment that caused his lungs to fill with blood and fluid.He was then transferred to Brigham and Women's, where doctors inserted an emergency heart pump that the family says is only meant to be a temporary stopgap.“It's devastating,” Tracey Ferguson said. “No one ever wants to see their child go through something like this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/patient-without-covid-shot-denied-heart-transplant-family-says-need-to-have-a-choice-101643329364773.html
28-01-2022||World||US Supreme Court to get its first Black woman judge, says Joe Biden||President Joe Biden said Thursday he will nominate a Black woman to the US Supreme Court for the first time in history, filling the vacancy left by retiring Justice Stephen Breyer."I've made no decision except (the) person I will nominate will be someone with extraordinary qualifications, character, experience and integrity," Biden said in an address from the White House."And that person will be the first Black woman ever nominated to the United States Supreme Court."Biden, speaking at a podium alongside Breyer, also indicated that he would seek a speedy nomination process, promising to name his candidate by the end of February.The exit of Breyer, who is 83, gives Biden a likely smooth opportunity to name a replacement to the lifelong seat on the Supreme Court while his Democratic Party retains control of the Senate.The Supreme Court is currently split between six conservatives and three liberals. Biden will now be able to nominate another liberal-leaning jurist to the court, maintaining the balance.Breyer had been under pressure from liberals to leave in time for Biden to get his nominee through the Senate before November's midterm elections, when Republicans are in a strong position to win majorities in Congress and would then control the approval process.As president, Donald Trump had the rare opportunity to put no fewer than three new justices on the court, fundamentally shifting its political leaning for potentially years to come.Biden's one pick so far will have nowhere near that level of impact. However, the Democrat will be glad of a successful confirmation process, delivering a much needed morale boost to his party ahead of the midterms.As an immediate reminder of the tensions that Supreme Court confirmations often provoke, Republican senior Senator Mitch McConnell warned Biden "not to outsource this important decision to the radical left.""To the degree that President Biden received a mandate, it was to govern from the middle," McConnell said.In his resignation letter, published Thursday, Breyer underlined the coordinated plan to ensure that the succession moves with minimal upheaval, confirming that he will stay on the court through the packed current term -- but not before his replacement is ready."I intend this decision to take effect when the court rises for the summer recess this year (typically late June or early July) assuming that by then my successor has been nominated and confirmed," he wrote.Campaign pledgeBiden promised to put an African-American woman on the court back when he was campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination.The vow was part of his vital outreach to the Black community, which became a crucial component in ultimately defeating a crowded field of Democratic rivals and then unseating Trump.Biden put the first Black and Asian woman, Kamala Harris, on the ticket as his vice president, and since taking office has also pushed hard to place more women and ethnic minorities as senior judges.Biden said that in the search for Breyer's replacement, he would be asking Harris to help, describing her as "an exceptional lawyer" and noting she was a former member of the Senate judiciary committee -- a body he himself led while serving as a senator.Among the leading candidates to replace Breyer are Ketanji Brown Jackson, a US Court of Appeals judge, and Leondra Kruger of the California Supreme Court.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Biden had "already started reviewing potential candidates" and the nomination process should "happen as expeditiously as possible."Of the 115 justices who served on the Supreme Court, only five have been women, including three today -- Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Amy Coney Barrett. Only two have been Black men, one of whom is current Justice Clarence Thomas.Breyer is the oldest justice on the court and was nominated in 1994 by then Democratic president Bill Clinton.Praising Breyer, Biden highlighted his bipartisan spirit, saying he "patiently sought common ground" and was "a model public servant in a time of great division in this country."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-to-get-its-first-black-woman-judge-says-joe-biden-101643329905372.html

One died instantly, and the other Grant finished off with a knife, according to court documents.He was sentenced to death in 2005.He filed numerous appeals during his imprisonment to have his sentence overturned, citing intellectual deficiencies in particular. In an online petition, his defenders claimed that he suffered from fetal alcohol syndrome and brain trauma caused by violent abuse in his childhood from his alcoholic father.His last appeal, concerning the method of execution used by the southern US state of Oklahoma, was rejected Wednesday by the US Supreme Court.Grant received an injection of three lethal substances at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester.The deadly cocktail is suspected of causing excruciating pain for the condemned, which is forbidden by the US Constitution. In late October, an inmate suffered from convulsions and vomited several times after the first injection.Nothing of the sort occurred during Grant's execution.The number of executions carried out annually in the United States has been declining in recent years.Capital punishment has been abolished in 23 US states, while three others -- California, Oregon and Pennsylvania -- have observed a moratorium on its use.A series of botched executions in Oklahoma led to a temporary moratorium on capital punishment in the state in 2015, but the moratorium was lifted in 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-first-execution-of-2022-is-man-who-robbed-hotel-for-girlfriend-s-bail-money-101643328209686.html
28-01-2022||World||North Korea confirms latest weapons tests as Kim visits 'important' munitions factory||North Korea conducted tests of an upgraded long-range cruise missile and a warhead of a tactical guided missile this week, as leader Kim Jong Un visited a munitions factory producing a "major weapon system," state media KCNA said on Friday.Tension has been simmering over North Korea's series of six weapons tests in 2022, among the largest number of missile launches it has made in a month, which triggered condemnation and a new sanctions push from the United States.An update to a long-range cruise missile system was tested on Tuesday, and another test was held to confirm the power of a conventional warhead for a surface-to-surface tactical guided missile on Thursday, KCNA said.Kim did not attend the tests, but during a visit to the munitions factory, he lauded "leaping progress in producing major weapons" to implement the ruling Workers' Party's decisions made at a meeting last month, a separate dispatch said."The factory holds a very important position and duty in modernising the country's armed forces and realising the national defence development strategy," Kim said.KCNA did not specify the weapons or the factory's location. Kim called for bolstering national defences to tackle an unstable international situation at that party gathering.Last week, North Korea said it would bolster its defences against the United States and consider resuming "all temporally-suspended activities", hinting at lifting a self-declared moratorium on testing nuclear bombs and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).At the factory, Kim called for "an all-out drive" to produce "powerful cutting-edge arms," and its workers touted his devotion to "smashing ... the challenges of the U.S. imperialists and their vassal forces" seeking to violate their right to self-defence, calling it "the harshest-ever adversity."Pyongyang has defended missile launches as its sovereign right to self-defence and accused Washington and Seoul of applying "hostile policy" and double standards https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nkorea-fires-unidentified-projectile-into-sea-off-east-coast-skorea-2021-09-27 over weapons tests.No ICBMs or nuclear weapons have been tested in North Korea since 2017 but a spate of shorter-range missile launches began amid stalled denuclearisation talks following a failed summit with the United States in 2019.'POWERFUL WARHEADS'In Tuesday's test, two long-range cruise missiles flew 1,800 km (1,118.5 miles) for 9,137 seconds and hit a target island off the east coast, showing practical combat performance, KCNA said.The two tactical guided missiles tested on Thursday also precisely struck the target and proved the explosive power of their warhead as designed, it said.The country "will keep developing powerful warheads capable of performing combat function and mission," KCNA added.KCNA Photos dated on Tuesday showed a long-range missile launched from a transporter-erector-launcher, gushing flame, before sparking a fire on an island. Another set of images from Thursday showed a shorter-range missile rising into the sky above a cloud of dust and then hitting an island.South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said it detected both tests, and the short-range missiles fired from the eastern coastal city of Hamhung travelled for about 190 km (118 miles) to an altitude of 20 km (12.4 miles).This month alone, North Korea has also tested tactical guided missiles, two "hypersonic missiles" capable of high speed and manoeuvring after lift-off, and a railway-borne missile system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-confirms-latest-weapons-tests-as-kim-visits-important-munitions-factory-101643327528723.html
28-01-2022||World||4 Indians found dead near US-Canada border was a family from Gujarat||TORONTO: The four Indian nationals who died from exposure to extreme cold on the Canadian side of the border with the United States on January 19 were members of a family from Gujarat, the Indian High Commission in Ottawa said in a statement on Thursday, citing information received from Canadian law enforcement.A special team from India’s Consulate in Toronto is camping in Manitoba “to assist ongoing investigations by Canadian agencies and to render any consular services for the victims,” the statement added.Manitoba Royal Canadian Mounted Police or RCMP has identified them as 39-year-old Jagdish Baldevbhai Patel, his wife 37-year-old Vaishaliben Jagdishkumar Patel, their daughter 11-year-old Vihangi Jagdishkumar Patel, and son, three-year-old Dharmik Jagdishkumar Patel.The high commission said the autopsy has confirmed that “based on the circumstances, the death of all the persons have been determined to be consistent with exposure to the outdoor elements.”The next of kin of the deceased have been informed and the Consulate General of India in Toronto is in touch with the family of the deceased and is providing consular support, according to a release from India’s High Commission in Ottawa.The statement said a number of ideas are under discussion between India and Canada on the longer term issues that this tragedy has brought into focus and the need to ensure that migration and mobility are made safe and legal and that such tragedies do not recur.These include India’s proposal of a comprehensive Migration and Mobility Partnership Agreement or MMPA to Canada to “prevent and suppress irregular migration, smuggling of migrants and human trafficking and to facilitate sustainable and circular mobility. The matter remains under consideration with Canada.The Office of the Medical Examiner is in possession of the deceased persons and will coordinate with Indian officials for the release of the bodies to their next of kind. Thereafter, arrangements will be made for the transport of the remains back to India.The bodies of the four victims were found just about 10 km from the American border and they may have succumbed due to a human smuggling operation gone wrong.Seven other Indian nationals, linked to the tragic quartet found dead on the Canadian side of the border, were apprehended in the United States. One person, a 47-year-old resident of Florida Steve Shand was arrested by US authorities (though later released on bail) for allegedly “smuggling undocumented foreign nationals.”Last Wednesday morning, Manitoba RCMP received “concerning information” from their counterparts that the US Customs and Border Protection or USCBP had apprehended a group of individuals who had crossed into the US from Canada, near the town of Emerson in Manitoba.A search began and four hours later, at about 1.30 pm, RCMP officers found the bodies of three individuals were located on the Canadian side of the border, close to Emerson.
