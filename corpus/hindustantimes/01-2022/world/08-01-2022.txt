08-01-2022||World||HT This Day: Jan 9, 1972 – Mujib is free, flown to London||Says Bangla Desh a reality No pledge to Bhutto on links with Pak APLONDON- Sheikh Mujibur Rehman to- day proclaimed Bangla Desh as "an unchallengeable reality" and called for world recognition and the admission of his country to the United Nations. Sheikh Mujib, freed by Pakistan President Z. A. Bhutto and flown to London early today, told a news conference that he had been kept in a condemned cell under sentence of death by hanging during his nine-month imprisonment in Pakistan. Speaking in a vigorous voice and showing no signs of ill-health, the 51-year-old Bangapita said he had given no promise to Mr Bhutto that Bangla Desh would maintain any link with Pakistan. Scores of elated Bengalis clustered outside the plush Claridges Hotel as Sheikh Mujib held his news conference in the ballroom against a background of ornate wall mirrors and under the glare of television lights. First question One of the first questions he was asked was: "Why did you come to London instead of flying to Dacca?" "I was a prisoner," the Sheikh said. "It was the Pakistan Government's will, not mine." The Sheikh said the duration of his stay had not yet been decided, but he hoped to meet British Prime Minister Edward Heath before leaving. The officials later announced that Sheikh Mujib would meet Mr Heath in the evening. The Sheikh told the newsmen Mr Bhutto had asked him to consider keeping links between Bangla Desh and Pakistan. Merciless killings "I told him I could not say anything about this until I returned to my people", he said. Sheikh Mujib was introduced to newsmen as "our beloved leader, the free President of the free people of an independent sovereign State." The Sheikh, wearing dark tunic, style suit, immediately paid a tribute to "the sacred memory of millions of martyrs who gave their lives" in the struggle to establish Bangla Desh. Sheikh Mujib said Pakistani troops, which tried to hold down he aspirations of Bangla Desh, had been guilty of "merciless Killings." Then he added: "If Hitler had been alive today, he would have men ashamed." Sheikh Mujib would not be trawn into any direct criticism of Mr Bhutto. "I wish him good luck," he said. The Sheikh expressed good wishes to India, the Soviet Union, Poland, Great Britain, France and 'also those freedom loving people all over the world, including those of the United States."In calling for world recognition of Bangla Desh the Bangapita said: "I appeal to all citizens of the world to help my hungry millions." Sheikh Mujib was asked if he had been physically ill-treated or tortured during his imprisonment. He replied that he had been held in a condemned cell in solitary confinement in a desert jail with no visitors, no letters and no contact with the outside world. –Mock trial Sheikh Mujib said that he underwent a "mock trial" but refused to defend himself when the hearing was halfway through. The Pakistani authorities then appointed a counsel to defend him, he said. "It was a court-martial of a civilian " he said. "They wanted to hang me." He said the Bhutto regime, which replaced the Government of former President Yahya Khan, who had ordered Sheikh Mujib's arrest, refused to carry out the sentence. He said he knew about the India-Pakistan war only because of an air-raid blackout in the area of his prison. And he knew nothing of the victory of the freedom fighters until Mr Bhutto told him, Sheikh Mujib added. "I am a free man now but I was cut off from the whole world," the Sheikh said. He told the newsmen that after the mock trial ''I was mentally ready to die." "The day I went to jail I didn't know whether I was to live or not. But I knew that Banda Desh would be liberated." he said. The Sheikh was asked what would be his attitude to the United States in view of Washington's support for Pakistan in the conflict with India. Triumphant shot The Sheikh ducked the question by replying : "I was in prison and I do not know many things yet. I will have to disccuss this with my people when I go to Dacca." Old acquaintances of the Sheikh said he appeared thinner than they remembered him, but still full of spirit despite his ordeal. He rounded off the news conference saying that he was tired after the flight from Rawalpindi. He then raised his voice in a triumphant shout of "Jai Bangla." Outside the hotel more of his supporters were gathering by the minute, hugging each other and shouting the same victory slogan. Reuter adds: The Sheikh declared : "I cannot wait a single moment to return to my people." He said he hoped to return to Dacca tomorrow or the day after. In a voice quivering with emotion, Sheikh Mujib told reporters : "No people have had to pay as high a price in human life and suffering as the people of Bangla Desh." He arrived at the Press conference 20 minute late and greeted the newsmen with "Jai Bangla." "Today," he said, "I celebrate the unbounded joy of freedom in a liberation struggle," Officials of the Bangla Desh mission indicated that it was felt a breathing space was needed before the Sheikh's return to Dacca. They said as many as a million people would come to the airport to see him. "I have nothing against the people of West Pakistan in spite of the way in which they behaved. When they arrested me, they arrested my children too and interned them and my house was burnt." He said Bangle Desh had been exploited for hundreds of years and that Britain bore some responsibility for this although the British Government had always been good to him personally. Loses 42 lb Bangla Desh officials said Sheikh Mujib appeared to have lost about 42 lb. (19 kg) in weight. Asked about reports that the Bangla Desh Government intended nationalising banking, insurance and foreign trade, Sheikh Mujib said such action was implicit in the manifesto of his Awami League which won the Pakistan elections of December, 1970. He added that he had great confidence in what his colleagues were doing in Bangla Desh. Sheikh Mujib said : "I am not going to lose my freedom again in any war. I'm ready to co-operate with anyone." He said Pakistan had played a dirty game and there should be some sort of trial for the mass murders. "But now that my people are liberated I have nothing against the people of West Pakistan. I wish Mr Bhutto success and good luck."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ht-this-day-jan-9-1972-mujib-is-free-flown-to-london-101641664296551.html

Experts slam earlier presumption as US sees record hospitalisation||Amid the ongoing debate of how wrong it is to call Omicron, the new variant of SARS-CoV-2, a mild variant, scientists have started pointing out that deaths from Covid-19 are rising in South Africa. "Looks like some may have discounted #Omicron too soon. Let’s stop it with the “it’s mild” nonsense once and for all. Protect your community. Protect kids," epidemiologist Eric Feigl-Ding has written on his social media as the South Africa government has added some backlog fatality figures in its tally recently, It is not clearly known whether those deaths were due to Omicron. #COVID19 hospitalizations just set a new record today with 138,073 currently hospitalized in the US. ICU occupancy is now at 22,394 - twice the level just 7 weeks ago. Deaths are rising in states like NY. Are these the signs of a "mild" infection? pic.twitter.com/IAA9joN9QWOmicron was first identified in South Africa on November 24. Since then, its spread has been rapid and in many countries, it has replaced Delta. The present surge in the number of Covid cases across the world is because of Omicron. 📍Watching—Deaths from #COVID19 are still increasing in South Africa🇿🇦 (with new backfilled data)— looks like some may have discounted #Omicron too soon. Let’s stop it with the “it’s mild” nonsense once and for all. Protect your community. Protect kids.🙏 Figure by @DrWilliamKu pic.twitter.com/FBRWFm6mIWShowing the data of hospitalisation in the United States, data scientist William Ku said Covid-19 hospitalisation in the US has sent a new record with 1,38,073 currently hospitalised in the US. "ICU occupancy is now at 22,394 - twice the level just 7 weeks ago. Deaths are rising in states like NY. Are these the signs of a "mild" infection?" the researcher said.Explaining the surge, Dr Eric said that it is simple math as exponential cases are likely to swamp out any 'mildness'. "People forget the nature of exponential math. If you have 10x, 20x greater number within 2-3 weeks, that out swamps any benefit of 2x lower mild. That’s why we see hospitalization rates surging across multiple countries” with Omicron," Dr Eric said.World Health Organization has recently flagged that Omicron should not necessarily be categorised as mild. “Just like previous variants omicron is hospitalising people, and it’s killing people. In fact, the tsunami of cases is so huge and quick that it is overwhelming health systems around the world,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.WHO emergencies chief Dr Michael Ryan said that the speculation that omicron might be the last variant of the outbreak was wishful thinking. “There still is a lot of energy in this virus,” he cautioned.Several doctors and experts have pointed out that Omicron's impact appears to be less severe as it does not attack the lungs. Young and vaccinated people may recover from Omicron soon, but for old and people with comorbidities, Omicron might not be as 'mild' as it is being projected, experts said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-mild-experts-slam-earlier-presumption-as-us-sees-record-hospitalisation-101641660806482.html
08-01-2022||World||Imprisoned without charge, Saudi princess freed after 3 years: Report||Saudi authorities have released a princess and her daughter who had been held without charge for nearly three years in the capital, a human rights group said on Saturday.Basma bint Saud, 57, a royal family member long seen as a proponent of women's rights and a constitutional monarchy, has been detained since March 2019, and in April 2020 implored King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to release her on health grounds."Basma bint Saud Al Saud and her daughter Suhoud... have been released," the ALQST for Human Rights said on Twitter."She was denied the medical care she needed for a potentially life threatening condition," the rights group added. "At no point during her detention has any charge been levelled against her."Saudi officials were not immediately available to comment on the case.Princess Basmah was arrested shortly before a planned trip to Switzerland for medical treatment, according to a source close to the family.The nature of her illness has never been disclosed.Prince Mohammed has overseen a reform drive since he was appointed by his father King Salman in June 2017 at the expense of the previous designated heir to the throne, Mohammed bin Nayef.Reforms have included lifting a decades-long ban on women driving and the easing of so-called "guardianship" rules that give men arbitrary authority over female relatives.But Saudi authorities have also cracked down on dissidents and even potential opponents, ranging from preachers to women's rights activists, even royals.Princess Basmah was kept in Al-Ha'ir prison, where numerous other political detainees have been held.In written testimony to the United Nations in 2020, seen by AFP, her family said her detention was likely due in large part to her "record as an outspoken critic of abuses".She was also deemed an ally of Mohammed bin Nayef, the written testimony added.In November 2017, a vast anti-corruption campaign saw Riyadh's luxury Ritz-Carlton hotel serve for three months as a de facto detention centre for dozens of princes and senior officials suspected of graft or disloyalty.In March 2020, the royal guard arrested King Salman's brother and nephew, accusing them of fomenting a coup against Prince Mohammed, according to several sources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imprisoned-without-charge-saudi-princess-freed-after-3-years-report-101641650731119.html

08-01-2022||World||Canada health official warns of Omicron’s strain on hospitals||Canada’s chief public officer on Friday said there has been no “explosive rate” of rise in serious illness in the country during the fifth wave of the Covid pandemic, driven by the highly transmissible Omicron variant, but warned that the “enormous volume of cases” it is causing is expected to add an additional strain on the health care system. “Although evidence from ongoing surveillance and recent studies indicates that the risk of hospitalisation is lower for Omicron compared to Delta,the sudden acceleration of Omicron”, which is now the dominant variant in Canada, will impact the system because of “increased hospital admissions and high numbers of illness and absenteeism among health care workers, which is expected to impact many areas of the country over the coming weeks,” said Dr Theresa Tam.In light of the surge in cases, with 44,309 new infections reported on Friday, Canada’s health minister Jean-Yves Duclos said vaccine mandates could become necessary.“What we see now is that our health care system in Canada is fragile, our people are tired, and the only way that we know to get through Covid-19, this variant and any future variant, is through vaccination,” he said during a briefing on Friday. At least 41,743 new cases were reported daily across Canada between December 30 and January 5, an increase of 65% over the previous week. An average of 3,646 people were being treated in hospitals each day during that period, which is 91% increase over the previous week, and, on average, 594 people were being treated in intensive care units, 25% higher than the week before, according to a release from Tam.Over nine million booster doses of Covid-19 vaccines have already been administered in the country, while 83% of the total population has received at least one dose and over 77% are fully vaccinated. But seven million still remain to be vaccinated.Vaccine certification is already required in many jurisdictions to access gyms, bars, restaurants, sports, and entertainment events, among others. The province of Quebec will add entry into liquor and cannabis stores to that list soon. The central government has mandated vaccinations for its employees, and for travel by air, on some trains, and on cruise ships.

Here's what WHO says||The Omicron variant has been causing a surge in the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) infection across the world. The number of hospitalisations is less, but the spread of infection is faster, owing to a high number of mutations the Omicron possesses.This begs a question: Can the Omicron variant reinfect a person? Health experts and the World Health Organization (WHO), which keeps an eye on the new and emerging variants of the constantly mutating coronavirus, have said that the possibility of reinfection is high.In a note published on the Omicron variant, the WHO said that the variant can evade previous immunity in people and can still infect those who have had Covid-19 in the past. It sounded an alarm for people who are unvaccinated, and those who were vaccinated many months ago.“Individuals who have recovered from Covid-19 are 3 to 5 times more likely to be reinfected with Omicron compared to Delta,” the WHO said in the note released on its website last month.It, however, added that there is still no proof that Omicron causes more severe disease than the Delta variant, which led to a devastating second wave of infection last year.The WHO said that the virus has been transmitted mostly among adults in their 20s and 30s, spreading initially in large cities and in clusters associated with social and workplace gatherings.However, some studies have confirmed the silver lining of the Omicron variant. News agency Bloomberg reported earlier this week that a combination of widespread immunity and numerous mutations have resulted in a virus that causes far less severe disease than previous iterations.The Bloomberg report was based on the ongoing studies being conducted on Omicron, including in South Africa where the variant first emerged.One of the crucial factors which makes Omicron less virulent is that it does not infect the lungs as easily as the previous variants. One such study was published by a consortium of Japanese and American scientists, who experimented on mice and hamsters. Another study in Belgium reported similar outcomes in hamsters, which experienced severe illness with previous mutations of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-recovered-covid-19-patients-be-reinfected-with-omicron-here-s-what-who-says-101641609966490.html
08-01-2022||World||Can booster shots beat the coronavirus? Read what experts have to say||The Omicron variant of coronavirus has created an unprecedented situation, leading to surge in Covid-19 infection and increasing the vaccination doses. Many countries across the world are asking people to take a third – or the booster shot – to tackle the heavily mutated Omicron.Israel has gone a step further and is giving a fourth dose of Covid-19 vaccine to its population. India has also launched a programme to inoculate an eligible group of people with the precautionary dose.But is this the way forward? And do we have to take a booster shot every few months? The healthcare experts and researchers have been baffled by the constantly mutating coronavirus and have been advocating increasing the vaccine coverage. But in many interviews, these experts have said that trying to boost the entire population every few months is not realistic.Akiko Iwasaki, professor of immunobiology at Yale University and one of the most authoritative voices on Covid-19, told New York Times that “there are better ways than doing boosters every six months”.“This doesn’t seem to be a sustainable long-term strategy, for sure,” said another immunologist Deepta Bhattacharya, from the University of Arizona.Booster shots were advocated to increase the immunity against the coronavirus, looking at the frequent mutations it is coming up with. But there is no data to support the effectiveness of this dose.The boost to the immunity has been temporary, with some studies in the United States pointing to a drop in antibody levels just weeks after a third dose.“Even with that amount of antibody, it’s very hard to stop the virus for very long. It’s a much higher bar now than before, and maybe an Omicron-specific vaccine would do a better job,” Shane Crotty, a virologist based in California told the New York Times.Late last year, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said that people might need a fourth Covid-19 shot sooner than expected due to the Omicron variant. The statement came days after Pfizer and BioNTech released results of a study which showed that a third shot of the vaccine is effective against Omicron, but a two-dose regime saw its ability to protect dropping significantly against the heavily-mutated virus.But in the United States, the worst affected country, Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that it’s too early to discuss a potential fourth dose of Covid-19 vaccine.Singapore's Health Minister Ong Ye Kung reiterated the same thought in a Facebook post on Friday. "If you have recovered well from an infection, without complications, your immune system would have gone through a strong stimulus. Think of it as a fairly powerful vaccination shot," he said.Ong said there is no rush to get boosted for those who have been infected and then vaccinated, or those who have been infected in between vaccine doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-booster-shots-beat-the-coronavirus-read-what-experts-have-to-say-101641609201715.html

The judge paused for a minute of silence to help drive home a sense of what that time must have felt like for Arbery, whose killing became part of a larger national reckoning on racial injustice.“When I thought about this, I thought from a lot of different angles. I kept coming back to the terror that must have been in the mind of the young man running through Satilla Shores,” he said, mentioning the neighborhood where Arbery was killed.Greg and Travis McMichael grabbed guns and jumped in a pickup truck to chase Arbery after spotting him running in their neighborhood outside the port city of Brunswick on Feb. 23, 2020. Their neighbor, William “Roddie” Bryan joined the pursuit in his own truck and recorded cellphone video of Travis McMichael firing close-range shotgun blasts into Arbery.“Ahmaud Arbery was then hunted down and shot, and he was killed because individuals here in this courtroom took the law into their own hands,” the judge said. Walmsley ordered the McMichaels to serve life without parole and granted Bryan a chance to earn parole after serving at least 30 years in prison.A few dozen supporters cheered Arbery’s family as they exited onto the courthouse steps Friday afternoon.“Today your son has made history, because we have people who are being held accountable for lynching a Black man in America!” said Benjamin Crump, a civil attorney representing the family.Murder carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison under Georgia law unless prosecutors seek the death penalty, which they opted against in this case. During the sentencing hearing, Arbery's family had asked the judge to show no lenience in deciding whether to grant an eventual chance at parole.Arbery's sister recalled his humor, describing him as a positive thinker with a big personality. She told the judge her brother had dark skin “that glistened in the sunlight," thick, curly hair and an athletic build, factors that made him a target for the men who pursued him.“These are the qualities that made these men assume that Ahmaud was a dangerous criminal and chase him with guns drawn. To me, those qualities reflect a young man full of life and energy who looked like me and the people I loved," Jasmine Arbery said.Arbery's mother said she suffered a personal, intense loss made worse by a trial where the defense was that her son had made bad choices that led to his death.“This wasn’t a case of mistaken identity or mistaken fact. They chose to target my son because they didn’t want him in their community. They chose to treat him differently than other people who frequently visited their community,” Wanda Cooper-Jones said. "And when they couldn’t sufficiently scare or intimidate him, they killed him.”The sentences matched the recommendation of prosecutor Linda Dunikoski, who said all deserved the mandatory life sentence for showing “no empathy for the trapped and terrified Ahmaud Arbery.”Contending the McMichaels still believed they didn’t do anything wrong, Dunikoski disclosed Friday that Greg McMichael gave Bryan's cellphone video of the shooting to an attorney, who leaked it.“He believed it was going to exonerate him,” the prosecutor said.The McMichaels' defense attorneys argued that their clients deserved the possibility of parole because the killing was an unplanned, unintentional act. Bryan's lawyer said he showed remorse and cooperated with police, turning over the cellphone video of the shooting to help them get to the truth.“Mr. Bryan isn’t the one who brought a gun,” Kevin Gough said. “He was unarmed. And I think that reflects his intentions.”Bryan is 52, raising the chances that he will spend the remainder of his life in prison even with the chance of parole after serving 30 years.The guilty verdicts against the men handed down the day before Thanksgiving prompted a victory celebration outside the Glynn County courthouse. In addition to murder, all three men were also convicted of aggravated assault, false imprisonment and criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment. Travis and Greg McMichael were each sentenced to an additional 20 years for aggravated assault.Defense attorneys have said they plan to appeal the convictions. They have 30 days after sentencing to file them.Next month, the McMichaels and Bryan face a second trial, this time in U.S. District Court on federal hate crime charges. A judge has set jury selection to begin Feb. 7. Prosecutors will argue that the three men violated Arbery's civil rights and targeted him because he was Black.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/arbery-killers-get-life-in-prison-no-parole-for-father-son-101641605417092.html

Though the investigation in the behaviour of the new strain is still in a very early stage, researchers have found very little to raise concern.The study, yet to be peer-reviewed, has been published on MedRxiv. In it, the researchers said that “it is still early to speculate on the IHU variants as the number of cases is extremely low”.Also Read | Explained: When was IHU variant first discovered and its spreadEarlier this week, then World Health Organization (WHO) also said that the ‘IHU’ variant has not become much of a threat as of now.The new variant was first identified in November and has been on WHO’s radar since then. It has so far not been labelled as a 'variant under investigation' by the global health body.The latest study has, however, advised keeping an eye on the ‘IHU’ variant.For now, the world’s focus is on the Omicron variant, which is leading to a surge in the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) infection across the world. The United States and Europe are badly hit by the Omicron strain.The IHU variant has 46 mutations and 37 deletions in its genetic code, more than Omicron. Many of these affect the spike protein.The variant is a sub-lineage of the B.1.640 and its discovery was announced by researchers from Méditerranée Infection in Marseille, part of France’s Instituts hospitalo-universitaires (IHU, or University Hospital Institutes) - hence the name. It has been classified as B.1.640.2.The IHU variant was discovered in November, in a sample of a man who visited Cameroon in Africa on a three-day trip.He began experiencing respiratory symptoms and was tested for Covid-19. The sample returned positive, with the presence of the B.1.640.2 variant.A localised spread of the infection was reported in France and attributed to the IHU strain, Vinod Scaria, a scientist of Delhi's Institute of Genomic and Integrative Biology, said on Twitter that there is no proof of that.The B.1.640, meanwhile, is not new.

But a diplomatic solution is still possible and preferable if Russia chooses it," Blinken told reporters ahead of talks Monday in Geneva.Blinken said that Russia, which has amassed tens of thousands of troops along the border with Ukraine, was "gaslighting" the world by making demands."No one should be surprised if Russia instigates a provocation or incident then tries to use it to justify military intervention, hoping that by the time the world realizes the ruse it'll be too late," Blinken said.Russia asked for the talks after putting forward proposals that include guarantees that NATO will not expand to Ukraine or further parts of the former Soviet Union."I think that's certainly part of the playbook -- to put out a list of absolutely non-starter demands and then to claim that the other side is not engaging and then to use that is somehow justification for aggressive action," Blinken said."But the fact of the matter is -- Russia knows well what is a non-starter."He said that the focus of talks will be Russia's "aggression toward Ukraine.""We won't be diverted from that issue. Because what's happening in Ukraine is not only about Ukraine, it's part of a broader pattern of destabilizing, dangerous and often illegal behavior by Moscow as it tries to build a sphere of influence that covers the countries that were once under Soviet dominion," Blinken said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-can-still-choose-diplomatic-solution-on-ukraine-says-blinken-101641580754360.html
08-01-2022||World||US: Joe Biden to deliver first State of the Union address on March 1||President Joe Biden will deliver his first State of the Union address on March 1, the White House confirmed on Friday, after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent the president a formal invitation to speak to Congress and the American public one year into his term.It will mark the latest any president has delivered a State of the Union address. The speech is normally timed for January, and occasionally for February. The delay is driven in part by a busy legislative calendar, a winter spike in Covid-19 cases from the more transmissible Omicron variant and the upcoming Winter Olympics, which ties up broadcast network time.The last State of the Union address was delivered by then-President Donald Trump on the eve of his acquittal by the Senate in his first impeachment trial.Joe Biden first addressed a joint session of Congress in April 2021, about 100 days into his time in the White House, which he used to promote twin infrastructure and domestic spending bills. Biden signed a slimmed-down and bipartisan version of the infrastructure proposal into law last year in crowning first-year legislative achievements. The larger expansion of the social safety net passed the House, but Biden has struggled to secure enough Democratic support in the Senate for passage.An address to Congress in the president’s first year is not an official State of the Union address, and Biden’s April speech bore little resemblance to one because of strict Covid-19 protocols. It was marked by limitations on attendance, with no guests allowed, and lawmakers seated on both the floor of the House chamber and the galleries above. Officials said pandemic precautions for this year’s speech were still being worked out, though they expect it to look more like a traditional State of the Union address than last year’s remarks.“Thank you for your bold vision and patriotic leadership which have guided America out of crisis and into an era of great progress, as we not only recover from the pandemic but Build Back Better!,” Pelosi wrote in her letter to Biden. “In that spirit, I am writing to invite you to address a Joint Session of Congress on Tuesday, March 1, to share your vision of the State of the Union.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-joe-biden-to-deliver-first-state-of-the-union-address-on-march-1-101641580429239.html
