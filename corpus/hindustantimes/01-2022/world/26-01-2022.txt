26-01-2022||World||China criticises US move to let diplomats leave over Covid-19 rules||China has expressed concern and dissatisfaction at the reported US bid to allow its diplomats to exit the country because of existing Covid pandemic-related restrictions.The Chinese foreign ministry on Wednesday said the pandemic control measures in China were in line with global conventions of diplomatic protocol and leaving the country would increase the risk of infection for US personnel and family.The foreign ministry was reacting to a Reuters report from Washington, which said the US state department was considering whether to authorise departures for American diplomats and their families in China wishing to leave because of intrusive pandemic control measures.“Two sources familiar with the issue said the US Embassy on Monday had sent the request to Washington for formal sign off, as China ramps up Covid-19 containment protocols ahead of the opening of the Beijing Winter Olympics in less than two weeks,” the Reuters report said.The foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said the decision was puzzling. “China is undoubtedly the safest country in the world at the moment, and withdrawing from the safest place will only greatly increase the risk of infection for US personnel. The logic of the US side’s decision is incomprehensible and difficult to justify,” he added.Zhao said China’s pandemic control measures were in line with the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.He added that China’s Covid-19 prevention and control measures were rigorous, scientific and effective, and have well protected foreign nationals in China.China had expressed “concern and dissatisfaction” to the US and hoped the embassy would reconsider the action, Zhao added.An unnamed person told Reuters that the US embassy conducted an internal survey showing that as many as 25% of staff and family members would choose to leave China as soon as possible.The tabloid Global Times, carried a story on the development, headlined: “Dirty trick again! US plots to authorise departure of staff from embassies in China over epidemic ahead of Beijing Olympics”.“Such tricks ahead of the Chinese New Year and the Games showed its true intention, which is beyond the anti-epidemic consideration but only serves to create panic, slander China’s anti-epidemic work and disrupt China’s successful hosting of the Winter Olympics,” the report said.Washington is leading several allied and partner countries in a diplomatic boycott of the upcoming Winter Olympic Games, scheduled to begin on February 4, due to what it says is Beijing’s ongoing genocide towards Uighurs and other Muslim groups in its western region of Xinjiang.China has brought the Covid-19 pandemic under control since it emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late, 2019 despite sporadic outbreaks including an ongoing one, a mix of Omicron and Delta variants.As of Tuesday, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases, both local and imported (ones detected among those flying in from abroad, mostly Chinese nationals), reported on the Chinese mainland had reached 105,749; the deaths stood at 4,636.The US has recorded more than 72 million coronavirus cases and a death toll of 891,595.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-criticises-us-move-to-let-diplomats-leave-over-covid-19-rules-101643197245243.html

26-01-2022||World||The ‘Partygate’ scandal: What Boris Johnson has said so far||Boris Johnson’s future as UK prime minister hangs in the balance as he grapples with two investigations — including one by the police — into alleged rule-breaking parties in government buildings while the country was in lockdown.The so-called ‘partygate’ controversy has gripped the country for weeks, escalating on Tuesday after police began a formal probe. That followed news of — among others — a “bring your own booze” party in Downing Street at the height of coronavirus restrictions in 2020, as well as a birthday party for Johnson.The scandal was already being investigated by senior civil servant Sue Gray, and her report is seen as central to whether members of Johnson’s Conservatives would continue to back him as a leader.  That review could come within days after police raised no objection to its publication, according to reports in local media.Meanwhile, the police probe is another damaging development for the prime minister, who is already facing calls to resign, even from within his own party, and slumping poll numbers.Among the key issues are whether any of the events breached coronavirus rules, when Johnson learned of the May 2020 BYOB party, and whether he ignored concerns from some within his office about it. Johnson has also been accused of misleading Parliament, which would customarily be a resigning matter.Here’s what Johnson has said so far in various interviews and Parliament addresses. December 1:At the weekly Prime Minister’s Questions in Parliament, Johnson says Covid rules were followed completely by his staff. Asked directly by opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer whether a Christmas party was thrown in Downing Street on Dec. 18, 2020, he replied:“What I can tell the right honorable and learned gentleman is that all guidance was followed completely in No. 10.”December 7:Asked in a broadcast interview about Dec. 18, 2020, Johnson said:“What I can tell you is that all the guidelines were observed, continue to be observed.”December 8:After days of stonewalling, Johnson finally tackles head-on allegations of a 2020 Christmas party and announces an investigation. He’s responding to a leaked video showing his aides joking about the party at a mock press conference, which prompted the resignation of his former press secretary Allegra Stratton. But he still insists no rules were broken.“I can understand how infuriating it must be to think that the people who have been setting the rules have not been following the rules because I was also furious to see that clip. I apologize unreservedly for the offense that it has caused up and down the country, and I apologize for the impression that it gives… I have been repeatedly assured since these allegations emerged that there was no party and that no Covid rules were broken… It goes without saying that if those rules were broken, then there will be disciplinary action for all those involved.”December 13:Asked about his involvement in a Christmas party quiz in 2020, Johnson replied:“I can tell you once again that I certainly broke no rules.”When Parliament went into recess for Christmas 2021, it offered Johnson an opportunity to reset his premiership, put the controversy behind him, and refocus on topics such as the rapid rollout of Covid-19 vaccine booster shots.But it wasn’t to be.On Jan. 10, 2022, broadcaster ITV reported that a top aide, Martin Reynolds, had invited about 100 people to a drinks party in the garden of No. 10 Downing Street in May 2020. Such gatherings were banned at the time under lockdown rules.January 12:Johnson makes his second apology in the space of a month to Parliament. He also admits he attended the gathering, though says he thought it was a work event.“I have learned enough to know that there were things that we simply did not get right. I must take responsibility.”“When I went into that garden just after 6 o’clock on 20 May 2020, to thank groups of staff before going back into my office 25 minutes later to continue working, I believed implicitly that this was a work event, but with hindsight, I should have sent everyone back inside... I should have recognized that even if it could be said technically to fall within the guidelines, there would be millions and millions of people who simply would not see it that way… To them and to this House, I offer my heartfelt apologies.”January 18:Johnson apologizes when asked in a broadcast interview about a party held in April 2021 on the eve of the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II’s husband Prince Philip. “I deeply and bitterly regret that that happened and I can only renew my apologies both to her majesty and to the country for misjudgments that were made and for which I take full responsibility.”Johnson is also asked to respond to a claim by Dominic Cummings, his former adviser, that Johnson not only knew about the May 20 party but ignored concerns raised. Cummings has been a thorn in the premier’s side since he was forced out of Downing Street in late 2020. Read more about his mudslinging here.“I can tell you categorically that nobody told me, and nobody said that this was something that was against the rules, a breach of the Covid rules...I do humbly apologize to people for misjudgments that were made.”He adds that people shouldn’t judge before all the facts are known.“What people need to do is wait and see what the report says.”January 25:In Parliament, the prime minister responds to news of the police’s involvement.“I welcome the Met’s decision to conduct its own investigation because I believe that will help to give the public the clarity they need and help to draw a line under matters.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-partygate-scandal-what-boris-johnson-has-said-so-far-101643189080494.html

The study is yet to be peer-reviewed and has been posted recently on BioRxiv. According to the findings, Omicron can remain alive on the skin for over 21 hours and more than eight days on any plastic surface. This might be the reason why Omicron is spreading faster compared to other strains, the study said.For the study, the researchers compared the survival time of the other variants and concluded that the Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants could remain alive on plastic surfaces for 56 hours, 191.3 hours, 156.6 hours, 59.3 hours, and 114 hours, respectively.Why some people avoid Covid-19 when those around them have it? Study explainsOmicron, on the other hand, can survive on a plastic surface for 193.5 hours, more than 8 days.On skin samples, the average virus survival times were 8.6 hours for the original version, 19.6 hours for Alpha, 19.1 hours for Beta, 11 hours for Gamma, 16.8 hours for Delta and 21.1 hours for Omicron, the study claimed.The findings also include the effectiveness of ethanol on all variants. Although Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron variants showed a slight increase in ethanol resistance in response to increased environmental stability, all VOCs on the skin surface were completely inactivated by 15-second exposure to 35 per cent ethanol, it said, asserting that santisiting hands frequently is highly recommended.Omicron is the latest variant of SARS-CoV-2, which was first identified in South Africa on November 24, 2021. Since then, the variant has been spreading at an unprecedented spread replacing Delta, and led to a fresh surge of the pandemic across the world. (With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-survives-over-21-hours-on-skin-more-than-8-days-on-plastic-study-101643185076600.html

Nothing less is at stake than our democracy,” she added.By announcing she would seek a 19th term, Pelosi avoids becoming a lame duck in a year when Democrats are clinging to a fragile majority in the House and the party is under pressure to raise vast sums of money to defend control of Congress.Her decision to remain in the chamber follows announcements by 29 House Democrats that they won't seek reelection this year, compared to 13 Republicans as the GOP looks toward taking back the House.The party that controls the White House typically loses seats in Congress in midterm elections, and Democrats are defending both chambers at a time when President Joe Biden's approval rating has been slipping.“Our democracy is at risk because the assault on the truth, assault on the U.S. Capitol and the state-by-state assault on voting rights,” she added.In the video, Pelosi never addresses if she intends to seek another term as the House's Democratic leader, if reelected.The San Francisco Democrat made history 15 years ago when she became the first female speaker of the House. She has served in Congress since 1987.Earlier this month in an interview with The Associated Press, Pelosi only hinted at another run, saying she “may” seek reelection.In a Twitter post, California Republican Kevin Kiley, a congressional candidate and state assemblyman, said Pelosi's announcement was “all the more reason we need Republicans in Congress who will fight.”Pelosi will be a overwhelming favourite in her heavily Democratic district — she won with 78% of the vote in 2020. But she's also running at a time when her hometown has been criticized for squalor and crime, including daytime shootings in tourist areas, widespread homelessness and smash-and-grab thefts at high-end stores.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/house-speaker-nancy-pelosi-to-seek-reelection-amid-retirement-buzz-101643167807231.html
26-01-2022||World||Why some people avoid Covid-19 when those around them have it? Study explains||The Omicron variant of the coronavirus has led to a surge in Covid-19 infection across the globe. The heavily-mutated strain is believed to bypass the existing vaccines and give stronger infection to the host.Yet, there are some people who don’t catch the virus despite living with a person who has Covid-19. How is it possible?A new study has explored thig angle, claiming that such people may be exposed to other coronaviruses in the past that enabled them to make memory immune cells - called T cells. They offer a higher protection against Covid-19.“Cross-reactive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 have been observed in pre-pandemic cohorts and proposed to contribute to host protection,” said the study published in Nature, which studied 52 Covid-19 household contacts to capture their immune responses. The idea was to capture immune responses at the earliest timepoints after exposure to Sars-CoV-2 virus.The researchers noted that viruses from the coronavirus family, though causes different illnesses, have some shared characteristics.Their shared structural similarities enable immune cells that recognise one type of coronavirus to recognise another type, said the study.The blood of all the 52 household contacts was tested between day one and day six. The researchers found higher levels of memory T cells in the samples of those who tested negative on a PCR test for Covid-19 than those who tested positive.The T cells that they measured not only targeted the spike protein part of the virus but also the nucleocapsid, the core part of the virus that stores its genetic material, the researchers said.Meanwhile, an infectious disease expert had said earlier this week that vaccinated people and those who haven’t taken a jab, experience different Omicron symptoms.“There is little systematic data so far, but I expect that many vaccinated and especially boosted folks are experiencing very mild symptoms and there is a higher proportion of vaccinated folks who have no symptoms,” Dr Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, told KSN.com.Dr Maya N Clark-Cutaia, professor at the New York University Meyers College of Nursing, said vaccinated people are reporting headaches, body aches and fever when infected with Omicron. Unvaccinated patients are more frequently reporting cough, shortness of breath and flu-like symptoms, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-some-people-avoid-covid-19-when-those-around-them-have-it-study-explains-101643167305375.html

The virologist, Aris Katzourakis, said in an article published in Nature that endemic has become one of the most misused of the pandemic.Watch: Belgium protests Covid rules“It doesn’t mean that Covid-19 will come to a natural end,” said Katzourakis, a professor at University of Oxford who studies viral evolution and genomics.Also Read | Netherlands eases Covid-19 lockdown despite spike in casesHe then explained what endemic means in epidemiological terms. Katzourakis said that a disease reaches an endemic stage when the number of people it is infecting balances out the basic reproduction number - those individuals who an infected person would pass on the infection too.“Common colds are endemic. So are Lassa fever, malaria and polio. So was smallpox, until vaccines stamped it out,” he said.But a disease can be both endemic and still widespread and deadly, noted Katzourakis, highlighting that malaria killed 600,000 people in 2020, and tuberculosis took the lives of 1.5 million in the same year.“Endemic certainly does not mean that evolution has somehow tamed a pathogen so that life simply returns to ‘normal’,” said Katzourakis.The latest surge in Covid-19 infection is led by the new and heavily mutated Omicron variant of the coronavirus, which was first found in South Africa in November last year. The worst affected regions are the United States and Europe, where fresh peaks of infection have been appearing nearly every day. However, the research on Omicron has noted that hospitalisations are low, which denotes reduced severity.Also Read | Health officials offer hope that Omicron wave will increase global immunitySince it first struck the world, the healthcare experts have been studying the evolution of the Sars-CoV-2 virus and have predicted that the disease is here to stay, and the world will have to learn to live with it. Katzourakis has lashed out at this.“As an evolutionary virologist, it frustrates me when policymakers invoke the word endemic as an excuse to do little or nothing. There’s more to global health policy than learning to live with endemic rotavirus, hepatitis C or measles,” he added.Katzourakis warned that a virus like the Sars-CoV-2 has the capacity to mutate and it can bring strains which are more dangerous than Omicron. He also rubbished the “rosy misconception” that virus evolve and become benign over time, noting that there is no predestined evolutionary outcome for the same.The virologist then went on to list steps, which he said are “immediately needed”. The first such step is setting aside lazy optimism. Then, he said that authorities must be realistic about the likely levels of death, disability and sickness taking into account the new and emerging variants. And the third step listed by Katzourakis talks about using vaccines, diagnostic tests and following Covid protocols like wearing masks, social distancing etc.“The more a virus replicates, the greater the chance that problematic variants will arise, most probably where spread is highest,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-endemic-doesn-t-mean-life-can-return-to-normal-says-virologist-101643162518852.html
26-01-2022||World||Netherlands eases Covid-19 lockdown despite spike in cases||Prime Minister Mark Rutte further eased the Netherlands' coronavirus lockdown, allowing bars, restaurants, museums, theaters and other venues to reopen from Wednesday for the first time this year.But Rutte warned that the move wasn't without risks.“We are taking a big step today to unlock the Netherlands while the infections numbers are really going through the roof,” Rutte said Tuesday.The announcement wasn't all good news for the beleaguered hospitality and cultural sectors, with the opening hours limited to 10 p.m., while professional sports teams will only be allowed to fill stadiums to a third of their normal capacities.Soccer clubs and administrators protested the move even before it was officially announced, calling it in a joint statement “a proposal without perspective.”The relaxation of restrictions follows widespread protests in recent weeks by business owners ranging from the Van Gogh Museum to local cafes at being excluded from am earlier easing of pandemic restrictions.Infections have spiked in recent weeks because of the omicron variant, despite the lockdown that was tougher than in most of Europe, but admissions to the country's intensive care units have been declining. The national public health institute reported a 51% rise in new Covid-19 cases over the last week to more than 366,000, while ICU admissions dropped by 34%.“We are taking another risk," Health Minister Ernst Kuipers said. "We are doing that for good reason. Living longer with many restrictive measures damages our health and our society.”Omicron is less likely to cause severe illness than the previous delta variant, according to studies. Omicron spreads even more easily than other coronavirus strains, and has already become dominant in many countries. It also more easily infects those who have been vaccinated or had previously been infected by prior versions of the virus.The Dutch government sought to mitigate the risk by imposing restrictions on venues where people gather, including the use of coronavirus passports and social distancing and capping the number of people allowed indoors and in stadiums.The new measures apply for six weeks, but Rutte said the government would review them and their effect on infection numbers after three weeks.He urged the public to stick to the rules, saying: “It is now up to us all to ensure that we don't have to hit the brakes again then."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/netherlands-eases-covid-19-lockdown-despite-spike-in-cases-101643161719764.html

I would see that," Biden said when asked by reporters in Washington about targeting Putin, whom opponents have long accused of holding gigantic, secret wealth.A senior US official laid out economic sanctions "with massive consequences" that go far beyond previous measures implemented in 2014 after Russia invaded Ukraine's Crimea region.New measures would include restrictions on exports of high-tech US equipment in the artificial intelligence, quantum computing and aerospace sectors, the official told reporters on condition of anonymity."What we're talking about are sophisticated technologies that we design and produce," and cutting them off would hit Putin's "strategic ambitions to industrialize his economy quite hard," the official said.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson echoed the threat, saying sanctions would be "heavier than anything we've ever done."French President Emmanuel Macron said he would talk by telephone with Putin on Friday, seeking "clarification" on Moscow's intentions.New Russian military exercisesA day after Washington said it was putting 8,500 US troops on alert for possible deployment to bolster NATO forces in Europe, the Russian military announced it was conducting new drills involving 6,000 troops near Ukraine and within the Crimea region.The drills included firing exercises with fighter jets, bombers, anti-aircraft systems and ships from the Black Sea and Caspian fleets, the defense ministry said.According to Western officials, the Kremlin has already deployed more than 100,000 troops on Ukraine's borders, with reinforcements arriving from all over Russia."We continue to watch the accumulation of significant combat power," Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said.Washington also warned Russia ally Belarus that its authoritarian government would "face a swift and decisive response" if it helps Moscow invade Ukraine."If an invasion were to proceed from Belarus, if Russian troops were to permanently station on their territory, NATO could well have to reassess our own force posture in the countries that border Belarus," State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters.The United States and its EU allies accuse Russia of seeking to upend European stability by threatening invasion of Ukraine, a former Soviet republic striving to join NATO and other Western institutions.Moscow denies plans to invade the country, where in addition to seizing Crimea, it backs separatist forces in the east.Russia instead blames the West for the tension and has put forward a list of demands, including a guarantee that Ukraine never join NATO and that NATO forces already in the former Soviet bloc pull back.Energy threatsThe senior US official said "contingency" plans were being drawn up to get Europe through the winter in case of Russia squeezing energy supplies.Washington and its European allies are scouring global markets for alternative energy sources, even as Europe already struggles with soaring mid-winter energy prices."If Russia decides to weaponize its supply of natural gas or crude oil, it wouldn't be without consequences to the Russian economy," the US official told reporters.Although the European Union sources about 40 percent of its supply from Russia, Moscow also relies heavily on sales of energy, meaning "it's an interdependency," the official said.Negotiating attemptsNegotiations this month have failed to ease tensions, though Washington and Moscow have agreed to keep talking.In addition to the Macron-Putin talks later, the French government said Russian and Ukrainian officials would meet, along with French and German counterparts, in Paris on Wednesday.Washington has promised written answers to Moscow's demands this week, while already making clear that it rejects giving Russia a veto on Ukraine joining NATO.But the crisis has laid bare divisions in the West.The new government in Germany has faced criticism from Kyiv over its refusal to send defensive weapons to Ukraine, as well as hesitating over one of the harshest economic sanctions under discussion -- cutting Moscow from the global SWIFT payments system.Ukraine's military is heavily outgunned by Russia and Biden repeated that he has "no intention of putting American forces or NATO forces in Ukraine."However, the United States has stepped up deliveries of weapons. A shipment arrived on Saturday and another batch was due Tuesday.At a ceremony for the latest shipment arriving in Kyiv, US charge d'affaires Kristina Kvien said "our preference is diplomacy."But in case of attack by Russia, "the Kremlin will face fierce resistance, the losses to Russia will be heavy.""If President Putin decides to make this reckless choice, we will provide additional defensive material to the Ukrainians above and beyond what we've already sent," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ukraine-russia-tension-biden-threatens-putin-with-personal-sanctions-101643151894242.html
26-01-2022||World||Group preparing attacks dismantled, says Ukraine||Ukraine said on Tuesday it had dismantled saboteurs controlled by Moscow who were preparing a series of attacks in Ukraine’s border regions to “destabilise” the situation in the ex-Soviet country.The men were planning a “series of armed attacks” on city infrastructure, Ukraine’s security service SBU said in a statement, adding that the group was “coordinated by Russian special services”.The SBU said it arrested two residents of Ukraine, one of them a Russian citizen, and seized “an explosive device, small arms and ammunition”.The two acted in Kharkiv, a city with one million people located near the Russian border in the east, and in the town of Zhytomyr in central Ukraine.Under the pretext of recruiting personnel for a private security firm they got people to join them, the SBU added.A source in law enforcement told AFP that both men were former commandos with combat experience and were recruiting “mainly” Russians who had already committed violent crimes. Kiev and the West accuse Russia of massing tens of thousands of troops on the Ukrainian border in preparation for a possible invasion as well as of seeking to destabilise the situation inside Ukraine.Ukrainian defence minister Oleksiy Reznikov played down the prospect of a full-scale invasion by the Russian military and reinforced the view from officials in Kiev that the nation’s security challenge hasn’t changed significantly since 2014.“The aggression continues since 2014 - the facts are the same, but the assessment of these facts is different,” Reznikov told reporters on Tuesday, citing international media coverage. Still, the shift is giving Ukraine the chance to benefit from greater military assistance, he said.US puts troops on alertWestern allies are pushing ahead with diplomatic efforts to avert war between Russia and Ukraine, though the Kremlin warned on Tuesday that a US decision to put as many as 8,500 troops on alert for deployment in Eastern Europe “exacerbates tensions”.The US troop move “exacerbates tensions” and Russia is monitoring the situation “with great concern”, according to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.Russia still expects to receive written US responses to its security demands this week, after which it will decide on prospects for future diplomacy, Peskov told reporters.Among other things, Russia is demanding that Nato pull back military infrastructure from its periphery, something the alliance has so far refused to do.The US is coordinating with the EU and Nato on its written response to Russia’s demands about Nato and Ukraine, according to an EU official who asked not to be identified.The reply is unlikely to be a detailed discussion of those requirements, the official said, but will set out areas where western allies believe they can address Russian concerns, as well as Russian actions that are alarming to Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/group-preparing-attacks-dismantled-says-ukraine-101643151351224.html
26-01-2022||World||Unicef laments education losses||School closures due to the Covid pandemic have caused “nearly insurmountable” losses in education among children around the world, Unicef said on Monday.More than 616 million students are still being affected by full or partial school closures, the UN children’s agency said.School closures due to the Covid pandemic have caused “nearly insurmountable” losses in education among children around the world, Unicef said on Monday.More than 616 million students are still being affected by full or partial school closures, the UN children’s agency said.|#+|In many countries, in addition to depriving millions of children of the chance to acquire basic skills, these disruptions have affected students’ mental health, put them at greater risk of abuse and prevented many from having access to “a regular source of nutrition”, Unicef added.“Quite simply, we are looking at a nearly insurmountable scale of loss to children’s schooling,” said Unicef chief of education Robert Jenkins in a statement.And “just reopening schools is not enough”, he added, calling for “intensive support to recover lost education”.Unicef reported that “learning losses to school closures have left up to 70% of 10-year-olds unable to read or understand a simple text, up from 53% pre-pandemic” in countries with low and middle income.In Ethiopia, for example, children learned only “between 30 to 40% of the math they would have learned if it had been a normal school year” in primary school, the UN agency estimated.Rich countries are far from being spared. In the US, learning losses have been observed in several states, including Texas, California and Maryland, said Unicef. School drop-outs are also a problem: in South Africa, between 400,000 and 500,000 students “reportedly dropped out of school altogether between March 2020 and July 2021”.Finally, in addition to rising levels of anxiety and depression among children and young people linked to the pandemic, school closures also meant more than 370 million children globally did not get school meals, “losing what is for some children the only reliable source of food and daily nutrition”.Israeli panel advises 4th vaccine dose for adultsAn expert panel on Tuesday advised the Israeli government to begin offering a fourth vaccine dose to everyone over the age of 18, citing research showing it helps prevent Covid-19 infection and severe illness.The advisory committee said research shows a fourth dose provides three to five times the level of protection against serious disease and double the protection against infection compared to three doses.Hong Kong expanded a partial lockdown and tightened pandemic restrictions on Tuesday after more than 200 cases of Covid-19 were discovered at a public housing estate.Nearly two dozen sailors on an Australian military ship going to deliver aid to Tonga have tested positive for the coronavirus, officials said on Tuesday, raising fears they could bring Covid-19 to a Pacific nation that has so far managed to avoid any outbreaks.The Australian government was working with Tongan authorities to keep the ship at sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unicef-laments-education-losses-101643151023419.html
26-01-2022||World||IMF trims global growth forecast; expects India’s financial sector to do better||Global economic growth will dip from 5.9% in 2021 to 4.4% in 2022, half a percentage point less than it estimated just three months ago, and 3.8% in 2023, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) noted in its World Economic Outlook released on Tuesday.The Fund estimates that India will grow at 9% in 2021-2022 – it estimated India’s growth prospects at 9.5% for the year in its October 2021 assessment; projects 9% growth for the Indian economy in 2022-23 – in its October assessment, this was pegged at 8.5%; and 7.1% in 2023-24.“India’s prospects for 2023 are marked up on expected improvements to credit growth – and subsequently investment and consumption – building on better-than-anticipated performance of the financial sector,” the report noted.But the Fund’s prognosis for the global economy is grim. “As the new Omicron Covid-19 variant spreads, countries have reimposed mobility restrictions. Rising energy prices and supply disruptions have resulted in a higher and more broad-based inflation than anticipated, notably in the United States and many emerging market and developing economies. The ongoing retrenchment of China’s real estate sector and slower-than-expected recovery of private consumption have also have limited growth prospects,” the report notes. Earlier this month, the World Bank too had predicted a slowdown in a global growth, pegging it at 4.1% in 2022.The dip in its projections for global growth are largely driven by the Fund’s assessment of economic prospects in the US and China. The report noted that removing the Build Back Better policy (a Joe Biden initiative that is stuck in Congress) from the baseline, earlier withdrawal of monetary accommodation, and continued supply shortages produced a downward revision of 1.2 percentage points for growth in US in 2022 – now pegged at 4%. “In China, pandemic-induced disruptions related to zero-tolerance Covid policy and protracted financial stress among property developers have induced a 0.8 percentage point downgrade.”IMF believes that elevated inflation will stay longer than assumed, and will wane off only in 2022 as “supply side imbalances wane and monetary policy in major economies responds”.The outlook, however, is clear on the risks to the global economy – pointing to the possibility of the emergence of new Covid-19 variants, renewed economic disruptions, supply chain disruptions, energy price volatility, and localised wage pressures.“As advanced economies lift policy rates, risks to financial stability and emerging markets and developing economies’ capital rates, currencies and fiscal positions – especially with debt levels having increased significantly in the last two years – may emerge.”The Fund also alluded to the possibility of geopolitical tensions (the US and Russia are locked in a bitter dispute over Ukraine) and the ongoing climate emergency as other risks.In a blog on the IMF’s assessment, Gita Gopinath, the Fund’s first deputy managing director, also flagged the dangers of uneven recovery. “The troubling divergence in prospects across countries persists. While advanced economies are projected to return to pre-pandemic trend this year, several emerging markets and developing economies are projected to have sizeable output losses in the medium-term. The number of people living in extreme poverty is estimated to have been around 70 million higher than pre-pandemic trends in 2021, setting back the progress in poverty reduction by several years.”The report bats for worldwide access to vaccine, tests and treatments, which entails “increased production of supplies, better in-country delivery systems and fairer international distribution”.Monetary policy, IMF recommends, will need to tighten in many economies to curb inflationary pressures; fiscal policy, it says, will need to prioritise health and social spending and the worst-affected. “In this context, international cooperation will be essential to preserve access to liquidity and expedite orderly debt restructurings when needed.”
26-01-2022||World||Thich Nhat Hanh (1926-2022): The mindful monk had said, ‘Walk as if you are kissing the Earth with your feet’||After dedicating a lifetime to promote peace and compassion in the world, author, activist and Zen Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh left the planet for his heavenly abode, on Friday.The news that was shared on his Twitter account, on Saturday morning, read: “The International Plum Village Community of Engaged Buddhism announces that our beloved teacher Thich Nhat Hanh passed away peacefully at Từ Hiếu Temple in Huế, Vietnam, at 00:00hrs on 22nd January, 2022, at the age of 95.” The community also posted a link to the live streaming of the transition ceremony held by Deer Park Monastery, which is a mindfulness practice and monastic training centre founded by Hanh in California, USA.Known as the Father of Mindfulness, he was born as Nguyen Xuan Bao in 1926. Ordained as a monk at the age of 16, he is now remembered fondly as one who introduced the concept of mindfulness to the West. Hanh also authored more than hundred books, including The Miracle of Mindfulness and Peace Is Every Step. He was fluent in speaking seven languages, and caught the attention of many, the world over, after he delivered lectures at the Princeton and Columbia universities, in the early 1960s. “I met him in 1987, and he transformed my life,” says Shantum Seth, an ordained Dharmacharya (dharma teacher), in the Buddhist mindfulness lineage of the Zen Master. Seth shares, “For me, he was a living Buddha. He was an awakened man, trying to bring the age old teachings in a way that they are relevant to us now. He empowered us to continue on this path of awakening, and taught us throughout his life, how to overcome the concept of birth and death. Like he used to say in his words, ‘The cloud never dies... it might transform into rain or snow’; we too have to look at him from a different eye now.” During the Vietnam War in the 1960s, Hanh had met civil rights leader Martin Luther King in the US, and also persuaded him to speak against the conflict. Subsequently, King nominated the monk for Nobel Peace Prize, describing him as, “an apostle of peace and non violence.” After opposing the war, Hanh was exiled from Vietnam, and he spread his teachings on peace and Buddhism outside his country, and soon became only second to the Dalai Lama. On receiving the news of his death, Seth says, “It’s like our spiritual father has passed away. With him there’s associated an energy of recommitment and practise of Buddhism, but not as a religion... He was never a guru, and told us ‘You have to be your own teacher’. In such moment of poignancy in our lives, one can light a candle in the heart to pay respect to him.” Authors tweet @HennaRakheja and @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thich-nhat-hanh-1926-2022-the-mindful-monk-had-said-walk-as-if-you-are-kissing-the-earth-with-your-feet-101642849424865.html
