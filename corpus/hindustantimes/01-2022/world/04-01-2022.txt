04-01-2022||World||Prince Andrew asks to dismiss US sex case, judge to rule 'soon'||Prince Andrew's lawyers pressed a New York judge Tuesday to dismiss a sexual assault lawsuit brought against the British royal, arguing he was protected by a previously confidential settlement that his accuser signed in 2009.Lawyer Andrew Brettler said Virginia Giuffre had "waived her rights" to sue other defendants in relation to alleged sex crimes committed by late disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.Judge Lewis Kaplan did not make an immediate ruling but appeared to express skepticism at Andrew's argument, questioning how a third-party could enforce a secret agreement that it didn't know about.Hour-long oral arguments in the civil action filed by Giuffre -- also a longtime accuser of Epstein's companion, the convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell -- were held via video conference with the public able to listen in by telephone.Giuffre alleges that Epstein lent her out for sex with his wealthy and powerful associates, including to Andrew, an allegation that Queen Elizabeth II's second son has repeatedly and strenuously denied.The deal made public for the first time Monday by a New York court showed that Giuffre agreed to drop a civil claim against Epstein for $500,000.The settlement contained a provision that purports to protect "other potential defendants" from being sued related to alleged sexual abuse committed by Epstein, who killed himself in jail in 2019.Brettler described it as "unambiguous" and argued that it protected the prince from litigation."Miss Giuffre intended to release a broad category of individuals, including royalty, including businessmen," Brettler said."She waived her rights to sue them when she entered into the 2009 release agreement and accepted the money from Mr. Epstein."But the judge said that neither he nor Brettler could "find any meaning at all" in the word "potential.""You'll have a decision pretty soon, but I'm not going to define that further," Kaplan said at the end of the hearing.Giuffre sued the prince for unspecified damages last year, alleging he sexually assaulted her in 2001 when she was 17 and a minor under American law.She says Andrew assaulted her at Epstein's home in New York, and on Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands.Giuffre's lawyer David Boies argued that the Epstein-Giuffre agreement was unrelated to Andrew because it was signed in Florida."Prince Andrew was not subject to jurisdiction," he told judge Kaplan.Giuffre alleges Andrew also sexually abused her at the London home of Maxwell, who last week was found guilty of sex trafficking minors for Epstein.The 61-year-old Andrew has not been criminally charged.Maxwell convictedMaxwell, who introduced Andrew to Epstein in the early 1990s, faces life behind bars after being convicted by New York jurors of five of the six counts she faced following a high-profile month-long trial.Epstein died aged 66 in a Manhattan jail in what New York's coroner ruled was a suicide, after being charged with child sex trafficking.Back in 2008 he was convicted of paying young girls for sexual massages at his Florida mansion but served just 13 months in jail after striking a deal with the state prosecutor at the time.Andrew has rarely been seen in public since he was forced to quit the royal frontline in 2019 for failing to distance himself from Epstein.In a disastrous interview with the BBC that year, Andrew denied Giuffre's claim that they had shared a sweaty dance at a London nightclub, saying that at the time he could not sweat due to a condition related to having fought in the 1982 Falklands War.Last week, Giuffre's lawyers demanded that Andrew hand over medical records proving that he is unable to sweat.Andrew's legal team has accused Giuffre of seeking to profit from a "baseless lawsuit," which is still in its early days.If the case proceeds and Giuffre and Andrew are unable to reach a settlement then it could go before a jury trial, likely in the latter half of this year.On Friday, Kaplan rejected attempts by Andrew's lawyers to halt progression of the suit on the grounds that Giuffre now lives in Australia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-andrew-asks-to-dismiss-us-sex-case-judge-to-rule-soon-101641318881440.html

Needless to say, the fifth wave of the corona is looming over Pakistan and hence the country is imposing tighter restrictions to contain the virus.The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has made it mandatory for people to get their PCR test done 48 hours before their flight. In addition to this, travellers who are aged 15 or above are required to show their negative report upon arrival in Pakistan reported Geo News. Another change being made is to remove the ban which was in place for countries in B and C categories, CAA stated.The new guidelines announced by the CAA as reported by Geo News include mandatory Covid-19 vaccination and possession of proof of Covid-19 vaccination, applicable for all passengers above 15 years of age; Valid negative PCR test result conducted within the 48 hours prior to commencement of travel to Pakistan which is applicable for all passengers above 06 years of age; Rapid Antigen Testing upon arrival for all direct flights from Europe; Rapid Antigen Testing upon arrival of a minimum of 50 per cent inbound flights from KSA, UAE and Qatar, and selective Rapid Antigen Testing for all inbound flights other than all direct flights from Europe and inbound flights from KSA, UAE and Qatar.Any passenger who is detected Covid positive will be sent to quarantine for 10 days. The CAA stated that travellers will not be charged for expenses incurred at quarantine centres set up by the health department, reported Geo News.National Command and Operation Centre said that the fifth wave of Covid is spreading at a faster pace and Pakistan has reported its highest Covid cases in two months. NCOC confirmed that the positivity rate in Karachi has risen from 2 per cent to 6 per cent in the last three days. The surge in cases is worrisome and measures are taken up to contain the spread and cope up with the situation in Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-issues-new-travel-advisory-amid-looming-fifth-wave-of-covid19-101641302785088.html
04-01-2022||World||Prosecutor drops groping charge against former New York Governor Cuomo||Albany's top prosecutor said Tuesday he is dropping a criminal charge accusing former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo of fondling an aide.Albany County District Attorney David Soares' decision comes three days before the Democratic ex-governor was due to answer the misdemeanor charge in court.“While we found the complainant in this case cooperative and credible, after review of all the available evidence, we have concluded that we cannot meet our burden at trial,” Soares said in a statement. He said he was “deeply troubled” by the allegation but was requesting that a complaint that the county sheriff filed in October be dismissed.The criminal complaint accused Cuomo of forcible touching. Soares had suggested the complaint was problematic.The sheriff's complaint did not name the woman, but she has identified herself as Brittany Commisso. She was one of Cuomo's executive assistants before he resigned amid sexual misconduct allegations in August.Commisso “had no control over the filing or prosecution of criminal charges. She had no authority or voice in those decisions,” her lawyer, Brian Premo, said in a statement Monday.“The only thing she has any power over is her resolution to continue to speak the truth and seek justice in an appropriate civil action, which she will do in due course,” he added.There was no immediate comment from Cuomo, who resigned in August.The Times-Union of Albany first reported that the charge would be dropped.Commisso says Cuomo slid his hand up her blouse and grabbed her breast when they were alone in an office at the governor's mansion in Albany in late 2020.Her testimony was included in a report, released in August by state Attorney General Letitia James, that concluded Cuomo sexually harassed 11 women. Cuomo announced his resignation a week after the release of the report, which he has attacked as inaccurate and biased.“I knew, and he knew, too, that that was wrong,” Commisso told investigators for the attorney general's office. “And that I in no way, shape or form invited that, nor did I ask for it. I didn't want it.”Cuomo has vehemently denied groping Commisso.“I would have to lose my mind to do some — such a thing. It would be an act of insanity to touch a woman's breast and make myself vulnerable to a woman for such an accusation,” Cuomo told lawyers investigating sexual harassment accusations for the attorney general, a fellow Democrat.Cuomo attorney Rita Glavin has said that Commisso had an “evolving version” of what happened.In October, Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple's office filed a criminal complaint against Cuomo accusing him of forcible touching in connection with Commisso's allegation.Soares later criticized Apple for “unilaterally and inexplicably” filing a complaint without first consulting with his office. The prosecutor criticized Apple's filing as “potentially defective” in asking a judge to delay Cuomo's arraignment from November to January.Apple has said the court paperwork was processed quickly, before he had a chance to consult with the district attorney. But he said he was confident in the strength of the case.The Associated Press doesn't identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they decide to tell their stories publicly, as Commisso has done in interviews.Several prosecutors around the state launched investigations after the attorney general's report.The development in Albany comes after two prosecutors in the New York City suburbs separately announced that Cuomo would not face criminal charges for allegations involving other women.A Long Island prosecutor announced on Dec. 23 that there would be no charges after a female state trooper on Cuomo's security detail told state investigators that he ran his hand across her abdomen at an event at Belmont Park in September 2019.Five days later, the district attorney in Westchester County announced Cuomo would not face charges stemming from allegations from that same trooper and another woman that the former governor planted unwanted kisses on their cheeks.In both instances, the prosecutors said the allegations were credible, but that they could not pursue criminal charges.On Monday, a lawyer for Cuomo said the Manhattan district attorney's office told him it had closed an investigation into how Cuomo's office handled nursing homes during the coronavirus pandemic. The office declined to comment.The office didn't disclose what it was looking into, but Cuomo faced scrutiny over his administration's reporting of nursing home residents' deaths and over an order that barred the homes from turning away recovering hospital patients because they had Covid-19.Federal prosecutors have also been investigating the nursing home death data issue.The state attorney general, meanwhile, has been investigating Cuomo's use of aides to help craft and promote his pandemic memoir. Cuomo said they volunteered, using their personal time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prosecutor-drops-groping-charge-against-former-new-york-governor-cuomo-101641316819011.html

Intensive care occupancy reached 21.2% on Monday, up from 8% a month ago but less than half the peak of 43% recorded last January.More than 90% of Spaniards over 12 have received a full vaccine course, according to health ministry data, while just under a third of children aged 5-11 have received their first dose since Spain began vaccinating that age group in mid-December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spanish-students-to-go-back-to-school-after-christmas-break-despite-omicron-101641302903454.html

According to the John Hopkins University data, the country logged 1.06 million cases of infections. The tally was almost double the previous record, set just days ago.This comes as the Omicron variant sweeps across the country, leading to exponential growth in the daily infections, cancelled flights, closed schools and offices and overwhelmed hospitals.Here are some of the key points to know about the surge:> Despite the surge in Covid cases, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shortened the isolation period to five days for asymptomatic people who test positive for Covid-19.>The agency has urged people to get a negative test result before venturing out again, officials said.> In the fresh surge, Covid-19 deaths have not soared yet as the spike is mostly driven by the Omicron variant. According to early studies, the Omicron variant spreads faster than earlier strains but causes milder symptoms.> The surge has also put enormous pressure on testing facilities, with holiday travellers waiting in long lines to be tested. Rapid at-home diagnostics are also flying off pharmacy shelves as the infection spreads rapidly in the country.> According to a report by Bloomberg, the actual number of infections might be underreported as Americans are not reporting the results of their at-home tests to the official government authorities.> The massive influx in cases also comes just as millions of students prepare to return to school, leading to a record jump in pediatric Covid-19 hospitalisations.> According to CDC data, an average of 378 children were admitted to hospitals every day with Covid-19 in the week ending on December 28. That's a 66% jump from the previous week, CNN had reported. The number also broke the previous record of 342 average hospitalisations, set during the Delta variant surge, earlier this year.> Most people who are being hospitalised for Covid-19 are unvaccinated against the disease, multiple reports have claimed citing data by hospitals.

04-01-2022||World||Italy: Voting for new Italian President to start on Jan 24||Italy’s lower chamber of Parliament on Tuesday set Jan. 24 as the start date to begin voting for a new president, officially kicking off a campaign that is expected to see Premier Mario Draghi and ex-Premier Silvio Berlusconi vie for the prestigious job.The victor, who is chosen by around 1,000 “big electors" among lawmakers and regional representatives, will replace President Sergio Mattarella, whose seven-year term ends Feb. 3. The voting is expected to last several rounds over several days.The Italian presidency has limited powers and is largely ceremonial. But the president plays a key role in resolving political impasses, which aren't uncommon in Italy. And this election comes before a new season of campaigning before the 2023 parliamentary election.During Italy's political crisis last year, Mattarella tapped Draghi to lead a government of national unity to help guide the country through the pandemic and secure European Union funding for Italy’s recovery plan.At his end-of-year news conference, Draghi said he had accomplished what he set out to do, indicating his availability to move into the presidential Quirinale Palace and allow political parties to resume the process of governing.The center-left Democratic Party, which recently has topped polls with around 20% of voters, has voiced strong support for a Draghi presidency, believing that the internationally respected Draghi would send a signal of continued Italian stability and credibility.The center-right, which combined far outpolls the PD, has instead rallied behind Berlusconi, the 85-year-old media mogul and three-time premier. Berlusconi, who faced continuous legal problems during three decades in politics, was acquitted by Italy’s highest court in 2015 of charges he paid for sex with an underage prostitute during infamous “bunga bunga” parties.On Tuesday, Italian news reports said the 5 Star Movement was instead rallying behind a second Mattarella term. There has been no indication that Mattarella, 80, would accept.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-voting-for-new-italian-president-to-start-on-jan-24-101641295756253.html

That move came after the court ruled in 2020 that the law, which had expanded access to single women but excluded gay couples, “disproportionately harmed the right to equality and the right to parenthood” and was unlawful. It gave the government of then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a year to draw up a new law, but parliament failed to meet the deadline.The court said last year that the change in the law would take six months to come into effect, on Jan. 11, to allow the formation of professional guidelines.“Full equality. That is the simple demand and it is the goal of the LGBT struggle, the long struggle of my community,” said Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz, who is openly gay. “Equality before the law and equality of parenthood.”Horowitz said the change in the law would also expand surrogacy to single men and transgender people.Under the previous regulations, Israeli same-sex couples looking to become parents could not engage a surrogate and were often deterred by the additional costs of finding one abroad.The state had argued that the law was intended to protect surrogate mothers but the court ruled that it would be possible to strike a balance that would not discriminate.In contrast with much of the conservative Middle East, Israel is generally tolerant toward its LGBTQ community. Gays serve openly in Israel’s military and parliament, and many popular artists and entertainers are openly gay. Nonetheless, obstacles — including the absence of civil marriage that would allow same-sex marriage — remain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-to-open-surrogacy-to-same-sex-couples-as-of-next-week-101641290727944.html

Feeling so many emotions right now. I knew nothing about the polar world three years ago and it feels so surreal to finally be here. It was tough getting here and I want to thank everybody for their support,” she wrote.“This expedition was always about so much more than me. I want to encourage people to push their boundaries and to believe in themselves, and I want you to be able to do it without being labelled a rebel. I have been told no on many occasions and told to ‘just do the normal thing’, but we create our own normal," Chandi said.She uploaded a live tracking map of her trek and also posted regular blogs of her journey to the snow-capped region.“Day 40 – Finished. Preet has just made history becoming the first woman of colour to complete a solo expedition in Antarctica,” reads the final entry of her blog."You are capable of anything you want. No matter where you are from or where your start line is, everybody starts somewhere. I don’t want to just break the glass ceiling; I want to smash it into a million pieces,” she said.As part of a Medical Regiment in the northwest of England, Chandi’s primary role is to organise and validate training for medics in the Army as Clinical Training Officer.Currently based in London, she is completing her masters degree in Sports and Exercise Medicine, part-time, at Queen Mary’s University in London and had dragged around two large tyres over the past few months for her polar training as a substitute for the heavy sledge she has been dragging along in Antarctica.“It definitely feels colder in the last degree where I’m at higher altitude. I haven’t seen anyone here in the last degree and now I’m 15 nautical miles from the South Pole. I can’t believe I’m almost there,” read her entry from Sunday, a day before her milestone.She also used her time in the cold to think about wedding plans for when she returns to England, having been engaged to Army reservist fiance David Jarman before setting off on her expedition. The couple are expected to be reunited in Chile when she returns from the South Pole later this month.“I read somewhere that when you ask people to be your bridesmaids it’s nice to do it in a special way, so all the way from Antarctica I would love nothing more than for you to be my bridesmaids. Sonia Chandi, Rachel Tucker-Norton, Kamal Dhamrait, Tig Bridge, Hannah Sawford (or Hannah Smith now) and Collette Davey,” Chandi wrote.“I love you all and would love you to be my bridesmaids. I think at least three hen do’s are required. That’s normal right? But even if it’s not normal that’s never been anything to stop me,” she added.Chandi says she has always been keen to push the human body to its limits and sees her latest mission as part of this wider research.As an "endurance athlete", she has run marathons and ultra-marathons and, as an Army officer, completed large-scale exercises and deployments in Nepal, Kenya and most recently a six-month United Nations peacekeeping tour to South Sudan.“Anything ambitious can feel out of reach at the beginning but every bit of training I complete brings me closer to my goal.

Mountainous, inland Guizhou is one of China's least developed regions.More than 1,000 people joined the overnight rescue effort, Xinhua News Agency said.Workplace accidents are a recurring problem in China as a result of managers cutting corners, lax enforcement of safety standards and decaying infrastructure.Among China’s worst accidents was a massive 2015 explosion at a chemical warehouse in the port city of Tianjin that killed 173 people, most of them firefighters and police officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/landslide-in-southwestern-china-kills-14-people-injures-3-101641286233509.html

The European Union later raised Lithuania’s claim that China had applied “unannounced sanctions” on its products to the World Trade Organization. China has denied it’s blocking Lithuania’s exports.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a regular press briefing in Beijing he wasn’t aware of the episode, adding: “I can tell you that the Taiwan authorities’ attempt to maintain their space for Taiwan independence activities by dollar diplomacy is doomed to be in vain.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-just-bought-20-000-bottles-of-rum-china-didn-t-want-101641285613294.html
04-01-2022||World||Japan’s Kishida vows tight borders, faster boosters for elderly||Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Japan would bring forward booster shots for elderly people and maintain tight border controls as it tries to slow the spread of the omicron variant of the coronavirus.“Regarding the vaccine, we will work to bring forward third doses for health workers and the elderly,” Kishida told a new year's news conference Tuesday. “For those local authorities that are on track, we will bring forward vaccinations for the elderly once again, using 9 million doses that are on hand across the country.”He also said the border measures would remain strong, although he noted the policy would be reviewed next week. The stakes are high for Kishida to get his response to the virus right, with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party facing upper house elections in July. Former Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga stepped down in September after losing voter support for seemingly being out of tune with the public sense of urgency on the virus.The country has more recently enjoyed a respite from the worst of the infections. Yet with boosters still, months away for the bulk of the population, Japan risks a resurgence like those seen in many parts of the world. Just 0.4% of the Japanese population have received a third vaccine dose, according to the prime minister’s office.Japan’s ex-vaccine czar urges faster booster rolloutRestrictions on activities may be introduced if hospitals come under strain, he said, adding he would take a cautious stance on re-introducing “Go-To” subsidies for domestic travel. Depending on symptoms, some of those infected may be supported to recover at home, rather than being admitted to hospital, Kishida said. In November, Kishida reimposed border controls that ban new entries by foreigners due to concerns about omicron. The strictest measures among the Group of Seven advanced nations have helped minimize the number of infections brought in from overseas and bought time for preparation he said. Xenophobia spills into Japan’s Covid-era debate on immigrationJapan posted 673 new coronavirus infections Monday, more than double from a week ago and its highest since October. But the country still has some of the lowest infection numbers in the developed world, while an omicron-fueled wave pushed the U.S. to set a global daily record of coronavirus cases, with more than 1 million people diagnosed on Monday.The premier also said his government would introduce a five-year plan to bolster startups, including providing funding from the public purse. “Japanese capitalism needs new players for the future,” he said at the event held in the coastal city of Ise. Kishida said he had been seeking to arrange to visit U.S. President Joe Biden and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison in the near future, but would instead prioritize virus management at home. He has no plans to travel abroad before parliament opens later this month, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japans-kishida-vows-tight-borders-faster-boosters-for-elderly-101641284322706.html

Before officers moved in, some people near the Van Gogh Museum unfurled a banner that read, "Less repression, more care."A group of people in white overalls and white masks held up signs, including one that said: "It's not about a virus, it's about control'' on one side and "Freedom" on the other, reported DW News.The Netherlands is currently in a strict lockdown, which is expected to last until at least mid-January.Despite the rapid spread of the highly contagious omicron variant, coronavirus infection rates in the Netherlands have been gradually decreasing in recent weeks.The cases have been on the decline since the country reintroduced lockdown measures in November, before tightening them further during the holiday season, reported DW News.Meanwhile, more countries in Europe are implementing or considering further measures to contain the Omicron variant as people return to work and school after the holidays.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-protest-covid-measures-in-netherlands-despite-ban-on-gatherings-101641280672967.html

It developed a relatively liberal culture in which mountain sports played a significant role.The skiers and cyclists on the slopes and roads, as well as the thousands of picnickers and sightseers enjoying the natural beauty offered a vision of carefree peace in stark contrast to the violence elsewhere."Band-e-Amir is a tourist location; it has beautiful lakes and pure weather. People enjoy spending time here," Reza said.The area was declared a national park in 2009 and although Bamiyan as a whole remains generally poor and underdeveloped, the tourism that continued during the years of war has left clear signs of prosperity in the little village by the lake.Reza said the 70 to 80 families living in Band-e-Amir village depend entirely on tourism and are already suffering from the slowdown in visitors caused by the pandemic. The economic crisis that followed the Taliban victory has done the rest."This year, due to the change in regime we have not seen any tourists in Band-e-Amir," Reza said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistans-blue-mountain-lakes-deserted-as-tourists-stay-away-101641279832182.html

CNN reported citing latest data from the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that Covid-19 hospitalisations last surpassed 100,000 on September 11, 2021.The CNN report stated that at the moment, nearly three-quarters of hospital beds across the country are full, and one in seven patients are suffering from Covid-19. It added that there have only been 67 days throughout the entire pandemic in the US when over 100,000 people were hospitalised with coronavirus at a time.As far as states are concerned, most hospitalisations are being reported from Ohio, Delaware and New Jersey with over 50 Covid-19 patients admitted for every 100,000 people. Meanwhile, the numbers are lowest in Wyoming and Alaska, with less than 10 coronavirus hospitalisations per 100,000 people, the CNN report added.Also Read | At 37,379 cases, India's Covid tally rises for 7th day; Omicron count at 1,892Furthermore, child hospitalisations due to Covid-19 is also the highest ever in the country, with more than 500 children admitted every day over the week ending December 31, data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated.The CDC data also revealed that overall hospitalisation rates through November are nearly eight times higher for unvaccinated adults and around 10 times higher for unvaccinated kids aged 12-17, according to CNN.Also Read | Can Omicron's ‘immunity’ end Covid-19 pandemic?

The latest figures are nearly double the earlier record of about 590,000 set just four days before, according to Bloomberg.Amid such a massive Covid-19 surge, US doctors are currently struggling to find out the variant of the virus that is affecting every patient who tests positive, meaning whether it's Delta or Omicron.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-hospitalisations-in-us-top-100-000-nearly-8-times-higher-in-unvaccinated-101641266716650.html

Monday’s number is almost double the previous record of about 590,000 set just four days ago in the U.S., which itself was a doubling from the prior week. America’s daily case count on Monday was more than twice the number seen in any other country at any time. The highest number outside the U.S. came during India’s delta surge, when more than 414,000 people were diagnosed on May 7, 2021. The stratospheric numbers being posted in the U.S. come even as many Americans are relying on tests they take at home, with results that aren’t reported to official government authorities. This means that the new record is surely a significant under-estimate.The surging infections have led to canceled flights, closed schools and offices, overwhelmed hospitals, and strangled supply chains. The data from Johns Hopkins University is complete as of midnight eastern time in Baltimore, and delays in reporting over the holidays may have played a role in the rising rates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/setting-a-global-record-us-tops-1-million-covid-19-cases-in-24-hours-101641275264819.html

The emergence of the new variant, which probably originated in Cameroon, as per the study, harbours both substitutions N501Y and E484K in the spike protein. At least 12 cases of the new variant have been reported near Marseilles, and has been linked to travel to the African country Cameroon.Also Watch: New COVID variant IHU with 46 mutations detected in France amid Omicron scare I Explained"The mutation set and phylogenetic position of the genomes obtained here indicate based on our previous definition a new variant we named IHU," the authors of the study said."These data are another example of the unpredictability of the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, and of their introduction in a given geographical area from abroad," they added.The B.1.640.2 has not been spotted in other countries or labelled a variant under investigation by the World Health Organization (WHO).According to a paper posted on medRxiv, the genomes were obtained by next-generation sequencing with Oxford Nanopore Technologies on GridION instruments.“Fourteen amino acid substitutions, including N501Y and E484K, and 9 deletions are located in the spike protein. This genotype pattern led to create a new Pangolin lineage named B.1.640.2, which is a phylogenetic sister group to the old B.1.640 lineage renamed B.1.640.1,” the research paper said.Epidemiologist Eric Feigl-Ding posted a long Twitter thread in which he said that new variants keep emerging but it does not necessarily mean they will be more dangerous. “What makes a variant more well-known and dangerous is its ability to multiply because of the number of mutations it has in relation to the original virus,” he said.“This is when it becomes a "variant of concern" - like Omicron, which is more contagious and more past immunity evasive. It remains to be seen in which category this new variant will fall,” the doctor further said.The Omicron variant was detected in a sample taken from South Africa on November 24 last year. Since then, it has spread to more than 100 countries. In India, it has infected nearly 1,900 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-covid-19-variant-ihu-discovered-in-france-has-more-mutations-than-omicron-101641274969259.html
04-01-2022||World||‘We beat the Americans’: Taliban showcase victory over US||In the governor's compound of Afghanistan's Ghazni province, a new historical exhibit is unveiled before a rapt audience of Taliban fighters -- sections of blast walls from a former US military base.One concrete slab is inscribed with the names and regiments of US troops who served in the province during America's longest war.Like soldiers throughout history, US troops regularly daubed their names on the walls of bases and fixed positions they occupied.But now the towering block is on public display -- being used to bolster the Taliban's narrative of toppling US-led forces after 20 years of fighting."We have to show this so that Afghans, the world, and future generations know that we beat the Americans," Taliban provincial culture chief Mullah Habibullah Mujahid told AFP."Even if they called themselves the greatest power in the world."Taliban forces took the city of Ghazni – 150 kilometres (95 miles) south of Kabul – three days before the capital fell on August 15.The region has 3,500 years of rich recorded history, and the Taliban are now busy writing the latest chapter with proof of their military triumph.The propaganda push comes as Afghanistan's new rulers struggle to evolve from an insurgency to a governing power in a country on the brink of economic collapse, with the UN estimating more than half the population is facing acute hunger.On roads outside the city of nearly 200,000, another informal exhibition to the Taliban victory has been erected.Rusting hulks of destroyed American armoured vehicles are on display, their weapons removed, their tyres flat and frayed.Children clamber around and over the wreckage, which also features skeletons of abandoned Soviet tanks from the decade-long occupation of Afghanistan.That invasion ended in humiliation for the Soviets, and -- alongside the defeat of British troops in the 19th century -- Afghans are quick to remind visitors that the country has now triumphed over three foreign empires."We are proud of our achievement when we see this," said 18-year-old Taliban fighter Ozair, who like many in the country goes by only one name."We showed that Afghans born here could beat America, a powerful country," he added, surveying the crumpled humvees and charred personnel carriers.Reminders and relics of two decades of the US-led occupation of Afghanistan are scattered across the nation -- some of them usable.Much military hardware gifted to Afghan police and armed forces fell into the hands of the Taliban in the last chaotic days of the US-backed government.The windfall of weapons, vehicles and uniforms has given the new rulers of Kabul tangible spoils of victory.But curating those trophies into a credible homage to the Taliban's return to power remains a challenge.Standing at the blast walls, Mullah Habibullah Mujahid boasted that the 20 or so names inscribed included "important commanders and generals" killed in combat.The ranks listed, however, were all junior -- and none of the names feature on databases of Americans killed in the war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-beat-the-americans-taliban-showcases-victory-over-us-101641270292871.html
04-01-2022||World||Capitol riot anniversary: Biden, Trump to address nation at split-screen event||A divided nation will experience an ominous split-screen moment Thursday when President Joe Biden uses the anniversary of the January 6 attack on Congress to warn of threats to US democracy and Donald Trump goes live with his conspiracy theories.One year after a mob of Trump supporters marched on Congress to try and prevent lawmakers from certifying Biden's victory in the presidential election, political wounds remain far from healed.Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will reportedly speak from inside the Capitol, the setting during the unrest of almost unbelievable scenes as Trump supporters fought past police to invade the heart of US democracy.As a veteran politician who came out of retirement to take on what he saw as Trump's authoritarian presidency, Biden has often warned during his first year in the White House of an "existential" threat to political freedoms that until now most Americans took for granted.His speech -- part of a series of events on what Biden's key ally, Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, says will be a "difficult day" -- is set to take that warning to a new level.But while Congress is holding a prayer vigil for what Biden has called "a dark moment," Trump will be giving a press conference from his luxury property in Mar-a-Lago, Florida.His message is likewise easy to predict. Despite losing by more than seven million votes to Biden, and despite losing multiple court challenges around the country, Trump continues to tout wild claims that the 2020 election was stolen.And the accusations are only the most incendiary element of a broader attack against Biden on everything from immigration to Covid-19, all adding up to what looks very much like an as-yet undeclared bid to take back power in 2024.It's a campaign that Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, calls "unprecedented in US history.""No former president has attempted to do so much to discredit his successor and the democratic process," Tobias said.What can Biden do?However ludicrous the election conspiracy theory may be -- one federal judge in Pennsylvania ruled Trump's case "strained" and "speculative" -- it is seen as truth by millions of Americans.Polls consistently show that around 70 percent of Republicans think Biden was elected illegitimately.A new Washington Post-University of Maryland poll puts this number at 58 percent. However, that same poll found that 40 percent of Republicans, compared to 23 percent of Democrats, believe violence against the government is justified sometimes.Fighting what Trump, the master brander, popularizes as "the Steal," has become a political ideology in its own right, with nearly all Republican lawmakers either squirming to avoid criticizing what happened on January 6 -- or actively defending the attack.Lara Brown, director of the Graduate School of Political Management at George Washington University, said the combination of political grifters looking to get into Trump's good books and the masses of voters deluded into believing what they're told amounts to a considerable force."What is so frightful about where we are right now isn't just that these are elite attacks, but they are being fueled by a grass roots movement," she said."It wasn't just far-right win groups who had organized" on January 6, she said. "It was average, everyday Americans who had bought into this whole notion."It's unclear what, if anything, Biden can do to change these dynamics.Political scientist and Democratic pollster Rachel Bitecofer urged Biden to take on Trump more aggressively, rather than stick to pretending that the man Press Secretary Jen Psaki has referred to as "the former guy" no longer matters.Biden "is not commemorating an event that ended. He is commemorating the event that is in process and threatens to get worse," she said."There's a real hesitancy to accept how virulent the right is in coming after democracy here."Brown said, however, that Biden has little room for maneuver, because a direct attack on Trump risks looking like a "political witch hunt" -- exactly what the former president claims in his conspiracy theories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/capitol-riot-anniversary-biden-trump-to-address-nation-at-split-screen-event-101641265059878.html

04-01-2022||World||Can Omicron's ‘immunity’ end Covid-19 pandemic? Experts hint at ‘silver lining’||A string of new studies has confirmed the silver lining of the omicron variant: Even as case numbers soar to records, the numbers of severe cases and hospitalizations have not. The data, some scientists say, signal a new, less worrying chapter of the pandemic.“We’re now in a totally different phase,” said Monica Gandhi, an immunologist at the University of California, San Francisco. “The virus is always going to be with us, but my hope is this variant causes so much immunity that it will quell the pandemic.”The omicron variant was discovered in South Africa just over a month ago, and experts caution that there is still plenty of time for the situation to change. But data from the past week suggest that a combination of widespread immunity and numerous mutations have resulted in a virus that causes far less severe disease than previous iterations.One study out of South Africa found that patients admitted to the hospital there during the omicron-dominated fourth wave of the virus were 73% less likely to have the severe disease than patients admitted during the delta-dominated third wave. “The data is quite solid now that hospitalizations and cases are decoupled,” said Wendy Burgers, an immunologist at the University of Cape Town.Early on, much of the alarm over omicron was due to the variant’s large number of mutations, many of which are on the spike protein, the part of the virus responsible for helping it invade host cells. Those mutations, early data suggested, allowed the virus to easily infect not only unvaccinated people but also to evade antibody responses from both previous infections and vaccines. But the question remained how omicron would fare once it made its way past those first lines of defense.Several factors appear to have made the omicron variant less virulent, or severe, than previous waves of Covid-19. One factor is the virus’ ability to infect the lungs. Covid infections typically start in the nose and spread down the throat. A mild infection doesn’t make it much farther than the upper respiratory tract, but if the virus reaches the lungs, that’s usually when more severe symptoms occur.But five separate studies in the past week suggested that the variant does not infect the lungs as easily as previous variants. In one study, released as an online pre-print by a large consortium of Japanese and American scientists, hamsters and mice infected with omicron experienced far less lung damage and were less likely to die than those infected with previous variants. Another study out of Belgium found similar outcomes in Syrian hamsters, which have been known to experience particularly severe illness with previous iterations of the virus.In Hong Kong, scientists studied a small number of lung tissue samples from patients collected during surgery and found that omicron grew more slowly in those samples than other variants did. Burgers said this change in virulence likely has to do with how the virus’s anatomy changed.“It used to use two different pathways to get into cells, and now because of all the changes to the spike protein, it’s preferring one of those pathways,” she said. “It seems to prefer to infect the upper respiratory tract rather than the lungs.”This, Burgers said, could mean less severe infection, but also more transmissibility as the virus replicates more often in the upper respiratory tract, from which it can more easily spread.While omicron may be good at evading the attacks of antibodies, recent studies have also shown that it has far less success avoiding the second-line defenses of vaccines and prior infections: T-cells and B-cells.T-cells are responsible for attacking a virus once it makes its way into the body’s cells if antibodies fail to prevent infection in the first place. In a recent study by Burgers and colleagues, scientists used white blood cells from Covid patients to show that about 70-80% of the T-cell response is preserved compared with previous strains of the virus. That means that for those who are either vaccinated or had a Covid infection in the past 6 months, it is likely their T-cells can recognize omicron and fight it off relatively quickly. This latest research will need to be followed up with further study. If it holds up to additional scrutiny, it just might explain why current infections appear to be milder than in previous waves of the virus.“When you start to see different kinds of data all pointing in the same direction, you begin to feel more confident that it’s going to hold up,” said Jessica Justman, a Columbia University Medical Center epidemiologist.That said, as cases skyrocket, the absolute number of hospitalizations and deaths will still rise alongside them, even if those numbers tick up more slowly.“When your denominator is very large because many, many people are getting infected, you still wind up having many people going to the hospital who need care,” Justman said.Gandhi, at the University of California, San Francisco, said that while case numbers might be reaching records, she hopes omicron’s combination of high transmissibility and mild infection might signal the beginning of the end. She pointed to another study out last week from Hong Kong, which showed that vaccinated patients infected with omicron generated strong immune responses against other versions of the virus as well. This, she said, might explain why case numbers peaked quickly in South Africa.“I hope this variant creates profound immunity in the population,” she said. “It will hopefully end the pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-omicron-s-immunity-end-covid-19-pandemic-experts-hint-at-silver-lining-101641266639881.html
04-01-2022||World||No way to distinguish Omicron cases from Delta, US doctors in a fix||Amid rising concerns over a fresh surge in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, doctors in the United States are faced with a peculiar conundrum – they have no ready way of determining which variant of the coronavirus a person is carrying. This is especially troublesome because a high-risk patient infected with the Delta variant would greatly benefit from two particular monoclonal antibody treatments, while they would do little to nothing for a patient infected with the new, highly transmissible Omicron variant – which requires a third antibody treatment.Faced with this issue, even federal health authorities are struggling to make decisions for the entire nation in the backdrop of uncertain estimates over the scope of each variant and the extent to which they are dominant in certain regions.Elaborating on the matter, a report by The New York Times states that the two antibody treatments that Delta-infected patients benefit from are the drugs made by Regeneron and Eli Lilly, while patients infected predominantly with the Omicron variant would greatly benefit from the antibody drugs manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology.Now, the problem arises in the fact that there actually is no approved test to determine the coronavirus variant with which each individual is infected: a national network of state and other labs in the US use genome-sequencing tests to track variants broadly in communities. Health authorities then use those “regional estimates” to decide which antibody treatments to use in clinics and hospitals.A system that is based on frail estimates is bound to show cracks, and such is evident in the fact that federal officials on December 23 stopped shipments of the antibody treatments for Delta infections after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that 73 per cent of all Covid-19 cases in the country were arising out of the Omicron variant.However, it soon became clear that there were, in fact, several states in the US where Delta was still dominant, and stopping the Eli Lilly and Regeneron antibody treatments there would be a grave mistake. Later, the CDC revised its national estimate of the Omicron outbreak to 59 per cent, and on December 31, federal officials once again resumed the shipments of all antibody treatments.According to infectious diseases experts and public health professionals quoted by NYT, the results of the genome sequencing used in most public laboratories take nearly a week to arrive – which is often too late to begin the early antibody treatments that have been found to reduce hospitalisations in patients.It is especially difficult to keep up with the pressure in states which have an uneven mix of both variants, thus keeping doctors on the edge about which treatment to use. According to health experts, this puts the United States in a “holding pattern” during which tailoring treatments to patients is going to be “extremely difficult” and in the absence of a rapid, surefire way to identify variants in bulk samples, the issue is only expected to compound in the near future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-way-to-distinguish-omicron-cases-from-delta-us-doctors-in-a-fix-101641260307447.html
04-01-2022||World||Global weekly Covid-19 cases surpass 10 million||Almost twice as many people were diagnosed with Covid-19 in the past seven days as the pandemic’s previous weekly record thanks to a tsunami of Omicron, the new variant, that has swamped every aspect of daily life in many parts of the globe.The highly mutated and infectious variant drove cases to a record 10 million in the seven days through Sunday, almost double the previous record of 5.7 million seen during in a week in late April.Soaring infections - with a record number of cases reported from Australia and the US to Italy and France - disrupted the holiday season a year after vaccines first started rolling out and two years after the emergence of the virus that many initially hoped would be fleeting.Israel begins 4th shotIsrael began on Monday administering fourth vaccine shots to people over 60 and health workers amid a surge driven by the new Omicron variant.The US is expanding Covid-19 boosters as it confronts the Omicron surge, with the Food and Drug Administration allowing extra Pfizer shots for children ages 12-15.French MPs on Monday began debating draft legislation that would require most people to be vaccinated against Covid-19 to enter public spaces such as bars, restaurants and long-distance public transport.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the right measures were in place to tackle the surge in Covid-19 cases caused by the Omicron variant given the high levels of vaccination in the country.“The way forward for the country as a whole is to continue with the path that we are on,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-weekly-covid-19-cases-surpass-10-million-101641259878291.html
04-01-2022||World||Jeffrey Epstein paid Prince Andrew accuser $500,000 in secret settlement||A woman suing Prince Andrew for sexual assault agreed in a confidential 2009 settlement with Jeffrey Epstein to release “any other person” involved in the case from litigation in exchange for $500,000. Virginia Giuffre’s lawsuit against Queen Elizabeth’s second son is barred by that language, newly revealed in documents unsealed on Monday, Andrew claims. But her lawyer, David Boies, says it’s a red herring.“The release is irrelevant to Ms. Giuffre’s claim against Prince Andrew,” said Boies. “The release does not mention Prince Andrew.” The issue will be aired in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday, when U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan hears arguments on Andrew’s motion to dismiss the suit. Giuffre claims the British royal was one of several powerful men to whom Epstein “lent” her for sexual abuse when she was a teenager. Andrew has denied her allegations.A litigation release in the November 2009 deal says it applies to Epstein and “any other person or entity who could have been included as a potential defendant” in the suit Giuffre filed against Epstein in federal court in Florida earlier that year.‘Potential Defendant’Boies said Andrew could not have been a “potential defendant” covered by the settlement, because he wasn’t subject to jurisdiction in Florida and that case involved federal claims of which the British royal wasn’t a part. Andrew was also unaware of the release at the time it was signed, Boies said.The settlement was also raised in a suit by Giuffre against Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz, with whom she also claims she had underage sex. She sued him for defamation in 2019 after he repeatedly denied her claims and called her a liar. Dershowitz, who counter-sued Giuffre for defamation and infliction of emotional distress, also said the 2009 deal barred her claims.The nine-page agreement includes a requirement that the amount of the settlement remain confidential. The parties also agreed that the deal “should not in any way be construed as an admission by Jeffrey Epstein” that he violated any federal or state laws.Epstein’s former longtime girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell was found guilty last week of sex trafficking. While Giuffre didn’t testify in that trial, prosecutors told jurors she was a victim of the couple’s abuse, and she was mentioned by name by two witnesses.Secret SettlementsFederal prosecutors put Epstein’s net worth at more than $500 million and said he had an income of more than $10 million a year when he was arrested in 2019.Epstein, who was found dead in his jail cell before he could go on trial for sex-trafficking, left an estate that included about $194 million in hedge fund and private equity investments, $113 million held in equities and $57 million in cash, according to a court filing.Before he died, Epstein used high-pressure litigation tactics and secret settlements to keep details of his sexual behavior out of the public eye. Some settlements exceeded $1 million, with three women agreeing to drop their suits for a total of $5.5 million. After Epstein died, his estate set up a compensation fund that distributed about $125 million to 135 victims.Maxwell’s lawyers aggressively questioned the women who testified against her about amounts they received in lawsuits and the fund. “Jane” said on the stand that she received $5 million. Prosecutors pointed out that Maxwell received some $30 million from Epstein.  Andrew’s lawyers said in his motion to dismiss Giuffre’s suit that she was looking for “another payday” by accusing “a member of the world’s best known royal family of serious misconduct.”  The case is Giuffre v. Prince Andrew, 21-cv-06702, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jeffrey-epstein-paid-prince-andrew-accuser-500-000-in-secret-settlement-101641254807165.html
