11-01-2022||World||Over half of Europe's population could be infected with Omicron in 6-8 weeks: WHO||More than 50 per cent of Europe's population could be infected with the Omicron variant of the coronavirus disease in the next six-eight weeks, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said.Dr Hans Kluge, European Regional Director of WHO, told reporters in Denmark on Tuesday that more than seven million Covid-19 cases were seen in the European Region in the first week of 2022.As of 10 January, 26 countries in Europe reported that over 1 per cent of their population had been infected with Covid-19 each week, an official statement read.“It is challenging health systems and service delivery in many countries where Omicron has spread at speed and threatens to overwhelm in many more,” Dr Kluge said.He added that vaccines continue to provide good protection against Omicron. “Allow me to reiterate that the currently approved vaccines do continue to provide good protection against severe disease and death, including for Omicron,” he said.The top WHO official also said that countries that are facing an Omicron surge should prioritise avoiding and reducing harm among the vulnerable and minimise disruption to health systems and essential services.“Any decision to shorten recommended quarantine or isolation periods should be taken in combination with negative Covid-19 tests and only when considered essential to preserve critical service continuity. Any decisions to do so must be taken with careful weighing of the risks and benefits of doing so,” Dr Kluge said during the press conference in Denmark on Tuesday.The WHO has already said that Omicron is less severe than the previous Delta, but it is not mild. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director-general, said on January 7 that Omicron is hospitalising and killing people, just like previous variants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-50-of-europe-s-population-could-be-infected-with-omicron-in-6-8-weeks-who-101641917408989.html

New cases prompted the lockdown of 5.5 million residents in the city of Anyang on Monday evening.The city recorded 58 of the 87 of the cases in Henan province.At least two Omicron cases have been confirmed in the city in recent days, linked to an outbreak in the city of Tianjin in the neighbourhood of Beijing but about 500km away from Anyang.The Anyang municipal government has banned vehicles from roads and required all residents to stay inside their homes while an epidemiological investigation is under way.“The first cases in the city are believed to be linked to the same transmission chain as the existing local cases in north China’s Tianjin Municipality, which are confirmed to be caused by the Omicron variant”, according to the publicity department of the Anyang city government. “Currently, all supermarkets in the city have suspended business other than selling daily necessities. Shops have been closed and take-out services have also been suspended,” official media reported.China’s national health commission reported 110 new locally transmitted Covid-19 cases for Monday, including 87 in Henan province, 13 in Shaanxi, and 10 in Tianjin.At least 13 million people have been under lockdown in the northwestern city of Xian, home to the famous Terracotta Warriors tourist site since December 23; another 1.1 million are locked down in Yuzhou in Henan.Residents of Tianjin, a city of nearly 14 million people near Beijing, continued to be mostly home on Tuesday with the local government restricting movement.Several residential communities continued to be under closed-loop management following the discovery of Covid-19 cases in the premises.Flights from the US cancelledMeanwhile, China’s aviation regulator has ordered the cancellation of more than 60 scheduled flights from the US in recent weeks after numerous passengers tested positive for Covid-19 after arriving in China.The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) has mandated the cancellations of 22 total scheduled US passenger airline flights for Shanghai under its Covid-19 pandemic rules: Ten by Delta Air Lines, six from United Airlines and six American Airlines flights.The US, agency reports said, is facing a surge in infections caused by the highly contagious Omicron variant and on Monday had 132,646 people hospitalised with Covid-19, surpassing the record of 132,051 set in January 2021.Olympic organisers back controls Despite Omicron concerns, Beijing will not adjust its Covid-19 prevention measures for the two-week Winter Olympics, beginning February 4, unless there are many cases inside the “closed-loop”, Huang Chun, an official with the Beijing Games organising committee, said on Tuesday, according to ReutersThe “closed-loop” bubble, in which participants can only leave if they are exiting the country or undergo quarantine, was activated earlier in January with a month to go for the Games.Restrictions at Games venues in Beijing and Zhangjiakou in neighbouring Hebei province will be much tighter than those during last summer’s Tokyo Olympics.“But organisers have room to make adjustments to Covid-19 control measures if necessary,” Huang said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-nearly-34mn-locked-down-in-china-as-omicron-fear-spreads-101641911375607.html

Beijing claims the self-ruled island as part of its territory and has vowed to take it one day, by force if necessary.The F-16V is an upgraded and much more sophisticated version of the island's other F-16 fighters which date back to the 1990s.The air force has suffered a string of fatal accidents in recent years as its jets are kept under growing pressure from China.Taiwan also has French-made Mirage jets and its own indigenous warplanes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-launches-rescue-operation-for-missing-f-16v-fighter-101641898186367.html
