The dispute between Republicans and Democrats on all these questions has intensified over the past decade.Joe Biden said that in response to the hard work that was done to enhance voter registration, expand voter access, and deepen civil rights, the Republicans have chosen “wrong way, the undemocratic way”. “To them, too many people voting in a democracy is a problem. So they’re putting up obstacles.” He then cited specific examples of steps taken by Republicans to restrict voter access - by seeking to make it harder to vote by mail; limiting the number of drop boxes where one could drop your ballots off and reducing the number of hours one could do so; restricting provision of food and water to those standing in voting queues on election day (as a Georgia law does); making it easier to remove election officials who had abided by the law in 2020 and appoint partisan cronies to influence the counting and certification process.“Last year alone, 19 states not proposed but enacted 34 laws attacking voting rights…Jim Crow 2.0 is about two insidious things: voter suppression and election subversion. It’s no longer about who gets to vote; it’s about making it harder to vote. It’s about who gets to count the vote and whether your vote counts at all,” Joe Biden added. Claiming that the goal of the “former president” - Biden does not refer to Donald Trump by name - and his allies were to “disenfranchise” anyone who voted against them, he said, “The facts won’t matter; your vote won’t matter. That’s the kind of power you see in totalitarian states, not in democracies.”The US president said that the world was watching, and cited the example of a G-7 meeting where, in response to his claim that America was back, allies asked him, “For how long?” “As someone who’s worked in foreign policy my whole life, I never thought I would ever hear our allies say something like that.”It was in this backdrop that Joe Biden made a pitch to the Congress to pass the Freedom to Vote Act - which, he claimed, would ensure full access to voting by mail, enough drop boxes during enough hours, provision of food and water to people waiting in line, protection of non-partisan election officials from intimidation and interference, get dark money out of politics, create fairer district maps and ending partisan gerrymandering - and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. The latter would restore federal supervision over changes in election laws in states with a history of racial discrimination, a key provision of the Voting Rights Act which was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013.The Senate is split equally, with 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans. With vice-president Kamala Harris’s tie-breaking vote, the Democrats have a simple majority, on paper to push through the two laws. But the Senate’s tradition of filibuster effectively makes it contingent on Democrats to have 60 votes to be able to pass the legislation. It is this clause that Biden argued against in Atlanta for the first time.“The United States Senate - designed to be the world’s greatest deliberative body - has been rendered a shell of its former self. It gives me no satisfaction in saying that, as an institutionalist, as a man who was honoured to serve in the Senate. The threat to our democracy is so grave that we must find a way to pass these voting rights bills, debate them and vote. Let the majority prevail. And if that bare minimum is blocked, we have no option but to change the Senate rules, including getting rid of the filibuster for this.”The next act in US’s saga over voting rights will now play out back in Washington DC, where the Democrats hope to push for a change in Senate rules on January 17 - the birth anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/voting-rights-in-us-joe-biden-bats-for-change-in-senate-rules-101642007750019.html

12-01-2022||World||British PM Boris Johnson apologises in Parliament for attending lockdown party||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday extended a “heartfelt apology” in the House of Commons in response to growing anger around reports of a “bring-your-own-booze” (BYOB) party in the 10 Downing Street garden during Covid-19 lockdown in May 2020.Johnson has been under intense pressure from the Opposition Labour Party as well as members of his own Conservative Party since an email invitation for the event on May 20, 2020 emerged in the media.He expressed “regret” as he admitted for the first time that he did attend the event, which he said he believed fell within the scope of a work event.“I want to apologise. I know that millions of people across this country have made extraordinary sacrifices over the last 18 months,” Johnson said in his statement to the Commons ahead of the weekly Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs) session.Also read | ‘Absolutely wrong, counterproductive, mumbo jumbo’: UK's Johnson on anti-vaxxers"I know the things they feel with me and at the government I lead when they think that in Downing Street itself the rules are not being properly followed by the people who make the rules. And although I cannot anticipate the conclusions of the current inquiry, I have learned enough to know there are things we simply did not get right and I must take responsibility,” he said.He went on to lay out the details of his presence at the garden party "to thank groups of staff before going into my office 25 minutes later to continue waiting"."I believed it was a work event. With hindsight, I should have sent everyone back inside, I should have found some other way to thank them and I should have recognised that even if it could be said to be technically within the guidance, there would be millions and millions of people who simply would not see it that way," he said, calling on Parliament to wait for the findings of an ongoing investigation into lockdown breaches within government ranks.However, he faced a blistering attack from the Opposition benches, with Labour Leader Keir Starmer leading the charge to demand his resignation."Well, there we have it. After months of deceit and deception, the pathetic spectacle of a man who's run out of rope. His defence that he didn't realise he was at a party is so ridiculous that it's actually offensive to the British public,” said Starmer."When the whole country was locked down, he was holding boozy parties in Downing Street. Is he now going to do the decent thing and resign," he questioned.The session was dominated by questions over the lockdown party, with members of Parliament terming the apology as “too little too late” and “worthless”, forcing the UK prime minister to keep repeating his apology and regret."I want to repeat that I thought it was a work event, and I regret very much that we did not do things differently that evening," Johnson said."I take responsibility and I apologise. But as for his (Starmer) political point, I don't think that he should pre-empt the outcome of the inquiry," he said.The inquiry is being conducted by senior UK civil servant Sue Gray, who is investigating all such alleged lockdown breaches within government quarters including at Downing Street.The latest gathering first came to light last week after a string of other revelations around gatherings held during the lockdown in 2020. Previously, a photograph had emerged from May 15, 2020 – five days before the so-called BYOB drinks party – showing Johnson, his wife Carrie and 17 staff members, also in the Downing Street garden. The UK prime minister had dismissed this as "people at work, talking about work" rather than a gathering.He has since maintained that it was for the ongoing internal investigation to conclude if laws were broken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-pm-boris-johnson-apologises-in-parliament-for-attending-lockdown-party-101641993667256.html

China has threatened that "Taiwan's independence" means war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/5-chinese-military-planes-enter-taiwan-s-air-defence-zone-101641992094510.html

12-01-2022||World||German president calls for debate over Covid vaccine mandate||Germany's president called Wednesday for a thorough debate over plans for compulsory coronavirus vaccinations in the country, saying such a drastic measure needs to be comprehensively justified.Chancellor Olaf Scholz has backed calls for a vaccine mandate and lawmakers are expected to begin debating a bill later this month. Polls show a majority of people in Germany back compulsory vaccination against Covid-19, but a vocal minority opposes the idea.“The exceptional situation of a pandemic increases the pressure for the state to act, but it doesn't replace the requirement to weigh up arguments and balance interests,” German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said at the beginning of a roundtable debate with citizens on the issue.“A vaccine mandate means a debate mandate,” he added.Steinmeier, whose role is largely ceremonial, said he wouldn't take sides in the debate but urged those involved to have “respect for other positions, but also respect for facts and reason that must be and remain our common currency.”He dismissed as “complete nonsense claims that the coronavirus pandemic has turned Germany into a dictatorship,” saying such allegations betray contempt for our democratic institutions and the rule of law.“Among friends, at work, in schools, in daycare centers, in clinics and nursing homes, in city halls, health offices and parliaments, people everywhere are trying to figure out together what needs to be done” to fight the pandemic, Steinmeier said. “And that’s exactly what this democratic struggle is about, also for us here today in this debate.”Among the people debating was a nurse from Cologne and the head of a nursing home in Berlin who both stressed how essential it is to be vaccinated so that especially the most vulnerable of society — those who are ill and old — can be protected from the virus.A professor for health communication pointed out that a lot of the people who refuse to get vaccinated are simply afraid of the vaccines. Cornelia Betsch criticized authorities for initially missing many opportunities to better explain how safe and important the vaccines are.“Many people are simply afraid of getting vaccinated and a mandate can create counter feelings,” she said adding that there need to be more efforts to inform those who are hesitant about the advantages of vaccinations.Around 72.2% of Germans are considered “fully vaccinated,” while at least 44.2 % have received an additional booster shot.Germany's disease control agency reported 80,430 newly confirmed cases of Covid-19 in a single day, a new record since the start of the pandemic. The country saw 384 additional deaths linked to the coronavirus in the past 24 hours.Among those who oppose a vaccine mandate are some members of the Free Democrats, who are part of the ruling coalition, and Germany’s former health minister who pledged last summer not to introduce a general vaccine mandate. Political leaders have agreed to let lawmakers vote according to their own conscience rather than along party lines on the issue.The looming mandate has also been a rallying point for vocal anti-vaccine campaigners who have taken part in protests against Germany’s pandemic restrictions. Some recent demonstrations have turned violent, with protesters attacking police officers after being ordered to disperse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-president-calls-for-debate-over-covid-vaccine-mandate-101641991407286.html
12-01-2022||World||Covid-19 in China: Second round of tests for Tianjin as cases go up||The northern Chinese city of Tianjin ordered a second of Covid-19 tests for its 14 million residents on Wednesday, the second round in three days, after 33 new local cases were reported for Tuesday, up from 10 for the day before.Official media said 77 cases of Covid-19 including the Omicron variant have been detected in Tianjin, considered a “gateway” to Beijing and located a 40-minute high-speed train journey away from the capital since last weekend.The municipal government said in a notice that the second round of mass testing would start on Wednesday afternoon, urging all residents to stay put while awaiting the results of their nucleic acid tests.The news agency, Xinhua, said authorities have carried out almost 12 million tests so far, with 7.8 million samples returned. Infections were first reported on Saturday.High-speed rail service and other forms of transportation between Tianjin and Beijing have been suspended, leading to some disruptions in supply chains, including for packaged food items sold in convenience stores, an agency report said.The Chinese mainland on Wednesday reported 166 new locally transmitted Covid-19 cases for Tuesday, the national health commission (NHC) said in its daily report on Wednesday.Of the new local cases, 118 were reported in Henan, 33 in Tianjin, eight in Shaanxi, and seven in Guangdong, the commission said.China, which has stuck to what is effectively a “zero-Covid” policy, is scrambling to prevent the spread of the highly infectious Omicron variant ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday beginning at the end of January and as Beijing prepares to stage the Winter Olympics from February 4.In the central province of Henan, the city of Anyang, where Omicron has also been detected in the community linked to the Tianjin outbreak, reported 65 local symptomatic cases on Tuesday, a surge from just two a day earlier.Vice-premier, Sun Chunlan, visited the province and said Omicron presented a challenge to the city’s virus control efforts.Officials should “further increase the efficiency of testing and epidemiological investigation and adopt strict community-level control measures,” the official Xinhua news agency quoted her as saying in a report late on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-in-china-second-round-of-tests-for-tianjin-as-cases-go-up-101641991547631.html
12-01-2022||World||Singapore bans book on political cartoons due to its ‘offensive’ religious content: Minister||Singapore has banned a book on political cartoons due to its “offensive content”, with the government on Wednesday defending its move saying the publication contained material that denigrated several religions and religious figures.Social and Family Development minister Masagos Zulkifli, who is also the Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs, told Parliament on Wednesday that pictures in the book titled 'Red Lines: Political Cartoons And The Struggle Against Censorship' are offensive to Muslims even if they are published in the name of free speech, academia or otherwise.He added that the book contained material that denigrated several religions and religious figures."The book also included images insulting to other religions. The authors may say that they do not intend for the publication to be insulting or demeaning, and their intention is to educate, but the government rejects that," the minister was quoted as saying by The Straits Times newspaper.The book, by Hong Kong Baptist University's professor of media studies Cherian George and graphic novelist Sonny Liew, has already been distributed in other countries like the US.The book by Prof. George, an Indian-origin media expert, examines political cartoons from all over the world and explains the various motivations for and methods of cartoon censorship.The Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) said in November that the book, published in August, will not be allowed to be sold or distributed in Singapore, as it has been classified as objectionable under the Undesirable Publications Act for containing content that denigrates religions.This includes reproductions of French magazine Charlie Hebdo's cartoons, which led to protests and violence overseas, as well as denigratory references pertaining to Hinduism and Christianity.The demeaning and insulting images have led to rioting and deaths in several parts of the world, the minister said, adding that major publications have refrained from publishing them.Singapore's harmonious race and religious relations require constant care and attention of the government and the society at large, and it is vital that every faith is treated with respect, Masagos said."We don't want to risk anything that will begin unravelling the peace and harmony we enjoy from the due respect and consideration everyone gives to others."We remain committed to working closely with all our religious communities to preserve and strengthen our racial and religious harmony, which is a bedrock of our cohesive society," Masagos said.On Wednesday, Minister for Communications and Information Josephine Teo stressed that the government does not allow any religious group to be insulted or attacked, as hate speech and offensive content can easily be normalised and lead to deep social divides if left unchecked."To preserve racial and religious harmony in Singapore, we take a firm stance on such content regardless of their purpose of publication," she said responding to questions in Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-bans-book-on-political-cartoons-due-to-its-offensive-religious-content-minister-101641983111989.html
12-01-2022||World||Quebec seeks to tax the unvaccinated as Omicron hits||As the fifth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic continues in Canada, the province of Quebec on Tuesday proposed a monetary penalty on those who refuse to get vaccinated against the virus.While vaccine certificates have been used to prevent the unvaccinated from accessing facilities like gyms, nightclubs, sports events, theatres, or even airports, this is the first time that a “vax tax” has been taken into serious consideration by any jurisdiction.The idea was introduced by Quebec Premier (equivalent of a Chief Minister) François Legault while addressing a press conference on the Covid-19 situation. He called it a “health contribution” that could be introduced in the coming weeks on adults in the province who continued to refuse to get vaccinated.Legault said that while just 10% of the eligible population in the province remained unvaccinated, they account for half of those occupying beds in intensive care units (ICUs) during current wave of the pandemic.“All Quebec adults who refuse in the coming weeks to at least get a first dose will be getting a bill,” he said Global News reported.Quebec has been among the worst-hit regions of Canada during the fifth wave, with cases nearing 20,000 per day at one point. Though numbers have dropped since, large-scale absenteeism among health care workers due to infections have placed a strain on the system.Legault accused the unvaccinated of imposing a “burden” on the health care network, and wanted there to be “consequence” for their actions. Quebec has an overnight curfew in place, and from January 18 will bar those without vaccine passports from accessing alcohol or cannabis outlets.Legault did not expand on what form the punitive measures will take, but Canadians have to file their annual tax returns by the end of April each year, and the fine on the unvaccinated could be extracted at that time.The announcement has already attracted criticism from the Canadian Civil Liberties Association. “Allowing the government to levy fines on those who do not agree with the government’s recommended medical treatment is a deeply troubling proposition,” the organisation’s general counsel Cara Zwibel said, adding, “To justify this kind of restriction on constitutionally protected rights, the government must provide clear and compelling evidence and demonstrate that there were no other reasonable alternatives.”Last week Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canadians were “angry” and “frustrated” with those that refused to get jabbed. He was followed by Canada’s health minister Jean-Yves Duclos who said that vaccine mandates may become necessary to counter such reluctance.

12-01-2022||World||In China, snowmaking wraps up ahead of approaching Winter Olympics||With the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics fast approaching, in about a week’s time, many of the 354 snowmaking machines deployed across the three clusters of venues will be gradually switched off.“We are still making (snow), but only topping up at certain spots. It’s pretty much done,” said Austrian engineer Manuel Schoepf, an expert at Italian company TechnoAlpin.What’s been done for the Games is “crazy”, Schoepf, who is among a handful of foreign experts helping China to make snow for the event, told HT in Yanqing, a Beijing suburb, late December.More than five million cubic metres of snow have been made for the Games in the last few months across three venue , said Schoepf, who has also worked for the last two Games in South Korea’s Pyeongchang and Russia’s Sochi.The venues for the Beijing Winter Games have been divided into three zones, or clusters: Beijing, Yanqing - a hilly, suburban district in the capital, and Zhangjiakou in the neighbouring Hebei province.At least seven of the snowmaking machines have been deployed in Beijing.Making snow, however, is not unique to the Beijing Games, which will run from February 4 to February 20 followed by the Paralympics from March 4 to March 13.Artificial snow has been used to varying degrees since the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. In Sochi, for example, which has a subtropical climate with a long, cold winter, snow was made and stored in piles inside insulated storage facilities.Schoepf said for Winter Olympics, snow of a different consistency is needed – it needs to be hard.“With natural snow, it’s just too soft and too dry,” he said.“So here is it is too dry for us, actually. We have to make purposely wet snow so that it sticks, and also so that it freezes to the ground, because the ground actually doesn’t freeze here. Because there’s no moisture in the ground, it can’t freeze,” he said.“What we did here, for example, in Yanqing, is that we covered all those access roads from the top down...first to make sure we don’t get the dust problem on the slopes,” Schoepf says, explaining that dust getting on the snow was a major problem for them. The essentials to manufacture snow are water and compressed air, which are mixed and then sprayed through hi-tech nozzles, called “nucleation nozzles”.Several factors like the nozzle configurations, temperature and humidity play critical roles in manufacturing snow.At government-organised media tour in December, Jia Maoting, general manager of Olympic Sports Construction Development Company agreed about the need to make snow for snow sports at the Olympics level.“The natural hardness of snow cannot meet the requirements for major Winter Olympics competitions. Therefore, the venues have artificial snow with higher hardness. The two major stadiums, the National Ski Jumping Centre and the National Cross-Country Ski Centre (in Chongli district of Zhangjiakou), require a total of about 250,000 cubic metres of water to meet snowmaking needs,” Jia told reporters.Making snow from water is divided into four categories, namely reservoir diversion, rainwater recovery, surface runoff, and melting, Jia said, adding that the organisers are using water cautiously, and ensuring that there is no damage to groundwater levels.“We are not mining (the water), and will not cause damage to the groundwater,” he said.Jia, asked about water waster in an area that is arid, said that as for the snow water that melted this year, all the snow water will be collected, and will continue to be recycled next year, without a drop being wasted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-china-snowmaking-wraps-up-ahead-of-approaching-winter-olympics-101641979000169.html
12-01-2022||World||Repeat booster shots have immune-system risks: European Medicines Agency||European Union regulators warned that frequent Covid-19 booster shots could adversely affect the immune system and may not be feasible.  Repeat booster doses every four months could eventually weaken the immune system and tire out people, according to the European Medicines Agency. Instead, countries should leave more time between booster programs and tie them to the onset of the cold season in each hemisphere, following the blueprint set out by influenza vaccination strategies, the agency said. The advice comes as some countries consider the possibility of offering people second booster shots in a bid to provide further protection against surging omicron infections. Earlier this month Israel became the first nation to start administering a second booster, or fourth shot, to those over 60. The UK has said that boosters are providing good levels of protection and there is no need for a second booster shot at the moment, but will review data as it evolves. Boosters “can be done once, or maybe twice, but it’s not something that we can think should be repeated constantly,” Marco Cavaleri, the EMA head of biological health threats and vaccines strategy, said at a press briefing on Tuesday. “We need to think about how we can transition from the current pandemic setting to a more endemic setting.”The EU regulator also said at the briefing that oral and intravenous antivirals, such as Paxlovid and Remdesivir, maintain their efficacy against omicron. The agency said that April is the soonest it could approve a new vaccine targeting a specific variant, as the process  takes about three to four months. Some of the world’s largest vaccine-makers have said they are looking at producing vaccines that could target new variants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/repeat-booster-shots-have-immune-system-risks-european-medicines-agency-101641977391044.html
12-01-2022||World||NATO, Russia in high-level talks as Ukraine tensions simmer||Senior NATO and Russian officials are meeting Wednesday to try to bridge seemingly irreconcilable differences over the future of Ukraine, amid deep skepticism that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s security proposals for easing tensions are genuine.The meeting comes during a week of high-stakes diplomacy and a U.S.-led effort to prevent preparations for what Washington believes could be a Russian invasion of Ukraine. Moscow denies it is planning an attack. Still, its history of military action in Ukraine and Georgia worries NATO.Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko and Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin will lead Moscow’s delegation at the NATO-Russia Council, the first time it’s convened in over two years. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman will also be at NATO headquarters in Brussels.The meeting is due to run for about three hours. The NATO-Russia Council, their chief forum for talks, was set up two decades ago but full meetings paused when Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014. It has met only sporadically since, the last time in July 2019.With around 100,000 combat-ready Russian troops backed by tanks, artillery and heavy equipment massed just across Ukraine’s eastern border, Wednesday’s gathering has taken on great significance, yet it still seems destined to fail.“These are completely unacceptable proposals,” Estonian Defense Minister Kalle Laanet told public broadcaster ERR on the eve of the talks.Estonia, like its Baltic neighbors Latvia and Lithuania, relies on U.S. security guarantees provided by its membership in NATO. The three Baltic nations were once ruled by the Soviet Union but are now part of the European Union and NATO.Putin says Russia’s demands are simple, but key parts of the proposals contained in the documents that Moscow has made public — a draft agreement with NATO countries and the offer of a treaty between Russia and the United States — won’t pass muster at the 30-country military organization.NATO would have to agree to halt all membership plans, not just with Ukraine, and scale down its presence in countries like Estonia close to Russia’s borders. In exchange, Russia would pledge to limit its war games, as well as end aircraft buzzing incidents and other low-level hostilities.Endorsing such an agreement would require NATO to reject a key part of its founding treaty. Under Article 10 of the 1949 Washington Treaty, the organization can invite in any willing European country that can contribute to security in the North Atlantic area and fulfill the obligations of membership.“It has become crystal clear that not a single ally inside the NATO alliance is willing to budge or negotiate anything as it relates to NATO’s open door policy,” Julianne Smith, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, said Tuesday. “I cannot imagine any scenario where that is up for discussion.”Maksim Samorukov, a fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center think tank, says the lack of any real Russian concessions in Putin's draft agreement probably means that “Russia is ready to tolerate a failure of these negotiations.”The idea, Samorukov said, is to “demonstrate to the West that we are serious, we mean business. That Russia is really ready to take drastic steps to impose these concessions” on the U.S.-led military organization.Still, NATO can't afford to ignore Russia’s offer. Some members fear that Putin may be seeking a pretext to launch an invasion — like the failure of the West to engage — and any talks that would ease tensions over border forces, missile deployments or war games would be welcome.For the Kremlin, though, time is of the essence.Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that this week's talks have, so far, provided little reason for optimism. He said the outcome of Wednesday’s meeting, and one at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe on Thursday, could determine whether it makes sense to continue talking.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nato-russia-in-high-level-talks-as-ukraine-tensions-simmer-101641975473590.html

12-01-2022||World||Omicron quickly overtaking Delta globally in terms of circulation, says WHO||Omicron is quickly overtaking the Delta variant of Covid-19 and becoming dominant around the world, a senior WHO official has warned, with the global health agency cautioning that there is "increasing evidence" Omicron is able to evade immunity but has less disease severity as compared to other variants.It could take some time for Omicron to overtake Delta in some countries, because it depends on the level of circulation of the Delta variant in those countries, Infectious Disease Epidemiologist and Covid-19 Technical Lead at the World Health Organisation (WHO) Maria Van Kerkhove said on Tuesday.“Omicron has been detected in all countries where we have good sequencing and it's likely to be in all countries around the world. It is quickly, in terms of its circulation, overtaking Delta. And so Omicron is becoming the dominant variant that is being detected,” Kerkhove said during a virtual questions and answers session.She further cautioned that even though there is some information that Omicron causes less severe disease than Delta, “it's not a mild disease” because “people are still being hospitalized for Omicron.”The Covid-19 Weekly Epidemiological Update, released by the WHO, said that over 15 million new Covid-19 cases were reported globally in the week of January 3-9, a 55 per cent increase as compared to the previous week when about 9.5 million cases were reported.Over 43,000 new deaths were reported in the past week. As of 9 January, over 304 million confirmed Covid-19 cases and over 5.4 million deaths have been reported.The highest numbers of new cases were reported from the US (4,610,359 new cases; a 73 per cent increase), France (1,597,203 new cases; a 46 per cent increase), the UK (1,217,258 new cases; a 10 per cent increase), Italy (1,014,358 new cases; a 57 per cent increase) and India (638,872 new cases; a 524 per cent increase), the update said.Kerkhove said the 15 million cases reported in the last seven days are a “record high in this pandemic” and are an “underestimate” given the challenges in surveillance around the world and COVID-19 self-tests at home that are not registered.The WHO update said that the Omicron variant has a substantial growth advantage and is rapidly replacing other variants.“This variant has been shown to have a shorter doubling time as compared to previous variants, with transmission occurring even amongst those vaccinated or with a history of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection; there is increasing evidence that this variant is able to evade immunity,” the update said.It said that in terms of disease severity, there is growing evidence that the Omicron variant is less severe as compared to other variants.Citing a non-peer-reviewed retrospective cohort study from the US, the update said the findings suggest that while the absolute number of cases and hospitalisations among children are currently increasing in the US, the risk of hospitalisation still remains lower compared to other age groups during the period when Omicron is circulating as compared to the period when the Delta variant was dominant.The update also noted that since December, six studies have provided evidence of reduced vaccine effectiveness (VE) of Covid-19 vaccines against the Omicron variant."While early VE estimates against the Omicron variant should be interpreted with caution due to potential biases, these preliminary results provide evidence of reduced overall effectiveness of vaccines against the Omicron variant, with greater declines in effectiveness with increasing time since vaccination, relative to Delta... While a booster vaccination appears to improve VE against infection and hospitalisation due to the Omicron variant, more data are needed to assess both the magnitude and duration of the protection,” the update said.The WHO Technical Advisory Group on Covid-19 Vaccine Composition (TAG-CO-VAC) said that as coronavirus evolves, the composition of current Covid-19 vaccines may need to be updated, to ensure that “Covid-19 vaccines continue to provide WHO-recommended levels of protection against infection and disease by VOCs, including Omicron and future variants.”Kerkhove added that as Omicron enters and circulates among vulnerable populations, “we will see increase in hospitalisations and deaths. So please treat this virus as seriously as it needs to be treated. The narrative that it's the common cold is not true. The narrative that it is just mild is not true. So we have to really fight against it. It’s not the time to give up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-quickly-overtaking-delta-globally-in-terms-of-circulation-says-who-101641965843677.html

Many of these include pregnant women and children, the report further said.The Mail report was based on videos posted on social media, which it said have been widely circulated. These videos talk about the situation in Xi’an, Anyang and Yuzhou, where people have been quarantined after a few cases of Omicron were reported.Also Read | China locks down second city amid Omicron threatIn all, 20 million people - including 13 million in Xi’an – have been quarantined in these cities and are living in tiny cells, said the Daily Mail. These people are given wooden boxes and a toilet and are forced to remain in the metal boxes for as long as two weeks, the videos posted on Chinese social media platforms showed, according to the Mail.The videos also showed workers in hazmat suits providing food to these people. Some of them have complained that very little food is left in the freezing metal boxes, the Mail said in its report.A few residents of locked-down cities told the BBC that they were part of a 'big transfer' of thousands of people to the camps."There is nothing here, just basic necessities... Nobody has come to check up on us, what kind of quarantine is this?” a user said in one of the comments posted on social media.As soon as a Covid-19 positive case surfaces in a city, the authorities ask people living in the entire area to leave their homes and board buses, which then take them to the quarantine centres - the metal boxes. The Daily Mail quoted a witness to report that some of the residents were asked to leave just after midnight.The measures are part of China’s strict Covid-zero policy, under which Beijing is aiming to eliminate the outbreak before Lunar New Year and the Winter Olympics next month.Also Read | Beijing on alert as partly-locked down Tianjin’s cases jumpChina even sent three people to prison for more than four years over breaches of rules that led to Covid-19 outbreak in port city Dalian, in one of the harshest punishments for lapses in enforcing the government’s strict Covid-zero policy. The oversight allowed four people to infect 83 others, local media reported.But the measures are not proving that effective. Apart from Dalian, fresh Covid-19 cases were reported in Tianjin, promoting the authorities to start a new round of sample testing among its 14 million residents.Tianjin reported 33 domestically transmitted coronavirus infections with confirmed symptoms for Tuesday, up from 10 a day earlier, national data showed.Including infections in Tianjin, mainland China reported a total of 166 local symptomatic cases for Tuesday, more than 110 a day earlier.There were no new deaths, leaving the death toll at 4,636. As of January 11, mainland China had 104,189 confirmed symptomatic cases, including both local ones and those arriving from overseas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/midnight-evacuation-quarantine-in-metal-boxes-china-enforces-zero-covid-policy-101641960198787.html
12-01-2022||World||Ahead of crucial talks in Brussels, US tells Russia: NATO’s doors won’t shut||WASHINGTON: Ahead of a crucial meeting between the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and Russia on Wednesday, the US stepped up its engagement with European allies.Washington made it clear that Moscow’s proposal seeking a curtailment of the NATO’s engagement, activities and expansion in the east was a non-starter; and it reiterated its warning that any Russian aggression in Ukraine will result in “severe costs”.Wednesday’s meeting is the second in a series of three dialogues between the US and Russia in different settings this week, even as tensions between the two countries have intensified in recent days over Russia’s military build-up along the border with Ukraine.On Monday, US deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman met her Russian counterpart, Sergei Ryabkov, in Geneva as a part of a strategic stability dialogue, focused on bilateral issues between the two countries. On Wednesday, Brussels will host the NATO-Russia council. And on Thursday, permanent representatives to the 57-member Organisation of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), of which both the US and Russia are members, will meet in Vienna to discuss European security.On Tuesday, Sherman met the NATO’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, and then ambassadors from the European Union (EU)’s political and security committee in Brussels. US state department spokesperson Ned Price said, “The meeting underscored the US commitment to work closely with the EU and its member states to address this urgent challenge together. They affirmed the United States’ and the EU’s unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The deputy secretary thanked the committee for their work to ensure any further Russian military invasion of Ukraine would result in severe costs, including coordinated economic measures, for the Russian Federation.”From Geneva, after her meeting, Sherman had told reporters, “We were firm… in pushing back on security proposals that are simply non-starters for the United States. We will not allow anyone to slam closed the NATO’s open door policy, which has always been central to the NATO alliance. We will not forego bilateral cooperation with sovereign states that wish to work with the United States. And we will not make decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine, about Europe without Europe, or about the NATO without the NATO. As we say to our allies and partners, ‘nothing about you without you’.”Watch: ‘Where’s the proof?’: U.S calls out Russia’s no-invasion claim against UkraineThese meetings are taking place in the wake of a Russian proposal in mid-December, whereby it has floated two draft treaties, one with the US and the other with the NATO. In its proposal of a new treaty with the US on security guarantees, the Russian draft states that the US shall “undertake to prevent further eastward expansion” of the NATO and “deny accession to the alliance” to the states of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Its second draft treaty seeks to effectively restore the NATO’s boundaries to its pre-1997 status, by stating that Russia and all parties that were member states of the NATO as of May 27, 1997 “shall not deploy military forces and weaponry on the territory of any of the other states in Europe”. The draft also asks “all member states of the NATO to commit themselves to refrain from any further enlargement of the NATO, including the accession of Ukraine as well as other states.”In a separate briefing on Tuesday, US ambassador to the NATO, Julianne Smith, said that in all their prior consultations and meetings with allies, it had become “crystal clear” that not a single ally inside the NATO alliance was willing to budge or negotiate anything with regard to the NATO’s open door policy. When asked about Russia’s demand seeking a restoration of the 1997 status of the NATO, Smith said, “Well, I think when you talk to NATO allies, one thing becomes clear in terms of consensus at the table, and that is that this alliance is not going to be rolling back time and returning to a completely different era where we had a very different alliance that was smaller and a very different footprint. I think we’re operating in today’s world with the NATO as it stands today, and I don’t think anyone inside the NATO alliance is interested in going back in time to revisit an era when the NATO looked a lot different from it does today.”

The United States continue to report an exponential surge in infections and record-high Covid-19 hospitalisations, largely driven by the highly contagious Omicron variant.After the US reported a record 1.35 million new Covid cases, top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci said the country is approaching the "threshold" of transitioning to living with the coronavirus as a manageable disease. Speaking to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Fauci said "Omicron, with its extraordinary, unprecedented degree of efficiency of transmissibility, will ultimately find just about everybody."Omicron may be headed for a rapid drop in US and BritainScientists, meanwhile, are seeing signals that the Omicron-driven Covid wave may have peaked in the United Kingdom, and the US is about to follow the suit. Britain reported 120,821 new cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday, a significant drop from 142,224 infections on Monday, according to government data. But the experts warn that there’s still much uncertainty over the course of the pandemic.“We are seeing a definite falling-off of cases in the UK, but I’d like to see them fall much further before we know if what happened in South Africa will happen here,” Dr Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at Britain’s University of East Anglia, was quoted as saying by Associated Press.The World Health Organization (WHO) said in a technical briefing last week that the overall risk related to Omicron remains very high due to a number of reasons. The UN health agency warned that a rapid increase in cases will lead to an increase in hospitalisations which may pose an overwhelming strain on health systems and lead to significant morbidity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-britain-reports-drop-in-daily-covid-cases-amid-record-surge-in-us-101641955240916.html
12-01-2022||World||Omicron may be headed for a rapid drop in US and Britain||Scientists are seeing signals that Covid-19′s alarming omicron wave may have peaked in Britain and is about to do the same in the US, at which point cases may start dropping off dramatically.The reason: The variant has proved so wildly contagious that it may already be running out of people to infect, just a month and a half after it was first detected in South Africa.“It’s going to come down as fast as it went up,” said Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle.At the same time, experts warn that much is still uncertain about how the next phase of the pandemic might unfold. The plateauing or ebbing in the two countries is not happening everywhere at the same time or at the same pace. And weeks or months of misery still lie ahead for patients and overwhelmed hospitals even if the drop-off comes to pass.“There are still a lot of people who will get infected as we descend the slope on the backside,” said Lauren Ancel Meyers, director of the University of Texas COVID-19 Modeling Consortium, which predicts that reported cases will peak within the week.The University of Washington's own highly influential model says the number of daily reported cases in the US will crest at 1.2 million by Jan. 19 and will then fall sharply “simply because everybody who could be infected will be infected,” according to Mokdad.In fact, he said, by the university's complex calculations, the true number of new daily infections in the US — an estimate that includes people who were never tested — has already peaked, hitting 6 million on Jan. 6.In Britain, meanwhile, new Covid-19 cases dropped to about 140,000 a day in the last week, after skyrocketing to more than 200,000 a day earlier this month, according to government data.Kevin McConway, a retired professor of applied statistics at Britain’s Open University, said that while cases are still rising in places such as southwest England and the West Midlands, the outbreak may have peaked in London.The figures have raised hopes that the two countries are about to witness what happened in South Africa, where the wave crested at record highs and then fell significantly about a month later.“We are seeing a definite falling-off of cases in the U.K., but I’d like to see them fall much further before we know if what happened in South Africa will happen here,” said Dr. Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at Britain’s University of East Anglia.Differences between Britain and South Africa, including Britain's older population and the tendency of its people to spend more time indoors in the winter, could mean a bumpier outbreak for the country and other nations like it.On the other hand, British authorities' decision to adopt minimal restrictions against omicron could enable the virus to rip through the population and run its course much faster than it might in Western European countries that have imposed tougher Covid-19 controls, such as France, Spain and Italy.Shabir Mahdi, dean of health sciences at South Africa’s University of Witwatersrand, said European countries that impose lockdowns won't necessarily come through the omicron wave with fewer infections; the cases may just be spread out over a longer period of time.On Tuesday, the World Health Organization said there have been 7 million new Covid-19 cases across Europe in the past week, calling it a “tidal wave sweeping across the region.” WHO cited modeling from Mokdad's group that predicts half of Europe’s population will be infected with omicron within about eight weeks.By that time, however, Hunter and others expect the world to be past the omicron surge.“There will probably be some ups and downs along the way, but I would hope that by Easter, we will be out of this,” Hunter said.Still, the sheer numbers of people infected could prove overwhelming to fragile health systems, said Dr. Prabhat Jha of the Centre for Global Health Research at St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto.“The next few weeks are going to be brutal because in absolute numbers, there are so many people being infected that it will spill over into ICUs,” Jha said.Mokdad likewise warned in the US: “It’s going to be a tough two or three weeks. We have to make hard decisions to let certain essential workers continue working, knowing they could be infectious.”Omicron could one day be seen as a turning point in the pandemic, said Meyers, at the University of Texas. Immunity from all the new infections, along with new drugs and continued vaccination, could render the coronavirus something with which we can more easily coexist.“At the end of this wave, far more people will have been infected by some variant of COVID,” Meyers said. “At some point, we’ll be able to draw a line — and omicron may be that point — where we transition from what is a catastrophic global threat to something that’s a much more manageable disease.”That's one plausible future, she said, but there is also the possibility of a new variant — one that is far worse than omicron — arising.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-may-be-headed-for-a-rapid-drop-in-us-and-britain-101641952130886.html

12-01-2022||World||WHO body says COVID vaccines ‘may need to be updated’ for Omicron||A technical advisory group established by the World Health Organization said on Tuesday that current Covid-19 vaccines may need to be updated to ensure they are effective against new variants like Omicron.The statement comes after several real-world studies found the variant, highly resistant to antibodies from a past infection as well as those elicited by vaccination, reduced the efficacy of most used doses to under 40%.“The composition of current Covid-19 vaccines may need to be updated, to ensure that Covid-19 vaccines continue to provide WHO-recommended levels of protection against infection and disease by VOCs, including Omicron and future variants,” the body of independent experts said in a statement.The WHO set 50% efficacy as the minimum bar for coronavirus vaccines, which each of them met when tested against the variant that first spread in 2020, but has since been reduced by the Sars-CoV-2’s evolution.The WHO panel, called TAG-CO-VAC, asked vaccine makers to generate and provide data on the performance of Omicron-specific vaccines for now.Several companies, including Moderna and Pfizer, are testing Omicron-specific vaccines, while some others have begun testing pan-coronavirus vaccines in clinical trials. Pan-coronavirus vaccines are difficult to design.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-body-says-covid-vaccines-may-need-to-be-updated-for-omicron-101641952115973.html
12-01-2022||World||North Korea's Kim calls for more 'military muscle' after watching hypersonic missile test||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for boosting the country's strategic military forces as he observed the test of a hypersonic missile, state media said on Wednesday, officially attending a missile launch for the first time in nearly two years.On Tuesday authorities in South Korea and Japan detected the suspected launch, which drew condemnation by authorities around the world and prompted an expression of concern from the U.N. secretary-general.The second test of a "hypersonic missile" in less than a week underscored Kim's New Year's vow to bolster the military with cutting-edge technology at a time when talks with South Korea and the United States have stalled.After watching the test, Kim urged military scientists to "further accelerate the efforts to steadily build up the country's strategic military muscle both in quality and quantity and further modernize the army," KCNA news agency reported.It was the first time since March 2020 that Kim had officially attended a missile test."His presence here would suggest particular attention on this programme," Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the U.S.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, posted on Twitter.Unlike some other recent tests, ruling party newspaper Rodong Sinmun published photos of Kim attending the launch on its front page."While Kim probably unofficially attended other tests in the interim, this appearance and its Page One feature on Rodong Sinmun is important," said Chad O'Carroll, chief executive of Korea Risk Group, which monitors North Korea. "It means Kim is not concerned about being personally associated (with) tests of major new tech. And doesn't care how the U.S. sees this."U.N. Security Council resolutions ban all North Korean ballistic missile and nuclear tests and have imposed sanctions over the programs.Talks aimed at persuading North Korea to surrender or limit its arsenal of nuclear weapons and missiles have stalled, with Pyongyang saying it is open to diplomacy but only if the United States and its allies stop "hostile policies" such as sanctions or military drills.U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland called the launches dangerous and destabilising."It obviously takes us in the wrong direction," she said at a regular briefing in Washington on Tuesday. "As you know, the United States has been saying since this administration came in that we are open to dialogue with North Korea, that we are open to talking about COVID and humanitarian support, and instead they're firing off missiles."The European Union on Tuesday condemned the latest North Korean missile launch as a "threat to international peace and security" and called on Pyongyang to resume diplomacy.'SUPERIOR MANOEUVERABILITY'Despite their name, analysts say the main feature of hypersonic weapons is not speed - which can sometimes be matched or exceeded by traditional ballistic missile warheads - but their manoeuvrability, which makes them an acute threat to missile defence systems.Photos released by state media appeared to show the same type of missile and warhead that was first tested last week, analysts said."The test-fire was aimed at the final verification of overall technical specifications of the developed hypersonic weapon system," KCNA reported.After its release from the rocket booster, a hypersonic glide vehicle made a 600 km (375 mile) "glide jump flight" and then 240 km of "corkscrew manoeuvering" before hitting a target in the sea 1,000 km away, the report said.South Korean officials had questioned the capabilities of the missile after the first test last week, saying it did not appear to demonstrate the range and manoeuverability claimed in a state media report and featured a manoeuverable warhead rather than an actual glide vehicle.On Tuesday, however, South Korea said the second test appeared to show improved performance, with the missile reaching top speeds up to 10 times the speed of sound (12,348 km per hour / 7,673 miles per hour), although they did not comment on its manoeuverability."The superior manoeuverability of the hypersonic glide vehicle was more strikingly verified through the final test-fire," KCNA said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-s-kim-calls-for-more-military-muscle-after-watching-hypersonic-missile-test-101641950683929.html
12-01-2022||World||‘Omicron will find everybody’: Fauci as US on 'threshold' of living with Covid||Despite soaring cases and record-high Covid-19 hospitalizations, the United States is approaching the "threshold" of transitioning to living with the coronavirus as a manageable disease, Anthony Fauci said Tuesday.Speaking to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the top US scientist said eliminating Covid was unrealistic and that "Omicron, with its extraordinary, unprecedented degree of efficiency of transmissibility, will ultimately find just about everybody.""There's no way we're going to eradicate this" virus, he said, given its contagiousness, its propensity to mutate into new variants and the large pool of unvaccinated people.Those up to date with their vaccines remain well protected against severe outcomes, but vaccine efficacy against infection has fallen.But "as Omicron goes up and down," the country will hopefully enter a new phase "where there'll be enough protection in (the) community, enough drugs available so that when someone does get infected and is in a high risk group, it will be very easy to treat that person," said Fauci."When we get there, there's that transition, and we may be on the threshold of that right now," he said, while also stressing that with the country currently recording almost a million infections a day, nearly 150,000 people in hospital and more than 1,200 daily deaths, "we're not at that point."Official data showed there are currently 145,982 Covid hospitalizations, even though a significant percent are thought to be hospitalized "with" the disease rather than because of it.Earlier, the 81-year-old director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases slammed vaccine skeptic Republican Senator Rand Paul for unleashing "crazies" who were threatening his life and harassing his family, in unusually emotional congressional testimony.President Joe Biden's top officials, including his chief medical advisor Fauci, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director Rochelle Walenksy and acting Food and Drug Administration (FDA) head Janet Woodcock were summoned to testify before the Senate about the pandemic.While many fellow lawmakers focused their questions on the lack of adequate testing and confusing new guidelines on how infected people should end their isolation, Paul, who has railed against vaccine mandates and refused to get vaccinated, said Fauci was personally to blame for people's deaths.Paul faulted Fauci for hundreds of thousands of deaths that occurred since Biden took office -- although the vast majority of those fatalities were unvaccinated and health officials, including Fauci, have consistently advocated for vaccines.'Kindles the crazies'"You personally attack me and with absolutely not a shred of evidence of anything you say," Fauci responded."All of a sudden that kindles the crazies out there and I have life threats upon my life, harassment of my family and my children with obscene phone calls."Fauci recalled that in late December, a man was arrested on his way from California to the capital Washington armed with an AR-15 assault weapon and multiple rounds of ammunition.The man said he wanted to kill Fauci, because of what he said was blood on the scientists' hands.Fauci then brandished a printout from Paul's website that showed the banner "Fire Dr Fauci" next to an invitation to donate to the Republican's campaign.Though Omicron causes severe cases at a lower rate than Delta, it is reaching more people because of its extreme infectiousness.By December 27, the age-adjusted vaccine efficacy against hospitalization was 92 percent, according to data from New York state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-will-find-everybody-fauci-as-us-on-threshold-of-living-with-covid-101641944196234.html

A Vatican spokesman said Francis had gone there to bless the shop because it had been recently renovated.Martinez-Brocal told Reuters the shop's owners told him that they had become friends with the pope years ago when he was Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, archbishop of Buenos Aires.He would visit their shop to buy classical music records and CDs when he was in Rome on Church business and stayed at a nearby residence for visiting clerics.They said they gave the pope a CD of classical music but declined to be more specific. Francis is known to like Beethoven, Mozart and Bach -- and even tango music from his native Argentina.The video showed the pope, who shuns bulletproof cars leaving the shop and getting into a simple white Fiat 500 with Vatican number plates.It was not the first time the pope has visited a Rome shop. In 2015, two years after his election, he ordered a new pair of eyeglasses from a Rome optician.They were to have been delivered to the Vatican but he decided to go pick them up himself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-makes-surprise-visit-to-rome-record-store-gets-classical-cd-101641944210812.html
12-01-2022||World||North Korea says Kim Jong Un oversaw latest hypersonic missile test||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un personally oversaw his regime’s latest hypersonic missile test on Tuesday, official media reported, as he pushes to develop weapons to counter U.S. defenses. The Korean Central News Agency said the hypersonic glide vehicle made a 240-kilometer (150-mile) “corkscrew” maneuver during flight to hit a target in waters 1,000 kilometers away. It called the launch “a great success in the field of developing hypersonic weapon, which is of the most important strategic significance.”“The superior maneuverability of the hypersonic glide vehicle was more strikingly verified through the final test-fire,” KCNA said on Wednesday. Kim congratulated the scientists involved, the report said, and stressed “the need to further accelerate the efforts to steadily build up the country’s strategic military muscle both in quality and quantity.” The missile, which flew at almost 10 times the speed of sound, has further stoked tensions with the U.S. and its allies as Kim ignores calls for a return to stalled nuclear talks. Shares of South Korea’s so-called “peace stocks,” which tend to benefit from talks between Seoul and Pyongyang, slipped Tuesday.The missile test took place at daybreak, KCNA said in its report, describing how Kim witnessed the advanced missile “brightening the dawning sky and leaving behind it a column of fire.” North Korea last week claimed a successful test of a “hypersonic gliding warhead” that turned 120 kilometers from its original flight path, potentially showing its ability to get around U.S. anti-missile systems deployed in South Korea.The fact that Kim’s presence at the launch was noted by official media is significant, according to Ankit Panda, a senior fellow in the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.“His presence here would suggest particular attention on this program,” Panda, author of the book “Kim Jong Un and the Bomb: Survival and Deterrence in North Korea,” wrote on Twitter. “Everything about this test is a reminder that North Korea is all-in on a new military modernization campaign.”Nuclear talks between the U.S. and North Korea broke down about two years ago after a brief revival under former President Donald Trump. The Biden administration has said the door is open for talks and indicated it would be willing to consider economic incentives to reward North Korea for taking steps to wind down its nuclear arsenal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-says-kim-jong-un-oversaw-latest-hypersonic-missile-test-101641942053911.html
12-01-2022||World||Omicron may be slowing down in US and Britain: Report||Scientists are seeing signals that COVID-19′s alarming omicron wave may have peaked in Britain and is about to do the same in the U.S., at which point cases may start dropping off dramatically.The reason: The variant has proved so wildly contagious that it may already be running out of people to infect, just a month and a half after it was first detected in South Africa.“It’s going to come down as fast as it went up,” said Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle.At the same time, experts warn that much is still uncertain about how the next phase of the pandemic might unfold. The plateauing or ebbing in the two countries is not happening everywhere at the same time or at the same pace. And weeks or months of misery still lie ahead for patients and overwhelmed hospitals even if the drop-off comes to pass.“There are still a lot of people who will get infected as we descend the slope on the backside,” said Lauren Ancel Meyers, director of the University of Texas COVID-19 Modeling Consortium, which predicts that reported cases will peak within the week.The University of Washington's own highly influential model projects that the number of daily reported cases in the U.S. will crest at 1.2 million by Jan. 19 and will then fall sharply “simply because everybody who could be infected will be infected,” according to Mokdad.In fact, he said, by the university's complex calculations, the true number of new daily infections in the U.S. — an estimate that includes people who were never tested — has already peaked, hitting 6 million on Jan. 6.In Britain, meanwhile, new COVID-19 cases dropped to about 140,000 a day in the last week, after skyrocketing to more than 200,000 a day earlier this month, according to government data.Kevin McConway, a retired professor of applied statistics at Britain’s Open University, said that while cases are still rising in places such as southwest England and the West Midlands, the outbreak may have peaked in London.The figures have raised hopes that the two countries are about to undergo something similar to what happened in South Africa, where in the span of about a month the wave crested at record highs and then fell significantly.“We are seeing a definite falling-off of cases in the U.K., but I’d like to see them fall much further before we know if what happened in South Africa will happen here,” said Dr. Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at Britain’s University of East Anglia.Differences between Britain and South Africa, including Britain's older population and the tendency of its people to spend more time indoors in the winter, could mean a bumpier outbreak for the country and other nations like it.On the other hand, British authorities' decision to adopt minimal restrictions against omicron could enable the virus to rip through the population and run its course much faster than it might in Western European countries that have imposed tougher COVID-19 controls, such as France, Spain and Italy.Shabir Mahdi, dean of health sciences at South Africa’s University of Witwatersrand, said European countries that impose lockdowns won't necessarily come through the omicron wave with fewer infections; the cases may just be spread out over a longer period of time.On Tuesday, the World Health Organization said there have been 7 million new COVID-19 cases across Europe in the past week, calling it a “tidal wave sweeping across the region.” WHO cited modeling from Mokdad's group that predicts half of Europe’s population will be infected with omicron within about eight weeks. By that time, however, Hunter and others expect the world to be past the omicron surge. “There will probably be some ups and downs along the way, but I would hope that by Easter, we will be out of this,” Hunter said. Still, the sheer numbers of people infected could prove overwhelming to fragile health systems, said Dr. Prabhat Jha of the Centre for Global Health Research at St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto. “The next few weeks are going to be brutal because in absolute numbers, there are so many people being infected that it will spill over into ICUs,” Jha said.Mokdad likewise warned in the U.S.: “It’s going to be a tough two or three weeks. We have to make hard decisions to let certain essential workers continue working, knowing they could be infectious.”Omicron could one day be seen as a turning point in the pandemic, said Meyers, at the University of Texas. Immunity gained from all the new infections, along with new drugs and continued vaccination, could render the coronavirus something with which we can more easily coexist.“At the end of this wave, far more people will have been infected by some variant of COVID,” Meyers said. “At some point, we’ll be able to draw a line — and omicron may be that point — where we transition from what is a catastrophic global threat to something that’s a much more manageable disease.”That's one plausible future, she said, but there is also the possibility of a new variant — one that is far worse than omicron — arising.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

12-01-2022||World||US sees record 1.48mn new virus cases||The United States reported at least more one million new coronavirus infections on Monday, the highest daily total of any country in the world as the spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant showed no signs of slowing.The US saw 1,481,375 new Covid-19 infections for Monday, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The previous record was 1.17 million cases on January 3.A large number of cases are reported each Monday due to many states not reporting over the weekend. The seven-day average for new cases has tripled in two weeks to over 700,000 new infections a day, Reuters reported.The record in new cases came the same day as the nation saw the number of hospitalised also hit an all-time high, having doubled in three weeks, according to a Reuters tally.There were more than 141,000 people hospitalised with Covid as of Monday, according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services, surpassing the record of 132,051 set in January last year.Deaths are averaging 1,700 per day, up from about 1,400 in recent days but within levels seen earlier this winter.The presence of the Delta variant of Covid, which has previously ravaged the country, would explain why deaths and hospitalisations are still rising, since data suggest that Omicron infections are less severe.Hospitals letting Covid+ staff stay on the jobHospitals around the US are increasingly taking the extraordinary step of allowing nurses and other workers infected with the coronavirus to stay on the job if they have mild symptoms or none at all.The move is a reaction to the severe hospital staffing shortages and crushing caseloads that the omicron variant is causing.California health authorities announced over the weekend that hospital staff members who test positive but are symptom-free can continue working. Some hospitals in Rhode Island and Arizona have likewise told employees they can stay on the job if they have no symptoms or just mild ones.Many hospitals are not only swamped with cases but severely shorthanded because of so many employees out with Covid-19.President Joe Biden said on Tuesday he was confident the US was on the right track in the fight against the pandemic. White House officials have said the situation is different from previous stages of the pandemic because more people are getting protection from vaccinations and booster shots.Mexican prez says he has Covid for second timeMexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Monday that he had Covid-19 for a second time and was experiencing mild symptoms.“I inform you that I am infected with Covid-19 and although the symptoms are mild, I will remain in isolation and will only do office work and communicate virtually until I get through it,” he tweeted. Lopez Obrador overcame a first bout of Covid-19 in early 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sees-record-1-48mn-new-virus-cases-101641932320322.html
