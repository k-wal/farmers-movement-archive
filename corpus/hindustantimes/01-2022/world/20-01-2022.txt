The doorstep of doom is no place to loiter.”BAS was founded in 1945 by Albert Einstein, J Robert Oppenheimer, Eugene Rabinowitch and scientists from the University of Chicago who helped develop the first atomic weapons, and the organisation created the Doomsday Clock two years later. According to the organisation’s website, the clock uses the “imagery of apocalypse (midnight) and the contemporary idiom of nuclear explosion (countdown to zero) to convey threats to humanity”.Every year, BAS’s Science and Security Board, in consultation with its board of sponsors that includes 11 Nobel laureates, makes the decision to move, or to leave in place, the minute hand of the Doomsday Clock. BAS has reset the minute hand on the Doomsday Clock 24 times since its debut in 1947.The last movement was in 2020, when the minute hand was moved from two minutes to midnight to 100 seconds from midnight because of an “unprecedentedly high risk” of a nuclear exchange. This brought the minute hand closer to midnight than ever in the Doomsday Clock’s history.BAS said factors such as nuclear weapons, climate change, disruptive technologies and the pandemic were exacerbated by “a corrupted information ecosphere that undermines rational decision making”.Rachel Bronson, president and CEO of BAS, said: “The Doomsday Clock continues to hover dangerously, reminding us about how much work is needed to be done to ensure a safer and healthier planet. We must continue to push the hands of the clock away from midnight.”Sharon Squassoni, co-chair of the Science and Security Board of BAS, said: “One hundred seconds to midnight reflects the board’s judgment that we are stuck in a perilous moment – one that brings neither stability nor security. Positive developments in 2021 failed to counteract negative, long-term trends.”BAS said the leadership change in the US last year had provided hope that “what seemed like a global race toward catastrophe might be halted and – with renewed US engagement – even reversed”. The Biden administration changed policies in some ways that made the world safer, such as agreeing to an extension of the New START arms control agreement and beginning strategic stability talks with Russia, announcing the US would seek to return to the Iran nuclear deal, and rejoining the Paris climate accord. Science and evidence also returned to US policy-making, especially regarding the pandemic, but these changes were not enough to reverse negative international security trends, the organisation said.US relations with Russia and China remain tense and all three countries are engaged in nuclear modernisation and expansion efforts, including Beijing’s large-scale programme to increase its deployment of silo-based long-range nuclear missiles. “If not restrained, these efforts could mark the start of a dangerous new nuclear arms race,” BAS said. “Ukraine remains a potential flashpoint, and Russian troop deployments to the Ukrainian border heighten day-to-day tensions,” it noted.BAS listed steps that should be taken to address current threats and to reverse the hands of the Doomsday Clock.It said the Russian and US presidents should identify “more ambitious and comprehensive limits on nuclear weapons and delivery systems by the end of 2022”, and agree to “reduce reliance on nuclear weapons by limiting their roles, missions and platforms”.The US should persuade allies and rivals that no-first-use of nuclear weapons is a step toward security and stability, and then declare such a policy in concert with Russia and China.The US and other countries should accelerate decarbonisation, and China should set an example by pursuing sustainable development pathways in the One Belt One Road initiative. The US and other leaders should work through World Health Organisation (WHO) and other international institutions to reduce biological risks of all kinds through better monitoring of animal-human interactions, improvements in international disease surveillance and reporting, increased production and distribution of medical supplies, and expanded hospital capacity, it added.
20-01-2022||World||US official lays out Biden’s China strategy, says India’s role ‘critical’||In its first year in office, the Joe Biden administration has focused on a five-part strategy to compete with China, and sees India’s role as “critical” in both pushing back against China, and advancing an affirmative vision of the Indo-Pacific, National Security Council (NSC) senior director for China Laura Rosenberger said on Wednesday.Speaking at the launch of Strategic Asia 2020-21 – a report on challenges emanating from US-China strategic competition, deglobalisation, and Covid-19 for countries and regions in the Indo-Pacific, Rosenberger said the administration’s approach to China rested on the analysis that while competition is particularly pronounced in the Indo-Pacific, it is playing out globally.When asked about how the US saw India’s role in this competition with China, at a time when India is facing China’s military aggression at the border, Rosenberger said, “We have taken a number of steps to deepen the partnership with India…India’s role is quite critical.”And the fact that the leaders of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) - India, US, Australia, and Japan - had met twice in the past year, once virtually and once in-person, was proof of the importance of the format, she said.Acknowledging that Beijing had been “engaging in provocations” along India’s border, Rosenberger said that India was an important partner not just in terms of pushing back China but also on a range of other issues, from vaccines to technology, as well as for advancing a different and affirmative vision of the Indo-Pacific.Rosenberger said that the first element of the broader US strategy on China involved “investing in ourselves”.“You can’t win a competition with only defence,” she said. This entailed, over the past year, battling the pandemic, staving off the prospects for recession, decreasing unemployment, ramping up vaccination, investing in infrastructure, diversifying supply chains to ensure that US was not dependent, and investing in the country’s technological edge.The second element, she said, was “investing in allies and partners”. This included intensive diplomacy with European allies and partners, harmonising differences, giving momentum to Quad, and deepening ties with the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean), among other steps.The third element was “shaping the international environment around China”, which involved re-engaging with multilateral platforms, and reinforcing deterrence in the Indo-Pacific, among other steps.Rosenberger said the fourth element of the administration’s strategy was based on “defending our values”. This involved imposing costs on China for its actions in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, ensuring global norms and institutions were consistent with democratic values, “strengthening democracy at home and abroad”, and showcasing how democracy delivered.The final element of the strategy, the NSC official said, was “responsibly managing competition” with China. This entailed maintaining channels of communication at the leader-level and installing “guardrails” to ensure that competition did not descend into conflict. Rosenberger cited the example of the Biden-Xi Jinping virtual summit in November as evidence of this engagement, and said these engagements provided an opportunity to set the terms of competition as well as discuss areas where interests align.
20-01-2022||World||UN approves resolution condemning Holocaust denial||The U.N. General Assembly approved an Israeli-sponsored resolution Thursday condemning any denial of the Holocaust and urging all nations and social media companies “to take active measures to combat antisemitism and Holocaust denial or distortion.”The 193-member world body approved the resolution by consensus -- without a vote -- and with a bang of a gavel by Assembly President Abdulla Shahid. Israel’s No. 1 enemy, Iran, “disassociated” itself from the resolution.The ambassadors of Israel and Germany, which strongly supported the resolution, stressed the significance of the resolution’s adoption on Jan. 20: It is the 80th anniversary of the Wannsee Conference where Nazi leaders coordinated plans for the so-called “Final Solution of the Jewish Question” at a villa on the shores of Berlin’s Wannsee Lake in 1942 during World War II.The result was the establishment of Nazi death camps and the murder of nearly 6 million Jews, comprising one-third of the Jewish people. In addition, millions of people from other nationalities, minorities and targeted groups were killed, according to the draft resolution.“We now live in an era in which fiction is becoming fact and the Holocaust is becoming a distant memory,” Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Gilad Erdan told the assembly in urging support for the resolution. “And as this happens following the greatest crime in human history, now comes the greatest cover-up in human history.”Erdan, the grandson of Holocaust survivors, said the resolution is a commitment to make sure that Holocaust distortion and denial “will be tolerated no more.”He said social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter and You Tube are spreading the “pandemic of distortions and lies” about the Holocaust“Social media giants can no longer remain complacent to the hate spread on their platforms” and must take action now, the Israeli ambassador said.The resolution commends countries that have preserved Nazi death camps and other sites from the Holocaust and urges the 193 U.N. member states “to develop educational programs that will inculcate future generations with the lessons of the Holocaust in order to help to prevent future acts of genocide.”It requests the U.N. and its agencies to continue developing and implementing programs aimed at countering Holocaust denial and distortions and to mobilize civil society and others to provide truthful facts about the Holocaust.Currently, the U.N. has an outreach program on the Holocaust and the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO, has a program on Holocaust education and combatting anti-Semitism.Unlike Security Council resolutions, General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, but do reflect global opinion.The General Assembly designated Jan. 27 — the day the Auschwitz concentration camp was liberated by the Soviet army — as the annual International Day of Commemoration in memory of victims of the Holocaust in 2005. The resolution underlines that remembrance “is a key component to the prevention of further acts of genocide.”It says Holocaust denial “refers to discourse and propaganda that deny the historical reality and the extent of the extermination of the Jews by the Nazis and their accomplices during World War II” and “any attempt to claim that the Holocaust did not take place” or call into doubt that gas chambers, mass shooting, starvation, and intentional genocide were used against the Jewish people.The resolution says distorting or denying the Holocaust also refers to “intentional efforts to excuse or minimize” the role of Nazi collaborators and allies, “gross minimization” of the number of victims, “attempts to blame the Jews for causing their own genocide,” statements casting the Holocaust as a positive event, and attempt to “blur the responsibility” for establishing concentration and death camps “by putting blame on other nations or ethnic groups.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-approves-resolution-condemning-holocaust-denial-101642697746617.html
20-01-2022||World||Biden confirms Kamala Harris would be running mate in 2024||Addressing a press conference to mark his first year in office on Wednesday, US President Joe Biden confirmed that if he runs for a second term in 2024, he would nominate vice-president Kamala Harris as his running mate again, even as he blamed Republican obstructionism for blocking progress in his first year in office and committed to greater public outreach to explain the administration’s work in his second year.The president commended his administration for progress in the battle against Covid-19, while acknowledging that the job remained unfinished, and battling unemployment, which was at 3.9% in December. Biden outlined steps that he was taking to tame to inflation – focusing on supply chain issues and indicating a role for the Federal Reserve in terms of monetary policy.He indicated a willingness, for the first time, to break up his signature legislation, the $1.9 trillion Build Back Better plan, into smaller components and pass whatever was possible at the moment. And he reiterated his commitment to getting bills related to voting rights passed, even as it failed to muster the numbers in the Senate the same evening. When asked if he was satisfied with VP Harris’s work on voting rights (Biden has given her charge of the contentious issue), and if he would nominate her as his running mate again if he stood in 2024, Biden said, “Yes and yes.” His remarks, though not unusual since it would have been rare for a sitting president to undermine his VP, assume salience given recent critical reports in the US media about Harris’s working style, and possible challenges from other contenders in the party if she positions herself as a presidential candidate in 2024. Biden would be 82 in 2024.But the focus of Biden’s remarks on domestic US politics rested on critiquing Republicans: he repeatedly wondered what they stood for, alleged they had been far more obstructionist than they had been even during Barack Obama’s presidency, and claimed that the entire party was in fear of “one man” who had lost office, hinting at Donald Trump.“Did you ever think that one man out of office could intimidate an entire party where they’re unwilling to take any vote contrary to what he thinks should be taken for fear of being defeated in a primary? I have had five Republican senators talk to me, bump into me, or sit with me, who’ve told me that they agree with whatever I’m talking about for them to do. ‘But, Joe, if I do it, I’m going to get defeated in a primary’”, he said.The president, who is battling unfavourable ratings, said he would do three things differently in the second year of office. “Number one, I am going to get out of this place more often. I’m going to go out and talk to the public… Number two, I am also going to be out there seeking the advice of experts outside, from academia, to editorial writers, to think tanks,” he said.“And the third thing I’m going to be doing is be deeply involved in these off-year elections. We’re going to be raising a lot of money. We’re going to be out there making sure that we’re helping all of those candidates,” Biden further said. He was referring to elections to the House of Representatives, and one-third of the seats in the Senate in November this year. The Democrats, at the moment, command a majority in the House, while the Senate is split 50:50. Observers believe that the outcome in the mid-terms will have a major impact on the remaining two years of the Biden presidency.

20-01-2022||World||In a first, Amazon to open fashion store where algorithms suggest what to try on||Amazon.com Inc's recipe for the department store of the future includes algorithmic recommendations and what one corporate director called "a magic closet" in the fitting room.The online retailer is making another push to grow its fashion business, announcing on Thursday it will open its first-ever apparel store this year, with a tech twist. "We wouldn't do anything in physical retail unless we felt we could significantly improve the customer experience," said Simoina Vasen, a managing director.At 30,000 square feet (2,787 sq meters), the planned "Amazon Style" shop near Los Angeles is smaller than the typical department store. Model items are on the racks, and customers scan a code using Amazon's mobile app to select the color and size they would like. To try on the clothes, which are stored in the back, shoppers enter a virtual queue for a fitting room that they unlock with their smartphone when it is ready.Inside, the dressing room is "a personal space for you to continue shopping without ever having to leave," Vasen said. Each has a touchscreen letting shoppers request more items that staff deliver to a secure, two-sided closet "within minutes," she said."It's like a magic closet with seemingly endless selection," Vasen said.The touchscreens suggest items to shoppers too. Amazon keeps a record of every good a customer scans so its algorithms personalize clothing recommendations. Shoppers can fill out a style survey as well. By the time they arrive in a fitting room, employees have already deposited customers' requested items and others that Amazon has picked.Shoppers can opt out with a concierge's help, Amazon said.Amazon has unveiled tech to help customers choose outfits before. The company has surpassed Walmart Inc as the most-shopped clothing retailer in the United States, according to analyst research.But it still has room to expand and compete with the likes of Macy's Inc and Nordstrom Inc, which have opened smaller-format stores. Amazon's lineup of physical grocery and convenience shops have yet to upend brick-and-mortar retail.The company's new store aims to attract a broad range of shoppers with hundreds of brands, Vasen said, declining to name examples.It has hundreds of associates, and no cashier-less checkout like some Amazon stores, Vasen said. Still, using a biometric system known as Amazon One, customers can pay with a swipe of their palm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-a-first-amazon-to-open-fashion-store-where-algorithms-suggest-what-to-try-on-101642681659916.html

20-01-2022||World||Not heavy viral load; studies say this is the reason why Omicron spreads so fast||The viral load of Omicron and Delta is almost the same and it is not the reason why Omicron rapidly surged across the world and became the dominant SARs-CoV-2 strain replacing Delta. According to Nature, two studies, yet to be peer-reviewed, have shown that the Omicron does not release a larger amount of viral load than Delta. It is spreading in lightning speed only because it is able to evade immunity -- either natural or generated by past vaccination.The results suggest that Omicron’s hyper-transmissibility does not stem from the release of large amounts of virus from infected people. Instead, the best explanation for its lightning-fast spread is its ability to evade SARS-CoV-2 immunity caused by either vaccination or past infection, Emily Bruce, a virologist at the University of Vermont in Burlington, said.What is viral load? It is the amount of the virus in an infected person. The RT-PCR test reveals the viral load. The CT value of the RT-PCR test report indicates the viral load, the lower the value, the higher the viral load is.To compare the viral loads, the researchers studied the PCR test results of the nose and throat swabs collected from infected individuals and found that those who had Delta had a slightly higher viral load than those who had Omicron. “I was really not expecting to see that,” Yonatan Grad, an infectious-disease specialist at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts, said.“Naturally, you’d think that higher transmissibility must cause a higher viral load,” Benjamin Meyer, a virologist at the University of Geneva in Switzerland, said.Since the identification of Omicron in South Africa on November 24, 2021, the latest variant of the virus has been spreading at an unprecedented speed and within two months, Omicron has become the dominant strain in the world, inviting a fresh surge of the pandemic.  According to many scientists, Omicron is an altogether different pandemic with patients showing different symptoms. Unlike Delta, Omicron is not affecting the lungs leading to a lower hospitalisation rate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-heavy-viral-load-studies-say-this-is-the-reason-why-omicron-spreads-so-fast-101642674095575.html

From now on, Govt is no longer asking people to work from home," he said.Johnson further said that the UK was the first nation in the world to administer a vaccine, and one of the fastest in Europe to roll it out."This was because we made the big call to pursue our own vaccine procurement, outside of the European Medicines Agency (EMA)," said Johnson."We made the tough decision to open up last summer when others said that we shouldn't, and kept open this winter while others locked down. As a result, we have the most open economy and society in Europe, and the fastest-growing economy in the G7," added Johnson.The UK PM also said that they are the first nation to emerge from the Omicron wave because it focused on NHS on delivering the fastest booster campaign in Europe."And it is because of the extraordinary booster campaign - together with the way the public has responded to the Plan B measures - that we can return to Plan A in England and allow Plan B regulations to expire," said Johnson.Plan B measures refer to legally enforced face masks, mandatory Covid passes, and advice to work from home.Johnson also said that his "government got the big things right". He said, "Confronted by the nation's biggest challenge since the Second World War and the worst pandemic since 1918, any government would get some things wrong."The move comes amid a peak in Covid-19 cases in the UK and his former chief adviser Dominic Cummings accusations that the British prime minister lied to the parliament that he thought a drinks party held in the Downing Street garden during the first lockdown was work-related."On 18 January 94,432 new cases and 438 deaths in 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK," tweeted UK Health Security Agency.A total of 52,133,611 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine, while 47,989,635 people have now received the second dose of a vaccine.Meanwhile, 36,546,583 people have received a booster dose, added UK Health Security Agency.The UK was the first country to raise alarm over Covid-19 mutations, to limit international travel over the Omicron variant, and in December introduced work-at-home advice, more mask-wearing and vaccine passes to slow its spread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-boris-johnson-rolls-back-covid-19-measures-including-mandatory-face-masks-vaccine-pass-101642671837226.html

Vouchers!" Chancellor Karl Nehammer told a news conference with the leader of the opposition Social Democrats, Pamela Rendi-Wagner, with whom the measure was negotiated.Nehammer said he wanted there to be a financial reward for those who get vaccinated, adding: "We have learned from the past and we have seen that a vaccination lottery is the best possible way to set up such a system."Members of the public, whether already vaccinated or not, would get a ticket for each shot they have had - three tickets in total for those who have had their booster shot.Every tenth ticket would win a 500 euro ($568) gift voucher, Nehammer said, without specifying what the vouchers were for.The lower house of parliament is due to pass a bill later on Thursday making vaccines compulsory for all adults in Austria, with initial fines of 600 euros, rising to up to 3,600 euros if the fine is challenged unsuccessfully.Austria will be the first European Union country to introduce a Covid vaccine mandate for all adults when the measure takes effect on February 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/austria-introduces-lottery-to-encourage-citizens-to-get-vaccinated-against-covid-101642669141302.html

The random trial involving 52 Canadian hospitals, and with 1,282 patients, had researchers studying the effects of Remdesivir in hospitalised patients with Covid-19 between August 14, 2020, and April 1, 2021.According to a release issued by CMAJ, the researchers found that among patients not receiving mechanical ventilation at the start of the study, the need for mechanical ventilation arose for 8% of those receiving Remdesivir compared with 15% of those receiving standard care. “In addition, patients treated with Remdesivir were able to come off oxygen and ventilators sooner than those receiving standard care,” the release said.It quoted the study’s authors, led by University of British Columbia’s Dr Srinivas Murthy, as saying, “The benefit of treatment was most apparent for preventing the need for mechanical ventilation, suggesting probable added value for patients with less severe disease to avoid progression during hospital stay.”“This may have important implications for patients and for health systems, particularly when ICU capacity, mechanical ventilation or oxygen is in limited supply,” they added.The trials were led by researchers at University of British Columbia and Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre.The research gains relevance as the number of persons infected with the Omicron variant of Covid-19 grows across the world, including in India and Canada. While infections from the variant are considered milder than those earlier, its rapid transmissibility has led to record number of cases being reported on a daily basis in Canada.Last week, Canada also cleared the use of the antiviral pill Paxlovid, manufactured by Pfizer, which is aimed at reducing hospitalisation amid the surge in cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/remdesivir-cuts-need-for-medical-ventilation-by-50-in-covid-patients-canadian-study-101642668329443.html

Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines are already in use in Australia. Johnson and Johnson’s Janssen vaccine is also approved but the government has not bought any.The Novavax vaccine will be available to unvaccinated Australians aged 18 years and older but will not be used as a booster for the 95% of the population aged 16 and older who have already received a vaccine.“There are some individuals, notwithstanding a massive take up of vaccination in this country, who have been waiting for Novavax, and it’s great that it’s finally been approved,” said chief regulator John Skerritt, head of the Therapeutic Goods Administration.“Our dream is we might turn our 95% into a 97 or 98% in this country,” Skerritt added.The protein-based vaccine is to be administered in two doses three weeks apart.Paul Griffin, associate professor of medicine at Queensland University, said Australia needed to strive to improve an already impressive vaccination rate.“For a variety of reasons, it seems some have remained reluctant to receive these vaccines thus far so an additional option, based on what is considered perhaps a more traditional platform, is likely to increase our vaccination rate even further,” Griffin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/novavax-becomes-australia-s-5th-approved-covid-19-vaccine-101642666851174.html
20-01-2022||World||What is behind the surge in Omicron cases in US? Report points to sewage water||The Omicron variant of Covid-19, which is the primary reason for the worsening pandemic situation in the United States, has set authorities thinking for how long this surge might last.According to a report by the New York Times, the omicron variant's surge is emerging from the unlikely source, the sewage.People who test positive for the coronavirus disease shed the virus in their stool, the report said, adding “the virus levels in local wastewater provide a strong, independent signal of how much is circulating in a given community.”The sewage data reveals an Omicron wave that is cresting at various times and locations.In Boston city, the surge in Covid-19 cases might have hit a peak amid a steep decline in viral signals in wastewater.Biobot Analytics, a Boston-based startup that monitors Covid-19 levels in sewage, said the virus concentration in the city’s wastewater samples is down over 50% from its recent peak.Apart from analysing Boston, Biobot Analytics is also tracking the virus in 183 communities across 25 states. The firm said that virus levels have already started to drop in many big cities. However, they are rising in smaller communities, according to the New York Times report.The drop of virus concentration in Boston's wastewater samples is the most dramatic to date, Biobot Analytics president and co-founder Newsha Ghaeli said last week.“We are pretty confident and hopeful that we have passed the peak of omicron infections,” Ghaeli told Bloomberg Radio on January 13 and added that hospitalisations might still surge “but there are better days ahead.”Citing wastewater data, Boston's mayor Michelle Wu said on January 13 that Omicron's peak may be past us soon.In the state of Florida, sewage data has indicated that the Omicron crisis in Miami-Dade County might soon peak, according to Bloomberg. On the other hand, in New York, people visiting emergency departments with Covid-like illness have dipped in all five boroughs.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that has been funding sewage surveillance in the US is now planning to add sewage surveillance to its daily Covid tracker on the internet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-is-behind-the-surge-in-omicron-cases-in-us-report-points-to-sewage-water-101642657526941.html

The airline had said it would try and switch to other aircraft for these routes.In total, airlines have cancelled more than 320 flights to and from the US by Wednesday evening following warnings from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) due to the rollout of high-speed wireless service interfering with aircraft technology that measures altitude, an Associated Press report said. This accounts for a little over 2 per cent of the US total, according to FlightAware."It is important to fully understand and reduce potential 5G signal interference with radio altimeters that are integral to aircraft security systems. We understand that the activation of these services is a part of India's select Coming soon in cities," the Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) expressed concern in a January 4 letter.The FIP also mentioned that if 5G deploys, pilots may face safety issues while operating flights.US telecom service providers AT&T and Verizon had announced that they would pause the 5G roll-out around key airports until the issue was fixed.US is not the first country to rollout 5G services and similar mobile networks have been deployed in more than three dozen countries. However, the US networks are designed in a certain way that raised concern of potential problems for airlines.Boeing Co. has in a statement assured that it would work with airlines, the FAA and others to ensure that all aircrafts can fly safely as 5G is rolled out in the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/5g-rollout-in-us-air-india-gets-technical-clearance-to-fly-boeing-777-aircraft-101642656884589.html

Its date of construction is given as around 1190.It sits in a rugged, inaccessible valley along the Harirud river, well off Afghanistan's tourist track even in the 1960s, when the country was a magnet for hardy Western travellers.Archeologists backed by UNESCO have tried previously to repair the minaret, but its remote location -- in the heart of territory controlled by the Taliban even before they took power in August -- meant security was always an issue.The last UNESCO mission to the site was in 2019 and at that time they said it faced no risk of collapse.Last year, agency head Audrey Azoulay called on the Taliban to help preserve Afghanistan's cultural heritage, including the minaret.Shortly before their first stint in power came to an end in 2001, the Taliban destroyed two giant centuries-old Buddha statues carved out of a cliff face in Bamiyan, sparking global outrage.They have promised a softer version of rule this time around, and Taliban fighters now guard what remains of the statues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/800yearold-afghan-minaret-in-danger-of-collapse-after-quakes-101642656886179.html
20-01-2022||World||Pakistan’s $7 billion ‘green’ city, Imran Khan's pet project, takes grim turn||After the British divided Pakistan and India more than seven decades ago, Suleman Mohammad Sajjad Warraich’s father received a section of land on the outskirts of Lahore. It was a place to put roots in the new nation. Later on, Warraich and his family filled their 300 collective acres with vegetable plots, marigold gardens, and guava groves.The property was supposed to pass through generations. But early last year Warraich was told that the government would be acquiring the land. He’d be compensated, and his farm turned into something other than agricultural land. That didn’t sit right with him, so he filed a petition opposing the acquisition.Warraich is among dozens of landowners petitioning against the government's plan to build a megacity from scratch on the banks of the Ravi river, a once-thriving waterway that’s been depleted by pollution and dwindling water levels. The $7-billion endeavor would span 46 kilometers (29 miles) and include housing, commercial areas, hospitals and schools — creating a metropolis that could ease pressure on overpopulated Lahore and support its urbanization.The Ravi Urban Development Authority, a government body created to manage the project, pitches it as a green initiative that will bring in much-needed resources to clean up the river. “The idea is to manage the area properly,” says RUDA’s Chief Executive Officer Imran Amin.RUDA aims to build a man-made channel and a series of barrages along the Ravi’s path to control its water level, which the authority says will help conserve what limited flow remains and restore Lahore’s supply of groundwater. But some opponents are skeptical of those claims and what they see as a land grab by RUDA. The city’s high court halted the project last year — one ruling in an ongoing legal fight for the future of the river that could reach Pakistan’s Supreme Court.“This is our property. We don’t want to sell it,” says Warraich, sitting on a white plastic armchair outside his farmhouse. “They are acquiring our land for a new city” where local residents won’t be able to continue farming, he says. “I don’t understand this logic.”Pakistan’s leaders have been trying to develop the banks of the Ravi for almost a decade and Prime Minister Imran Khan has made the task a priority.The Ravi river was instrumental to Lahore’s development, but today large pockets sit stagnant while other sections have dried up completely. A water-sharing treaty with India has limited its flow, while Pakistan’s own mismanagement has exacerbated the problem. For decades, the river has collected untreated sewage from Lahore, as well as industrial and agricultural waste.In recent years, Pakistan has developed legislation to regulate water use amid warnings that the country will face water scarcity by 2025. According to a government study last year, only 39% of water sources across 29 cities were safe for drinking. Cleaning up the Ravi could help Pakistan forestall an impending water crisis — its basin is home to some 50 million people and the river irrigates about 7 million acres of land.These short-term solutions, however, will run up against the climate clock. Most of Pakistan's rivers are fed by melting snow from glaciers in the Himalayas, which are set to shrink as the world heats up. As global average temperatures rise beyond 2 degrees Celsius — a highly likely scenario based on current trajectories — the volume of Himalayan glaciers will be halved.Global warming is set to increase precipitation across Pakistan, but climate models show the seasonality and intensity of those rains will become less predictable. That's bad news for farmers given the vast majority of crops grown in Pakistan are dependent on reliable monsoon patterns. Though agriculture provides less than 20% of the country's gross domestic product, it employs 40% of its labor force.Pakistan isn’t the first country to try and solve its environmental issues with more development. Governments have plowed billions of dollars into eco-city initiatives everywhere from Malaysia to Iceland to simultaneously boost economic growth and adapt to a warming planet. The projects are marked by common features including more efficient public transport, green spaces and wastewater treatment systems.RUDA says that Ravi City will follow the same mold and become a sister city to Lahore, helping to control its urban sprawl while reviving the river. A 2017 census put the population of Pakistan’s second-biggest city at 11 million, though unofficial estimates say it’s grown to about 13 million since. RUDA will take “all the proceeds from this zone which you are developing and put it in the water channelization, barrages and the wastewater treatment plants,” says Amin.Pakistan has had some success with planned cities. Its capital, Islamabad, shares a larger metropolitan area with neighboring Rawalpindi — the way RUDA says it envisions its city relating to Lahore. The grid structure of Islamabad is drastically different from other Pakistani cities; traffic and pollution are better and the city feels orderly in a way Lahore does not.But critics worry that the new city, which RUDA says will take 12 to 15 years to build, will replicate Lahore’s problems instead of fixing them — especially its inequality. They also say the government’s focus on building a new city could lead to further neglect in parts of Lahore. As the city boomed, it has stretched west toward the Ravi, spawning packed settlements around the river. The area’s population density contrasts starkly with growing wealth at the other end of the city, where single-family houses built on large lots in private communities extend far enough to almost kiss the border with India.Lower-income residents in Lahore bear the brunt of the city’s environmental woes, living in areas with dirty water and bad air. Meanwhile, wealthier residents are protected in housing developments that operate like private businesses with separate water supplies. “It’s a very sad reflection of what has happened to our city because it has been totally commercialized,” says Fauzia Qureshi, an architect and urban planner.The question for residents like Warraich who are being pressured to give up their land is whether the potential improvements and compensation will be worth it.To create the proposed city, RUDA would sell land to developers, who would build on it under the government’s supervision. Opponents argue that the promised environmental benefits of Ravi City are being used to justify the government’s exercise of “eminent domain” — giving it the right to claim private property for public use — on land they fear will actually be used by private developers for commercial purposes. RUDA’s official land-use master plan sets aside space for a high-rise residential zone, business district, and area that will be called Sports City.“There won’t be any forced acquisition,” says Amin from RUDA. “Unless it’s important where it’s [a] wastewater treatment plant or something which is necessary to be placed there and we will try our best” to give current residents “a fair market price.”According to Section 45 of the Ravi Urban Development Authority Act, which outlines RUDA’s powers and functions, the authority may “use such force as may be necessary” to “eject any person in unauthorized occupation of any land or property vested in the Authority.” The document also gives RUDA power “to remove, demolish or alter” any building or structure as needed to realize development plans.There’s no guarantee that those plans will help restore the Ravi.Raising the river’s levels by creating a channel and barrages will have “almost no impact” on Lahore’s groundwater levels, says Vaqar Zakaria, an environmental consultant. The city’s water table will keep being depleted unless groundwater usage by housing developers and factories is regulated, he says, something that isn’t addressed in RUDA’s proposal. “Those who are bigger and richer can bore and get the water from the ground and a poor man can’t afford to do that,” Zakaria says. Ravi City “is going to benefit a small number of people, and it's not going to add value to the average citizen.”Environmentalists have also cast doubt on the other green pillar of the Ravi City plan: Lahore’s first wastewater treatment plant.Untreated sewage flows into the Ravi from multiple points, and treating discharge from one area near the Ravi won’t fix the river’s water quality as a whole, says Ahmad Rafay Alam, a lawyer and environmental activist. “Nobody upstream changes their habits and you end up subsidizing pollution.”Amin argues that housing developments are already being built in Lahore without environmental approval. If the area near the Ravi isn’t acquired by RUDA, it would be snapped up by developers who operate with far less oversight. At least, he says, “we make sure that it is planned according to the green standards.”The case against development along the Ravi has been taken up by public interest litigators and lawyers representing landowners. They argue an environmental study RUDA presented in court was inadequate, and that the authority has failed to explain in detail what exactly the 100,000 acres of acquired land will become. Lawyers say a land-use master plan was only submitted in court last month.Advocates also challenge the establishment of the Ravi River Development Authority, whose sweeping control they say is unconstitutional. The way the project is progressing is “unprecedented,” says Waqar Sheikh, a lawyer who argues that RUDA’s development plan doesn’t legally justify government acquisition of land.Sheikh argues that it isn’t in the public interest to get rid of agricultural land since Pakistan already struggles with food shortages. Seventy-five percent of the Ravi river basin is used for agriculture, according to a study by the Asian Development Bank, and a large percentage of the city’s vegetables and dairy supply comes from areas along the Ravi.RUDA now awaits a judgment from the Lahore High Court. If the project doesn’t get permission to go ahead, the authority will likely appeal the decision, sending the case to the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, some farmers have agreed to sell their land after negotiating better payments with RUDA.Malik Ghulam Murtaza, a 56-year-old landowner, says he started to see the development more positively after compensation talks with RUDA. He believes the price he was offered will be enough to give his family a better life and he’s convinced the environmental plans will benefit everyone.Others are still adamantly opposed. Haji Abdul Ghani, 56, is most upset about giving up cultivatable land, which he worries will be harder to come by. “This is all agricultural land, and will be lost forever,” he says. “If you really want to expand, look for barren land where the fertility of the soil doesn’t matter.”Sitting near their house perched precariously near the river, Karamat Jutt, 26, and his family say they’ve already lost much of their land to floods last summer that destroyed an entire settlement. They know the volatility of the river and changing climate could make things worse, but, for now, their bigger concern is losing their livelihoods to development.Warraich remains suspicious of RUDA. He says the agency labeled parts of his family’s land barren, despite it being viable for farming, and offered less than what he believes the land is worth. Even if more money was offered, Warraich says he wouldn’t sell because of the many tenant farmers and workers who rely on their land for subsistence. “Without justice there is no community,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistans-7-billion-green-city-imran-khan-s-pet-project-takes-grim-turn-101642654953152.html

This is the most significant advancement of an idea the country's leaders have been toying with for years.The new state capital law, which provides a legal framework for President Joko Widodo's ambitious $32 billion mega project, also stipulates how development of the capital will be funded and governed."The new capital has a central function and is a symbol of the identity of the nation, as well as a new centre of economic gravity," Planning Minister Suharso Monoarfa told parliament after the bill was passed into law.Why is Indonesia moving the capital from Jakarta?The plan was formulated as Jakarta is prone to flooding amid climate change. The sinking megacity also suffers from chronic congestion and air pollution.Monoarfa said that the relocation of the capital city to Nusantara is based on several considerations, regional advantages, and welfare and with a vision of the birth of a new economic centre of gravity in the middle of the archipelago.President Joko Widodo first announced the capital would be relocated in 2019, but the move was delayed due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.How fast is Jakarta sinking?Jakarta sits on the swampy ground near the sea - making it especially prone to flooding - and is one of the fastest-sinking cities on Earth, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF). It has been dropping into the Java Sea at an alarming rate due to the over-extraction of groundwater.Jakarta is also one of the world's most overpopulated urban regions. It is home to more than 10 million people, with an estimated 30 million in the greater metropolitan area, according to the United Nations.About NusantaraThe name of the new city has been chosen by Widodo. It is a Javanese term which translates to "archipelago" in the Indonesian language. It is located within the jungle of Kalimantan on Borneo island.According to data from the National Planning and Development Agency, the total land area for the new capital city will be around 256,143 hectares (around 2,561 square kilometres) - almost all of it converted from the forest area.Indonesia owns the majority of Borneo, the world's third-largest island, with Malaysia and Brunei each holding parts of its northern region.The initial relocation will start from between 2022 and 2024.Nusantara would follow in the footsteps of new capitals in other countries, notably Brazil and Myanmar.It will strengthen supply chains and place Indonesia "in a more strategic position in world trade routes, investment flows, and technological innovation," the government said in a statement.The new capital has been dubbed by the government as a low-carbon "super hub" that will support pharmaceutical, health and technology sectors and promote sustainable growth beyond Java Island.Nusantara will be led by a chief authority whose position is equivalent to a minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-replaces-sinking-jakarta-with-new-capital-city-nusantara-details-here-101642653954758.html

Titled ‘The overlooked pandemic of antimicrobial resistance’, it highlights the growing threat of superbugs.The study has been carried out by researchers from the University of Washington and University of Oxford. They said that anti-microbial resistance (AMR) killed as many people as HIV (680,000) and malaria (627,000) combined.The researchers further said that these superbugs were a potential factor in five million global deaths in the year 2019.In comparison, the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) killed 3.5 million people last year.The figure of 1.2 million fatalities is much higher than the estimates released by the World Health Organization (WHO), which said that 700,000 people died from drug-resistant infection.The study published in The Lancet further called for urgent action to stop the death toll from AMR going up further.What are superbugs?These are pathogens which are resistant to multiple antimicrobial drugs, thus making it harder to treat. Patients infected with any of these bugs often have to be treated with last line drugs, which are both expensive and toxic. And many of them succumb.A 2018 study, carried out in 10 Fortis Group hospitals in India, found that patients with multidrug resistant infections were almost thrice as likely to die as those with susceptible ones.What the study saysAccording to the research published in The Lancet, the toll taken by AMR on patients and their families is largely invisible but is reflected in prolonged bacterial infections that extend hospital stays and cause needless deaths.Moreover, AMR disproportionately affects poor individuals who have little access to second-line, more expensive antibiotics that could work when first-line drugs fail, it further said.Discovered in the 1920s, antibiotics have saved tens of millions of lives by defeating bacterial diseases such as pneumonia, tuberculosis and meningitis.But over the decades, bacteria have learned to fight back, building resistance to the same drugs that once reliably vanquished them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antibiotic-resistant-superbugs-killed-1-2-million-people-in-2019-claims-study-101642649289598.html
20-01-2022||World||Covid-19 deaths much higher than official figures, claims report||Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in late 2019, more than 55 million people have lost their lives due to the viral disease, according to official figures. But a new research published in Nature has claimed that the actual toll count could be many times higher.There has been an ongoing debate about whether countries hide their actual Covid-19 death toll to protect their image on the global platform.The report published in Nature takes into account a machine learning approach used by The Economist magazine in London. It found some issues with the collection of data and claimed the actual fatalities could be two and four times more than the official Covid-19 data.The report in Nature cited examples of how countries around the world have been reporting the victims of Covid-19. It said that in the Netherlands, the government, during the early stages of the pandemic, only counted those patients who died in the hospital after getting infected.On the other hand, Belgium included deaths caused by severe cold and as Covid-19 fatalities, without testing the patients, the report said.The report said that the death toll remained high in rich countries and low in poor countries. But an analysis of the World Mortality Dataset (WMD) of 116 countries said that poorer countries recorded fewer deaths, it further said.According to data modelling, the actual Covid-19 deaths in wealthy countries may be as high as a third of the current figures. In poor countries, meanwhile, the actual fatalities can be up to 20 times higher than the current figures.The report said that the WHO may soon release its first assessment regarding the deaths. It has taken the opinion of several experts to conclude that in order to estimate the actual Covid-19 fatalities, the deaths that happened five years before the pandemic will have to be compared with the current period.The report also stated that Covid-19 pandemic is the largest after the Spanish flu that spread during 1918-20.Going as per the WMD model, Russia saw more than 300,000 patients succumbing to Covid-19 by the end of 2021. However, excess deaths are likely to have crossed one million in that period.More than 100 countries, including China, India, and several in Africa, lack excess-death estimates in the WMD. This is due to either their governments not collecting the death figures or publishing them speedily, the Nature report said.However, these countries also account for millions of deaths due to Covid-19.India, which was severely hit during the second wave of Covid-19 last year, has reported more than 487,000 deaths since the onset of the pandemic. But, the aforementioned model adopted by the Economist estimated around five million deaths in the country.Similarly in China, which is the epicentre of Covid-19, the Economist’s model has estimated over 750,000 deaths in total which is 150 times more than the official data at 4,600.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-deaths-much-higher-than-official-figures-claims-report-101642644577295.html
20-01-2022||World||Scientists develop Covid diagnosis test using X-rays, say it's 98% accurate||A group of scientists in Scotland has found a way to detect the presence of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) infection in a person using X-rays. The diagnosis test uses artificial intelligence (AI) to predict the presence of the virus inside a person.The scientists from University of West Scotland (UWS), who developed the test, claim it is 98 per cent effective.Also Read | Why symptom link is key to OmicronThey also said that it will be faster than the PCR test, which takes to hours to return a result.“There has long been a need for a quick and reliable tool that can detect Covid-19, and this has become even more true with the upswing of the Omicron variant,” said Professor Naeem Ramzan, who led the three-person team at the UWS.How the test works?According to UWS researchers, the new technique utilises X-ray technology to compare scans to a database of around 3,000 images, belonging to patients with Covid-19, healthy individuals and those with viral pneumonia.An AI process, known as the deep convolutional neural network, then uses an algorithm to analyse visual imagery and make a diagnosis. During an extensive testing phase, the technique proved to be more than 98 per cent accurate, said UWS scientists.What is the utility of the new testing technique?Professor Ramzan said that there are many countries are unable to carry out large numbers of Covid tests because of limited diagnosis tools. Their research utilises easily accessible technology to quickly detect the virus.“It could prove to be crucial, and potentially life-saving, when diagnosing severe cases of the virus, helping determine what treatment may be required,” said the professor.He, however, acknowledged that Covid-19 symptoms are not visible in X-rays during the early stages of infection so it cannot fully replace the PCR tests.Also Read | Endemic Covid would not mean end of danger, says WHOProfessor Milan Radosavljevic, Vice-Principal of Research, Innovation and Engagement at UWS and another member of the team said they now plan to expand the study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-develop-covid-diagnosis-test-using-x-rays-say-it-s-98-accurate-101642645045854.html

20-01-2022||World||Ukraine crisis: What Russia is demanding and how the West has responded?||The concentration of Russian forces along the Ukrainian border has concerned the West, in particular the United States, which has warned of "swift, severe, and united response". Western intelligence officials say that Russia has amassed 100,000 troops on the eastern side of the former Soviet republic.They fear another invasion by Russia, on the lines of Crimea in 2014. Numerous rounds of talks have been held between the West and Moscow, but the Russian troops remain in the area.Watch: Why US fears Putin could invade UkraineRussia has, however, said that the fears of the West are unfounded and it doesn’t plan to start a war. But the West is keenly watching what Russian President Vladimir Putin’s next move will be.What triggered the crisis?Ukraine shares its border with Russia and the European Union (EU) countries. It has deep cultural ties with Russia and Russian is widely spoken there.Russia has expressed its displeasure over Ukraine’s increasing move towards the European institutions and wants it shouldn’t join the Nato. The demand has been rejected by the Western alliance, which comprises of the United States, EU countries and Nato allies.The deposing of Ukraine’s pre-Russia president in 2014 sent the alarm bells ringing in Moscow, which moved in and annexed Ukraine’s southern peninsula Crimea. It also backed separatists who them captured large parts of Ukraine’s eastern region. More than 14,000 people have been killed in nearly eight years of fighting there.Is the threat of war real?The West says yes. It has held several rounds of negotiations with Russian officials, Putin has also spoken to US President Joe Biden, but the troops remain along the Ukrainian border. Officials in the US have said that Russia has offered no proof that it will not invade.After the recent talks with his US counterparts in Geneva, Russian foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov assured that there are “no plans or intentions to attack Ukraine”.But Putin’s recent statements about “appropriate retaliatory military-technical measures” against West’s “aggressive approach” has worried officials. At a press conference on Wednesday, marking his first year in office, Biden said he thinks Putin will “move in” on Ukraine although he suggested a full-scale invasion may not be in the Russian leader’s plans.Moreover, there are reports that Russia has provided passports to 500,000 people in the rebel-held areas in Ukraine. This, many political observers say, is a tactic adopted by Kremlin to protect its ‘citizens’ if its demands are not met.Then there are war games held by Russia closer to Ukraine to prepare its troops. On Tuesday, reports emerged that Russia is a sending an unspecified number of troops from the country’s far east to Belarus for major war games in February. White House press secretary Jen Psaki described the Russian forces' move into Belarus as part of as “extremely dangerous situation.”What is Russia demanding?Russia has denied an intention to attack its neighbour but demanded guarantees from the West that Nato will not expand to Ukraine or other ex-Soviet nations or place its troops and weapons there. It has also asked Western countries to not adopt “aggressive” approach and abandon military activity in Eastern Europe.What this means that Nato countries will have to pull out their combat units from Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.Washington and its Nato allies have rejected Moscow’s demands.Moscow has also accused Nato countries of flooding Ukraine with weapons and the US of stoking tensions. In his remarks to military officials last month, Putin had said that Russia has nowhere further to retreat to. “Do they think we’ll just watch idly?”The West’s responseIn his Wednesday’s address, Biden said that the US and its European allies are united on making sure Russia would face “severe economic consequences” if Putin attacks. But the US President acknowledged it would be crucial, and potentially difficult, to keep Nato united on the response to any attack on Ukraine.The UK said it is supplying Ukraine with short-range anti-tank missiles for self-defence in the wake of Russia’s belligerence. Fearing an attack from Russia, Sweden recently moved hundreds of troops over strategically important Gotland Island. Denmark too adopted a similar approach a few days ago, strengthening its presence in the region.Visiting Kyiv in a show of support, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday that Russia could launch a new attack on Ukraine at "very short notice" but Washington would pursue diplomacy as long as it could.Meanwhile, Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said it is upto Ukraine to decide when it is ready to join the alliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ukraine-crisis-what-russia-is-demanding-and-how-the-west-has-responded-101642639499413.html
20-01-2022||World||Japan, France to hold talks amid China's growing assertiveness in Indo-Pacific||Amid China's growing assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region, the foreign and defense ministers of Japan and France will hold security talks virtually on Thursday.The Indo-Pacific region, where China's rise has stoked concern among many countries, is expected to top the agenda for the talks between both sides, Kyodo News reported.Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi on Tuesday said that the two countries share fundamental values and strategic interests and will promote their security collaboration during the online "two-plus-two" meeting, after the French Defense Ministry announced its schedule on Monday.Hayashi said that he and Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi will discuss a variety of topics including recent regional affairs in the first such talks since January 2019 with their respective French counterparts Jean-Yves Le Drian and Florence Parly, the Japanese news agency reported.The countries had initially planned to hold an in-person two-plus-two meeting in Japan by the end of 2021 but put it off due to the coronavirus pandemic, lately fueled by the rapid spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant. They have generally taken turns hosting such talks since their first session in 2014.Japan has been boosting defense cooperation with European countries, including Britain and Germany, as China increasingly flexes its military muscle and steps up its territorial claims in the Indo-Pacific region, Kyodo News reported.It further reported that France, which has overseas territories in the region such as New Caledonia, released its Indo-Pacific strategy in 2018 to promote a stable and rules-based order.Meanwhile, French troops last year for the first time carried out joint exercises with Japan's Ground Self-Defense Force and the United States on Japanese soil aimed at defending remote islands.France is hoping to launch talks with Japan on a defense cooperation agreement to allow the easing of restrictions on the transportation of weapons and supplies for joint training and disaster relief operations, Kyodo News reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-france-to-hold-talks-amid-china-s-growing-assertiveness-in-indopacific-101642637095585.html
20-01-2022||World||Supreme Court rejects Donald Trump bid to block Capitol attack document release||The Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected a bid by former president Donald Trump to block the release to a congressional committee of documents related to the January 6 attack on the US Capitol.Trump, citing executive privilege, had sought to prevent the documents held by the National Archives from being given to the committee investigating the assault on Congress by Trump supporters.Trump, who has been accused of fomenting the assault on the Capitol, had asked the nation's highest court to stay a ruling this month by a federal appeals court which rejected his attempt to keep the documents and records secret.But the Supreme Court, in an 8-1 vote, refused to issue a stay and upheld the appeals court ruling.Justice Clarence Thomas, a conservative, was the only justice in favor of issuing a stay.Trump had sought to exercise his privilege as a former president to keep under wraps White House records and communications that might relate to the attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/supreme-court-rejects-donald-trump-bid-to-block-capitol-attack-document-release-101642636645887.html
20-01-2022||World||North Korea hints at resuming nuclear, ICBM tests||Accusing the United States of hostility and threats, North Korea on Thursday said it will consider restarting “all temporally-suspended activities” it had paused during its diplomacy with the Trump administration, in an apparent threat to resume testing of nuclear explosives and long-range missiles.North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency said leader Kim Jong Un presided over a Politburo meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party where officials set policy goals for “immediately bolstering” the North’s military capabilities to counter the Americans’ “hostile moves.” Officials gave “instructions to “reconsider in an overall scale the trust-building measures that we took on our own initiative … and to promptly examine the issue of restarting all temporally-suspended activities,” the KCNA said.The North’s Foreign Ministry had already warned of stronger and more explicit action after the Biden administration last week imposed fresh sanctions over the North’s continued missile testing activity.Kim unilaterally suspended his nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests in 2018 as he initiated diplomacy with then-President Donald Trump in an attempt to leverage his nukes for badly needed economic benefits. But negotiations have stalled since the collapse of their second meeting in 2019, when the Americans rejected North Korea’s demand for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities.The North has been ramping of its weapons demonstrations in recent months, including four rounds of missile launches just this month, as Kim revives Pyongyang’s old playbook of brinkmanship to extract concessions from Washington and neighbors as he grapples with an economy decaying under pandemic-related difficulties and crippling U.S.-led sanctions over his nuclear ambitions.Last week, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on five North Koreans over their roles in obtaining equipment and technology for the North’s missile programs, in its response to North Korea’s earlier tests this month.The State Department ordered sanctions against another North Korean, a Russian man and a Russian company for their broader support of North Korea’s weapons of mass destruction activities. The Biden administration also said it would pursue additional U.N. sanctions over the North’s continued tests.The announcement of the sanctions just came hours after North Korean state media said Kim oversaw a successful test of a hypersonic missile last Tuesday, the country’s second test of the purported system in a week, and claimed that the weapon would greatly increase the country’s “war deterrent.”The North tested fired short-range ballistic missiles on Friday and Monday in an apparent reprisal against the U.S. sanctions, which came after its Foreign Ministry warned of “stronger and certain reaction” if Washington maintains its confrontational stance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-hints-at-resuming-nuclear-icbm-tests-101642635579411.html
20-01-2022||World||Biden expects Russia to ‘move in’ on Ukraine, warns Putin again||President Joe Biden said he thinks Vladimir Putin will “move in” on Ukraine after amassing more than 100,000 troops on the nation’s border, although he suggested a full-scale invasion may not be in the Russian leader’s plans. “I’m not so sure he has, is certain, about what he’s going to do,” Biden said at a news conference Wednesday marking his first year in office. “My guess is he will move in, he has to do something.”Pressed on whether that means he has determined Putin is definitely going to attack, Biden said “that decision is completely, totally, solely Putin’s decision,” later adding “I don’t know whether he’s decided if he wants to do that or not.” Biden said the US and its European allies are united on making sure Russia would face “severe economic consequences” if Putin attacks, though he signaled that something less than a full-blown invasion might prompt disagreements.“I think what you’re going to see is that Russia will be held accountable if it invades,” Biden said. “And it depends on what it does. It’s one thing if it’s a minor incursion and we end up having to fight about what to do and not do.”If Putin chooses to continue or ramp up cyber attacks on Ukraine, Biden said, “we can respond the same way, with cyber.” While top US officials have stepped up their warnings about Putin’s possible intentions -- and Russian officials continue to say they don’t plan to invade -- the remarks by Biden were the starkest yet about the crisis on the border. He said a major attack would prompt a devastating economic response. “If they actually do what they’re capable of doing it is going to be a disaster for Russia,” Pressed on whether sanctions are an effective tool against Putin, Biden said “he’s never seen sanctions like the ones I’ve promised will be imposed if he moves.”NATO’s ‘Differences’But Biden acknowledged it would be crucial, and potentially difficult, to keep NATO united on the response to any attack on Ukraine. “That’s what I’m spending a lot of time doing,” Biden said. “And there are differences in NATO as to what countries are willing to do, depending on what happens, the degree to which they’re able to go.”Those remarks come amid signs that European nations aren’t on the same page when it comes to the package of sanctions that would hit Moscow following an attack. Some European governments have expressed anxiety that hitting Russia hard could damage their own economies, or perhaps spur Putin to cut off essential gas supplies to them. And because the bulk of any European Union-wide response would have to be agreed to by all 27 member states, several governments are keen to avoid a group-wide debate for now, fearing it would advertise potential differences.In Kyiv on Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said diplomacy is still the best path out of the current crisis. Previewing his planned meeting Friday in Geneva with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Blinken said, “We need to see where we are and see if there remain opportunities to pursue the diplomacy and pursue the dialog.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-expects-russia-to-move-in-on-ukraine-warns-putin-again-101642631642694.html
20-01-2022||World||Biden hails 'enormous progress' in first year despite pandemic||A defiant President Joe Biden acknowledged missteps over the still-raging pandemic Wednesday but hailed a year of "enormous progress" on the US economy as he took stock of his first year in office.In a rare news conference marking his first 12 months, Biden touted a period of unprecedented job creation, infrastructure improvements and a growing economy that he said would help counter inflation and supply chain woes plaguing his presidency."It's been a year of challenges," Biden told reporters in the ornate East Room of the White House, saying he "didn't anticipate" the level of obstruction he has encountered from Republicans in Congress."But it has also been a year of enormous progress," the US leader said."We went from two million people being vaccinated at the moment I was sworn in to 210 million Americans being fully vaccinated today. We created six million new jobs -- more jobs in one year than any time before."It was Biden's first news conference of the year -- and the first formal such event at all since November.Biden was set to face questions on everything from the confrontation with Russia over Ukraine and North Korea's missile tests to US inflation, Covid-19 and what he calls a threat to democracy from his predecessor Donald Trump.The press conference was at the core of an intense new effort by the White House to spin the calamitous last few weeks into a new narrative focusing on what officials say are Biden's many, if overlooked, gains during his first year in the Oval Office.It came as a new Gallup poll showed Biden with just 40 percent approval, down from 57 percent when he started. Since World War II, only Trump's first year averages were lower, Gallup said.Biden's press secretary, Jen Psaki said he has made "a lot of progress" in "incredibly difficult circumstances, fighting a pandemic, a massive economic downturn."The White House points out that in the last year, unemployment fell to 3.9 percent from 6.4 percent at the height of pandemic fallout on the economy and that mass vaccination has been a success, with 74 percent of adults now fully vaccinated.However, Biden has faced a string of recent setbacks, including the highest inflation in decades and the Supreme Court striking down the administration's vaccine mandate for large businesses.The inability of Democrats to use their razor-thin majority in Congress to pass another top Biden priority -- voting law reforms that he says are needed to protect US democracy -- was highlighted Wednesday as the Senate moved to almost certain defeat for two bills.Republican comeback? Biden's press conference came on the eve of the anniversary of his January 20th inauguration, which took place in the extraordinary circumstances of a pandemic and the aftermath of a violent assault by Trump supporters on Congress to try and overturn Biden's victory.Now, with a State of the Union speech to Congress set for March 1, Biden faces the rapidly approaching likelihood of a Republican comeback in midterm congressional elections this November.Republicans are forecast to crush his party and take control of the legislature. That risks bringing two years of complete obstruction from Congress, likely including threats of impeachment and a slew of aggressive committee probes.Trump, who continues to perpetuate the lie that he beat Biden in 2020 and seeks to undermine Americans' faith in their election system, is eyeing a possible attempt at another run at the White House in 2024.Biden's team hopes that good news will gradually outweigh the pandemic-related gloom, with the economy continuing to rebound, the Omicron coronavirus variant tailing off, and Americans taking notice of achievements, like massive spending on infrastructure.As White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain told Politico: "President Biden was elected to a four-year term, not a one-year term."While Biden does frequently interact with journalists in short, often-hurried question-and-answer sessions at the White House, his lack of full press conferences has raised eyebrows. Wednesday's event was only the second held at the White House since he took office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-hails-enormous-progress-in-first-year-despite-pandemic-101642627870073.html
20-01-2022||World||5G launches in US without huge impact on flights||Telecom giants AT&T and Verizon began 5G service in the United States Wednesday without major disruptions to flights after the launch of the new wireless technology was scaled back.A handful of international carriers removed flights to the United States from their schedules Wednesday, but there were not mass cancelations and some of those companies planned to resume service on Thursday.At 1630 GMT Wednesday, about 215 flights either planned to depart or land in US airports were canceled, according to the website FlightAware. That figure is less than the 538 reported last Wednesday, although the number could climb throughout the day.Airlines that had cut flights for Wednesday included Emirates, Air India, ANA and Japan Airlines.Also read | Explained: Why major airlines suffered disruptions due to US 5G 'nightmare'Both ANA and Japan Airlines said they were restoring service on Thursday after assurances from regulators at the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)."As the launch of the 5G service in the US has now been partially postponed, operation of ANA flights from Jan. 20 will follow the normal schedule based on FAA notification that there is no safety issue with the operation of Boeing 777 aircraft to the US airports that we serve," said a statement from ANA President Yuji Hirako.Telecom giants spent tens of billions of dollars to obtain 5G licenses last year but aviation industry groups have raised concerns about possible interference with airplanes' radio altimeters -- which can operate at the same frequencies -- particularly in bad weather.On Tuesday, both AT&T and Verizon agreed to scale back the launch of 5G near airports following an outcry from US airlines, who warned of mass disruptions.AT&T said Wednesday its high-speed service was available in "limited parts" of eight major metropolitan areas across the United States, while Verizon said it now provides 5G coverage to 90 million Americans.Hans Vestberg told CNBC that he was confident the issues with the airline industry would be "cleared out" following collaboration with "all involved parties, including the White House."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/5g-launches-in-us-without-huge-impact-on-flights-101642622900769.html
20-01-2022||World||US senior diplomats in Sudan to try resolve post-coup crisis||Two senior US diplomats were in Sudan Wednesday to try to find a way out of the crisis roiling the African country since an October military coup. An Israeli delegation meanwhile met with Sudan’s ruling generals to consolidate newly established ties between their countries.The October 25 military takeover has upended Sudan’s transition to democratic rule after three decades of repression and international isolation under autocratic President Omar al-Bashir, ousted during a popular uprising in April 2019.US Assistant Secretary of State Molly Phee and the newly appointed US special envoy for the Horn of Africa, David Satterfield, first met with pro-democracy activists from the Sudanese Professionals Association, according to the US Embassy in Khartoum.The activists led the uprising against al-Bashir and are now a pillar of anti-coup protests that have demanded a fully civilian government to lead the transition. The diplomats also met with another group, the Forces for the Declaration of Freedom and Change, on “their positive engagement” with UN efforts to end the deadlock, the embassy said. They were expected to meet with the ruling generals later Wednesday.US State Department spokesman Ned Price said earlier this week that Phee and Satterfield would reiterate Washington's call for Sudanese security forces to “end violence and respect freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.”Before arriving in Khartoum, the two attended a meeting of the Friends of Sudan group in Saudi Arabia to rally support for UN efforts to end Sudan’s deadlock. The group includes the United States, Britain and other international governments and world financial institutions.Sudan’s turmoil has been worsened following the resignation of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok earlier this month. Hamdok, who was ousted in the October coup only to be reinstated a month later under heavy international pressure, stepped down on Jan. 2 after his efforts to reach a compromise failed.The Sudan Doctors Committee, also part of the pro-democracy alliance, said one protester was shot and killed Wednesday as security forces removed makeshift barricades in Khartoum’s twin city of Omdurman.The barricades were part of a two-day civil disobedience campaign the pro-democracy movement had called for following a deadly crackdown on Monday when security forces opened fire on anti-coup protests in Khartoum, killing at least seven people. Wednesday’s fatality brings the death toll among the protesters since the coup to 72.Also Wednesday, an Israeli delegation met with top Sudanese military officials in Khartoum, according to a Sudanese military official and Israeli reports.The Sudanese official said the delegation, including officials from the Mossad spy agency, met with Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, the coup leader and head of the ruling Sovereign Council, and other military officials. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters.The Israeli public TV station Kan also reported the visit and said the plane carrying the Israeli delegation made a brief stop in Egypt’s Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh before heading to the Sudanese capital. Israel maintains close security ties with Egypt, the first Arab country to strike peace with Israel.Sudan normalized ties with Israel in 2020 as part of a series of US-brokered deals between Israel and four Arab countries. The agreement paved the way for the African country to reintegrate into the international community after two decades of isolation under al-Bashir.Israel has been silent on the October coup and its aftermath, indicating it intends to maintain normalized ties with Sudan, which formerly was a top critic of Israel in the Arab world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senior-diplomats-in-sudan-to-try-resolve-post-coup-crisis-101642621043798.html
20-01-2022||World||UK lifts Covid-19 restrictions, says Omicron wave 'has peaked'||Face masks will no longer be mandatory in public places and Covid-19 passports will be dropped for large events as infections level off in most parts of the country, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Wednesday.Johnson told lawmakers that the restrictions were being eased because government scientists think it is likely that the surge of infections prompted by the highly contagious omicron variant “has now peaked nationally.”While hospitals in northern England still are getting pressed by high caseloads and infections were still rising in schools, Johnson said hospital admissions and patients in intensive care units elsewhere in England were stabilizing or falling.The government is no longer advising people to work from home, and compulsory face masks will be scrapped in secondary school classrooms starting Thursday.Mandatory Covid-19 passes will not be needed to gain entry to large-scale events beginning January 27. Face masks will no longer be legally required anywhere in England as of that day.“We will trust the judgment of the British people and no longer criminalize anyone who chooses not to wear one,” Johnson said.The restrictions were introduced in December to slow the rapid spread of the omicron variant and buy time for the population to get their booster vaccine shot.Johnson said Wednesday that more than 90% of those over age 60 in the UK have had booster shots.Official figures showed that Covid-19 infections have dropped in most parts of the UK for the first time since early December. The government reported 108,069 new cases on Wednesday, about half the daily number recorded over the holidays.The requirement for those infected to self-isolate for five full days remains, but Johnson said that measure will also end in the coming weeks. He said while the self-isolation rule expires on March 24, he will seek to scrap it earlier if the virus data continues to improve.Johnson and Health Secretary Sajid Javid both suggested that the government is planning for a post-pandemic period when it can treat Covid-19 more like the flu.“There will soon come a time when we can remove the legal requirement to self-isolate altogether, just as we don’t place legal obligations on people to isolate if they have flu," Johnson said.Nonetheless, Johnson urged people to remain cautious in the last weeks of winter and stressed that the pandemic was “not over.”The news was welcomed by businesses, especially those relying on workers re-populating city centers, as well as hospitality and tourism. But some said officials need to give more details about their plans to cope with the coronavirus in the longer term. Johnson’s spokesman said the government would publish such a plan “shortly.”“There’s a vital need now for greater consistency in how we live with the virus in the longer term. Swinging back and forth between restrictions and normality has been damaging," said Matthew Fell, chief policy director of the Confederation of British Industry.Scotland and Wales, which set their own public health rules, have also announced similar easing of restrictions.Britain has the second-worst pandemic death toll in Europe after Russia, with over 153,000 confirmed virus-related deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-lifts-covid-19-restrictions-says-omicron-wave-has-peaked-101642617953058.html
20-01-2022||World||China warns US missile destroyer in South China Sea||China on Thursday said its armed forces deployed warships and aircraft to monitor and warn away a US guided missile destroyer from waters near the Paracel (Xisha) islands in the South China Sea, the latest tense incident between the two countries in the disputed maritime region.The US warship USS Benfold “illegally” sailed into Chinese territorial waters without permission, violating the country’s sovereignty, and that Chinese naval and air forces tracked the ship before warning it away, the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) Southern Theatre Command said.“The actions of the US side have seriously violated China’s sovereignty and security, which is another iron proof that it is pursuing navigational hegemony and militarising the South China Sea,” the theatre command said.“We solemnly demand that the US side immediately stop such provocative actions, otherwise it will bear the serious consequences of unforeseen events,” it added.The US navy denied that the warship was “warned” away.“The People’s Republic of China’s statement about this mission is false. USS Benfold conducted this FONOP (freedom of navigation operation) in accordance with international law and then continued on to conduct normal operations in international waters,” the 7th Fleet spokesperson Mark Langford said in an emailed statement on Thursday.In an earlier statement, Langford said that USS Benfold “…asserted navigational rights and freedoms in the vicinity of the Paracel Island, consistent with international law”.“At the conclusion of the operation, USS Benfold exited the excessive claim and continued operations in the South China Sea,” Langford added.The US, the statement added, carries out what it calls freedom of navigation missions in the South China Sea to challenge Chinese territorial claims.China claims nearly the entire South China Sea but that claim is disputed by several maritime neighbours including Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia besides Vietnam and Taiwan (which China says is a breakaway region).Specifically, China, Taiwan and Vietnam claim sovereignty over the Paracel islands, known as Xisha islands in China.“By engaging in innocent passage without giving prior notification to or asking permission from any of the claimants, the US challenged the unlawful restrictions imposed by the PRC, Taiwan, and Vietnam,” Langford said.China has built and established military outposts on artificial islands in the South China Sea, a vital shipping lane for international maritime trade besides containing gas fields and rich fishing grounds.The South China Sea has become one of many flashpoints in the relationship between China and the US besides Taiwan, trade and alleged rights abuses in Xinjiang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-warns-us-missile-destroyer-in-south-china-sea-101642675830078.html
