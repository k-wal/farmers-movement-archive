17-01-2022||World||Chinese President Xi Jinping rejects ‘cold war mentality’, pushes cooperation||Chinese President Xi Jinping said Monday that his country will send an additional 1 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccine to other countries, calling for global cooperation to tackle the pandemic and other challenges while urging other powers to discard a "Cold-War mentality” — a veiled swipe at the United States.Xi touted China's efforts to share vaccines, fight climate change and promote development in the opening speech of a virtual gathering hosted by the World Economic Forum. The online event is being held after the group put off its annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, because of the coronavirus pandemic.Efforts to battle the global outbreak that has claimed over 5.5 million lives and upended the world economy and climate change were prominent themes Monday.In a panel session on the virus, Moderna's CEO said the vaccine maker was working on a single-shot booster for both Covid-19 and the flu, while U.S. infectious diseases expert Dr. Anthony Fauci lamented as “very disturbing” the reluctance of many Americans to follow basic measures like mask-wearing and getting vaccinated.Xi, who hasn’t left China since the coronavirus emerged in early 2020, said his country has exported more than 2 billion doses of its Covid-19 vaccines to over 120 countries and international institutions. He announced plans to provide an additional 1 billion, including a donation of 600 million doses to Africa and an extra 150 million to Southeast Asia.By comparison, managers of the U.N.-backed COVAX program to ship vaccines to developing countries announced over the weekend that it has now delivered 1 billion vaccine doses.Xi touched on standard themes from previous international addresses, including responding to trading partners' complaints by promising to open China's state-dominated economy wider to private and foreign competition.His comments come as tensions between the United States and China have simmered on topics like Taiwan, intellectual property, trade, human rights and the South China Sea.“We need to discard Cold War mentality and seek peaceful coexistence and win-win outcomes,” Xi said through a translator. “Protectionism and unilateralism can protect no one. ... Even worse are the practices of hegemony and bullying, which run counter to the tide of history" — terms Beijing has used to describe U.S. policy and actions.“A zero-sum approach that enlarges one’s own gain at the expense of others will not help,” he added. "The right way forward for humanity is peaceful development and win-win cooperation.”Xi said China “stands ready to work with” other governments on climate change but announced no new initiatives and offered no resources. He said it was up to developed countries to provide money and technology.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also took up the environment in his address, pledging his country's commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2070.India’s growth in the next 25 years will be “green and clean, and also sustainable and reliable,” he said, stressing its commitment to solar power.While Xi and Modi touted environmental efforts, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres ratcheted up his concerns about the use of coal — both China and India are big users — in his call for “real climate action in developing countries.”“Emissions must fall, but they continue to rise," Guterres said in his address, appealing for debt relief for developing countries needing help weaning off coal.Guterres pointed to his call for “coalitions” to help foster a clean energy transition, highlighting US-Chinese efforts to provide China with “adequate technologies" to accelerate that shift."India doesn’t like the coalition, but India has accepted several bilateral forms of support, and I’ve been in close contact with the US, UK and several other countries to make sure that there's a strong project to support India,” he said.Guterres said the past two years had shown that the world needs to cooperate to halt climate change, achieve global economic recovery and beat the pandemic.During a session on Covid-19's future, Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said he hoped the US-based company would have a combined vaccine booster ready to test in advanced research in the second quarter, saying a best-case scenario would be if the single shot covering both flu and Covid-19 would be ready for use next year.“I don’t think it would happen in every country, but we believe it’s possible to happen in some countries next year,” Bancel said.Moderna has been criticized for prioritizing distribution of its Covid-19 vaccines to rich countries; only a fraction of its supply has gone to poor countries via COVAX. He said the company aimed to make about 2 to 3 billion doses this year and hopes to have data from a new vaccine tweaked to address the omicron variant in March.The annual Davos gathering usually takes place in person in the Alpine snows of eastern Switzerland, drawing hundreds of business leaders, cultural elites, academics and government leaders. Leaders of countries like Germany, Colombia and Japan were set to address the gathering that runs through Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-president-xi-jinping-rejects-cold-war-mentality-pushes-cooperation-101642442759435.html
17-01-2022||World||China to send another 1bn Covid vaccines to Africa: Xi||China will supply another one billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines to African countries, President Xi Jinping announced at the all-virtual Davos forum on Monday, adding that 150 million vaccine doses will donated to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries. Of the one billion vaccines that it will send to Africa, 600 million will be donated, Xi said. This is in addition to the more than one billion doses that China promised and supplied to Africa last year.“China is a country that delivers on its promises. China has already sent over two billion doses of vaccines to more than 120 countries and international organisations,” the Chinese President said at the World Economic Forum via video link on Monday, the third time the Chinese leader has addressed the event. “Still, China will provide another one billion doses to African countries, including 600 million doses as donation, and will also donate 150 million doses to Asean countries,” he said.Xi had announced in November that China will deliver one billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines to Africa, after already having supplied nearly 200 million doses to the country.Xi reiterated that cooperation is “the only right way” to defeat the pandemic, while holding each other back or shifting blame “would only cause needless delay in response” and “distract us from the overall objective”.“Holding each other back or shifting blame would only cause needless delay in response and distract us from the overall objective,” he said.“As changes of the times combine with the once-in-a-century pandemic, the world finds itself in a new period of turbulence and transformation,” Xi said.The Covid-19 pandemic first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late December, 2019.China has been accused of withholding critical information related to the origin of the virus; Beijing has strongly countered that by saying more countries should be investigated to trace the origins.According to official data, by the end of last year, China had provided the international community with about 372 billion masks, more than 4.2 billion protective suits, 8.4 billion testing reagents, and more than 2 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines to more than 120 countries and international organisations. China has provided the most vaccines worldwide, a government spokesperson said on Monday.Xi urged other powers to discard a “Cold-War mentality” at a time of rising geopolitical tensions — a veiled swipe at the United States.The Chinese leader touted his country’s efforts to share vaccines, fight climate change and promote development at home and abroad as he delivered the opening speech.“We need to discard the Cold War mentality and seek peaceful coexistence and win-win outcomes. Our world today is far from being tranquil,” said Xi. “Protectionism and unilateralism can protect no one. They ultimately hurt the interests of others as well as one’s own. Even worse are the practices of hegemony and bullying, which run counter to the tide of history.“A zero-sum approach that enlarges one’s own gain at the expense of others will not help,” he added. “The right way forward for humanity is peaceful development and win-win cooperation.”For the second year in a row, an online event is being held in place of the face-to-face gathering of political and corporate power players in Davos, Switzerland, because of health concerns linked to the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-send-another-1bn-covid-vaccines-to-africa-xi-101642428279456.html
17-01-2022||World||2 Indians, 1 Pakistani killed in blast from ‘drone attack’ in Abu Dhabi||A possible drone attack may have sparked an explosion that struck three oil tankers in Abu Dhabi and another fire at an extension of Abu Dhabi International Airport on Monday that killed three people and wounded six, police said.Abu Dhabi police identified the dead as two Indian nationals and one Pakistani. It did not identify the wounded, who police said suffered minor or moderate wounds.Police said an investigation was underway.#عاجل| #شرطة_أبوظبي: الحادث أسفر عن وفاة شخص من الجنسية الباكستانية و شخصين من الجنسية الهندية و إصابة 6 آخرين إصاباتهم بين البسيطة والمتوسطة pic.twitter.com/sbbVsphDoFWhile Abu Dhabi police did not immediately offer any suspects for the possible assault, Yemen’s Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for an attack targeting the United Arab Emirates, without elaborating. The Iranian-backed Houthis have claimed several attacks that Emirati officials later denied took place.The incident comes while Yemen’s yearslong war rages on and as an Emirati-flagged vessel found itself recently captured by the Houthis. That’s as Abu Dhabi largely has withdrawn its national forces from the conflict tearing apart the Arab world’s poorest nation while still supporting local militias there.Abu Dhabi police said preliminary investigations indicated the detection of small flying objects, possibly belonging to drones, that fell in the two areas and may have caused the explosion and fire. They said there was no significant damage from the incidents, without offering further details.Also Read | UAE says it suspects drones caused Abu Dhabi fires, Yemen's Houthis claim attackPolice said the “minor” airport fire took place at an extension of the international airport that is still under construction. For years, the airport home to Etihad Airways has been building its new Midfield Terminal, but it wasn't clear if that was where the fire took place.The other blast, according to the police, struck three petroleum transport tankers near a storage facility for the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. in the Musaffah area. The neighborhood, 22 kilometers (13 miles) from the center of Abu Dhabi city, also has an oil pipeline network and 36 storage tanks, from which transport trucks carry fuel nationwide.Houthi military spokesman Yahia Sarei said on Monday that the group has launched an attack deep in the UAE. He did not provide further details, saying a statement would be released soon.The location of the ADNOC storage facility where the tankers caught fire is approximately 1,800 kilometers (1,100 miles) northeast of Saada, the Houthis’ stronghold in Yemen.The UAE has been at war in Yemen since early 2015 and was a key member of the Saudi-led coalition that launched attacks against the Iranian-backed Houthis after the group overran the capital of Yemen and ousted the internationally-backed government from power.Although the UAE has decreased the number of troops it has on the ground, it continues to be actively engaged in the war and supports key militias fighting the Houthis. It also cooperates closely with the United States in counter-terrorism operations in Yemen.The Houthis have come under pressure in recent weeks and are suffering heavy losses as Yemeni forces, allied and backed by the UAE, have pushed back the rebel group in key southern and central provinces of the country.Yemen’s government-aligned forces, aided by the UAE-backed Giants Brigades and with help from Saudi airstrikes, reclaimed the entire southern province of Shabwa from the Houthis earlier this month and made advances in nearby Marib province.The incident comes as South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in visits the UAE. During the president’s meeting with Emirati Prime Minister and Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum on Sunday, the two countries reportedly reached a preliminary deal valued at some $3.5 billion to sell mid-range South Korean surface-to-air missiles to the UAE.The Houthis have claimed previous attacks on Abu Dhabi's airport, as well as the emirate's Barakah nuclear power plant - claims that Emirati officials have denied in the past.The Houthis have used bomb-laden drones to launch crude and imprecise attacks aimed at Saudi Arabia and the UAE over the course of the war. The group has also launched missiles at Saudi airports, oil facilities, and pipelines, as well as used booby-trapped boats for attacks in key shipping routes.Though there have been civilian deaths in Saudi Arabia from some of these attacks, the overwhelming number of civilian deaths have been in Yemen. The war has killed 130,000 people in Yemen - both civilians and fighters - and has exacerbated hunger and famine across the impoverished country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-indians-1-pakistani-killed-in-blast-from-drone-attack-in-abu-dhabi-101642418955776.html
17-01-2022||World||China’s population in ‘zero growth’ period, birth rate falls for 5th year||China’s population increased by less than half a million in 2021, recording a drop in births for the fifth consecutive year, latest national data showed on Monday with officials saying that the country’s population has entered a “zero growth” period.China recorded 10.62 million births in 2021, or only 7.5 births per 1,000 people, the national bureau of statistics (NBS) said. It marked the lowest growth rate since the founding of new China under the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 1949.In demographic terms, new births managed to outnumber deaths with the population growing by 480,000 to 1.4126 billion.The number of deaths recorded in 2021 was 10.14 million. New births in 2021 dropped 11.6% from 12.02 million in 2020; it had registered a sharp 18% plunge that year from 14.65 million in 2019.Ning Jizhe, head of the NBS, said multiple factors were responsible for China’s falling population.A primary reason is the continued decrease in the number of women of childbearing age, as 2021 saw about 5 million fewer women of childbearing age between 15 and 49 than in the previous year.“Other factors included delaying marriage and births due to the fertility concept of couples and the pandemic,” Ning was quoted as saying by state media.Ning said at the end of 2021, the working-age population aged 16-59 was 882 million, accounting for 62.5% of the total population; the population aged 60 and above was 267 million, accounting for 18.9% of the total population, and the population aged 65 and above was 200 million, accounting for the total population 14.2%.“The demographic challenge is well known but the speed of population ageing is clearly faster than expected,” Zhang Zhiwei, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, was quoted as saying by the AFP.“It also indicates China’s potential growth is likely slowing faster than expected,” he said.Liang Jianzhang, an economics professor at Peking University, told the Global Times that it is necessary, effective and important to further encourage fertility and increase the population to improve China’s economy.China, the most populous country in the world, is burdened with an ageing citizenry despite scrapping the decades-old one-child policy in 2016.China’s population is growing at its slowest pace in decades with the country adding only 72 million people in the past decade, the once-in-a-decade Census data showed in May, 2021.In May, China allowed married couples to have up to three children, in a major shift from the limit of two children per couple following a worrying decline in births confirmed in new Census data.“The three-child policy and supporting measures will be conducive to improving China’s demographic structure and implementing the national strategy of actively responding to population ageing,” the Chinese government said about the decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-population-in-zero-growth-period-birth-rate-falls-for-5th-year-101642416398528.html
17-01-2022||World||UAE says it suspects drones caused Abu Dhabi fires, Yemen's Houthis claim attack||Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi movement said on Monday it had carried out an attack on the United Arab Emirates after authorities in the Gulf state reported two fires in the capital Abu Dhabi that were possibly caused by drones.Abu Dhabi police said three fuel tanker trucks had exploded in the industrial Musaffah area near storage facilities of oil firm ADNOC and that a fire broke out at a construction site at Abu Dhabi International Airport."Initial investigations found parts of a small plane that could possibly be a drone at both sites that could have caused the explosion and the fire," the police said in a statement on state news agency WAM.There was no "significant damage" from the incidents and a full investigation has been launched, the statement added.The military spokesman of Yemen's Houthi movement, which is battling a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia and including the UAE, said the group launched a military operation "deep in the UAE" and would announce details in the coming hours.Pro-coalition forces backed by the UAE have recently joined fighting against the Houthis in Yemen's energy-producing regions of Shabwa and Marib.The UAE had largely scaled down its military presence in Yemen in 2019 but continues to hold sway through the Yemeni forces it armed and trained.The Houthis have repeatedly launched cross-border missile and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia and have in the past threatened to attack the UAE.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-says-it-suspects-drones-caused-abu-dhabi-fires-yemen-s-houthis-claim-attack-101642413957474.html

Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates are among the world's richest.The world's 10 richest men doubled their fortunes during the Covid-19 pandemic as poverty and inequality soared, an Oxfam study revealed on Monday.The charity, which is focused on combating global poverty, said the 10 wealthiest men's fortunes skyrocketed collectively from $700 billion to $1.5 trillion (€1.314 trillion), at a rate of around $1.3 billion per day.While the fortunes of the world's billionaires have soared, the world's poorest are facing even more dire circumstances."Over 160 million people are projected to have been pushed into poverty," according to the paper "Inequality Kills," published ahead of the World Economic Forum's Davos meeting, which this year is being held online due to the ongoing pandemic.'Economic violence tearing world apart'Oxfam's paper stated that increasing economic, gender and racial inequalities, as well as the disparity that exists between countries "are tearing our world apart.""This is not by chance, but choice: 'economic violence' is perpetrated when structural policy choices are made for the richest and most powerful people. This causes direct harm to us all, and to the poorest people, women and girls, and racialized groups most," the paper's authors continued."It has never been so important to start righting the violent wrongs of this obscene inequality by clawing back elites' power and extreme wealth including through taxation -getting that money back into the real economy and to save lives," Oxfam International's executive director Gabriela Bucher said."The Covid-19 pandemic has revealed openly both the motive of greed, and the opportunity by political and economic means, by which extreme inequality has become an instrument of economic violence," Bucher added.Zuckerberg and Gates see wealth soarThe authors of the paper called for curbs on extreme wealth via progressive taxation, proven inequality-busting measures, as well as a power shift in the economy and society.Forbes listed the 10 richest men in the world as Tesla and SpaceX chief Elon Musk, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, former Microsoft CEOs Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer, former Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, US investor Warren Buffet and the head of the French luxury group LVMH, Bernard Arnault.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxfam-10-richest-men-in-the-world-doubled-wealth-amid-covid-pandemic-101642406534353.html
17-01-2022||World||Sonic boom, quake, tsunami waves: Why Tonga volcanic eruption was no small event||The eruption in Hunga Tonga Hunga Ha’apai volcano in southern Pacific Island of Tonga was no small event. It triggered tsunami waves around the Pacific and smothered Tonga in dust.Watch: “Get away from coast...”, volcanic eruption triggers panicThe eruption on Saturday was so powerful that it was recorded around the world and sent pressure shockwaves around the planet twice.As more and more details emerge about the natural incident, here’s a look at what a volcanic eruption is and the global impact of that happened in Tonga.What is a volcanic eruption?Before we talk about volcanic eruptions, it is important to understand what a volcano is. A volcano is an opening or rupture in the earth’s surface that allows magma - which comes out as hot liquid and semi-liquid rock - volcanic ash and gases to escape.The volcanic hotspots are places which are found where Earth’s tectonic plates come together.A volcanic eruption is when lava and gas are released from a volcano - sometimes explosively.Undersea volcanic eruptionThis type of eruption happens in a volcano which is located under the ocean surface. There are an estimated one million undersea volcanoes, and most of them are located near the tectonic plates.Apart from lava, these openings also spew out ash. These deposit on the ocean’s floor and lead to the formation of sea mounds - underwater mountains that are formed on the ocean floor but do not reach the water surface.How many active volcanoes are there on Earth?According to USGS, there are about 1,350 potentially active volcanoes worldwide. About 500 of those have erupted, according to data available with USGS. Many of those are located along the Pacific Rim in what is known as the “Ring of Fire”.Impact of volcanic eruption on Earth’s climateHuge volcanic eruptions can sometimes cause temporary global cooling as sulfur dioxide is pumped into the stratosphere. But in the case of the Tonga eruption, initial satellite measurements indicated the amount of sulfur dioxide released would only have a tiny effect of perhaps 0.01 Celsius (0.02 Fahrenheit) global average cooling, said Alan Robock, a professor at Rutgers University.What happened in Tonga?Satellite images showed the spectacular undersea eruption on Saturday evening, with a plume of ash, steam and gas rising like a giant mushroom above the South Pacific waters.A sonic boom was heard as far away as Alaska.Some climate experts said that the eruption altered atmospheric pressure that may have briefly helped clear out the fog in Seattle, in the United States.Tsunami waves of about 80 centimeters (2.7 feet) crashed into Tonga's shoreline, and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern described damage to boats and shops on Tonga's shoreline.The waves crossed the Pacific, drowning two people in Peru and causing minor damage from New Zealand to Santa Cruz, California.The US Geological Survey estimated the eruption caused the equivalent of a magnitude 5.8 earthquake.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sonic-boom-quake-tsunami-waves-why-tonga-volcanic-eruption-was-no-small-event-101642398968653.html
17-01-2022||World||Australia PM blames Omicron for testing woes as Covid cases hit downward trend||Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Monday the shortages of at-home antigen tests were "not unique" to the country as authorities deal with a runaway Omicron outbreak that has driven up hospitalisation rates and strains testing systems.Australia is facing a shortage of at-home rapid antigen test kits after asymptomatic close contacts were told to bypass government-funded testing hubs, where high volumes delayed results by several days, and take their own tests."The rapid antigen tests are in short supply all around the world. This is not something that is unique to Australia going through it," Morrison told radio station 2GB on Monday. "It's part of dealing with Omicron. Omicron has disrupted everything."The country's competition regulator, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), on Monday flagged "significant concerns" about reports of price gouging https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-regulator-flags-significant-concerns-price-hike-covid-19-antigen-tests-2022-01-16 of testing kits amid reports of stockpiling and called inflated prices "clearly outrageous".ACCC Chair Rod Sims said there were reports of kits costing even up to A$500 ($361) at online retailers, and A$70 per test at stores when they were available for around A$10 at pharmacies weeks ago.Morrison, under pressure in an election year for his handling of the Omicron outbreak and not procuring enough supplies of antigen tests, early this month had agreed to provide 10 free kits for low-income earners.Doctors and trade unions are demanding free tests for everyone, but Morrison has resisted those calls saying the government would not cover the cost, citing a heightened role for "personal responsibility".Australian Council of Trade Unions Secretary Sally McManus said dozens of unions will meet later on Monday to respond "to the failure of the Federal Government to keep us safe". A survey by the Australian Institute on Monday showed almost three-quarter of Australians believe they should get free antigen tests.In a bid to ease pressure on its testing hubs, Victoria from Monday began rolling out 3 million antigen tests to frontline workers and the vulnerable population, while many other states awaited millions of testing kits to be delivered.After successfully containing the virus earlier in the pandemic, Australia has reported nearly 1.3 million cases over the last two weeks, overwhelming hospitals and testing clinics.Daily infections on Monday dipped in New South Wales and Victoria, Australia's most populous states, amid expectations the Omicron wave had neared its peak https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-nears-omicron-peak-daily-infections-hover-around-records-2022-01-15 in the country. But net new hospitalisations remain elevated, with more people admitted than at any other time in the pandemic.Nearly 74,000 cases were reported on Monday, the country's lowest tally in a week. National daily numbers had touched a record 150,000 last Thursday but have been steadily falling since then.So far, Australia has reported around 1.6 million infections and 2,699 deaths since the pandemic began.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-pm-blames-omicron-for-testing-woes-as-covid-cases-hit-downward-trend-101642398199507.html

17-01-2022||World||Gene that slashes Covid-19 severity by 20% identified, say scientists||The Omicron variant of coronavirus has infected a large number of people across the world. The numbers have been growing exponentially since the discovery of the new strain in November last year, with the United States and the United Kingdom being the worst hit.Also Read | India logs 258,089 new Covid-19 cases, positivity rate rises to 19.65%But the behaviour of Covid-19 has puzzled the researchers since the beginning of the pandemic. While it has affected some countries severely, with a high number of fatalities and widespread infection, others have largely been spared with the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, causing only mild infection. A group of European scientists may have discovered the reason behind it.The researchers from Sweden claimed to have discovered a gene that reduces the severity of Covid infections by 20 per cent, the Daily Mail reported.The study has also explained why Covid-19 hits some people harder than others.The researchers said that their discovery will help in creating vaccines that are effective against the coronavirus.The scientists claim that the presence of this particular gene varies according to ethnicity. In people with white European ancestry, the gene is present in one in three people. In people with African heritage, it is present in eight out of 10 individuals, said the study.The gene tells the body to make a protein that is effective at breaking down Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid, said scientists. It also determines the length of the protein OAS-1 and when it is longer, it is better at breaking down Sars-CoV-2, they added.The study has been published in Nature Genetics.Also Read | In Greece, citizens aged 60+ to face monthly fine for not taking Covid vaccineMeanwhile, leaders across the world are revisiting their strategies of fighting the pandemic, announcing stricter curbs in the wake of Omicron’s spread.Hong Kong has reimposed strict curbs, such as the closure of gyms and in-restaurant dining for dinner, to stop the spread of the omicron variant. New Zealand, where 93% of adults are fully vaccinated, has delayed a phased reopening of the border to keep omicron out while it rushes to administer booster shots and begin inoculating children.Japan’s government is deliberating placing stricter coronavirus measures, known as a “quasi” state of emergency, on Tokyo and surrounding prefectures within the week, broadcaster FNN reported, citing several unidentified government officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gene-that-slashes-covid-19-severity-by-20-identified-say-scientists-101642396600261.html
17-01-2022||World||In Greece, citizens aged 60+ to face monthly fine for not taking Covid vaccine||Greece from Monday intends to fine all people ages 60 and over who aren’t vaccinated against Covid-19 as a way to boost lagging inoculation levels and reduce pressure on health care.  Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has told seniors the simplest way to avoid the levy is to get vaccinated. “To the few of our fellow citizens over 60 who are still unvaccinated, I encourage them today: take the step,” he said on Saturday. “It’s not a matter of fine, yes the fine will be imposed, but that’s the least. Protect your life, the lives of those you love and understand that the vaccine is safe.” Greek authorities say the non-vaccinated remain at high risk for hospitalization from the coronavirus. Some nine in 10 Covid-related deaths in Greece have been among people 60 and above, while seven in 10 of those hospitalized from the virus are over 60. And of those, eight in 10 are unvaccinated.From Pandemic to Endemic: Can 2022 Succeed Where 2021 Failed?Before the compulsory shots were announced in November, some 520,000 seniors in Greece hadn’t been vaccinated, according to Health Ministry data. Since then, about 220,000 more have rolled up their sleeves. Of the remaining 300,000 individuals, some will be eligible to apply for exemptions for medical reasons. Holdouts may be fined 100 euros ($114) a month. The penalty will be imposed by Greek tax authorities directly to those who haven’t been inoculated, and the funds collected will be given to hospitals fighting the pandemic.At this point the government has exhausted all other means of persuasion, spokesman Ioannis Oikonomou said on Thursday.Like much of Europe, Greece has seen daily cases hit records this month due to the highly-contagious omicron variant. Covid-related deaths are running at levels similar to the peak of previous waves. Greece is about two-thirds fully vaccinated, below the EU average.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-greece-citizens-aged-60-to-face-monthly-fine-for-not-taking-covid-vaccine-101642395075909.html
17-01-2022||World||China grew by 8.1% in 2021, it has a $18 trillion economy||China’s GDP grew 8.1% in 2021 riding out a slump in the second half of the year when the economy was besieged by a crippling power shortage, real estate sector turmoil and a drop in consumption because of Covid-19-related restrictions. Fourth quarter GDP rose by 4% from a year ago, China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Monday. Though slower than growth in the third quarter, it was faster than the 3.6% increase forecast by a Reuters poll.Growth in the first, second, and third quarter were 18.3%, 7.9% and 4.9%, respectively. The fourth quarter growth was the weakest in one-and-half years.The country’s total GDP in 2021 reached 114.37 trillion yuan ($18 trillion), the NBS said.Chinese official media said the 8.1% growth was the fastest in nearly a decade and landed well above the government’s annual target of achieving a growth rate above 6%.In 2020, disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, which was first reported from the central city of Wuhan, the Chinese economy had grown by about 2.3%, the only major economy to have expanded that year.The per capita disposable income of citizens went up by 9.1% to 35,128 yuan ($5,535) last year in nominal terms. “Weak consumption data also clouded the outlook, with retail sales in December missing expectations with only a 1.7% increase from a year earlier, the slowest pace since August 2020. Analysts in the poll had expected them to grow 3.7% after rising 3.9% in November,” a Reuters report said on Monday.Industrial production saw sustained development, the NBS said, adding that high-tech manufacturing and equipment manufacturing experienced fast growth. “The total value added of industrial enterprises above the designated size increased by 9.6% over the previous year, an average two-year growth of 6.1%. In terms of sectors, the value added of mining was up by 5.3%, that of manufacturing up by 9.8% and that of production and supply of electricity, thermal power, gas and water up by 11.4%,” the NBS said.The value added of high-tech manufacturing and equipment manufacturing went up by 18.2% and 12.9% respectively.“Generally speaking, in 2021, China sustained the continuous and steady recovery of the national economy and maintained the leading position in economic growth and epidemic prevention and control in the world, with major indicators reaching the expected targets,” the NBS said in a statement released on Monday.It added a note of caution. “We must be aware that the external environment is more complicated and uncertain, and the domestic economy is under the triple pressure of demand contraction, supply shock and weakening expectations”.Experts told the tabloid, Global Times that in the near term, the spread of highly transmissible Omicron variant across China including in Beijing, Tianjin and the southern Guangdong province well as the Delta variant’s resurgence in multiple cites has cast a shadow on the spending during the Lunar New Year holidays and the economic outlook for the first quarter of 2022, though this impact is likely to fade away by the second quarter. According to a report issued by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China’s GDP growth is projected to moderate at around 5.5% in 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-grew-by-8-1-in-2021-it-has-a-18-trillion-economy-101642394615483.html
17-01-2022||World||UK police arrest 2 teenagers in connection with Texas synagogue attack||The man who held four people hostage at a Texas synagogue was identified by US authorities as a British citizen Sunday while UK police later arrested two teens over an attack that President Joe Biden called an "act of terror."The captor, who died in the 10-hour siege in the small town of Colleyville on Saturday, was named by the FBI as 44-year-old Malik Faisal Akram.Hours later, Britain's counter terrorism police arrested two people and were questioning them in connection with the incident."Two teenagers were detained in South Manchester this evening. They remain in custody," the Greater Manchester Police said in a statement.The FBI's field office in Dallas had earlier said there was "no indication" that anyone else was involved in the attack on the Congregation Beth Israel synagogue.The four hostages -- including a respected local rabbi, Charlie Cytron-Walker -- were all freed unharmed Saturday night, prompting relief in the United States, where the Jewish community and Biden renewed calls to fight anti-Semitism."There is no question that this was a traumatic experience," Cytron-Walker said in a statement Sunday."We are resilient and we will recover," he added.A man identifying himself as Akram's brother Gulbar said in a Facebook post that the suspect had suffered from mental health problems."We would like to say that we as a family do not condone any of his actions and would like to sincerely apologize wholeheartedly to all the victims involved in the unfortunate incident," Gulbar said in the post to a Muslim community Facebook page in Blackburn, in northwest England -- where British police said Akram was from.Gulbar added that he had been in touch with law enforcement in Texas and that his family hoped to get Akram's body back to Britain for a funeral.Biden declined to speculate on the motive but appeared to confirm reports that the hostage-taker was seeking the release of convicted terrorist Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani neuroscientist known as "Lady Al-Qaeda.""This was an act of terror" committed by an assailant who apparently "insisted on the release of someone who's been in prison for over 10 years," Biden told reporters during a visit to a hunger relief organization in Philadelphia.Britain's foreign minister Liz Truss likewise Sunday condemned the hostage-taking as an "act of terrorism and anti-Semitism."Siddiqui, the first woman to be suspected by the United States of links to Al-Qaeda and a cause celebre in Pakistan and in South Asian jihadist circles, was detained in Afghanistan in 2008.Two years later she was sentenced by a New York court to 86 years in prison for the attempted murder of US officers in Afghanistan.She is currently being held at a prison in Fort Worth, Texas -- about 20 miles (32 kilometers) away from the synagogue which Akram attacked.Siddiqui's lawyer has said she "has absolutely no involvement" in the hostage situation and condemned it.Any links she may have to Akram remained unclear.FBI special agent Matthew DeSarno told reporters in Colleyville after the standoff that the investigation would "have global reach."He said the suspect's demands were "focused on one issue that was not specifically threatening to the Jewish community."Britain's ambassador to Washington confirmed that British authorities were "providing our full support to Texas and US law enforcement agencies."'Mind-blowing'Cytron-Walker in his statement credited his congregation's previous security training from the FBI and others with their survival from a harrowing ordeal."In the last hour of our hostage crisis, the gunman became increasingly belligerent and threatening," the rabbi said."Without the instruction we received, we would not have been prepared to act and flee when the situation presented itself."Other residents of Colleyville, about 25 miles northwest of Dallas, were left struggling to comprehend the incident."Colleyville... It's one of the safest towns in North Texas," said Austin Sewell, owner and founder of the North Texas Kings baseball club, whose field is across the street from the synagogue in a quiet residential neighborhood."It's mind-blowing, to be honest," he told AFP Sunday.At one point the standoff involved some 200 local, state and federal law enforcement officers massed around Colleyville.A Facebook livestream of the congregation's Shabbat service appeared to capture audio of a man talking loudly, but did not show the scene inside the building.One hostage was freed early in the standoff.Hours later, after what police said were extensive negotiations, an elite SWAT team burst into the synagogue and the remaining three hostages were freed.Journalists nearby said they heard a loud bang -- likely a flash-bang grenade used as a distraction -- and shots.The siege had sparked an outpouring of concern from Jewish organizations.Biden pledged to "stand against anti-Semitism and against the rise of extremism in this country."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-police-arrest-2-teenagers-in-connection-with-texas-synagogue-attack-101642385795113.html
17-01-2022||World||North Korea fires suspected ballistic missile, 4th test in January||North Korea fired on Monday what could be a ballistic missile, Japan's coast guard said, in what would be the fourth test this month as Pyongyang forges ahead with new military developments amid stalled stalks with the United States and South Korea.South Korea's military also reported that the North had fired an "unidentified projectile" toward the ocean off its east coast.Since New Year's Day, North Korea has conducted three other tests, an unusual frequency of weapons tests. Two of those launches involved single "hypersonic missiles" capable of high speeds and manoeuvring after launch, while the last, on Friday, involved a pair of short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs) fired from train cars.It was not immediately known what kind of missile was involved in Monday's reported launch.The series of launches prompted US President Joe Biden's administration to impose its first sanctions against Pyongyang on Wednesday, and to call on the UN Security Council to blacklist several North Korean individuals and entities.North Korea has defended the missile tests as its sovereign right to self-defence and accused the United States of intentionally escalating the situation with new sanctions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-fires-suspected-ballistic-missile-4th-test-in-january-101642380502786.html
17-01-2022||World||Huge Tonga volcanic eruption caused 'significant damage'||A massive volcanic eruption in Tonga that triggered tsunami waves around the Pacific caused "significant damage" to the island nation's capital and smothered it in dust, but the full extent was unclear with communications still hampered Monday.The eruption on Saturday was so powerful it was recorded around the world and heard as far away as Alaska, triggering a tsunami that flooded Pacific coastlines from Japan to the United States.The capital Nuku'alofa suffered "significant" damage, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said, adding there had been no reports of injury or death but a full assessment was not yet possible with communication lines down."The tsunami has had a significant impact on the foreshore on the northern side of Nuku'alofa with boats and large boulders washed ashore," Ardern said after contact with the New Zealand embassy in Tonga."Nuku'alofa is covered in a thick film of volcanic dust but otherwise conditions are calm and stable."Tonga was in need of water supplies, she said, as "the ash cloud has caused contamination."There has been no word on damage in the outer islands but New Zealand sent an air force reconnaissance aircraft early Monday "to assist in an initial impact assessment of the area and low-lying islands," the country's Defence Force said.Tonga has also accepted Canberra's offer to send a surveillance flight, Australia's foreign office said, adding it is also immediately prepared to supply "critical humanitarian supplies".The United States and the World Health Organization have pledged support, while the United Nations children's agency said it was preparing emergency supplies to fly in.A 1.2-metre (four-foot) wave swept ashore in the Tongan capital with residents reporting they had fled to higher ground, leaving behind flooded houses, some with structural damage, as small stones and ash fell from the sky."It was massive, the ground shook, our house was shaking. It came in waves. My younger brother thought bombs were exploding nearby," resident Mere Taufa told the Stuff news website Saturday.She said water filled their home minutes later and she watched the wall of a neighbouring house collapse."We just knew straight away it was a tsunami. Just water gushing into our home," Taufa said."You could just hear screams everywhere, people screaming for safety, for everyone to get to higher ground."Drownings in PeruTonga's King Tupou VI was reported to have been evacuated from the Royal Palace in Nuku'alofa and taken by police convoy to a villa well away from the coastline.Dramatic satellite images showed the long, rumbling eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano spew smoke and ash in the air, with a thunderous roar heard 10,000 kilometres (6,000 miles) away in Alaska.The eruption triggered tsunamis across the Pacific with waves of 1.74 metres measured in Chanaral, Chile, more than 10,000 kilometres away, and smaller waves seen along the Pacific coast from Alaska to Mexico.Two women drowned on a beach in northern Peru due to "anomalous waves" caused by the eruption, authorities said Sunday, and dozens of people required rescue from flooding in the south of the country.In California, the city of Santa Cruz was hit by flooding due to a tidal surge generated by the tsunami, while waves of around 1.2 metres hit along Japan's Pacific coast.'Just incredible'The US Geological Survey recorded Saturday's eruption as equivalent to a 5.8-magnitude earthquake at zero depth.The volcano's eruption lasted at least eight minutes and sent plumes of gas, ash and smoke several kilometres into the air.New Zealand scientist Marco Brenna described the impact as "relatively mild" but said another eruption with a much bigger impact could not be ruled out.The eruption was so powerful it was even heard in Alaska, the UAF Geophysical Institute tweeted, saying the fact it was audible was "fairly unique."It cited Alaska Volcano Observatory scientists David Fee as recalling "only a couple other volcanic eruptions doing something like this" -- namely, the 19th-century eruption of Indonesia's Krakatau, and Alaska's Novarupta, the most powerful volcanic eruption of the 20th century.The Fife weather station in Scotland tweeted it was "just incredible to think of the power that can send a shockwave around the world" after the eruptions produced a jump in its air pressure graph.Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha'apai, which lies about 65 kilometres north of Nuku'alofa, has a history of volatility.In recent years it breached sea level during a 2009 eruption, while in 2015 it spewed so many large rocks and ash into the air that when they settled, a new island had formed two kilometres long by one kilometre wide and 100 metres high.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/huge-tonga-volcanic-eruption-caused-significant-damage-101642378456632.html

This is a part of the preparations of having to live with coronavirus in the future.The official guidance, however, will remain but the no legal punishment or fine will be imposed if the rules are ignored, The Telegraph’s report said. Prime Minister Johnson wants to permanently revoke the emergency provisions like self-isolation since Covid-19 cases have been falling in the country, the report further said.The announcement is expected as early as spring, The Telegraph further reported.Last week, UK health secretary Sajid Javid said that Covid-19 self-isolation in England will be cut to five days from seven if someone tests negative twice.Meanwhile, The Sunday Times said in a report that the UK is planning to do away with the requirement of mandatory Covid-19 tests post-arrival into the country for fully vaccinated travellers, including from India.The country’s transport secretary Grant Shapps is understood to be in favour of ending the testing regime for all those who have had both vaccine doses, in time for school holidays in the UK in February, the Times further said in its report in Sunday.The report further quoted an official aware of the developments to say that the rules could be relaxed by the “end of January”.Under current rules, travellers arriving in England are required to stay at their declared address on a legally binding passenger locator form until they log a negative lateral flow or PCR test result on a pre-booked system.A positive test requires a 10-day quarantine at the address, although this can be cut short with a negative lateral flow test on days six and seven. Those not fully vaccinated must isolate for the full 10 days on arrival, with tests required on days two and eight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-led-uk-govt-plans-to-scrap-covid-19-self-isolation-law-report-101642376945248.html

The Weather Channel reported that more than a foot of snow had fallen in North Carolina.The NWS even reported some snow flurries in Pensacola, Florida, while usually mild Atlanta, Georgia also saw snow.The storm is expected to cause some coastal flooding, and the NWS warned that winds could near hurricane force on the Atlantic coast.The northeastern United States had already seen snow chaos in early January, when a storm blanketed the Northeast.After that storm, hundreds of motorists were stuck for more than 24 hours on a major highway linking to the capital Washington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/millions-hunker-down-as-storm-hits-eastern-us-101642374602829.html
17-01-2022||World||‘We stand with US’: UK foreign minister condemns Texas hostage||Britain's foreign minister Liz Truss on Sunday condemned a hostage-taking at a synagogue in Texas as an "act or terrorism and anti-Semitism".And a man identifying himself as the hostage-taker's brother said in a post to Facebook that his brother had suffered from mental health problems.In a statement posted on Twitter, Foreign Secretary Truss wrote: "My thoughts are with the Jewish community and all those affected by the appalling act in Texas."We stand with US in defending the rights and freedoms of our citizens against those who spread hate."In Manchester, northwest England, Assistant Chief Constable Dominic Scally of the region's counter-terrorism team, confirmed the assailant's identity as Malik Faisal Akram.Akram was from Blackburn, also in the northwest, said Scally."Police forces in the region will continue to liaise with their local communities, including the Jewish community, and will put in place any necessary measures to provide reassurance to them," he added.'Mental health issues'On the Facebook page of Blackburn's Muslim community, a man identifying himself as Gulbar, the hostage-taker's brother, said he had been shot dead."We would like to say that we as a family do not condone any of his actions and would like to sincerely apologize wholeheartedly to all the victims involved in the unfortunate incident," he added.Gulbar wrote that during the incident, he had been liaising from England with law enforcement at the scene."Although my brother was suffering from mental health issues we were confident that he would not harm the hostages," he wrote.But he added: "There was nothing we could have said to him or done that would have convinced him to surrender."His family was devastated and their priority now was to get his brother's body back to Britain for his funeral.US authorities have launched an investigation with "global reach" into a 44-year-old Akram who was killed after holding four people hostage at the synagogue.Akram was reportedly calling for the release of a convicted terrorist known as "Lady Al-Qaeda".The four hostages -- including a respected local rabbi, Charlie Cytron-Walker -- were all released unharmed Saturday night.

17-01-2022||World||Texas standoff: Captor grew ‘belligerent' towards end, says Rabbi who was among hostages||A rabbi who was among four people held hostage at a Texas synagogue said Sunday that their captor grew “increasingly belligerent and threatening” toward the end of the 10-hour standoff, which ended with an FBI SWAT team rushing into the building and the captor's death.Authorities identified the hostage-taker as a 44-year-old British national, Malik Faisal Akram, who was killed Saturday night after the last hostages ran out of Congregation Beth Israel around 9 p.m. The FBI said there was no indication that anyone else was involved, but it had not provided a possible motive as of Sunday afternoon.Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker credited security training that his suburban Fort Worth congregation has received over the years for getting him and the other three hostages through the ordeal, which he described as traumatic.“In the last hour of our hostage crisis, the gunman became increasingly belligerent and threatening,” Cytron-Walker said in a statement. “Without the instruction we received, we would not have been prepared to act and flee when the situation presented itself."President Joe Biden called the episode an act of terror. Akram could be heard ranting on a Facebook livestream of the services and demanding the release of Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani neuroscientist suspected of having ties to al-Qaida who was convicted of trying to kill US Army officers in Afghanistan.Speaking to reporters in Philadelphia on Sunday, Biden said Akram allegedly purchased a weapon on the streets and might have been in the US for only a few weeks.Video from Dallas TV station WFAA showed people running out a door of the synagogue, and then a man holding a gun opening the same door just seconds later before he turned around and closed it. Moments later, several shots and then an explosion could be heard.“Rest assured, we are focused,” Biden said. “The attorney general is focused and making sure that we deal with these kinds of acts.”US Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not immediately respond to questions Sunday about Akram's immigration status and history. London’s Metropolitan Police said in a statement that its counter-terrorism police were liaising with US authorities about the incident.FBI Special Agent in Charge Matt DeSarno said the hostage-taker was specifically focused on an issue not directly connected to the Jewish community, and that there was no immediate indication that he was part of any broader plan.It wasn't clear why Akram chose the synagogue, though the prison where Saddiqui is serving her sentence is in Fort Worth. Michael Finfer, the president of the congregation, said in a statement “there was a one in a million chance that the gunman picked our congregation.”Authorities have declined to say who shot Akram, saying it was still under investigation.Law enforcement officials who were not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation and who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity earlier said the hostage-taker demanded Siddiqui's release and wanted to be allowed to speak to her.Authorities said police were first called to the synagogue around 11 a.m. and people were evacuated from the surrounding neighborhood soon afterward.Saturday's services were being livestreamed on the synagogue's Facebook page for a time. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported that an angry man could be heard ranting and talking about religion at times during the livestream, which didn't show what was happening inside the synagogue.Shortly before 2 p.m., the man said, “You got to do something. I don’t want to see this guy dead.” Moments later, the feed cut out. A spokesperson for Meta Platforms Inc., the corporate successor to Facebook Inc., later confirmed that Facebook had removed the video.Multiple people heard the hostage-taker refer to Siddiqui as his “sister” on the livestream. But John Floyd, board chair for the Houston chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations — the nation’s largest Muslim advocacy group — said Siddiqui’s brother, Mohammad Siddiqui, was not involved.“We want the assailant to know that his actions are wicked and directly undermine those of us who are seeking justice for Dr. Aafia,” said Floyd, who also is legal counsel for Mohammad Siddiqui.Texas resident Victoria Francis, who said she watched about an hour of the livestream, said she heard the man rant against America and claim he had a bomb. Biden said there were apparently no explosives, despite the threats.“He was just all over the map. He was pretty irritated and the more irritated he got, he’d make more threats, like ‘I’m the guy with the bomb. If you make a mistake, this is all on you.’ And he’d laugh at that,” Francis said. “He was clearly in extreme distress.”Colleyville, a community of about 26,000 people, is about 15 miles (23 kilometers) northeast of Fort Worth. By Sunday morning, the police perimeter around the synagogue had shrunk to half a block in either direction and FBI agents could be seen going in and out of the building. A sign saying “Love” — with the “o” replaced with a Star of David — was planted in a neighbor’s lawn.Reached outside his home Sunday, Cytron-Walker declined to speak at length about the episode. “It’s a little overwhelming as your can imagine. It was not fun yesterday," he told the AP.Andrew Marc Paley, a Dallas rabbi who was called to the scene to help families and hostages upon their release, said Cytron-Walker acted as a calm and comforting presence. The first hostage was released shortly after 5 p.m. That was around the time food was delivered to those inside the synagogue, but Paley said he did not know if it was part of the negotiations.“He appeared a little unfazed, actually, but I don't know if that was sort of shock or just the moment," Paley said of the first hostage after his release. “He was calm and grateful to law enforcement and Rabbi Charlie."Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said on Twitter that “this event is a stark reminder that antisemitism is still alive and we must continue to fight it worldwide."The standoff led authorities to tighten security in other places, including New York City, where police said that they increased their presence “at key Jewish institutions” out of an abundance of caution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-standoff-captor-grew-belligerent-towards-end-says-rabbi-who-was-among-hostages-101642370344375.html
