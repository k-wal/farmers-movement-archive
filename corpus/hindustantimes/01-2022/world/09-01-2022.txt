Dr Clive Dix called for a new targeted strategy to manage Covid-19 and scrap population-based jabs as the UK witnesses fall in daily Covid-19 cases after registering record numbers, according to several British media reports.“We need to analyse whether we use the current booster campaign to ensure the vulnerable are protected, if this is seen to be necessary,” The Observer quoted Dix as saying. “Mass population-based vaccination in the UK should now end.”The vaccine expert insisted that the government needs to manage the disease and not the spread of coronavirus, adding that the future objective should be “stopping progression to severe disease in vulnerable groups.”Omicron mild? Experts slam earlier presumption as US sees record hospitalisationDix’s statement came after the UK health security agency (UKHSA) reported nearly 147,000 new confirmed Covid cases over the last 24 hours on Saturday. With an 18.5% decline in daily infections from the previous week's figure of 179,637, the UK marked the biggest week-on-week fall since the start of November. But the death toll due to Covid-19 continued to increase with 313 more fatalities recorded, taking the cumulative death toll of Britain over 150,000.“Coronavirus has taken a terrible toll on our country and today the number of deaths recorded has reached 150,000,” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wrote on Twitter.“Each and every one of those is a profound loss to the families, friends and communities affected and my thoughts and condolences are with them. Our way out of this pandemic is for everyone to get their booster or their first or second dose if they haven’t yet,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/treat-covid-like-flu-end-mass-vaccination-after-boosters-uk-vaccine-expert-101641734477007.html

What scientists say about Covid-19 strain found in Cyprus||A researcher in Cyprus has reportedly discovered a strain of the coronavirus that combines the Delta and Omicron variant and has been nicknamed as Deltacron. At a time when the world is in the grip of Omicron, the latest variant of SARS-CoV-2, reports of this apparently new variant triggered fresh apprehension. As Deltacron trended on social media, many experts opined that it is not a real variant. However, the Cyprus scientist has defended the finding. In an emailed statement to Bloomberg, the said that the cases he has identified indicate “an evolutionary pressure to an ancestral strain to acquire these mutations and not a result of a single recombination event”.Here is what we know so far:1. Leondios Kostrikis, professor of biological sciences at the University of Cyprus, called the strain 'Deltacron'. Reports said the strain has Omicron-like genetic signatures within the Delta genomes.2. 25 cases of Deltacron have been found so far, Bloomberg reported. Much about this strain or these cases remains unknown.3. In an interview, Kostrikis said, "We will see in the future if this strain is more pathological or more contagious or if it will prevail."4. The sequences of the 25 Deltacron cases were sent to GISAID, the international database that tracks changes in the virus, on January 7. Small update: the Cypriot 'Deltacron' sequences reported by several large media outlets look to be quite clearly contamination - they do not cluster on a phylogenetic tree and have a whole Artic primer sequencing amplicon of Omicron in an otherwise Delta backbone.5. Virologist Tom Peacock said on social media that Deltacron may not be an actual variant, but possibly a result of contamination. "So when new variants come through sequencing lab, contamination isn't that uncommon (very very tiny volumes of liquid can cause this) - just usually these fairly clearly contaminated sequences are not reported by major media outlets," he explained."Recombinants are definitely worth keeping an eye on and almost definitely will eventually be found, this particular example is almost definitely contamination though," he wrote.

Some documents still bear Nazi stamps."The Nazis hated the Freemasons," Andrzej Karpowicz, who managed the collection for three decades, told AFP.Nazi ideology, he said, was inherently "anti-Masonic" because of its anti-intellectual, anti-elite tendencies.The library puts some select items on show, including the first edition of the earliest Masonic constitution written in 1723, six years after the first lodge was created in England."It's one of our proudest possessions," Grazynska said.The oldest documents in the collection are prints from the 17th century relating to the Rosicrucians -- an esoteric spiritual movement seen as a precursor to the Freemasons whose symbol was a crucifix with a rose at its centre.During the war as Allied bombing intensified, the collection was moved from Germany for safekeeping and broken up into three parts -- two were taken to what is now Poland and one to the Czech Republic.The section left in the town of Slawa Slaska in Poland was seized by Polish authorities in 1945, while the others were taken by the Red Army.In 1959, the Polish Masonic collection was formally established as an archive and curators began studying it -- at that time, Freemasonry was banned in the country under Communism.The collection is open to researchers and other visitors, who have included representatives of German Masonic lodges wanting to recover their pre-war history.It is "a mine of information in which you can dig at will," said Karpowicz.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/still-holds-mysteries-archive-amassed-by-nazis-sheds-light-on-masonic-history-101641722420262.html

The unnamed military officer was reportedly among the athletes who fell sick after attending the World Military Games in Wuhan, China's epicentre of the Covid-19 outbreak, in October 2019.“I'm 100 per cent convinced the virus was present in Wuhan when we were there,” the Daily Mail quoted the Canadian officer as saying. “The burden of proof is on the scientific community and intelligence experts to prove – not for athletes.”The report suggests that a quarantine section was set up on their military flight back home as many from the Canadian contingent were hit by the “mysterious virus”. The officer said that the foreign participants of the games found the city of Wuhan ‘like a ghost town’.A World Health Organization (WHO) team of international experts visited Wuhan in January last year to probe the origin of the virus but failed to conclude how the pandemic began. While the joint report prepared by the WHO and Chinese experts ruled out the possibility of a lab leak as “extremely unlikely”, top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci said he was not totally convinced with natural introduction theory.Since then, there have been several calls for a renewed probe into the origin of Sars-CoV-2, which China has repeatedly rejected.While the Canadian military officer acknowledged that the debilitating illness athletes suffered from after visiting Wuhan might not be Covid but wondered why everyone seems “reluctant to investigate properly.”“It feels like we were present at Ground Zero of this pandemic that has had such impact on everyone's life, with millions of deaths and economies shut down, so why not carry out due diligence. Are the facts just too big to handle?” he said, as quoted by the British daily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/are-facts-too-big-to-handle-canadian-military-officer-fears-he-was-at-covid-ground-zero-in-oct-2019-101641720555631.html

The group accused the professor of “nonsense remarks on social media, which were provoking people against the government and playing with people’s dignity.”The Taliban seized control of Afghanistan last August ahead of America's chaotic Aug. 31 departure after nearly 20 years of war. The Islamic militant guerrillas-turned-rulers previously held power from 1996-2001.In a tweet early Sunday, Jalal's daughter Hasina Jalal pleaded for her father's release. “As I confirm the disturbing news. I ask for the immediate release of my father Professor Faizuallah Jalal,” she tweeted.Afghanistan faces a humanitarian crisis of epic proportions, with the United Nations warning that 90% of the country's 38 million people are in dire need. The arrest of a prominent rights activist was certain to complicate humanitarian aid efforts.It also reinforced fears that the Taliban are imposing the same harsh and repressive rule as their last stint in power before they were ousted by a U.S.-led coalition for harboring al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden.TOLO TV, Afghanistan's largest station on which Faizuallah Jalal was a frequent commentator, tweeted that Jalal was arrested “reportedly for making allegations against government departments, a security source said."There was no official response from the government to queries about Jalal's arrest.Jalal is the husband of one of the country's first female presidential candidates, Masooda Jalal, who ran against former President Hamid Karzai in 2004.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-arrest-popular-afghan-professor-critical-of-govt-101641717466228.html

We envision this project as a first-phase engagement and a building block for AIIB’s long-term partnership with India and - in this particular case, Chennai - by supporting the government’s programme of expenditures,” Pandian was quoted in an AIIB statement released after the project was approved.The former Indian bureaucrat has in the past sought to dispel the impression, especially in India, that the AIIB is a Chinese bank, saying it has emerged as a multilateral bank becoming the lead financier of infrastructure projects in Asia.Except the US and Japan, most of the developed and developing countries have joined the bank.An AIIB report in December said that India can capitalise on a higher participation rate in global value chains (GVC) to accelerate the country’s recovery from the pandemic. “AIIB’s 2021 Asian Infrastructure Finance Report said GVC participation across India will largely rely on a combination of improving infrastructure, strengthening institutional quality and increasing port efficiency, capacity and connectivity with the hinterland,” it said.In late December, the AIIB approved the application of Iraq to join, becoming the bank’s 51st regional member to bring its membership to 105.As of October 22, AIIB has overall approved 147 projects in 31 countries valued at $28.97 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-rbi-guv-urjit-patel-appointed-beijing-based-aiib-vicepresident-101641717561771.html

Fact is that the Xi Jinping regime is targeting global supply chains to punish a small country. While a Chinese spokesperson denies blocking imports containing Lithuanian components, the hit is on German automotive suppliers as their precious cargo is said to be languishing at Chinese ports. Germany and France are beneficiaries of a close economic relationship with China, which often uses this leverage to dilute any diplomatic action against Beijing on human rights contemplated by the EU. The German automotive industry players as well as multinational companies, reeling under Chinese potent action, are already putting pressure on Lithuania to rename the Taiwanese office in Vilnius and warning the tiny EU country to back down as German subsidiaries are at risk. German CEOs are known to have warned their political leadership not to conduct confrontational foreign policy with China, clearly showing how the economic leverage of Beijing works globally.Incidentally, the US Congress has passed the Uighur Forced Labour Prevention Act, which would bar goods made by forced labour in the Sinkiang region from entering America. The US multinational companies are bracing for the day when the Act becomes law.While Lithuania’s total exports to China were a mere USD 350 million in 2020 with the balance of trade much in favour of Beijing, but the Xi Jinping regime expanded the sanctions to hurt global supply chains by including Lithuanian parts.Also Read| Eye on India: China to appoint special envoy to Horn of AfricaLithuania, Australia and Norway are examples to show that Beijing refuses to take criticism lying down and India was first to face the brunt after the 14th Dalai Lama was given shelter in Dharamshala in 1959. It was then paramount leader Mao Zedong who made an example out of India by launching the 1962 war across the 3,488 km long Line of Actual Control (LAC). Since then, Beijing has not ceded an inch to India as it is in relentless pursuit of superimposing the 1959 line (first unveiled by Premier Chou En-Lai) on Ladakh LAC and claim Arunachal Pradesh as South Tibet even though it has recognized the same McMahon Line as the border with Myanmar.Under the circumstances, little is expected out of the 14th round of India-China military dialogue to resolve the Ladakh LAC and roll back the PLA aggression over the years. Clearly, for the PLA, the LAC has now become a Line of Control (LoC) with rapid military infrastructure upgrades all along the line that still awaits resolution.

The discovery was named “deltacron” due to the identification of omicron-like genetic signatures within the delta genomes, he said.Kostrikis and his team have identified 25 such cases and the statistical analysis shows that the relative frequency of the combined infection is higher among patients hospitalized due to Covid-19 as compared to non-hospitalized patients. The sequences of the 25 deltacron cases were sent to GISAID, the international database that tracks changes in the virus, on Jan. 7. “We will see in the future if this strain is more pathological or more contagious or if it will prevail” over delta and omicron, he said.

Our diversity makes the US stronger, and we condemn any form of hate-based violence,” the State SCA wrote on Twitter.An un-dated 26-second long video shared on Twitter on January 5 showed the Sikh cab driver being assaulted by an unidentified man. It was posted by Navjot Pal Kaur, who said that it was recorded by a bystander at the John F Kennedy airport.In the video, the man could be heard allegedly using expletives against the cab driver. He repeatedly hit the victim and punched him and also knocked off his turban. Further details about the driver and the cause of the attack were not available.It’s not enough to say that we need to fight AAPI hate. We actually need our elected officials to get involved with consequences for those who commit acts of violence against our community. @GregMeeksNYC @NYCMayor @AdrienneToYou @yuhline @rontkim pic.twitter.com/Dkk23lQw0gThe video derived angry reactions from the Sikh community. A day before the State SCA's remarks, the Indian Consulate in New York took up the matter with the authorities.“The assault against a Sikh taxi driver in New York is deeply disturbing. We have taken up the matter with US authorities and urged them to investigate this violent incident,” the Consulate tweeted on Saturday.The National Sikh Campaign, an organisation that promotes a better understanding of the Sikh community in the US and other Western countries, said, “We are only a few days into the new year and there has already been a hate crime committed against a Sikh.”"A Sikh person goes about their daily lives only to be senselessly attacked by someone. Common road rage between people can escalate when someone who is ignorant of who we are takes their disdain for our turbans and becomes violent,” the NSC added.This is the second such attack on a Sikh cab driver in New York. In 2017, drunk passengers assaulted a 25-year-old driver and knocked his turban off.On December 5, 2019, a Sikh driver working for Uber was racially abused and strangled by a passenger in Bellingham, Washington.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-vows-action-against-recent-attack-on-sikh-cab-driver-at-jfk-airport-101641697334825.html
09-01-2022||World||US hones warnings, offers to Russia over Ukraine||The Biden administration on Saturday issued new, forceful warnings to Russia on penalties it may face if it goes ahead with threats to invade Ukraine.US officials raised the possibility of incremental shifts in decisions about America’s future strategic posture in Europe. But they also said Russia would be hit with debilitating sanctions should it intervene in Ukraine.The officials said the administration would be open to discussions with Russia on curtailing possible future deployments of offensive missiles in Ukraine and putting limits on US and NATO military exercises in Eastern Europe.Yet, they said Russia will be hit hard with economic sanctions should it intervene in Ukraine. In addition to direct sanctions on Russian entities, those penalties could include significant restrictions on products exported from the US to Russia and potentially foreign-made products subject to US jurisdiction.The comments came as senior US and Russian officials prepare to meet in Switzerland on Monday amid heightened tensions over Ukraine.The officials said the US is willing to discuss certain, limited aspects of its European security posture in those talks. But they stressed that any agreements would be contingent on Russia removing threats to Ukraine and that no decisions would be made without the consent of Ukraine or NATO.And, they said there is no chance the US will reduce its military presence or arsenal in Eastern Europe as Russia has demanded.While those comments, made to reporters on condition of anonymity in a White House-organized telephone conference call, were the first to suggest a willingness to compromise on issues tangential to Ukraine, they were accompanied by threats for Russian inaction on US demands to step back.In the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, “we – in coordination with our allies and partners – would immediately impose severe and overwhelming costs on Russia’s economy, including its financial system and sectors deemed critical to the Kremlin,” another official said.In addition to sanctions on energy and consumer goods, the US and its allies are considering bans on the export to Russia of advanced electronic components, software and related technology that uses American equipment. Russia could be added to the most restrictive group of countries for export control purposes, together with Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria, officials said.That would mean that Russia’s ability to obtain integrated circuits, and products containing integrated circuits, would be severely restricted, because of the global dominance of US software, technology and equipment in this sector. The impact could extend to aircraft avionics, machine tools, smartphones, game consoles, tablets and televisions.Such sanctions could also target critical Russian industry, including its defense and civil aviation sectors, which would hit Russia’s high-tech ambitions, whether in artificial intelligence or quantum computing.US officials have been careful not to issue ultimatums to Russia, while at the same time demanding that threats to Ukraine cease. But they have also flatly rejected Russian demands that NATO will not further expand eastward and that the US will remove troops and weapons from Eastern Europe.Despite that stance, the US and NATO have signaled a willingness to explore compromises on related issues.“We think we can at least explore the possibility of making progress with the Russians,” one official said Saturday, ahead of Monday’s Strategic and Security Dialogue between the US and Russia in Geneva. He added, though, that “there will be no firm commitments made in these talks.”Monday’s meeting will be followed by discussions between Russia and NATO members on Wednesday and with a broader European audience on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-hones-warnings-offers-to-russia-over-ukraine-101641691004405.html

On January 3, the country set a global record in daily tally with 1,080,211 cases.The Omicron variant, first discovered in South Africa in November 2021, is also driving a record surge in the number of hospitalisations in the United States.News agency Reuters reported on Saturday that hospitalisations have been steadily increasing since late December last year, and health officials have warned that the sheer number of cases caused by Omicron is placing a strain on hospitals.Many hospitals across the country are struggling to keep up with the influx of patients as their own workers are out sick.The rising number of Covid-19 patients also brings in burnout and extreme exhaustion for healthcare workers. Doctors and nurses are frustrated at the surge in the number of unvaccinated patients by saying that they are unable to understand why people ignore doctors' advice to get inoculated against Covid-19 but then seek help once infected, Reuters further reported.Authorities in the US, including President Joe Biden, have said that vaccination protects people from severe illness and death.“If you're unvaccinated, you're at a high risk of getting sick. And if you get sick you're likely to spread it to others, including friends and family. We should all be concerned about Omicron, but not panicked,” Biden said during an address from the White House on December 21 last year.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United States administered over 518 million vaccine doses as of Saturday morning and nearly 640 million doses were distributed. The CDC's tally includes two-dose vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson's one-shot vaccine.(With Reuters inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-variant-driving-covid-surge-in-cases-hospitalisations-in-united-states-101641688266275.html
09-01-2022||World||Baby lost during evacuations at Kabul airport found, returned to family||An infant boy handed in desperation to a soldier across an airport wall in the chaos of the American evacuation of Afghanistan has been found and was reunited with his relatives in Kabul on Saturday.The baby, Sohail Ahmadi, was just two months old when he went missing on Aug. 19 as thousands of people rushed to leave Afghanistan as it fell to the Taliban.Following an exclusive Reuters story published in November with his pictures, the baby was located in Kabul where a 29-year-old taxi driver named Hamid Safi had found him in the airport and took him home to raise as his own.After more than seven weeks of negotiations and pleas, and ultimately a brief detention by Taliban police, Safi finally handed the child back to his jubilant grandfather and other relatives still in Kabul.They said they would now seek to have him reunited with his parents and siblings who were evacuated months ago to the United States.During the tumultuous Afghan evacuation over the summer, Mirza Ali Ahmadi - the boy's father who had worked as a security guard at the U.S. embassy - and his wife Suraya feared their son would get crushed in the crowd as they neared the airport gates en route to a flight to the United States.Ahmadi told Reuters in early November in his desperation that day, he handed Sohail over the airport wall to a uniformed soldier who he believed to be an American, fully expecting he would soon make it the remaining 5 meters (15 feet) to the entrance to reclaim him.Just at that moment, Taliban forces pushed the crowd back and it would be another half an hour before Ahmadi, his wife and their four other children were able to get inside.But by then the baby was nowhere to be found.Ahmadi said he searched desperately for his son inside the airport and was told by officials that he had likely been taken out of the country separately and could be reunited with them later.The rest of the family was evacuated - eventually ending up at a military base in Texas. For months they had no idea where their son was.The case highlights the plight of many parents separated from their children https://www.reuters.com/world/when-are-my-parents-coming-1300-afghan-children-evacuated-us-limbo-2021-11-10 during the hasty evacuation effort and withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country after a 20-year war.With no U.S. embassy in Afghanistan and international organizations overstretched, Afghan refugees have had trouble getting answers on the timing, or possibility, of complex reunifications like this one.The U.S. Department of Defense, the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment on Saturday.ALONE AT THE AIRPORTOn the same day Ahmadi and his family were separated from their baby, Safi had slipped through the Kabul airport gates after giving a ride to his brother's family who were also set to evacuate.Safi said he found Sohail alone and crying on the ground. After he said he unsuccessfully tried to locate the baby's parents inside, he decided to take the infant home to his wife and children. Safi has three daughters of his own and said his mother's greatest wish before she died was for him to have a son.In that moment he decided: "I am keeping this baby. If his family is found, I will give him to them. If not, I will raise him myself," he told Reuters in an interview in late November.Safi told Reuters that he took him to the doctor for a check-up after he was found and quickly incorporated the child into his family. They called the baby Mohammad Abed and posted pictures of all the children together on his Facebook page.After the Reuters story about the missing child came out, some of Safi's neighbors - who had noticed his return from the airport months earlier with a baby - recognized the photos and posted comments about his whereabouts on a translated version of the article.Ahmadi asked his relatives still in Afghanistan, including his father-in-law Mohammad Qasem Razawi, 67, who lives in the northeastern province of Badakhshan, to seek out Safi and ask him to return Sohail to the family.Razawi said he traveled two days and two nights to the capital bearing gifts - including a slaughtered sheep, several pounds of walnuts and clothing - for Safi and his family.But Safi refused to release Sohail, insisting he also wanted to be evacuated from Afghanistan with his family. Safi's brother, who was evacuated to California, said Safi and his family have no pending applications for U.S. entry.The baby's family sought help from the Red Cross, which has a stated mission to help reconnect people separated by international crises, but said they received little information from the organization. A spokesperson for the Red Cross said it does not comment on individual cases.Finally, after feeling they had run out of options, Razawi contacted the local Taliban police to report a kidnapping. Safi told Reuters he denied the allegations to the police and said he was caring for the baby, not kidnapping him.The complaint was investigated and dismissed and the local police commander told Reuters he helped arrange a settlement, which included an agreement signed with thumbprints by both sides. Razawi said the baby's family in the end agreed to compensate Safi around 100,000 Afghani ($950) for expenses incurred looking after him for five months."The grandfather of the baby complained to us and we found Hamid and based on the evidence we had, we recognized the baby," said Hamid Malang, the chief area controller of the local police station. "With both sides in agreement, the baby will be handed over to his grandfather," he said on Saturday.In the presence of the police, and amid lots of tears, the baby was finally returned to his relatives.Razawi said Safi and his family were devastated to lose Sohail. "Hamid and his wife were crying, I cried too, but assured them that you both are young, Allah will give you male child. Not one, but several. I thanked both of them for saving the child from the airport," Razawi said.The baby's parents told Reuters they were overjoyed as they were able to see with their own eyes the reunion over video chat.    "There are celebrations, dance, singing," said Razawi. "It is just like a wedding indeed."Now Ahmadi and his wife and other children, who in early December were able to move off the military base and resettle in an apartment in Michigan, hope Sohail will soon be brought to the United States."We need to get the baby back to his mother and father. This is my only responsibility," his grandfather said.

Among them was an Islamabad police officer and seven other members of his family, fellow police officer Atiq Ahmed said.More than 4 feet (1m) of snow fell in the area of the Murree Hills resort overnight on Friday and early Saturday, trapping thousands of cars on roadways, said interior minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed.The snow was so severe that heavy equipment brought in to clear it initially got stuck during the night, said Umar Maqbool, assistant commissioner for the town of Murree. Temperatures fell to minus 8 degrees Celsius.Officials called in paramilitary troops and a special military mountain unit to help. By late on Saturday, thousands of vehicles had been pulled from the snow but more than a thousand were still stuck, Ahmed said.Most roads leading to the area’s resorts were largely cleared of snow by late on Saturday, and military troops were working to clear the rest, Maqbool said. The military also converted army-run schools into relief camps where they provided shelter and food for the tourists who had been rescued.Emergency officials distributed food and blankets to people while they were trapped in their snowed-in vehicles, but many died of hypothermia.Others may have died from carbon monoxide poisoning after running their car heaters for long periods of time, said rescue services physician Abdur Rehman. As of late Saturday, the death toll included 10 men, 10 children and two women, Rehman said.In one instance, a husband and wife and their two children all died in their car. In another, four young friends died together, he said. Located 46km north of the capital of Islamabad, Murree is a popular winter resort town that attracts well over a million tourists annually. Streets leading into the town are often blocked by snow in winter.Authorities warned last weekend that too many vehicles were trying to enter Murree, but that failed to discourage hordes of daytrippers from the capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-22-die-in-cars-trapped-by-snowstorm-101641685069949.html
09-01-2022||World||Colombian man dies publicly under new euthanasia policy||Victor Escobar decided to die and to do so publicly, becoming one of the first Latin Americans to end their life without suffering from a terminal disease, under a ground-breaking court ruling in Colombia.Hours before dying on Friday, 60 year old Escobar celebrated what he called victory in his two-year battle with a lung ailment that left him unable to breathe on his own."Little by little, it becomes everyone's turn. So I do not say goodbye but rather, see you soon. And little by little we will end up with God," Escobar, who is a practicing Catholic, said in a video sent to news organizations.He died in the city of Cali with doctors present, his lawyer said on Twitter.The last footage of him alive shows him smiling and surrounded by family. He was sedated and then given a lethal injection.Colombia depenalized assisted death in 1997, and in July 2021 a high court expanded this "right to dignified death" to those not suffering from a terminal illness.It is the first Latin American country to take the step and one of the few in the world, and did so despite being mostly Roman Catholic. The church categorically opposes euthanasia and assisted suicide."I was already feeling sick. I felt like my lungs did not obey me," Escobar told AFP in October as he waged the final chapter of his legal battle.Non terminalDiabetes and a cardiovascular ailment left him in a wheel chair and suffering from spasms that wracked his body.His family backed the idea of euthanasia.In Europe only Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxemburg and Spain have legalized euthanasia.Colombia may have joined that list but access to the procedure is not always smooth.As of mid-2021 patients like Escobar -- with chronic diseases and a life expectancy of more than six months -- could not undergo euthanasia."They were being forced to live in undignified conditions against their will," said Monica Giraldo of an NGO called the Foundation for the Right to Dignified Death.She said that since the court ruling on euthanasia, three people with non-terminal diseases used it to end their lives but Escobar is the first to do so with cameras rolling so the public could witness it."I want my story to be known because it creates a path for patients like me, patients with degenerative conditions, to have an open door to seek rest," Escobar said.Escobar has said he got ill from years of working with exposure to asbestos, an insulating material now known to cause cancer.Permission to dieIn October of last year a panel at the Imbanaco clinic rejected Escobar's request for euthanasia, after two years of earlier petitions that were also rejected.The committee argued that Escobar was not terminal and there were still ways to try to alleviate his suffering.Days earlier in another city, Medellin, 51 year old Martha Sepulveda, suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also saw her request to die cancelled at the last minute on grounds that she was not terminal.Giraldo said hospitals sometimes deny euthanasia requests over "ideological positions" or scrap them at the last minute over legal concerns.But Escobar appealed in court and won. He chose to die on January 7 -- a Friday, so it would be easy for relatives to go to his funeral on the weekend, his lawyer said."I suffer from my diseases, and I suffer watching ny family suffer because of me," Escobar said in October, gasping for breath.The courts also granted permission for Sepulveda to die. Like Escobar she had gone public with her case.The government says at least 157 people have chosen euthanasia since the July 2021 legal change.Giraldo's foundation is now working with five people seeking assisted suicide, two of them with non terminal conditions.Shortly before dying, Escobar said God does not like to see people suffer."I do not think God will punish me for trying to stop suffering," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/colombian-man-dies-publicly-under-new-euthanasia-policy-101641682283352.html
09-01-2022||World||US open to discuss with Russia exercises, missile deployments: Official||The United States and its allies are prepared to discuss with Russia in talks about Ukraine the possibility of each side restricting military exercises and missile deployments in the region, a senior U.S. administration official said on Saturday.With a crucial set of talks set to start on Monday in Geneva, the senior Biden administration official said the United States is not willing to discuss limits on U.S. troop deployments or the U.S. force posture in NATO countries in the region.The Geneva talks, to be followed by other sessions in Brussels and Vienna, are aimed at averting a crisis. Russian President Vladimir Putin has massed tens of thousands of troops along the border with Ukraine, generating fears of an invasion.Whether the United States and its European allies can make progress in the talks with Moscow is far from clear. Putin wants an end to NATO's eastward expansion and security guarantees, demands the United States says are unacceptable.But the senior U.S. official, briefing reporters ahead of the talks, said there are some areas that present an opportunity for common ground."Any discussion of those overlapping areas where we might be able to make progress would have to be reciprocal," the official said. "Both sides would need to make essentially the same commitment."Russia says it feels threatened by the prospect of the United States deploying offensive missile systems in Ukraine despite assurances from President Joe Biden to Putin that he has no intention of doing so."So this is one area where we may be able to reach an understanding if Russia is willing to make a reciprocal commitment," the official said.The United States is also willing to discuss imposing restrictions on military exercises in the region by both sides, the official said."We are willing to explore the possibility of reciprocal restrictions on the size and scope of such exercises, including both strategic bombers close to each other's territory and ground-based exercises as well," the official said.The official said Washington is open to a broader discussion on the deployment of missiles in the region, after the previous Trump administration withdrew from the 1987 U.S.-Russia Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 2019 based on accusations that Moscow was violating the accord.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-open-to-discuss-with-russia-exercises-missile-deployments-official-101641670510120.html
