13-01-2022||World||Speculations rife about who could replace UK PM Boris Johnson||With Boris Johnson in his most precarious position yet as UK prime minister, speculation is swirling over who might replace him as leader of the Conservative party and take Britain's top political job.Rishi SunakThe UK's first Hindu chancellor of the exchequer is the current bookies favourite to replace Johnson, having been appointed finance minister in 2020 after only five years in politics.Sunak, 41, was credited with taking bold steps and delivering a sweeping publicly-funded furlough scheme to secure jobs affected by the coronavirus lockdown.Pro-Brexit Sunak's public speaking ability, smart appearance and slick communications style are in stark contrast to Johnson, earning him comparisons to former prime minister Tony Blair.Sunak was noticeably absent from the House of Commons during Johnson's apology Wednesday for attending a lockdown-breaking drinks party at Downing Street, and took hours to voice support for his beleaguered boss.Privately wealthy through his previous business career, Sunak's grandparents were from the Punjab in northern India and emigrated to the UK from east Africa in the 1960s.His father-in-law is Indian tech billionaire Narayana Murthy.Liz TrussAnother front-runner is Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, a free-trade champion whose straight talking and willingness to wade in to the culture wars have made her popular among Tory grassroots.Truss, 46, was handed the top diplomat's role as reward for her work as minister for international trade securing a raft of post-Brexit trade deals.Some MPs characterised her former Department for International Trade (DIT) as the "Department for Instagramming Truss" because of her prolific output on the social media site.Truss, who opposed Brexit but then switched sides, grew up in Leeds, northern England, and previously worked for 10 years in the energy and telecommunications sectors.Michael GoveThe former journalist with a nose for political drama was a driving force behind Brexit and has been an influential member of Johnson's cabinet.Gove, 56, was in September tasked with leading the housing and local authorities ministry, to deliver Johnson's agenda of "levelling up" disadvantaged UK regions.He ran twice to be Conservative leader, in 2016 and 2019, coming third on both occasions.Jeremy HuntFormer foreign and health secretary Jeremy Hunt, 55, lost to Johnson in the 2019 leadership contest during which he branded himself as the "serious" alternative.A fluent Japanese speaker, he is the current chair of the health select committee and has an image as a "nice guy" although is seen by some as lacking charisma.Hunt was a contemporary of Johnson and former prime minister David Cameron at Oxford University, and previously worked as a management consultant and an English language teacher in Japan.Sajid JavidHealth Secretary Sajid Javid, 52, is the son of a Pakistani immigrant bus driver who become a high-flying banker and eventually Johnson's finance minister before resigning in 2020.He has spoken fondly of shaking free market champion Margaret Thatcher's hand when he was a young boy.Javid voted in 2016 to remain in the European Union because of its economic benefits to trade, but later rallied to the Brexit cause and ended his leadership challenge to support Johnson.Priti PatelInterior minister Priti Patel, 49, is the most socially conservative of Johnson's senior ministers, voting against introducing same-sex marriage, and was a prominent Brexit supporter.Patel was born in London to a Ugandan-Indian family and has taken a tough line on immigration while being confronted with record numbers of migrants arriving in the country from across the Channel.An avowed Thatcherite who has had to fend off claims she bullied civil servants, Patel worked in public relations before entering politics.Dominic RaabDeputy prime minister and justice secretary Dominic Raab, 47, led the country when Johnson was in intensive care in hospital with Covid-19 in 2020.The former lawyer and karate black belt was seen as a reliable ally whose unfussy and pragmatic approach made him the right man for a crisis.His move to justice from the post of foreign secretary was seen as a demotion after he initially failed to cut short his holiday as Kabul fell to the Taliban in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/speculations-rife-about-who-could-replace-uk-pm-boris-johnson-101642093509837.html
13-01-2022||World||China criticises Indian army chief’s remarks, doesn’t release info on LAC talks||China on Thursday criticised Indian Army Chief General MM Naravane’s comment about the existence of Chinese threat in the region, saying it hopes that Indian officials would “refrain” from making “unconstructive” comments.The Chinese foreign ministry, however, did not share any information about Wednesday’s 14th round of Sino-India military discussions to resolve the dragging standoff in eastern Ladakh. “We will release information if there is any,” foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said when asked to comment on the talks at Thursday’s briefing.Asked to comment on the Indian army chief’s statement, Wang said, “China and India are working through diplomatic and military channels to advance the easing of the border tension. We hope individual personnel from India will refrain from making unconstructive comments”.Naravane on Wednesday said that the Chinese threat in the region had not reduced in any way despite partial disengagement at multiple friction points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.Naravane was speaking to reporters ahead of Army Day on January 15.India and China’s decision not to issue official statements a day after the talks concluded is an indication that deep differences exist in implementing the decision to disengage from remaining friction points.On Tuesday, Wang had said: “Currently the situation on the border areas is stable on the whole and the two sides are in dialogue and communication through diplomatic and military channels. “We hope India will work to help the situation to move from emergency handling to a regular daily based management phase,” Wang added.The last military talks in October had collapsed following major differences between the two sides.Both had issued strong statements after the 13th round of talks ended in bitterness.The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) said India had made “unreasonable” and “unrealistic” demands during the talks.New Delhi said the Chinese side wasn’t “agreeable” and “…could not provide any forward-looking proposals” at the negotiating table.Indian and Chinese border troops have been locked in a border standoff in eastern Ladakh since May, 2020, when a violent clash in Pangong lake area led to both sides gradually deploying tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry along the border.Several rounds of military and diplomatic talks have only resulted in partial disengagement of troops until now.India has repeatedly and consistently rejected China’s allegations that Indian troops crossed over to the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, asserting that New Delhi has always taken a responsible approach towards border management and maintaining peace and tranquillity in the border areas.Ahead of the Wednesday talks, an editorial in state-run China Daily newspaper warned India not be led “astray” by the US.The editorial quoted White House press secretary Jen Psaki describing China as a threat to regional security with its “attempt to intimidate its neighbours” and that the US will “…continue to stand with our partners on that”.“India must not be led astray by such remarks. It should engage in the talks with sincerity and strive to meet China half-way so that they can work together to solve their border disputes,” the editorial said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-criticises-indian-army-chief-s-remarks-doesn-t-release-info-on-lac-talks-101642075798561.html
13-01-2022||World||Whisky for visas: India, UK start post-Brexit trade talks||Britain and India began hammering out a post-Brexit trade deal on Thursday, with London seeking a cut in tariffs on Scotch whisky and greater access to the Asian giant's services and tech sectors.New Delhi, which is notoriously reticent about lowering trade barriers and was dubbed the "tariff king" by former US President Donald Trump, wants in return to make it easier and cheaper for Indians to obtain British visas.A joint statement after Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and British Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan formally launched the talks in Delhi reiterated a target of doubling bilateral trade volumes by 2030."Both sides have agreed that we will focus initially on areas which are of mutual benefit and where there is less disagreement, and for which we have set a very aggressive timeline of next few months," Goyal told reporters."We feel confident that there is so much complementarity between the two economies that we should easily be able to come up with a very substantive agreement in the initial phase... I think we are committed to concluding this negotiation in about a year's time," he said."The UK has world-class businesses and expertise we can rightly be proud of, from Scotch whisky distillers to financial services and cutting-edge renewable technology," Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a statement."We are seizing the opportunities offered in growing economies of the Indo-Pacific to cement our place on the global stage and deliver jobs and growth at home," he said.Britain has struck trade deals with Japan, New Zealand and Australia as it attempts to compensate for falling trade volumes with the European Union since it left the bloc in January 2020.The total volume of trade at stake in a deal between Britain and India is small fry, however, equivalent to about three per cent of London's total volume of commerce with the EU, Bloomberg News reported.New Delhi's push to ease the granting of UK visas for Indian nationals may also fall foul with Brexit supporters who were keen to cut immigration.Conservative lawmaker Edward Leigh told parliament last week that "working-class voters who voted Brexit did not vote to replace immigration from Europe with more immigration from the rest of the world".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/whisky-for-visas-india-uk-start-post-brexit-trade-talks-101642074668372.html

13-01-2022||World||‘Deltacron might be a result of…’: WHO on infection with Delta and Omicron||The World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday said that ‘Deltacron’ that implies an individual being infected with both Delta as well as the Omicron variant of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is not “really a thing.” The phrase came to the news after a researcher in Cyprus namely Leondios Kostrikis reportedly discovered a strain of Covid-19 that combines both the variants. Furthermore, Bloomberg reported that as many as 25 cases of Deltacron have been detected in the country so far, even as details about the new strain remains unknown.WHO technical lead of Covid-19 Dr Maria Van Kerkhove said that the Deltacron might be a result of “contamination” that occurred during the sequencing process.She, however, clarified that it is possible for a person to be infected with different variants of SARS-CoV-2. The WHO technical lead also stated that there have been examples of coinfection in which individuals were infected with both influenza and Covid-19 “throughout this pandemic.”“There was a recent systematic review that looked at the prevalence of this (coinfection with Covid-19 and influenza). They also looked at whether or not people had more severe disease,” she said, adding that the review discovered that coinfection didn't increase the severity of the disease.

Cui presented a sharp analysis of problems with China’s diplomacy,” it said.The words of caution come against the backdrop of President Joe Biden administration’s strengthening of ties with allies such as Britain, Japan, Australia and China’s neighbour India.China’s current tough line on the US has been spearheaded by top diplomat Yang Jiechi, a member of the Chinese Communist Party’s powerful Politburo, and foreign minister, Wang Yi.Cui, who was China’s top envoy in the US from 2013 until stepping down in June, said Sino-US relations were unlikely to improve in the near future.“The current stage of history in US-China relations will continue for quite some time, and the US will not willingly accept the rise of a power with a very different social system, ideology, cultural traditions and even ethnicity,” Cui said.The US announced a diplomatic boycott of the upcoming 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing in December, less than a month after Chinese President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Joe Biden talked about avoiding conflict and jointly responding to global challenges like climate change.The two leaders had met for more than 200 minutes via video link in November, the first such meeting since Biden became president in January.Ties between the countries in recent years have been deeply acrimonious over wide-ranging issues including alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Tibet, Beijing’s crackdown on the democracy protests in Hong Kong and US’s ties with self-ruled Taiwan, which China sees as interference in its internal matters, and trade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/exchinese-envoy-warns-china-on-us-ties-takes-a-dig-at-wolf-warrior-diplomacy-101642069378373.html

He recommended the measure for high-exposure groups, people in outbreak areas and on public transport.Yuen Kwok-Yung, a renowned microbiologist, told local radio that people with chronic diseases or who can’t receive Covid vaccines, along with high-risk workers such as airport staff, could also consider double-masking, which helps boost filtering capabilities.The advice comes as omicron is suspected to have spread at events where people were already wearing masks. Hong Kong, which along with mainland China is the last place still adhering to a strict Covid-Zero policy, is in partial lockdown for two weeks with gyms, cinemas, primary schools and kindergartens shut after dozens of locally-transmitted cases of omicron were detected. The call to use more mask protection against omicron isn’t unique to Hong Kong. In the U.S., the potential for a new recommendation from health regulators is unleashing a scramble for higher-quality N95 masks and boosting prices. Yuen said there’s no need yet for the wide adoption of N95 masks in Hong Kong given the low case count. N95 masks are more expensive and more difficult to breathe in for everyday use, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wear-two-masks-to-keep-omicron-at-bay-hong-kong-experts-say-101642066539330.html
13-01-2022||World||Russia-led troops begin withdrawal from Kazakhstan||Over 2,000 Russia-led troops began withdrawing from Kazakhstan after being deployed when peaceful protests over an energy price hike turned into unprecedented violence claiming dozens of lives.The decision to despatch peacekeepers was a first for the Moscow-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), often touted by Russia as a NATO equivalent but previously reluctant to interfere in unrest in Central Asia -- a region with long historical ties to Russia.At a ceremony marking the end of the CSTO mission, soldiers lined up as anthems from each of the six CSTO member countries were played before official speeches began."The peacekeeping operation is over ... the tasks have been fulfilled," said Russian General Andrei Serdyukov, commander of the CSTO contingent that saw troops from Russia, Belarus, Armenia, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan sent to the former Soviet republic on January 6.The Russian defence ministry said the "collective peacekeeping forces ...are starting to prepare equipment and materiel for loading into the planes of the military transport aviation of the Russian aerospace forces and returning to the points of permanent deployment"Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said on Wednesday that Russian and allied forces "played a very important role in terms of stabilising the situation in the country" during his first visit to the country's main city, Almaty.The financial hub of 1.8 million people was devastated during clashes between security forces and government opponents that gave way to a spree of looting.Claims of foreign meddling"Without a doubt, it was of great psychological importance in repelling the aggression of terrorists and bandits. The mission can be considered very successful," he added.One of the strategic buildings that the CSTO contingent was guarding was Almaty airport, which was reportedly seized by government opponents last week.The airport's press service said that it was handling both domestic and international flights again on Thursday.AFP correspondents earlier Thursday witnessed a funeral for a serviceman killed during the clashes which was attended by dozens of soldiers and featured sombre military music.Tokayev has framed the clashes as a coup attempt assisted by local and international terrorists.Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin hinted that the violence was reminiscent of "colour revolutions" instigated by foreign meddling.Those narratives resonated with some residents of Almaty, despite the lack of proof provided by authorities.'Provoked by West'Retired engineer Malik Shaimukhambetov blamed the shootouts in his city on "foreign aggression", which he said had subverted state troops and allowed gangs to seize government buildings."I see these events as a kind of orange revolution provoked by the west," Shaimukhambetov said, referring to political protests that erupted in Ukraine in 2004.Tokayev said the phased withdrawal of the foreign troops would take no more than 10 days.Concern had mounted that Moscow could leverage the mission to shore up its influence in Kazakhstan.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken earlier warned that "once Russians are in your house, it's sometimes very difficult to get them to leave".Last week's violence in Kazakhstan erupted on the back of peaceful demonstrations over a rise in fuel prices and against a background of deteriorating living standards and endemic corruption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russialed-troops-begin-withdrawal-from-kazakhstan-101642063903751.html

It approved the use of Novavax Inc's vaccine on Wednesday.Since the pandemic began, the country of 52 million people has been among the coronavirus mitigation success stories, with 679,030 cases in all and 6,210 deaths, achieved largely with masks and social distancing.The KDCA reported another record for imported COVID-19 cases for Wednesday, at 391, among a tally for the day of 4,167 infections.The number of South Koreans who tested positive after attending a consumer electronics trade show https://www.reuters.com/business/skorean-officials-test-positive-covid-19-after-attending-ces-trade-show-us-2022-01-12 in Las Vegas last week rose to 119, including some Omicron cases, a KDCA official said.The Omicron variant makes up a small fraction of its overall cases but the share has more than tripled to about 12.5% over the past two weeks.Health officials have warned it could this month become dominant, as it has in the United States and much of Europe, and daily tallies could soar up to an unprecedented 20,000 next month.The government will decide on Friday whether to extend social distancing rules https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/skorea-extend-curbs-amid-omicron-surge-serious-covid-19-cases-2021-12-31, which were reinstated in mid-December after daily infections hit new highs of nearly 8,000.Nearly 90% of South Korean adults have been fully vaccinated and 55% have had a booster shot as of Wednesday, KDCA data showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-to-deploy-pfizer-covid-19-pills-as-omicron-wave-looms-101642063883371.html

According to Our World in Data, the US has been reporting a seven-day rolling average of 2,240 Covid cases while the average daily infections in the United Kingdom currently stands at 22,90.The daily Covid cases in Britain peaked around January 5 as the country’s healthcare system was under tremendous pressure due to record-high hospitalisation. On the other hand, the United States is still to reach the peak of its Omicron-driven Covid wave. The US is currently seeing an average of 750,000 cases a day and more than 1,600 daily deaths. The current virus-related hospital admissions are over 150,000, up by nearly 20 per cent from the previous week, according to The Washington Post figures."Omicron, with its extraordinary, unprecedented degree of efficiency of transmissibility, will ultimately find just about everybody," Joe Biden's chief medical advisor Anthony Fauci predicted Tuesday.With more than 15 million Covid cases reported last week, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that the Omicron variant is dangerous, especially so for those who have not been vaccinated."While Omicron causes less severe disease than Delta, it remains a dangerous virus -- particularly for those who are unvaccinated," WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press conference."We mustn't allow this virus a free ride or wave the white flag, especially when so many people around the world remain unvaccinated."India, meanwhile, reported 247,417 new Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours, taking the cumulative tally to 36,317,927, according to the Union health ministry's data as per Thursday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-uk-reporting-similar-average-daily-covid-cases-per-million-101642052407429.html

Symptoms include bruising or excessive or unusual bleeding, according to the agency.The changes to the fact sheet include recommendations to vaccination providers about giving the J&J shot to people with existing medical conditions, including those who have a low level of platelets, a type of blood cell that helps stop bleeding.J&J said in a statement that “individuals who have been previously diagnosed with ITP should talk to their health-care provider regarding the risk of ITP and the potential need for platelet monitoring following vaccination.”J&J’s vaccine has also been previously connected to rare but serious blood clots, a condition called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or TTS. Women ages 30 to 49 were at the highest risk, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.So far, about 17 million Americans have been given the one-dose vaccine. Last month, the CDC recommended messenger RNA vaccines made by Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc. for use in adults over J&J’s shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jj-vaccine-gets-additional-warning-on-bleeding-aide-effect-101642051271715.html
13-01-2022||World||Explained: Why Wordle game is in news and how to play it||The newest craze on social media is Wordle, a website-only game launched in October last year. While the users have been happy with Wordle, posting their daily scores on Twitter and other platforms, the game has been in the news for wrong reasons.Several developers have created identical versions (or clones) to cash in on surging demand for the game, and unsuspecting users have been downloading these app versions, hence pushing the downloads up for clone apps.But Apple cracked down on these attempts, removing these knockoffs of the original game from its App Store.But what is the game all about? And how can we play it? Here’s everything you need to know about Wordle:The game was created by former Reddit software engineer Josh Wardle, originally for his partner Palak Shah, as reported by NPR. The game can only be played on its official website and does not have a mobile app.It’s a once-a-day online word game and gives a player six chances to guess the day's secret word, which has five letters.The aim is to figure out the secret word with the fewest guesses. If a player successfully guesses the word, he is prompted to post his/her score on social media along with the number of tries.The gameplayAfter guessing a five-letter word, the game tells you whether the letters chosen by you are correct or not. The tiles keep changing colours to shows letters which are not in the word (gray), those present in the word but in wrong position (yellow) and words with right position (green).The word of the day is same for everyone and people can play it only once a day.There is also a “hard mode” on the Wordle website where the game wants the player to use yellow or green letter in subsequent guesses.What’s different in Wordle than other games?Wordle is a free-to-use, ad-less experience on a simple website that does not have to be downloaded from Apple's App Store or Google's PlayStore.Wardle says that the game also doesn’t require sign ups with emails, or personal information, thereby making it safe. As soon as the official website opens, the game appears as a pop-up.Meteoric riseWardle created the game for his partner, and played with her and family members for a few months. After seeing the positive response from his family, the developer released it on a website for the public.From 90 users on November 1, Wordle has been played by 300,000 people in just over two months, according to New York Times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-why-wordle-game-is-in-news-and-how-to-play-it-101642049384907.html
13-01-2022||World||'Finished as working royal': Uncertainty over Prince Andrew's future after US court decision in sexual assault case||After a US judge ruled that the sexual assault lawsuit brought against Prince Andrew can move forward, the Duke of York could be forced to quit up to nine military roles, according to British media reports. Lawyers of Prince Andrew had moved a motion to dismiss the complaint by accuser Virginia Giuffre, but New York judge Lewis Kaplan denied the motion “in all respects".Giuffre alleges that late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein lent her out for sex with his wealthy and powerful associates, including Andrew. The lawyers of the Duke urged the judge to throw out the suit based on the previous $500,000 settlement between Giuffre and Epstein in 2009., saying the accuser had "waived her rights" to sue other defendants in relation to alleged sex crimes committed by Epstein.The New York judge, in his 46-page decision, noted that the deal was "riddled with drafting problems and ambiguities.""The parties have articulated at least two reasonable interpretations of the critical language. The agreement therefore is ambiguous," Kaplan wrote.The decision of the New York judge has caused further embarrassment to the British monarchy and piled up pressure on the Duke to relinquish his military roles. Royal biographer Phil Dampier opined that Prince Andrew is “finished as a working royal”, reported The Sun Online.“It was suggested he would try and get back this year for the 40th anniversary of the Falklands events but that's not going to happen for him the way this is going. It wouldn't surprise me if, in time, he loses his military patronages," The Sun Online quoted Dampier as saying.Andrew's attorneys can still ask the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn Kaplan's decision. If the appeals court upholds the decision, the lawyers could take the case to the US Supreme Court. But legal analysts are skeptical about whether justices would choose to hear it, reported AFP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/finished-as-working-royal-uncertainty-over-prince-andrew-s-future-after-us-court-decision-in-sexual-assault-case-101642047777378.html

This quagmire has led to concerns among Chinese diplomats and experts about the dragon’s relations with the United States.Such concerns were highlighted by China’s longest serving ambassador to the United States, Cui Tianki. Nikkei drew attention to the comments made by Cui at a symposium last month at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, which is used to entertain foreign dignitaries. The candid remarks were peppered with words like “careless” and “incompetent”, noted Nikkei in which Cui asserted that China must be very vigilant while dealing with the US.Taking a dig at China’s “wolf warrior diplomacy”, the diplomat urged China to stop being swayed by US provocations."In principle, we should not fight a war we are not prepared for, a war we are not sure of winning, a war of anger and attrition,” Cui said in the remarks made at the symposium on December 20."In the face of complex situations, we must always have the country at large in mind, and not always think about being an internet celebrity," Cui further said, as reported by Nikkei.The Japan-based newspaper noted that by presenting a sharp analysis of problems with China's diplomacy, Cui differed from other diplomats who play up to President Xi Jinping.The words of caution come against the backdrop of Biden administration's strengthening of ties with allies such as Britain, Japan, Australia and China's neighbour India.China's current tough line on the US has been spearheaded by top diplomat Yang Jiechi, a member of the Chinese Communist Party's powerful Politburo, and Foreign Minister Wang Yi.Speaking at the same event, Wang Yi said China welcomed mutually beneficial cooperation and healthy competition with the US, but was not afraid of confrontation.Cui's message was that China's current diplomacy is missing the grand picture as it busily engages in a war of words, said Nikkei. Instead of tit-for-tat slapping of sanctions, Cui said it would be more prudent for China to establish an environment that allows American companies to remain and flourish in the country, rather than allow firms like Apple and Intel to head back home.Chui served as Chinese ambassador to the US for eight long years, before heading home in June 2021. He observed changes in United States’ China policy under three presidents - Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden. He was given an extension by Xi because of the good access Cui had built to the family and inner circle of US President Trump.By the time Cui left Washington, the relations between the US and China had plunged into crisis. The situation was so harsh that he was even denied meeting with major US leaders to bid them farewell.Hence, the remarks by one of Xi’s most trusted diplomat resonated across China. He said the leadership has locked itself in a "war of attrition" without making careful preparations, driven by emotion, noted Nikkei.Discussions have been going on in China about mending the ties with the US, the most significant of China’s bilateral ties. In 2020, the bilateral trade volume was $615.2 billion, including exports to the US worth $452.58 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/exenvoy-warns-china-on-us-ties-takes-a-dig-at-wolf-warrior-diplomacy-101642046599646.html

While 107,000 Covid vaccine doses were administered on Tuesday, Dube said, appointments for the first dose were taken by people from all age groups.Quebec Premier Francois Legault earlier announced that the province will impose a new health tax in the coming weeks on unvaccinated individuals.The French-speaking province is struggling to control the highly contagious Omicron variant of coronavirus and the government says that the unvaccinated remain a burden on its public health system. While Quebec has administered the first dose of the Covid vaccine to 90 per cent of its eligible population, Legault stressed that the remaining 10 per cent of Quebecois must not harm others."We are working on a health contribution for all the adults who are refusing to get vaccinated" because they represent a "financial burden for all Quebecois," Legault told a press conference."It is not on all Quebecois to pay for that," he said.The provincial government is yet to reveal the details of the penalty to be levied on unvaccinated people but, according to Legault, it wanted the tax to represent a "significant amount".Rights and medical experts have raised concerns about the proposal to fine the unvaccinated. While Canada's Civil Liberties Association said it could violate Canadians' fundamental rights, health advocates expressed concern about its broader implications."I've not seen anything like this in Canada before. I'm worried about the precedent it would set," said Danyaal Raza, a doctor with Unity Health in Toronto and former chair of Canadian Doctors for Medicare, as quoted by Reuters.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/its-encouraging-unvaccinated-tax-in-canada-s-quebec-leads-to-spike-in-first-dose-appointments-101642040787479.html

They lambasted YouTube, saying it frames discussions about disinformation as a “false dichotomy" of deleting or not deleting content.Displaying fact-checked information is more effective than deleting content, the fact checkers wrote. They propose that YouTube focuses on providing context and debunks that are “clearly superimposed” on videos. They also called for YouTube to act against repeat offenders and beef up efforts against misinformation in languages other than English.In a statement, YouTube spokesperson Elena Hernandez said the company has “invested heavily in policies and products in all countries we operate to connect people to authoritative content, reduce the spread of borderline misinformation, and remove violative videos.” She called fact checking “a crucial tool to help viewers make their own informed decisions,” but added that it is “one piece of a much larger puzzle to address the spread of misinformation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fact-checkers-say-youtube-lets-its-platform-be-weaponized-101642037997469.html

As we assess the issue today, the lockdowns are most likely to have an effect isolated in China, because the production facilities in those geographies are principally suppliers to the Chinese market," Deese said on Wednesday.The Chinese government imposed lockdowns in Anyang, Henan province following the emergence of Omicron Covid-19 variants in the city, which has a population of over 5 million people.The lockdown duration is yet to be announced and will be declared separately at a future date.Anyang is the second Chinese city to announce cases from the Omicron variant, following reported cases in Tianjin in December. Taiwan and Hong Kong have also reported Omicron cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-monitoring-china-s-covid-19-lockdown-says-white-house-101642037743580.html
13-01-2022||World||North Korea missile launches: US sanctions Russian national, 7 others||The Biden administration announced on Wednesday that it was imposing sanctions on seven individuals and an entity over North Korea's weapons programs. The action comes after at least two known North Korean ballistic missile tests.Watch: Why the world is worried by North Korean missile testsThe sanctions by the US treasury department target six North Koreans, one Russia and one Russian firm. The department said that they were responsible for procuring goods for the programs from Russia and China.The US Treasury further said that the steps were aimed at preventing the advancement of North Korea's programs as well as impeding its attempts to proliferate weapons technologies.In last one week, North Korea has launched two hypersonic missiles, with its reclusive leader Kim Jong-un urging the military to make more military advances.Kim was even present for the latest test, which was reported by Japan on Tuesday. After watching the test, he urged military scientists to "further accelerate the efforts to steadily build up the country's strategic military muscle both in quality and quantity and further modernise the army," according to KCNA news agency.While announcing the sanctions, the US treasury department said that North Korea has conducted six ballistic missile launches since September, each of which violated UN Security Council resolutions. All ballistic missile tests by North Korean are banned under these resolutions. Under secretary of the treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence Brian Nelson said in a statement that the moves targeted North Korea's "continued use of overseas representatives to illegally procure goods for weapons."North Korea's latest launches were "further evidence that it continues to advance prohibited programs despite the international community's calls for diplomacy and denuclearization," Nelson further said in the statement.The individuals against whom the US has imposed sanctions are:• Choe Myong Hyon, a Russia-based representative of North Korea’s Second Academy of Natural Sciences (SANS)• Sim Kwang Sok, a North Korean based in China, who worked to procure steel alloys• Kim Song Hun, another North Korean based in China (in Shenyang), procured software and chemicals• Two more China-based North Koreans, Kang Chol Hak and Pyon Kwang Chol• Russia-based North Korean O Yong Ho, who the treasury department said worked with other sanctioned nationals and firms to procure multiple goods with ballistic missile applications, including Kevlar thread, aramid fiber, aviation oil, ball bearings, and precision milling machines.• Russian national Roman Anatolyevich AlarThe Russian firm sanctioned by the US treasury department is Parsek LLC.North Korea's UN mission, Russia and China's embassies in Washington and the Russian firm have so far not responded to the US action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-missile-launch-us-sanctions-russian-national-6-others-101642037028268.html
13-01-2022||World||As Delta retreats experts warn darker days lie ahead for US hospitals||The highly infectious omicron variant has flushed out the delta strain across the US, but the ascendance of the purportedly milder form of Covid-19 has done nothing so far to ease the burden on stretched hospitals.The omicron variant represents about 98% of cases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said Tuesday. That number is based on data for the week ending Jan. 8 and is a significant increase from just two weeks prior, when omicron accounted for 71.3% of cases. Omicron’s heightened transmissibility coupled with the immunity some have built to combat the delta through vaccination and exposure, have made conditions favor the “more mild” variant, said David Wohl, a professor at the Institute of Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. But experts warn that for those who remain unvaccinated or who suffer from other health concerns, infection from any Covid-19 variant is a major concern. And without intervention, data signal dark days ahead for a health care system already stretched to its limit, they say. Explained: Why you should still try to avoid Omicron infectionIn many parts of the US, the health care system is “collapsing under the weight of Covid patients,” said Neil Sehgal, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Health. “I started to question whether or not this was the week the health care system would break.”The most recent CDC Nowcast data predict that omicron is dominating caseloads in every region of the country. And while infections appear to be peaking in places that were hit early, such as New York City, the majority of cities are continuing to see infections eclipse previous records and hospitalizations skyrocket. In Maryland, where Sehgal works, some hospitals have moved to crisis standards of care – meaning they have halted certain elective surgeries and redistributed staff. Hospitals in several other states, including Colorado and Oregon, have declared similar crises. Sehgal said that on Tuesday the Maryland Hospital Association pleaded with the public for better adherence to preventative measures, such as masking, and again pushed for vaccinations. Some places are reinstating safety protocols to try to ease the burden on local hospitals. As cases exploded in Utah last week, Salt Lake County health director Angela Dunn issued a county-wide mask mandate, taking the additional step of requiring respirator-type masks, like KN95s, KN90s or KF94s. The county said they would provide the masks at no cost to those who needed them.Preserving the capacity of the healthcare system is crucial, Sehgal said.  “If we don’t act now and we don’t act decisively, it will be too late,” Sehgal said. “Today’s cases are next week’s hospitalizations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-delta-retreats-experts-warn-darker-days-lie-ahead-for-us-hospitals-101642036997928.html

The president, who is up for re-election this year, has been digging in to his position against vaccines. He vowed to not allow his daughter to receive the shot and promised to continue to fight against lockdowns, even as omicron makes landfall in the country, causing cases to surge past 70,000 a day. For most of December, daily infections rarely surpassed the 10,000 mark. What We Know About the Omicron Variant Now: QuickTakeThe rising Covid cases following year-end holidays have filled emergency rooms across the continent-sized nation and led to a massive jump in demand for tests. On Wednesday, private laboratories, hospitals and pharmacy chains like Rede D’Or Sao Luiz SA, Diagnosticos da America SA and Raia Drogasil SA said they were limiting the amount of tests available to the general public, prioritizing hospitalized patients with more severe symptoms, health-care professionals and essential services workers. But while hospitalizations have ticked higher in Brazil in recent weeks, so far there hasn’t been an onslaught of patients seeking intensive care units like in mid-2021, before vaccines were widely available. It’s a similar pattern to that seen in countries from Argentina to South Africa and Denmark, and one that has fueled a change to how some nations approach the pandemic. Despite the seemingly more mild effects of the variant, medical experts warn it could still overburden hospitals and health systems because of how quickly it spreads. Omicron, first spotted in November, has become the dominant strain in many places, including the U.K., U.S., and Brazil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-a-welcome-variant-says-brazil-s-bolsonaro-amid-surge-101642036660002.html
13-01-2022||World||US inflation reaches highest level in four decades as consumer prices jump 7%||Inflation jumped at its fastest pace in nearly 40 years last month, a 7% spike from a year earlier that is increasing household expenses, eating into wage gains and heaping pressure on President Joe Biden and the Federal Reserve to address what has become the biggest threat to the U.S. economy.Prices rose sharply in 2021 for cars, gas, food and furniture as part of a rapid recovery from the pandemic recession. Vast infusions of government aid and ultra-low interest rates helped spur demand for goods, while vaccinations gave people confidence to dine out and travel.As Americans ramped up spending, supply chains remained squeezed by shortages of workers and raw materials and this magnified price pressures.The Labor Department reported Wednesday that a measure of inflation that excludes volatile food and gas prices jumped 5.5% in December, also the highest in decades. Overall inflation rose 0.5% from November, down from 0.8% the previous month.Price gains could slow further as snags in supply chains ease, but most economists say inflation won’t fall back to pre-pandemic levels anytime soon.“U.S. inflation pressures show no sign of easing,’’ said James Knightley, chief international economist at the financial services company ING. “It hasn’t been this high since the days of Thatcher and Reagan. We could be close to the peak, but the risk is that inflation stays higher for longer.’’High inflation isn't only a problem for the U.S. In the 19 European countries that use the euro currency, inflation rose 5% in December compared with a year earlier, the biggest increase on record.Companies large and small are adapting as best they can.Nicole Pomije, a bakery owner in the Minneapolis area, said she plans to raise prices for cookies because of surging ingredient costs.Her basic cookies were priced at 99 cents each, while premium versions were selling for $1.50 each. But Pomije said she will have to jack up the prices of her basic cookies to the premium price.“We have to make money,” she said. “We don’t want to lose our customers. But I think we might.”Businesses struggling to hire have hiked pay, but rising prices for goods and services have eroded those income gains for many Americans. Lower-income families have felt it the most, and polls show that inflation has started displacing even the coronavirus as a public concern.The United States hasn’t seen anything like it since the early 1980s. Back then, Fed Chair Paul Volcker responded by pushing interest rates to painful levels — the prime rate for banks’ best customers hit 20% in 1980 — and sent the economy into a deep recession. But Volcker succeeded in taming inflation that had been running at double-digit year-over-year levels for much of 1979-1981.High inflation has put President Biden on the defensive. His administration, echoing officials at the Fed, initially suggested that price increases would be temporary. Now that inflation has persisted, Biden and some congressional Democrats have begun to blame large corporations. They say meat producers and other industries are taking advantage of pandemic-induced shortages to drive up prices and profits. But even some left-of-center economists disagree with that diagnosis.On Wednesday, the president issued a statement arguing that the drop in gas prices in December and a smaller increase in food costs showed progress.One trend experts fear is a wage-price spiral. That happens when workers seek more pay to offset higher costs, and then companies raise costs further to cover that higher pay. On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told a Senate panel that he has yet to see evidence that wages are broadly driving up prices across the economy.The biggest driver of inflation, according to economists, are mismatches between supply and demand. Used car prices have soared more than 37% over the past year because a shortage of semiconductors has prevented auto companies from making enough new cars. Supply-chain constraints have driven furniture prices nearly 14% higher over the past year.Shoppers are feeling the pinch all around them, from the gas station to the grocery store.Vicki Bernardo Hill, 65, an occupational therapist in Gaithersburg, Maryland, says she no longer throws extra canned food, boxes of cereal or bakery items into her shopping cart at the Giant Food store.“I am trying to stick to my list and buying things that are on sale, ” said Hill.Because she couldn't find a good deal on a used car, Hill recently bought a new Mazda, spending $5,000 more than she had planned.Inflation could ease as the omicron wave fades and as Americans shift more of their spending to services such as travel, eating out and movie-going. That would reduce the demand for goods and help clear supply chains.But some higher prices, such as rents, could prove to be stickier. Rental costs, which have accelerated since summer, rose 0.4% in December, the third consecutive monthly increase. That's significant because housing costs make up one-third of the government's consumer price index.Powell told Congress that if it becomes necessary to fight high inflation more aggressively, the Federal Reserve is prepared to accelerate the interest rate hikes it plans to begin this year. The Fed's benchmark short-term rate, now pegged near zero, is expected to be bumped up at least three times this year.Rate increases would make borrowing for a home or car more expensive, and therefore help to cool off the economy.Some economists and members of Congress fear the Fed has acted too slowly to head off inflation and that this could eventually force even sharper rate increases that could damage the economy.Republicans in Congress and even some liberal economists say Biden deserves at least some of the blame for high inflation, arguing that the financial rescue package he pushed through Congress last March added significant stimulus to an already strengthening economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-inflation-reaches-highest-level-in-four-decades-as-consumer-prices-jump-7-101642035750989.html

After the launch, Kim said North Korea must “further accelerate the efforts to steadily build up the country’s strategic military muscle both in quality and quantity and further modernise the army”, according to North Korea’s news agency KCNA. The Tuesday test, which came as the UN Security Council met in New York to discuss Pyongyang’s weapons programme, sparked swift condemnation, with the US state department branding it a “threat... to the international community”.It was the third reported North Korean test of a hypersonic gliding missile. The first, which took place four months ago, was followed by one last week. KCNA said the most recent test demonstrated “the superior manoeuvrability of the hypersonic glide vehicle”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-urges-more-military-muscle-after-missile-test-101642029182214.html
13-01-2022||World||Reduced hospitalisation risk, shorter stays for Omicron patients: US study||A preliminary US study of nearly 70,000 Covid positive people showed a substantially reduced risk of hospitalisation and death from Omicron even after controlling for growing population immunity levels.People infected with Omicron were half as likely to be hospitalised, about 75 percent less likely to need intensive care, and around 90 percent less likely to die compared to those infected with the formerly dominant Delta variant, according to the paper.Of some 52,000 people infected with Omicron, none ended up on a ventilator, compared to 11 people from nearly 17,000 with Delta.Hospital stays lasted for a median of 1.5 days for Omicron compared to five days for Delta, and 90 percent of Omicron patients were discharged in three or fewer days.The analysis was conducted on data from the Kaiser Permanente Southern California hospital system, which serves a population of around 4.7 million people, between November 30, 2021, and January 1, 2022, when both strains were circulating widely.The findings build on accumulating population-level research from countries including South Africa and Britain, but also on animal and human tissue-based testing, which have found Omicron replicates better in the upper airways compared to the lungs.The new paper, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, was carried out by researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, Kaiser Permanente and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)."This study controlled for important key parameters such as age, sex, prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, prior vaccination and comorbidities," CDC director Rochelle Walensky told reporters on a briefing call Wednesday.The results thus suggest that Omicron is "intrinsically less severe than Delta," and observed reductions in severe cases aren't only the result of more people being vaccinated and infected over time, the paper said.In addition, while the study noted reduced vaccine efficacy against infection from Omicron, it also found substantial ongoing protection against severe outcomes.Walensky warned that the results should not lead to complacency, since Omicron's extreme transmissibility is still stretching the United States' already over-extended health care system and its exhausted health workers.The country is currently seeing an average of 750,000 cases a day -- though that figure is soon expected to exceed a million -- around 150,000 total Covid hospitalisations, and more than 1,600 daily deaths.President Joe Biden's chief medical advisor Anthony Fauci predicted Tuesday that "Omicron, with its extraordinary, unprecedented degree of efficiency of transmissibility, will ultimately find just about everybody."But he added that after the country emerged from its current wave, it would transition towards a future of living with the virus, with Covid vaccines moderating severe disease for the majority and effective treatments available for the most vulnerable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/reduced-hospitalisation-risk-shorter-stays-for-omicron-patients-us-study-101642034064236.html

It has provisions to help bolster Ukraine’s security and encourages the US to “consider all available and appropriate measures” to ensure the Russia-to-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline - a “tool of malign influence of the Russian Federation” - does not become operational.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nato-russia-eye-more-talks-despite-tensions-101642033666644.html

It was not clear how much of the donated wheat would be used as direct humanitarian aid and how much to pay workers in Afghanistan.The expanding programme underlines the growing conundrum faced by the Taliban administration as cash in the country dries up and could raise questions among donors over the use of humanitarian aid for government purposes while strict restrictions remain on financial flows into the country.UN agencies on Tuesday asked donors for $4.4 billion in humanitarian aid for Afghanistan in 2022, calling the funds an “essential stop gap” to ensure the country’s future.“A full-blown humanitarian catastrophe looms. My message is urgent: don’t shut the door on the people of Afghanistan,” said UN aid chief Martin Griffiths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-pay-in-wheat-in-lieu-of-cash-as-economic-crisis-bites-101642028636492.html
13-01-2022||World||Inflation-fighting rate hikes could increase rich-poor divide, warns IMF||Central banks' interest rate hikes aimed at combating inflation could exacerbate a deepening, "dangerous divergence" between advanced and developing economies, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said Wednesday.Inflation is not a universal phenomenon, Georgieva noted, but was a problem in a number of countries and especially the United States. U.S. consumer prices surged 7% in the 12 months to December, the largest annual increase in nearly four decades.The Federal Reserve and others have signaled that rate hikes may be imminent in 2022. The "spillover impact on emerging markets .... can add fuel to the fire of divergence," Georgieva said. Rate hikes in advanced economies raise the cost of borrowing and siphon away investments from emerging markets.Georgieva said in December the IMF was likely to downgrade global economic growth forecasts of 5.9% in 2021 and 4.9% this year due to slowing growth in the United States, China, and the Omicron variant; the revision is expected on Jan. 25."Yes, the recovery is likely to continue, but against stronger winds," she said Wednesday, citing inflation and growing debt levels. Social unrest seen in 2019 was also expected to re-emerge this year, which could pose challenges for policymakers, she added.The IMF is urging countries to keep building up their defenses against the current pandemic and future ones, she said. It is "hugely important" to ensure more diversified production of vaccines and reduce the reliance of Africa and other regions on imports.She said she expects increasing demand for IMF financing this year. The IMF's executive board is slated to discuss on Friday a new Resilience and Sustainability Trust lending instrument backed by the Group of 20 countries in October.The trust will allow rich IMF members to donate their share of $650 billion in new emergency reserves, or Special Drawing Rights, to a broader range of countries in need, including small island states and vulnerable middle-income countries.More details are expected during annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank this spring. (Reporting by Andrea Shalal; additional reporting by David Lawder; Editing by Heather Timmons and Jonathan Oatis)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/inflationfighting-rate-hikes-could-increase-rich-poor-divide-warns-imf-101642024846294.html
