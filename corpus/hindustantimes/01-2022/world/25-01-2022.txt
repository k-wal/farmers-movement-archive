This is the first time since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic that a comprehensive global sporting event is held as scheduled. It is a successful example of acting upon the new Olympic motto: ‘Faster, Higher, Stronger - Together,’” Xi said.Nearly 3,000 athletes from about 90 countries and regions will compete at the Beijing Olympics.Xi said that in conformity with the “athletes-centred” concept, China has spared no efforts in the construction of venues and infrastructure as well as services for the Games.“China is confident of ensuring the safety of all Games participants, relevant personnel and the Chinese people,” he added.The Games will take place from February 4-20 inside a “closed-loop” separating athletes and other participants from outsiders, and tickets will not be sold to the public.China has all but shut its borders to international arrivals to curtail Covid-19 though a small outbreak of 67 domestic cases – a mix of Omicron and Delta variants – recorded in Beijing since January 15 have put the city authorities on an “emergency” mode.Xi and Bach talked about Covid-19 countermeasures at the Games and Bach told Xi that “China is now a winter sports country, and this is the start of a new era for global winter sports”, according to a readout on the IOC website.“Some countries are sending athletes to the Olympic Winter Games for the first time, which fully demonstrates the extensive support of the international community for the Beijing 2022 Games,” Bach said according to the Chinese readout, adding that it was in contrast to the overwhelming international opposition to the politicisation of sports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-xi-meets-ioc-chief-bach-ahead-of-winter-olympics-101643121267105.html
25-01-2022||World||China’s claims in SCS inconsistent with int’l law: US||The US on Monday reiterated its rejection of China’s expansive maritime claims in the South China Sea as “inconsistent with international law” and called on Beijing to cease its “unlawful and coercive activities” in the region.Two US state department officials reiterated their opposition to Beijing’s actions in the maritime space at an interaction to highlight a recent official report disproving the legal basis of China’s claims in South China Sea. It is the 150th report in the Limits of Seas series prepared by the department, and is a follow-up of an earlier 2014 report that had examined and rejected China’s claims in the South China Sea.The disputed waterway is one of many areas of tension between the United States and China, which claims a large swathe of the waters and has built military bases on artificial islands there.The South China Sea, crossed by vital shipping lanes and also containing gas fields and rich fishing grounds, is also claimed by Taiwan, while Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines claim parts of it.Jung Pak, the deputy assistant secretary of state for multilateral affairs in the bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said that China’s claims gravely undermine the rule of law in the ocean.Claiming that in recent years, China had “stepped up its coercive activities in the South China Sea by increasing its deployment of maritime militias…to harass and intimidate other claimant states”, she said, “These actions represent a systemic and calculated effort to interfere with the rights and freedoms, including the navigational rights and freedoms, that all countries enjoy under international law.”Additionally, acting deputy assistant secretary of state for Oceans, Fisheries, and Polar Affairs in the Bureau of Oceans, Environment, and Scientific Affairs Constance C Arvis said that China had offered “no coherent legal basis” for its claims.She reiterated the US call to China to “conform its maritime claims to international law as reflected in the Law of the Sea Convention, to comply with the July 12, 2016 decision of the arbitral tribunal in the South China Sea arbitration, and to cease its unlawful and coercive activities in the South China Sea”. The 2016 decision refers to an international arbitration ruling in a dispute between Philippines and China, which the latter has not accepted.Arvis said that the new report provided a deeper analytical basis to uphold the existing US position on the issue, and provides further basis to allies and partners to push back on Chinese claims. “We definitely are not accepting a fait accompli,” she said.Pak added that the report highlighted the US commitment to the Indo-Pacific region, and said that as long as there were “unlawful infringements of maritime rights and freedoms”, the US would continue to uphold those rights and support allies and partners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-claims-in-scs-inconsistent-with-int-l-law-us-101643120126458.html
25-01-2022||World||China: Tragic story of twice-abandoned teen’s suicide triggers online sympathy||The alleged death by suicide of a 17-year-old who was sold by his parents after birth and said to have been rejected by them after a reunion only last month has prompted an outpouring of sympathy on Chinese social media.Liu Xuezhou, who lived and grew up in the central Chinese province of Hebei, posted a lengthy note about the unexpected developments in his life in the early hours of Monday on China’s Twitter-like Sina Weibo micro-blog platform, indicating that he had decided to end his life, alerting his many followers.Liu’s body was later found by the police on a beach in the southern city of Sanya on Monday.State media reports said Liu was sold to a child trafficker by his biological parents when he was three months old as he had been born out of wedlock; his adoptive parents died in an accident when he was four years old.He had since been living with relatives of his adoptive parents and learned from them about his adoption.In December, Liu released a video stating that he was looking for his birth parents after reading about another family reunion where the son had been abducted 14 years earlier, state-run China Daily newspaper said in a report.Liu said in his video that he was born between 2004 and 2006 and was sold at about 3 months old in Datong, Shanxi province.Liu also mentioned he was bullied at school and met a “perverted male teacher” at his middle school in Nangong, Hebei, implying he was sexually molested, the news report said.Liu’s plea was picked up by the police who helped track down his biological parents with old records and DNA samples.The reunion was widely followed on China’s social media and several photos and videos of Liu and his biological parents were published online. The happy reunion, however, was short-lived.Liu found that his biological parents were divorced and neither apparently wanted Liu around. “Liu said in his note that he told his mother he wanted a ‘home’ but she accused him of forcing her to buy him real estate and blocked him on the WeChat social media platform, according to a Sina Weibo post from Jan 18,” the China Daily report said.Liu’s death sparked a heated discussion online on issues like child trafficking, cyber bullying safety in schools.Many sympathised for Liu and condemned internet trolls.Zhou Zhaocheng, a Beijing lawyer, said child abduction and abandonment can be prosecuted and if the police find relevant evidence, Liu’s biological parents are likely to be charged.(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.

25-01-2022||World||Russia adds Putin critic Alexei Navalny to ‘terrorists and extremists’ list||Russia on Tuesday added jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny to a list of “terrorists and extremists”, as authorities continue a clampdown on the opposition.Navalny and several of his allies, including key aide Lyubov Sobol, appeared Tuesday on a database of banned individuals compiled by the Federal Service for Financial Monitoring (Rosfinmonitoring).According to Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation – which was declared extremist and shut down last year – nine other Navalny allies were added to the list on Tuesday.The decision puts them on a par with right-wing nationalist groups and foreign terrorist organisations, including the Taliban and the so-called Islamic State group.Earlier this month, two other key aides of the opposition politician were added to the list.The past year has seen an unprecedented crackdown on dissent in Russia, including the jailing of President Vladimir Putin's top critic Navalny last January and the outlawing of his political organisations.Almost all of his top allies have since fled the country.Navalny -- Putin's most vocal domestic opponent -- has been behind bars since returning to Moscow in January 2021 from Germany, where he was recovering from a poisoning attack with a nerve agent that he blames on the Kremlin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-adds-putin-critic-alexei-navalny-to-terrorists-and-extremists-list-101643103794400.html

An autopsy is expected on Tuesday.In a statement released on Monday, Manitoba Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said, “We are aware that some media outlets are publishing the possible identities of the four victims. As a law enforcement organisation, we will not be in a position to confirm these names until we have 100% certainty of their identities and next of kin notification is completed.”The RCMP said that it continued to work “to confirm the identities of the four victims who were located on Wednesday, January 19, 2022, near the town of Emerson, Manitoba.” It said investigators were working closely with the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of Manitoba and pursuing other investigative avenues to confirm the names. “We are also in regular contact with Indian consular officials who have arrived in Manitoba. Once the identities have been confirmed, our priority will be to formally notify the next of kin,” the statement said.A two-member team from the Indian consulate in Toronto is in Winnipeg to coordinate with local officials and law enforcement. They will remain there till the identities are confirmed and procedural formalities completed for transportation of the mortal remains back to India.Meanwhile, a prarthana sabha or prayer meeting was organised on Monday evening by the Indo-Canadian community in Manitoba. Winnipeg-based Hemant Shah, one of the organisers, said the prayers were being offered as four young lives were lost and described the incident as “very tragic and devastating”.“Our hearts are crying. Everybody is shocked across Canada, not just in Manitoba,” he said.The bodies of the four victims, an infant, a teenaged boy and two adults, were found just about 10km from the US border and they may have succumbed due to a human smuggling operation gone wrong.Seven other Indian nationals, linked to the tragic quartet found dead on the Canadian side of the border, were apprehended in the United States. One person, a 47-year-old resident of Florida Steve Shand was arrested by US authorities for allegedly “smuggling undocumented foreign nationals”.On January 19 morning, Manitoba RCMP received “concerning information” from their counterparts that the US Customs and Border Protection had apprehended a group of individuals who had crossed into the US from Canada, near the town of Emerson in Manitoba”.A search began and four hours later, at about 1.30pm, RCMP officers found the bodies of three individuals were located on the Canadian side of the border, close to Emerson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-border-deaths-shaken-indo-canadian-community-holds-prayer-meeting-101643094375343.html

It has now been reported that Biden called the journalist soon after and apologised for the moment, saying it wasn't “personal, pal.”The incident occurred on Monday evening on the sidelines of a White House event. Fox News reporter Peter Doocy attempted to ask the US President if inflation was a political liability for him. Probably unware of the mic being on, Biden replied, “No, it's a great asset - more inflation. What a stupid son of a b****.”Doocy said that the US President reached out to him “within an hour” of the incident with the apology. “He called my cell phone and he just said ‘It’s nothing personal, pal',” the Fox News reporter told talk show host Sean Hannity.

The site where the world’s worst nuclear disaster took place is a potential entry point for Russia, the report said.The isolated zone in site located in northern part of Ukraine falls on the shortest route from Russia to its capital Kiev. The meltdown of a nuclear reactor happened in Chernobyl in 1986.The site hosts ghost towns and fallow fields, decades after the nuclear disaster. The Ukrainian army is carrying weapons as well as equipment to detect radiation in the area, according to New York Times report.Lieutenant Colonel Yuri Shakhraichuk of the Ukrainian border guard service told The New York Times: “It doesn't matter if it is contaminated or nobody lives here.” He added, “It is our territory, our country, and we must defend it.”The soldiers are required to wear a device around their necks which will check the levels of radiation. In case soldiers wander into a highly irradiated area, they will be taken off duty.None of the troops have suffered exposure to high doses so far, Colonel Shakhraichuk told The New York Times.The forces deployed in Chernobyl won’t be able to repel an invasion, they have been sent there to detect warning signs, Colonel Shakhraichuk further said.The move to send army to Chernobyl in view of the aggressive tactics adopted by Russia ignited emotional reactions from those who battled to control fire at the nuclear plant 1986.Among them is Ivan Kovalchuk, a Ukrainian firefighter. "How can this be? We liquidated the accident together. For them to do this to us now just makes me feel sorry for people in Ukraine," he told The New York Times.The town of Chernobyl is still partially occupied by workers who live on rotations to maintain the safety apparatus in place. One such workers told the New York Times, “We don’t know what will kill us first, the virus, radiation or war.”Meanwhile, Russia has maintained that it has no intention of invading Ukraine and accuses the West of ratcheting up tensions in the region. The Kremlin has, however, reiterated its demand that Nato allies should remove their forces and weapons from sites near the former Soviet Republic - like Ukraine.The tension has led to the US issuing warning to its citizens to not travel to Russia. It has also brought back embassy staff from Kiev.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-tension-at-border-ukraine-sends-soldiers-to-defend-chernobyl-101643089976896.html

It is China that has changed, not Australia that has changed.”“I don’t ... blame the government and never have for the current circumstances,” Albanese added.Morrison is the third prime minister of the conservative coalition since 2013 when Albanese was the deputy prime minister of a Labor government that was voted out of office.The first conservative Prime Minister Tony Abbott hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping during a Canberra visit in 2014 that marked a high point in bilateral relations.But relations soured when Abbott’s successor Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced in 2017 updated treason and espionage laws that would outlaw covert foreign interference in politics.Throughout Morrison’s tenure, which began in 2018, Chinese ministers have refused to speak to their Australian counterparts while key Australian exports including coal, wine and barley have been disrupted.Exporters have generally supported the government’s willingness to risk angering China through policies such as calling for an independent investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic.Albanese said a Labor government would deal with China “in a mature way. Not by being provocative for the sake of it to make a domestic political point.”“I don’t argue that a change of government will simply change the relationship. Because that’s just something that we have to deal with,” Albanese said.Albanese said the three pillars of a Labor government’s foreign policy would be Australia’s alliance with the United States, engagement with regional partners and engagement in multilateral forums including the United Nations.Albanese was critical of government cuts to aid spending in the Asia-Pacific region which had helped China increase its influence in the region.“It was very short sighted for this government to withdraw from aid in the Pacific in the way that they did,” Albanese said.“If Australia and democratic nations withdraw, guess what? There are others who may want to fill that gap,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-relations-won-t-change-even-if-my-party-wins-aus-oppn-leader-albanese-101643085520266.html
25-01-2022||World||Covid: why some people with symptoms don’t get tested||Testing people with Covid symptoms has been a pillar of the UK’s pandemic response, reducing transmission by identifying and isolating those with the virus. But to be effective, it relies on people with symptoms getting tested, which raises an obvious question: what proportion of symptomatic people actually take a test?The ZOE Covid Study, which is funded by the government and run by a group including King’s College London and the city’s Guy’s and St Thomas’ hospitals, is uniquely positioned to answer this question. Each day more than 4 million participants in the UK report any symptoms they are feeling via the study’s app, and record the results of any recent Covid tests.Testing rules have evolved during the pandemic, but one rule has remained consistent: if you have one of the main three symptoms of Covid listed by the NHS (fever, a persistent new cough, or loss of taste or smell) but don’t otherwise know if you have the virus, you should take a PCR test. And by analysing the study’s data, my colleagues and I have been able to see what proportion of participants experiencing any of these symptoms then go on to have a test shortly after their symptoms appear.The results were surprising. In December 2020 we found that 25% of those who reported one of the three core symptoms didn’t report a PCR result shortly afterwards, suggesting they weren’t getting tested. This was despite there being plenty of spare testing capacity at the time.Armed with this information, we then sent out a survey to a sample of 4,000 users in the UK who had had symptoms but no test, to better understand why they didn’t get tested. We found this was mostly down to three reasons.Firstly, people were less likely to get tested if they had only one of the three symptoms or if their symptoms lasted only a day. This suggests people might have the erroneous view that their illness is unlikely to be Covid if their symptoms are brief or mild.We also found that 40% of our respondents couldn’t identify all three of the symptoms that qualify you to get a Covid test. Older groups were less likely to know: 80% of respondents aged 25-34 could identify all three symptoms, but just 25% of those 75 and over could.Plus, even when individuals knew they should get a test, we found they weren’t always able to. Of those that wanted but failed to get one, the most common reason provided was, “I did not know where to go in order to get tested”. Other common reasons were “I was not able to get to a testing location” and “I tried to get a test but was not able to get one”.Together, these results demonstrate that knowledge is often a barrier to getting tested for Covid. People may not know that their mild illness could still be Covid, they may not realise that their symptoms mean they should get a test, and even if they want a test, they may not know how to get one.Expanding the symptom listThese findings could have big consequences. It’s important that we identify and isolate as many cases of Covid as possible to help reduce the spread of the disease. People that don’t get tested may continue their daily lives, unwittingly infecting people at home and at work.Our results show that educating the public is crucial for increasing test take-up. Efforts need to be made to inform the public that even mild symptoms can be Covid, to teach them what these symptoms are, and how they might get tested. It might help to target this messaging at older populations, who are less likely to know what symptoms qualify them for a test.Recently, there have been calls to expand the list of symptoms that qualify someone for a Covid test, based on evidence that with variants such as omicron and delta, many infected people have symptoms other than the core three. While this approach may be sensible, our results indicate that extensive efforts will be needed to educate the public about any new set of symptoms to ensure that people experiencing them do get tested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-why-some-people-with-symptoms-don-t-get-tested-101643082648210.html

The US Navy said in a statement that the incident happened in the South China Sea during a routine flight operation."An F-35C Lightning II, assigned to Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 2, had a landing mishap on deck while USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) was conducting routine flight operations in the South China Sea, Jan. 24, 2022. The pilot safely ejected from the aircraft and was recovered via US military helicopter," the US Pacific Fleet said in the statement.The statement further said that out of the seven injured sailors, were evacuated to Manila, Philippines for treatment, where their condition was listed as stable. The other four, said the US Navy, were treated by on-board medical personnel.No details were provided on the cause of the incident or the fate of the aircraft. The Pacific Fleet said the incident was under investigation.The Vinson and another US carrier, the USS Abraham Lincoln, and their strike groups began drills on Sunday in the South China Sea, following exercises with a Japanese naval ship in the Philippine Sea last week.The South China Sea is among China's most sensitive territorial issues and is a frequent area of tension between the United States and China.The news of the US operations coincides with Taiwan reporting the latest mass incursion by China's air force into its air defence identification zone - 39 aircraft - in an area close to the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands in the northern reaches of the South China Sea.Taiwan also reported an anti-submarine Y-8 in the Bashi Channel which separates the country from the Philippines and connects the Pacific to the South China Sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/f35-jet-crashes-on-us-aircraft-carrier-in-south-china-sea-7-injured-101643081391585.html
25-01-2022||World||US, Europe declare 'unity' against Russia over Ukraine||President Joe Biden declared "total" unity among Western powers Monday after crisis talks with European leaders on deterring Russia from an attack against Ukraine, while the Pentagon said 8,500 US troops were put on standby for possible deployment to boost NATO."I had a very, very, very good meeting -- total unanimity with all the European leaders," Biden told reporters shortly after finishing a one hour and 20 minute video conference with allied leaders from Europe and NATO.In London, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's office also said "the leaders agreed on the importance of international unity in the face of growing Russian hostility."German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said "it is up to Russia to undertake visible de-escalation," while NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned of "severe costs" if there is "any further aggression" by Moscow against Ukraine.Also on the call were the leaders of France, Italy, Poland and the European Union.Despite insisting he has no intention of attacking, President Vladimir Putin has deployed some 100,000 troops close to Ukraine, where Russia already seized Crimea in 2014 and backs a separatist army in the east.Moscow is demanding a guarantee that Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, never be allowed to join NATO, as well as other concessions by the United States in return for a decrease in tension.The United States and NATO have rejected the Russian demands and told Putin to withdraw from Ukraine's borders, warning that a Russian attack will trigger damaging economic sanctions, as well as a beefed-up NATO presence in eastern Europe.In Washington, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said a force of up to 8,500 US troops was on "heightened alert" for potential deployment to reinforce any activation of the NATO Response Force in the region, where there are growing fears of spillover from the Ukraine conflict."What this is about... is re-assurance to our NATO allies," Kirby said. "It sends a very clear signal to Mr. Putin that we take our responsibilities to NATO seriously."NATO also said it was sending jets and ships to bolster its eastern flank.The tension helped fuel instability in global markets, while Russia's main stock index plunged and the central bank suspended foreign currency purchasing after the ruble slumped.The French government announced that Russian and Ukrainian officials would meet, along with French and German counterparts, in Paris on Wednesday to try to find a way out of the impasse.President Emmanuel Macron "thinks there is a space for diplomacy, a path to de-escalation," an aide said, confirming that Macron would speak to Putin "in the coming days."- Unity search -Washington is trying to maintain transatlantic unity to build a credible threat of sanctions as a deterrence against Moscow.However, members of the 27-nation European Union have starkly differing approaches and ties to Russia, which supplies about 40 percent of the trade bloc's natural gas supplies.The new government in EU economic powerhouse Germany in particular has faced criticism from Kyiv over its refusal to send defensive weapons to Ukraine, as well as hesitating over one of the harshest economic sanctions under discussion -- cutting Moscow from the global SWIFT payments system.Echoing other US warnings, Kirby said on Monday that intelligence shows "it's very clear that the Russians have no intention right now of de-escalating."However, some European leaders are signaling less alarm.EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said after talks with US top diplomat Antony Blinken that there was nothing to suggest an "immediate" Russian attack."You have to stay calm doing what you have to do, and avoid a nervous breakdown," he said.While Britain and Australia followed the United States in ordering diplomats' families to leave Kyiv, the EU and the Ukrainian government said any withdrawal of foreign embassy personnel was premature.France told citizens to avoid non-essential travel to the country.- NATO troops 'on standby' -The US-led NATO alliance said members were placing troops "on standby" and sending ships and jets to bolster eastern Europe's defenses, pointing to recent mobilizations by Denmark, Spain and the Netherlands.Stoltenberg said the alliance "will continue to take all necessary measures to protect" members.The Kremlin accused NATO of "hysteria."It also claimed that Ukrainian troops fighting Russian-backed separatists in the east of the country could launch an offensive, prompting President Volodymyr Zelensky's office to say that Ukraine will not "succumb to provocations."The United States has warned that Moscow could manufacture a "false flag" incident in Ukraine to be able to then frame an invasion as a justified response.Non-NATO member Ireland meanwhile sounded the alarm over upcoming Russian military exercises off its southwest coast in international waters of the Atlantic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-europe-declare-unity-against-russia-over-ukraine-101643080027624.html

We had a small bottle of water between us," one driver who identified himself only as Christos told private Star TV."Everything is frozen stiff."The army, firefighters and police began work to free the stranded motorists in the early evening.Greece's climate crisis and civil protection minister Christos Stylianides apologised for the chaos and blamed the company managing the motorway for not keeping it open.A cold snap with sub-zero temperatures and gale-force winds last hit Athens in February 2021, killing four people on the islands of Evia and Crete and leaving tens of thousands of households without electricity for days.Kostas Lagouvardos, research director at the National Observatory of Athens, told ANT1 TV that the capital had not seen back-to-back winters like this since 1968.The snow uncharacteristically fell on several Aegean Sea islands, isolating some mountain villages on Andros, Naxos and Tinos, and covering beaches in Mykonos, in summer a party island.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europes-busiest-airport-shut-down-amid-snow-havoc-in-southeast-europe-101643079397183.html
25-01-2022||World||Facebook parent Meta creates powerful AI supercomputer||Facebook’s parent company Meta on Monday said it has created what it believes is among the fastest artificial intelligence supercomputers running today.The social media giant said it hopes the machine will help lay the groundwork for its building of the metaverse, a virtual reality construct intended to supplant the internet as we know it today.Facebook said it believes the computer will be the fastest in the world once it is fully built around the middle of the year.Supercomputers are extremely fast and powerful machines built to do complex calculations not possible with a regular home computer. Meta did not disclose where the computer is located or how much it is costing to build.The computer, which is already up and running but is still being built, is called AI Research SuperCluster. Meta says it will help its AI researchers build “new and better” artificial intelligence models that can learn from “trillions” of examples and work across hundreds of different languages simultaneously and analyze text, images and video together.The way Meta is defining the power of its computer is different from how conventional and more technically powerful supercomputers are measured because it relies on the performance of graphics-processing chips, which are useful for running “deep learning” algorithms that can understand what’s in an image, analyze text and translate between languages, said Tuomas Sandholm, a computer science professor and co-director of the AI center at Carnegie Mellon University.“We hope RSC will help us build entirely new AI systems that can, for example, power real-time voice translations to large groups of people, each speaking a different language, so they can seamlessly collaborate on a research project or play an AR game together,” Meta said in a blog post.The company said its supercomputer will incorporate “real-world examples” from its own systems into training its AI. It says its previous efforts used only open-source and other publicly available data sets.“They are going to, for the first time, put their customer data on their AI research computer,” Sandholm said. “That would be a really big change to give AI researchers and algorithms access to all that data.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-parent-meta-creates-powerful-ai-supercomputer-101643079315687.html

No excuse is understandable or accepted. The girls of the country must return to the school," Karzai said in an interview with American news network CNN."Women should return to work. Our religion allows it. Period...No compromise on the principles or rights. Or running the country better," he added.This comes as talks are underway in the capital city of Norway over wide-ranging issues concerning the fate of Afghanistan.A Taliban delegation, led by Acting Afghanistan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, met with envoys of western nations in Oslo on Monday. Prior to that, the Taliban delegation also met with members of the civil society.Karzai backed these meetings, which experts believe could play a vital role in solving the problems in the country."We have happy about the meetings that have taken place in Norway among Afghans between the Taliban government representatives and members of the civil society. We had some very constructive talks. Notes were changed," the former Afghan President said.For the good of Afghanistan, Karzai said a parallel track of two activities must happen at the same time."We...must begin to work out a stable and peaceful Afghanistan by incorporating the opinion and aspiration of all other Afghans, by enacting a constitution, by moving forward with opening schools for girls this March," he said.While supporting the issue of girls' education, the former president said, "we all sit among ourselves and understand each other and work with one another, despite the differences we have."Afghanistan is contending with drought, a pandemic, an economic collapse and the effects of years of conflict. Some 24 million people are experiencing acute food insecurity. Reports indicate that one million children could die of starvation.According to UN estimates, more than half of the population will be facing famine this winter, and 97 per cent of the population could fall below the poverty line this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-girls-must-return-to-school-when-they-reopen-in-march-hamid-karzai-101643076352800.html

With omicron spreading more than twice as fast as the delta strain that cause the last surge, experts say new cases may exceed 10,000 this week and possibly 20,000 after the Lunar New Year’s holiday break that begins this weekend and continues to next Wednesday.To prevent a sudden explosion of infections from overwhelming hospitals and disrupting workplaces and essential services, South Korea will reduce quarantine periods, expand testing and treat more people at home.From Wednesday, the quarantine periods for people who test positive after being fully vaccinated will be reduced from the current 10 days to seven days. Fully vaccinated people who comes in close contact with virus carriers won't be placed under quarantine. Officials are also planning to treat a larger number of mild or moderate cases at home and expand the use of rapid antigen tests to detect more infections sooner.Omicron has become the dominant variant in many countries and more easily infects those who have been vaccinated or had Covid-19 previously. But vaccination and booster shots still provide strong protection from serious illness, hospitalization and death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-sees-highest-single-day-spike-of-8k-covid-cases-101643074998929.html

Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said that US defense secretary Lloyd Austin's order to place 8,500 military personnel to heightened preparedness would allow America to rapidly deploy additional brigade combat teams, along with units.Kirby told reporters that giving time to prepare the US military personnel enough time to prepare makes “prudent sense” in case Nato activates its Response Force as Russia has “no intention right now of de-escalating”. The US forces placed on alert would be in addition to the significant combat-capable troops already based in Europe “to deter aggression and enhance the alliance’s ability to defend allies and defeat aggression if necessary,” said Kirby."Again, I want to reinforce that as of now the decision has been made to put these units on higher alert and higher alert only," Kirby said. "No decisions have been made to deploy any forces from the United States at this time."‘Leave Ukraine’: US tells American citizens, families of diplomats amid tensionsWhile Russia has denied intention to invade Ukraine, its aggression along the border has caused concern to the West, prompting a visit to Kyiv by US state secretary Antony Blinken and meeting with European allies. US President Joe Biden also held what he called a “great” call with European leaders as they work to strike a unified position on Russia.Biden had said that the US, in case of an invasion, would respond with stringent economic sanctions but the latest order indicates that the US President wants to send a stronger military message to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, as fears of invasion grow."As [President Joe Biden] has made clear, the United States will act firmly in defence of its national interests in response to actions by Russia that harm us, our allies or partners," the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ukraine-crisis-8-500-us-troops-on-heightened-alert-as-russia-shows-no-intention-deescalating-101643073945486.html

Then, Peter Doocy of Fox News shouted a question about inflation.“Do you think you think inflation is a political liability in the midterms?” Doocy asked.“No -- that’s a great asset,” Biden deadpanned. “What a stupid son of a b----.”Biden had been discussing his administration’s efforts to discourage greater corporate consolidation and how that would reduce inflation, which has became a threat to Democratic prospects in next fall’s elections for the House and Senate.Doocy frequently asks combative questions of the president and his press secretary, Jen Psaki. On Fox News later, he made light of the exchange. “And now we’ll just have to wait and see if the White House has to bleep that on the transcript,” Doocy joked, adding that he’d only learned about Biden’s comments after he’d left the room and other reporters repeated them back to him. “The clip will now live on,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-bristles-at-fox-inflation-query-with-hot-mic-expletive-101643071141706.html

25-01-2022||World||US asks its citizens to leave Ukraine||As diplomatic talks over Ukraine fail to yield a breakthrough, and tensions with Russia deepen, the United States ordered family members of its diplomats to leave Ukraine, and advised all US citizens to do the same, citing “the increased threat of Russian military action”.The US, Britain and Australia ordered diplomats’ families to leave Kyiv, while France told its citizens to avoid non-essential travel to Ukraine.Both Kyiv and the European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said any withdrawal of diplomatic personnel appeared premature.In an advisory on Sunday night, the US state department authorised the “voluntary departure” of US direct hire employees, and “ordered the departure of eligible family members” from its embassy in Kiev “due to the continued threat of Russian military action”.The advisory added that US citizens in Ukraine “should consider departing now using commercial or other privately available transportation options”.The US is weighing sending as many as 5,000 troops to Nato allies in the Baltic and Eastern Europe as concerns mount that Russia might invade Ukraine, US media reported on Monday.The possible deployment could involve 1,000 to 5,000 troops, along with naval vessels and aircraft, according to the New York Times. It said the number could rise sharply if conditions deteriorate.CNN said the Pentagon is identifying which units would go but that the final decision to deploy them has not been taken.The option came out of discussions on the Ukraine crisis between US President Joe Biden and his advisors, including defence secretary Lloyd Austin, over the weekend. US officials, speaking anonymously, said that they are consulting with allies on deployments and studying all scenarios.Nato said on Monday it was sending jets and ships to bolster its eastern European flank, as the US and EU looked to coordinate a tough response to Russia if it invades Ukraine. Tensions have soared over Russia’s deployment of some 100,000 troops and heavy armour at its neighbour’s borders, despite the Kremlin’s insistence it is not planning a new incursion almost eight years after it seized Crimea.Meanwhile, Top US diplomat Antony Blinken on Monday dialled in to a meeting of his EU counterparts in Brussels to brief them on his meeting on Friday with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, where they failed to make a breakthrough but agreed to keep talking.EU foreign ministers were sounding out Blinken over a written response Washington has committed to provide to Moscow this week after the Kremlin laid down a series of security demands, including preventing Ukraine joining Nato and rolling back the alliance’s forces in eastern Europe.“Nato will continue to take all necessary measures to protect and defend all allies,” chief Jens Stoltenberg said.The Kremlin accused the alliance of ramping up tensions through “information hysteria” and “concrete actions”, claiming the risk of an offensive by Ukrainian troops fighting Russian-backed separatists in the east of the country was “very high”.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged his western partners to “preserve the unity of all EU member states in protecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our state”.European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc was preparing a 1.2-billion-euro emergency financial aid package for Ukraine.(With inputs from agencies)
25-01-2022||World||Burkina Faso military coup: Junta says it has now seized power||More than a dozen mutinous soldiers declared Monday on state television that a military junta now controls Burkina Faso after they detained the democratically elected president following a day of gunbattles in the capital.The military coup is the third of its kind in West Africa in the last 18 months, creating upheaval in some of the countries hardest hit by Islamic extremists attacks.Capt. Sidsore Kaber Ouedraogo said the Patriotic Movement for Safeguarding and Restoration "has decided to assume its responsibilities before history.” They cited the deteriorating security situation amid the deepening Islamic insurgency and the president’s inability to manage the crisis.It was not immediately known where President Roch Marc Christian Kabore was, and the junta spokesman said only that the coup had taken place “without any physical violence against those arrested, who are being held in a safe place, with respect for their dignity.”He said the new military leaders would work to establish a calendar “acceptable to everyone” for holding new elections without giving further details.The announcement on state broadcaster RTB capped a day of confusion over who was in control of Burkina Faso, once a bastion of stability in the region that has faced growing violence from Islamic extremists during Kabore's time in power.In a statement, Kabore's political party accused the mutinous soldiers of trying to assassinate the president and another government minister and said the presidential palace in Ouagadougou remained surrounded by "heavily armed and hooded men.”Gunfire erupted early Sunday when soldiers took control of a major military barracks in the capital, Ouagadougou. In response, civilians rallied in a show of support for the rebellion but were dispersed by security forces firing tear gas. Burkina Faso has seen a series of anti-government protests as anger has mounted over the handling of the Islamic insurgency.Groups of people celebrated again in the streets of the capital Monday morning after reports of Kabore's capture.Kabore was elected in 2015 after a popular uprising ousted longtime strongman President Blaise Compaore. Kabore was reelected in November 2020, but frustration has been growing at his inability to stem the spread of jihadist violence across the country. Attacks linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group are escalating, killing thousands and displacing more than an estimated 1.5 million people.The military has suffered losses since the extremist violence began in 2016. In December, more than 50 security forces were killed and nine more died in November.Mutinous soldiers told the AP that the government was out of touch with troops and that they wanted military rule. Among their demands are more forces in the battle against extremists and better care for the wounded and the families of the dead.About 100 military members have planned the takeover since August, according to one of the mutinous soldiers.Sahel experts say the government was overstretched, but it’s unlikely the mutiny will change anything.“Burkina Faso’s army is profoundly ill-equipped and unprepared for the war it’s asked to fight. It’s out of its depth. Its frustration with an equally out-of-its-depth government is understandable. Regrettably, this is unlikely to improve anything,” said Michael Shurkin, a former political analyst at the CIA and director of global programs at 14 North Strategies, a business intelligence consultancy based in Senegal.But as protests over the weekend and on Monday showed, discontent among the general population is also growing.“People are tired with this situation of insecurity. Every day, people are killed. In Burkina, there are areas that can’t be accessed. We have lost a big part of our territory,” said Jean-Baptiste Ilboudou, a civilian who was biking near the military base when gunshots were heard.The West African regional bloc known as ECOWAS, which already has suspended Mali and Guinea in the past 18 months over military coups, issued a statement of support for Burkina Faso’s embattled president and urged dialogue with the mutineers.Burkina Faso has also seen its share of coup attempts and military takeovers — though it experienced a period of relative stability under Compaore, who ruled for 27 years until his ouster in 2014.Earlier this month, authorities arrested a group of soldiers accused of participating in a foiled coup plot. It was not immediately known whether there was any connection between those soldiers and the ones rebelling now. Military prosecutors said nine soldiers and two civilians were being held in connection with the plot.In 1987, Compaore came to power by force. And in 2015, soldiers loyal to him attempted to overthrow the transitional government put into place after his ouster. The army was ultimately able to put the transitional authorities back in power, who led again until Kabore won an election and took office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/burkina-faso-military-coup-junta-says-it-has-now-seized-power-101643048771193.html
25-01-2022||World||Yemen’s Houthi rebels threaten to expand operations against UAE, Saudi Arabia||Yemen’s Houthi rebels targeted Abu Dhabi again on Monday and threatened to expand their operations against the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, a major escalation in hostilities with the two countries that are home to nearly six million Indians.The UAE defence ministry said it intercepted and destroyed two ballistic missiles over Abu Dhabi that were fired by the “Houthi terrorist militia”. There were no reports of loss of life or property, though fragments of the missiles fell in different areas around the UAE capital.The Houthi attack marked the latest escalation in the long-running war in Yemen and came exactly a week after another drone-and-missile attack by the Houthis on Abu Dhabi killed two Indian nationals and a Pakistani. Two more Indians were also injured in that attack.‘Ready for attack’: UAE intercepts Houthi attack; destroys 2 missilesThe UAE defence ministry said it destroyed missile launchers in Yemen’s northern Al Jawf region, more than 1,200km from Abu Dhabi, immediately after the projectiles were fired. The ministry said it was fully prepared to deal with any threats and that it will “take all necessary measures to protect the UAE from any attacks”.Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sare’e warned in a statement in Arabic that the group is prepared to expand its operations against Saudi Arabia and the UAE and “confront escalation with escalation”. The Houthis also “advised” foreign investors and firms in the UAE to leave the “unsafe country”.There was no immediate response from the Indian side to the latest attack by the Houthis or the threat of expanding operations against the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which the Indian government describes as part of the country’s extended neighbourhood. The two West Asian countries are home to almost six million Indians, including professionals and blue collar workers.The Houthis are also holding the 11 crew members, including seven Indians, of the merchant vessel Rwabee after seizing it in the Red Sea earlier this month. Both India and the UAE have demanded the release of crew members, though little headway appears to have been made in efforts to get them freed.External affairs minister S Jaishankar on January 18 condemned the drone attack by the Houthis in Abu Dhabi that killed two Indian nationals as a “terror attack”, and conveyed India’s strong solidarity to his UAE counterpart Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan in the face of such assaults.The Indian government has expressed concern at the recent intensification of fighting in Yemen and reiterated its position that a peaceful solution should be found through dialogue. It has called on all parties in the conflict to come to the negotiating table to find a “peaceful resolution to the Yemen issue”.Experts believe the Houthi attacks on the UAE using drones and missiles represents a major escalation of the nearly seven-year-old conflict. The Houthis earlier used drones and missiles to target oil facility in Saudi Arabia. The UAE reduced its participation in the Saudi Arabia-led coalition in Yemen, but the Houthis have retaliated in response to reports that the UAE backed a recent ground offensive in southern Yemen.The UN Security Council last week condemned the “heinous terrorist attacks in Abu Dhabi” and at other sites in Saudi Arabia, and “underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice”.India is caught in a delicate position because of the long-standing support provided by Iran to the Houthis. Some reports have suggested the drones and missiles used by the Houthis are being supplied by Iran. India enjoys good relations with both the UAE and Iran, which is seen as a key player in tackling the emerging situation in Afghanistan.
