He is married to Akshata Murty, the daughter of Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy, and the couple has two young daughters Krishna and Anoushka.The MP for Richmond in Yorkshire first entered the UK Parliament in 2015 and has quickly risen up the Tory party ranks as a staunch Brexiteer, who had backed Johnson’s strategy to leave the European Union (EU).From working in my mum’s tiny chemist shop to my experience building large businesses, I have seen how we should support free enterprise and innovation to ensure Britain has a stronger future,” Sunak had said during the Brexit referendum.He co-founded a 1-billion-pound global investment firm and specialised in investing in small British businesses before his entry into politics.As the first Chancellor of the Exchequer of Indian heritage, Sunak made history in February 2020 when he was appointed to the most important UK Cabinet post.If the Tory party murmurings and bookie betting odds are anything to go by, then the 41-year-old may well be in line to make history as Britain’s first Indian-origin Prime Minister."No, definitely not. Seeing what the Prime Minister has to deal with, this is a job hard enough for me to do," Sunak said back in October 2020, when asked if he had prime ministerial ambitions.But a lot has happened since, with Sunak leading the charge for the country’s economic fightback against the Covid-19 pandemic.Many of the schemes he put in place as finance minister, including the furlough-based Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and COVID support grants for struggling businesses over the course of several lockdowns have proved largely popular.However, proposed tax hikes coming up from this April and consistently rising energy and cost of living costs have proved less popular within the Conservative Party base.The famously low-tax favouring Tories may find his high tax plans to recoup some of the lost economic ground during the pandemic hard to digest when things really come to a leadership scrum.In fact, there is already talk within the party ranks of him having overplayed his hand by not speaking out more firmly in support of 57-year-old Johnson, following his Parliament apology earlier this week over a Downing Street garden party in apparent breach of lockdown rules.Sunak, who was miles away on a business visit, tweeted much later in the evening to say that “the PM was right to apologise and I support his request for patience while Sue Gray carries out her enquiry”.This was seen as a half-hearted show of support and viewed as reflective of his own leadership ambitions.The wealth associated with Sunak and his wife Akshata has also often hit the spotlight for the wrong reasons, with the Chancellor’s 95-pound pair of slippers spotted in official photographs released pre-Budget last October the latest luxury item to hit the headlines.This followed being pictured with a 180- pound so-called “smart mug”, which was reportedly a gift from his wife.However, his image as a family man who wears bracelets made by his daughters ahead of important speeches is the narrative that the British Indian community would like to highlight.He has also often spoken about himself as a “proud Hindu”, most recently when he unveiled a new 5-pound commemorative coin celebrating the life of Mahatma Gandhi for Diwali last November.“As a practicing Hindu, I am proud to unveil this coin during Diwali. Mahatma Gandhi was instrumental in the movement for Indian independence and it is fantastic to have a UK coin commemorating his remarkable life for the first time,” he said at the time.Ever since he took charge as Chancellor, there has been speculation within the UK media about Sunak eyeing the top job to move next door from his current No. 11 Downing Street office.A Prime Minister and Chancellor at odds with each other has been a historic dynamic within British politics and much of the speculation was attributed to that political power play.However, with Johnson becoming increasingly embattled within his own party ranks, that Downing Street neighbourly dynamic may just go on to create new British Indian history.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rishi-sunak-british-prime-minister-in-waiting-101642176061120.html
14-01-2022||World||Sino-India trade at record $125bn for 2021 amid border tension; deficit widens||Trade between India and China reached a record $125 billion in 2021 despite the worst chill in bilateral ties in decades, Chinese customs data showed on Friday.Two way trade between India and China in 2021 stood at $125.66 billion, up 43.3% from 2020 when bilateral trade was worth $87.6 billion.In 2021, China’s exports to India were $97.52 billion, up 46.2%, while China imported $28.14 billion worth of goods from India, up 34.2%, according to statistics released by the General Administration of Customs (GAC) and quoted by the tabloid, Global Times, on Friday.Trade deficit between the two countries remained much in favour of China – at $69 billion.The deficit in trade has been a constant source of friction between New Delhi and Beijing, with India complaining that China, despite promises, hasn’t given Indian companies access to sectors like pharmaceuticals.India was China’s 15th largest trade partner in 2021, according to GAC. “Analysts attributed the surge in trade to the complementary aspects of the industrial chains of the two countries. For example, about 50-60 percent of chemicals and other materials used by the Indian pharmaceutical industry, which is a pillar industry, are imported from China,” the Global Times report said.India-China trade in 2020 declined by 5.6% to $87.6 billion, the lowest since 2017. But China still overtook the US to become India’s largest trading partner last year.Chinese companies saw an increase in demand from India for medical equipment in the first half of the year following a devastating second wave of the coronavirus pandemic.The widening trade deficit with China, according to an explanatory note published online by the Indian embassy, can be attributed to two factors: narrow basket of commodities, mostly primary, for exporting to China and the lack of market access for most India’s agricultural products and the sectors where India is competitive in, such as pharmaceuticals, and IT.The Chinese report said amid bilateral tensions, the trade data “is just another piece of proof that New Delhi is unable to reduce its dependence on the Chinese market”.Indian and Chinese border troops have been locked in a border standoff in eastern Ladakh since May 2020, when a violent clash in Pangong lake area led to both sides gradually deploying tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry along the border.Several rounds of military and diplomatic talks have only resulted in partial disengagement of troops until now.Separately, GAC data showed on Friday that trade between China and the US soared by 28.7% and amounted to $755.6 billion in 2021 - maintaining a strong growth momentum and contributing 12% to China’s record $6 trillion foreign trade for the year.China’s exports to the US increased by 27.5% in 2021, while imports grew by 32.7%, reaching $179.53 billion.“The US maintained its place as China’s third-largest trade partner following Asean and the European Union. China-US trade was twice China’s trade with its fourth-largest trade partner Japan - which was 2.4 trillion yuan,” the Global Times reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sinoindia-trade-at-record-125bn-for-2021-amid-border-tension-deficit-widens-101642166288374.html

In a tweet on Thursday, the agency said, “A decision will be made once all of the required information has been thoroughly evaluated by Health Canada. As the review is still ongoing, it is not possible to predict when a regulatory decision will be made.”Health Canada said it reviews vaccine applications through an independent process and authorises products based on “scientific rigour and medical evidence”.“Timing for the completion of Health Canada’s review depends on many factors, including but not limited to, the need for additional data, discussions with the sponsor, and requirements for updates to safety information,” it added.Covaxin was approved for emergency use by the World Health Organization (WHO) in November 2021. It is recognised in Canada for travel purposes, as on November 30 the country started accepting those with two doses of Covaxin as fully vaccinated.At this time, only two vaccines, those manufactured by Pfizer and Moderna are available for administration in Canada, and these two have accounted for the vast majority of jabs given so far, including boosters, accounting for nearly 66 million out of the total 72 million inoculations given so far. There has been limited use of other approved vaccines, including that from AstraZeneca and its version Covishield manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, and the vaccine from Johnson & Johnson.Meanwhile, Health Canada also said it was reviewing “on a priority basis” a submission from Pfizer on a Covid-19 antiviral treatment, the submission for which was received last month. The news agency Canadian Press cited Health Canada’s chief medical adviser Dr Supriya Sharma as saying that the authorisation decision for the drug will be taken within ten days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-canada-yet-to-approve-covaxin-for-emergency-use-101642150567230.html
14-01-2022||World||PM Imran Khan launches Pakistan's first-ever National Security Policy||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday launched the country’s first-ever National Security Policy, which articulates a citizen-centric framework, placing economic security at its core unlike the previous one-dimensional security policy where the focus was on the military.Unveiling the public version of the policy, which was separately endorsed by the National Security Committee and the Cabinet last month, Prime Minister Khan said that the previous governments had failed to strengthen Pakistan’s economy.The national security has been clearly explained in the new original 100-page document, he said, adding that the policy articulates a citizen-centric framework, placing economic security at its core and seeking a secure and economically resilient Pakistan.Khan said that Pakistan, since its evolution, has had a one-dimensional security policy where the focus was on the military. "For the first time, the National Security Division has developed a consensus document which defines national security in a proper way," he added.The powerful army, which has ruled Pakistan for more than half of its 70 plus years of existence, has hitherto wielded considerable power in the matters of security and foreign policy.The five-year-policy document covering a period between 2022-26, is being propped up by the Khan government as the country’s first-ever strategy paper of its kind that spells out the national security vision and guidelines for the attainment of those goals."We need to realise that our biggest security is when the people become stakeholders and stand up for the country. And this can be achieved through inclusive growth. We need to develop as a nation, not in sections,” Khan said.The original version of the policy will remain classified.The main themes of the National Security Policy are national cohesion, securing an economic future, defence and territorial integrity, internal security, foreign policy in a changing world and human security.Earlier, National Security Advisor Moeed Yusuf said that Pakistan, under the new policy, will be shifting to a Comprehensive National Security Framework with the aim of ensuring the safety, security, and dignity of the citizens of Pakistan."The policy puts economic security at the core. A stronger economy would create additional resources which would then be distributed to further bolster military and human security,” he said.On the foreign front, the new policy highlights disinformation, Hindutva, and the use of aggression for domestic political gains as key threats from India, the Express Tribune newspaper reported.The report, quoting Yusuf, said the policy places the Jammu and Kashmir issue as the core of the bilateral relationship.When asked about the message it sends to India, Yusuf said: “it tells India to do the right thing and jump on the bandwagon to benefit from regional connectivity to uplift our peoples. It also tells India, if you don't want to do the right thing, it will be a loss to the entire region, but most of all India.”Earlier this week, an official said that Pakistan is willing to make peace with immediate neighbours, including India, under the new security policy which leaves doors open for trade with New Delhi even without the settlement of the Kashmir issue provided there is headway in bilateral talks.Peace with immediate neighbours and economic diplomacy will be the central theme of Pakistan’s foreign policy in the new National Security Policy, the newspaper reported on Tuesday."We are not seeking hostility with India for the next 100 years. The new policy seeks peace with immediate neighbours,” the official said on condition of anonymity.If there is a dialogue and progress, there would be a possibility of normalising trade and commercial ties with India as it had happened in the past, the official added.India has told Pakistan that it desires normal neighbourly relations with Islamabad in an environment free of terror, hostility and violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-imran-khan-launches-pakistan-s-first-ever-national-security-policy-101642147546470.html

Authorities didn’t immediately comment on the source of the outage, which comes amid surging tensions with Russia due to its buildup of thousands of troops near the border.A spokesman for Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry said on Twitter that the websites were down following a massive hack and that authorities were working to restore services. He didn’t identify who might be behind the attack, which hit the site of his agency as well as those of the Agriculture and Education Ministries and the government staff. All those sites were down, some with their content replaced for a time by messages in Russian, Polish and Ukrainian. “Ukrainian! All your personal data has been uploaded to the public network,” the message said. “All data on your computer is being erased and won’t be recoverable. All information about you has become public, fear and expect the worst. This is being done to you for the your past, present and future,” it said, with a reference to “historic lands.”Ukraine has previously accused Russia of mounting major cyber attacks against it as relations between the two neighbors have worsened since a 2014 conflict. In recent months, Ukraine and its allies in the U.S. and Europe have warned that Russia could be preparing to invade as it massed about 100,000 troops near the border. Moscow denies any such plans.A Kremlin spokesman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the cyber attack.The U.S. and its allies have warned that Russia might use hacking or other actions short of a military operation to put pressure on Ukraine. Russia denies it uses cyber weapons offensively but President Vladimir Putin has said what he called “patriotic hackers” may take it upon themselves to stand up for the country’s interests online.As tensions have mounted in recent months, the U.S. and its allies have been working to ready a package of sanctions to respond to a potential invasion or further acts of Russian aggression, though it’s not clear whether a cyber attack, if shown to be linked to Moscow, would trigger major retaliation. Trading in the Ukrainian currency and government bonds opens after 10 a.m. in Kyiv. As of 9:59 a.m. in Moscow, the ruble was trading 0.4% stronger against the dollar. The currency posted its sharpest daily drop since October 2020 on Thursday after a senior Russian diplomat said Moscow’s demands for security guarantees from the U.S. and its allies had hit “a dead end.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/massive-cyberattack-on-ukraine-govt-sites-amid-russia-tensions-101642145460817.html

Primary schools and kindergartens have also shuttered.The government is expected to announce later on Friday that the restrictions will be extended through the Lunar New Year holiday at the start of February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-suspends-transit-flights-from-most-of-the-world-due-to-covid19-101642143503427.html

Speaker of the British House of Commons Lindsay Hoyle informed the lawmakers about the alert, saying the spy agency has found that Lee "has facilitated financial donations to serving and aspiring parliamentarians on behalf of foreign nationals based in Hong Kong and China".The allegations were swiftly rejected by the Chinese embassy in London, claiming that China does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries."We have no need and never seek to 'buy influence' in any foreign parliament," it said. "We firmly oppose the trick of smearing and intimidation against the Chinese community in the UK."Who is Christine Lee?Christine Lee is the founder of a law firm with offices in London and Birmingham.In 2019, then UK Prime Minister Theresa May personally congratulated Lee after she was awarded for helping Chinese-British cooperation. She was also photographed with David Cameron when he was holding the top office at Downing Street.Her law firm Christine Lee & Co has donated £584,177 to Labour MP Barry Gardiner’s office, reported The Guardian citing Electoral Commission records. The Labour leader acknowledged receiving hundreds of thousands of pounds in donations from the Chinese agent, saying he has been liaising with intelligence services "for a number of years" about her."They have always known, and been made fully aware by me, of her engagement with my office and the donations she made to fund researchers in my office in the past," Gardiner said.Christine Lee & Co has listed on its website one of its roles as legal adviser to the Chinese embassy in Britain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-is-christine-lee-woman-at-the-centre-of-uk-spy-service-mi5-warning-101642140879074.html
14-01-2022||World||Covid-19: 55% Canadians expect to contract Omicron, finds poll||Covid fatigue appears to have given way to Covid fatalism in Canada, as with the advent of the highly transmissible Omicron variant, a majority of those sampled in a survey were resigned to being infected by the virus.New data released by the public polling agency Angus Reid Institute (ARI) pointed to this trend, as the agency said that “nationally a slim majority resigned to the inevitability of being infected with this latest strain of the coronavirus”. More than half of Canadians (55%) say regardless of the precautions they take, they expect to contract Omicron. Notably, this sentiment rises to at least three-in-five among parents who have children in grade school.”Those sentiments come as the fifth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in Canada, driven by the Omicron variant continues, though numbers of fresh daily cases have been declining, even as public health authorities have noted that could be a factor of fewer tests being administered and being limited to those considered symptomatic.Interestingly, those who believe they will get infected regardless of their actions, are almost equally divided between those who think public health restrictions should be lifted, at 48%, and those who disagree with such action, also 48%.Most appear to believe that they will live with Covid-19 for some time yet with less than a quarter of respondents, 23%, believe that 2022 will be the last year for the pandemic. The most likely group to expect the pandemic to be nearing its end is that of those unvaccinated, with nearly a third of that subset, 32%, thinking along those lines.There were 31,248 new cases reported in Canada on Thursday, taking the total since the pandemic began to 2,688,631.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-55-canadians-expect-to-contract-omicron-finds-poll-101642139946809.html
14-01-2022||World||Blow for Biden: US Supreme Court blocks federal vaccine mandate for large firms||WASHINGTON: Even as US President Joe Biden termed the current surge in Covid-19 cases as a “pandemic of the unvaccinated”, drawing a distinction between how it has affected those who have taken the jab and those who haven’t, the Supreme Court blocked the administration from enforcing a vaccine-or-testing mandate for large employers in the country. If allowed, the move would have applied to all companies with more than 100 employees. “This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Right now, both vaccinated and unvaccinated people are testing positive, but what happens after that could not be more different. If vaccinated people test positive, they overwhelmingly have either no symptoms at all or they have mild symptoms. And if they are unvaccinated... if they test positive, you are 17 times more likely to get hospitalised… And yes, the unvaccinated are dying from Covid-19,” said Biden on Thursday morning. On Wednesday, the US reported 781,203 Covid-19 cases; 145,005 individuals were hospitalised; and 1,827 people died. Biden emphasised that vaccination against Covid-19 had made a difference between the surge last winter and this one. “Because we’ve fully vaccinated nearly 210 million Americans, the majority of the country is safe from severe Covid-19 consequences. That’s why, even as the number of cases among the vaccinated Americans go up, deaths are down dramatically from last winter.” The US president cited the example of United Airlines to buttress his point, claiming that, on an average, one employee was dying a week before it implemented a vaccination requirement. Since enforcing it, 99% of its employees have got vaccinated, and while 3,600 have tested positive, there hasn’t been a single case of hospitalisation or death in the last eight weeks. “But as long as we have tens of millions of people who will not get vaccinated, we’re going to have full hospitals and needless deaths,” he said.Just hours after Biden’s remarks, the Supreme Court — while allowing a requirement for health workers at facilities receiving federal money to get vaccinated — disallowed the administration from enforcing vaccine mandates for large employers. This would have required workers to get vaccinated, or wear masks and get tested weekly. The court’s six conservative judges outnumbered the three liberal justices — and ruled against federal vaccine mandates, primarily on the ground that the federal executive branch did not have the authority to impose such a sweeping requirement. Also Read: WHO recommends two new Covid-19 treatments amid rise in hospital admissionsBiden said he was disappointed with the court’s decision to block “common-sense life-saving requirements for employees at large businesses that were grounded squarely in both science and the law”. “The court has ruled that my administration cannot use the authority granted to it by Congress to require this measure, but that does not stop me from using my voice as president to advocate for employers to do the right thing to protect Americans’ health and economy. I call on business leaders to immediately join those who have already stepped up – including one third of Fortune 100 companies – and institute vaccination requirements to protect their workers, customers, and communities.”

14-01-2022||World||North Korea vows ‘stronger’ action to US sanctions over hypersonic missile tests||North Korea hit back at U.S. sanctions in response to recent hypersonic missile tests that raised new security concerns, vowing a “stronger and certain reaction” to Washington’s attempt to halt its weapons programs.The pursuit of the advanced hypersonic missiles system, which are designed to evade existing defenses, is North Korea’s “legitimate right,” the country’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Washington’s move to slap sanctions on North Koreans who advanced its nuclear and ballistic weapons programs was a dangerous escalation, the ministry added in a statement released Friday through the state’s official Korean Central News Agency.A dispatch from the Foreign Ministry is usually reserved for North Korea’s most important messages to the outside world. The statement ratchets up tensions as the Biden administration is pushing Kim Jong Un to return to nuclear disarmament talks stalled for nearly three years. Kim’s regime has shunned overtures for talks, stepped up its production of fissile material for nuclear bombs and tested new systems to deliver atomic warheads.“The U.S. is intentionally escalating the situation even with the activation of independent sanctions, not content with referring the DPRK’s just activity to the UN Security Council,” the ministry said, referring to the country’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.“If the U.S. adopts such a confrontational stance, the DPRK will be forced to take stronger and certain reaction to it,” it added.The heightened tensions between the U.S. and North Korea come after Pyongyang tested two missiles in less than a week designed to deploy a hypersonic glide vehicle that can maneuver at high speeds during an unpowered flight to strike a target. For the first time in nearly two years, Kim oversaw a weapons test when he watched the Tuesday launch of a hypersonic system that North Korea claimed performed “corkscrew” maneuvers and hit a target 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) away. On Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury Department designated five North Koreans living overseas -- one in Russia, and four in China -- for aiding the country’s weapons programs. The U.S. point man for North Korea, Sung Kim, held separate talks with his counterparts from Japan and South Korea after the latest tests, emphasizing that Washington condemned the moves for violating United Nations Security Council resolutions banning Pyongyang from ballistic missile testing. He also called on North Korea to halt “destabilizing activities” and get back to the bargaining table, the State Department said Thursday.Kim’s regime was hit with tightened UN sanctions to punish it for nuclear and missiles tests in 2017 that have been a major factor in making North Korea’s economy even smaller now than when Kim took power a decade ago. The Biden administration has indicated it could provide economic rewards for steps to wind down the nuclear arms program.“These designations convey our serious and ongoing concern about the DPRK’s continued proliferation activities and those who support it,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement this week. “We remain committed to seeking dialogue and diplomacy with the DPRK and call on the DPRK to engage in negotiations.”The North Korean Foreign Ministry statement accused the U.S. of using “gangster-like” logic with sanctions, which it said demonstrated that Washington wasn’t interested in talks.“This shows that though the present U.S. administration is trumpeting about diplomacy and dialogue, it is still engrossed in its policy for isolating and stifling the DPRK,” the foreign ministry said. “The DPRK will not abandon its just right.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-vows-stronger-action-to-us-sanctions-over-hypersonic-missile-tests-101642124530714.html

The state department’s Office of International Religious Freedom, which promotes universal respect for freedom of religion or belief for all as a core objective of US foreign policy, urged the Chinese authorities to respect the right of Tibetans to practice their belief freely.“We are very troubled by reports of escalating PRC actions against Tibetan Buddhists, including authorities destroying Buddha statues, removing prayer wheels, and burning prayer flags. We urge PRC authorities to respect the right of Tibetans to practice their beliefs freely,” the US Office of International Religious Freedom wrote on Twitter.The statement comes days after reports of China destroying a second Buddhist statue revered by Tibetans in western China's Sichuan province emerged. The destruction of a three-storey statue of Maitreya Buddha at Gaden Namyal Ling monastery in Drago county in the Kardze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture was confirmed through commercial satellite imagery, reported Radio Free Asia.Also Read: Renaming places in Arunachal is part of Chinese psy-opsChinese officials claimed that the statue was razed due to safety reasons, according to the report.

14-01-2022||World||UK security services warn of Chinese spy ‘knowingly interfering’ in parliament||British security services have warned MPs that a suspected Chinese agent "knowingly engaged in political interference activities" inside parliament, authorities said Thursday.The office of House of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle confirmed that it had emailed MPs to tell them of the incident, in consultation with the security services."The Speaker takes the security of members and the democratic process very seriously, which is why he issued this notice in consultation with the security services," a spokeswoman for Hoyle said.The Chinese embassy in London denied the accusations, saying "we have no need and never seek to 'buy influence' in any foreign parliament."We firmly opposes the trick of smearing and intimidation against the Chinese community in the UK," it added.The security notice named the suspect as Christine Lee, saying she had "knowingly engaged in political interference activities on behalf of the United Front Work Department of the Chinese Communist Party".The London-based solicitor reportedly donated £200,000 ($275,000, 239,000 euros) to former Labour shadow cabinet member Barry Gardiner and hundreds of thousands of pounds to his party.Former prime minister Theresa May -- whose Conservatives have been accused of benefiting from millions in Russian money -- presented Lee with an award in 2019 to recognise her contribution to Sino-UK ties.Lee was also photographed with May's predecessor David Cameron at an event in 2015, and separately with former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.Lee "facilitated financial donations to serving and aspiring parliamentarians on behalf of foreign nationals based in Hong Kong and China", said the Speaker's note, according to British media."This facilitation was done covertly to mask the origins of the payments. This is clearly unacceptable behaviour and steps are being taken to ensure it ceases," it added.Iain Duncan Smith, a former Conservative leader and vocal critic of Beijing, demanded strong action after Britain's MI5 intelligence agency warned of Lee's activities."I say, as a member of parliament who has been sanctioned by the Chinese government, that this is a matter of grave concern," he said.China last year imposed sanctions on 10 UK organisations and individuals, including Duncan Smith, over what it called the spreading of "lies and disinformation" about human rights abuses in Xinjiang.Lee has not been arrested or deported, merely barred from entering parliament, he complained.Conservative former defence minister Tobias Ellwood told the Commons that "this is the sort grey-zone interference we now anticipate and expect from China"."But the fact that it's happened to this parliament, there must be a sense of urgency from this government."There was no immediate comment from the Chinese embassy in London or from the UK government.Gardiner said Christine Lee's son had been employed as his diary manager but had resigned on Thursday.In a statement, he said all of her donations were properly reported and any suggestion of shady money was not linked to his office, but that he had been "liaising with our security services" for many years about her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-security-services-warn-of-chinese-spy-knowingly-interfering-in-parliament-101642119556586.html
14-01-2022||World||WHO recommends two new Covid-19 treatments amid rise in hospital admissions||The World Health Organization approved two new treatments for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as Omicron cases put a strain on the healthcare system around the world. The WHO experts recommended arthritis drug baricitinib and synthetic antibody treatment Sotrovimab to stave off serious illness and death from Covid-19.The experts strongly recommended the use of Baricitinib as an alternative to interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor blockers, in combination with corticosteroids, to treat severe or critical Covid patients. They suggested that the use of baricitinib with corticosteroids in severe Covid patients led to better survival rates and reduced need for ventilators.“The strong recommendation for baricitinib in those with severe or critical illness reflects moderate certainty evidence for benefits on mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital length of stay (high certainty) with no observed increase in adverse effects leading to drug discontinuation,” the updated WHO guidelines say.The experts suggested that baricitinib and IL-6 receptor blockers like tocilizumab and sarilumab have similar effects and the decision should be based on issues including cost and clinician experience.They also recommended Sotrovimab for people with non-serious Covid who are at the highest risk of hospitalisation, such as the elderly and people with chronic diseases.The use of Sotrovimab in patients with non-severe illness led to a substantial reduction in the risk of hospitalisation and trivial benefits in those at lower risk. However, the drug probably has little or no impact on mortality and on mechanical ventilation, according to the guidelines.“There were insufficient data to recommend one monoclonal antibody treatment over another, and evidence on their efficacy for emerging variants is likely to influence future recommendations,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-recommends-two-new-covid-19-treatments-amid-rise-in-hospital-admissions-101642119075998.html
14-01-2022||World||Russia gives out mixed signal on talks with US||Talks this week on Moscow’s demands for security guarantees from the US and its allies are at “a dead end,” a senior Russian diplomat said, stepping up the pressure on the West even as he and other officials held out the prospect of more diplomacy to ease tensions.“The US and its allies in effect are telling us ‘no’” on Russia’s key proposals, offering further discussions only on “secondary” matters, deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov told RTVi television. “That’s the dead end or difference in approaches.”The comments by Ryabkov, who led the talks with the US in Geneva on Monday, seemed to reflect a slight hardening of Russia’s position as he said he didn’t see reason to resume discussions in the near future. But shortly after he spoke, his boss, foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, seemed more upbeat, telling state television he expects the US and its allies to respond to Russia’s proposals as soon as next week.The mixed messages suggested the Kremlin is keeping up the pressure on the US and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato) allies that started with a buildup of tens of thousands of troops on the border near Ukraine. Moscow has so far rejected western calls to pull those forces back, saying it has no plans to invade.Cuba, Venezuela warningBut the stakes in Russia’s dispute with the West were raised when Ryabkov refused to rule out a Russian military deployment to Cuba and Venezuela if tensions with the US mount.Ryabkov said in televised remarks that he would “neither confirm nor exclude” the possibility that Russia could send military assets to Cuba and Venezuela if the talks fail and US pressure on Russia mounts.Speaking in an interview with Russian RTVI TV, Ryabkov noted that “it all depends on the action by our US counterparts,” pointing to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s warning that Moscow could take military-technical measures if the US provokes the Kremlin and turns up military pressure on it.Ryabkov’s statement followed his comments last month in which he compared the current tensions over Ukraine with the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.Kazakh pullback beginsTroops of a Russia-led security alliance were preparing to pull out of Kazakhstan on Thursday, the Russian defence ministry said. The withdrawal comes only a week after they were deployed to the ex-Soviet nation on the request of its president, who was seeking to quell extremely violent mass protests. The demonstrations started on January 2 in western Kazakhstan, with local residents outraged by a sharp rise in fuel prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-gives-out-mixed-signal-on-talks-with-us-101642114426036.html
14-01-2022||World||China races to stamp out Covid outbreak||China’s northern port city of Tianjin reported an increase in Covid-19 infections on Thursday as it stepped up efforts to rein in an outbreak that has spread the highly transmissible Omicron variant to another city.Omicron has brought new challenges for China’s strategy to quickly stamp out outbreaks, which has taken on urgency ahead of the Winter Olympics set to start from February 4, while the busy Lunar New Year travel season begins this month.Volkswagen Group’s China unit said it had shut a vehicle plant run jointly with FAW Group in Tianjin, as well as a component factory since Monday due to the outbreak.Tianjin, located about 100km from the capital Beijing, reported 41 domestically transmitted infections with confirmed symptoms on Wednesday, up from 33 a day earlier, National Health Commission data showed.Dalian in the northeast also reported an individual arriving from Tianjin had tested positive for Omicron, city officials said. It said the virus situation was “largely controllable”.Anyang in the central province of Henan reported 43 local symptomatic cases on Wednesday, after two Omicron infections on Monday. It traced the flare-up to a student from Tianjin.Zhang Wenhong, director of a Covid-19 treatment team in Shanghai, said on Thursday the public health clinic in the commercial hub faced a record number of infections arriving from overseas.On Thursday, authorities in the ancient town of Xian, ordered two hospitals to suspend operations for three months for failures in providing medical care during the outbreak. One of the hospitals apologised for rigid virus controls that delayed treatment for a patient who suffered a heart attack and died.AZ booster dose helps against Omicron: DataAstraZeneca said on Thursday preliminary data from a trial it conducted on its Covid-19 shot, Vaxzevria, showed it generated a higher antibody response against the Omicron variant and others, including Beta, Delta, Alpha and Gamma, when given as a third booster dose.The increased response was seen in people who were previously vaccinated with either Vaxzevria or an mRNA vaccine, the drugmaker said, adding that it would submit this data to regulators worldwide given the urgent need for boosters.Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden said his administration will double its order of rapid Covid tests to send to Americans, while also distributing “high quality” masks to help fight a surge of cases of the omicron variant.France will let in travelers from Britain who are vaccinated against Covid-19 without having to self-isolate or to offer a valid reason for the trip, the French Prime Minister Jean Castex said on Thursday||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-races-to-stamp-out-covid-outbreak-101642114036596.html
14-01-2022||World||Pakistan Taliban confirm ex-spokesman's death in Afghanistan||The Pakistani Taliban on Thursday confirmed the killing over the weekend in neighbouring Afghanistan of the group's former spokesman and vowed to avenge the slaying.The outlawed Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, which is also known as TTP, announced on Twitter the death of the man known as Mohammad Khurasani, which is an alias. His real name was Khalid Balti.The confirmation comes days after Pakistani security officials said the former spokesman of the TTP had been shot and killed in Afghanistan's Nangarhar province, the headquarters of the extremist Islamic State group's regional affiliate. The TTP did not confirm the claim until Thursday.The current TTP spokesman, who also goes by the name Mohammad Khurasani, said on Twitter that Balti was killed on Sunday while travelling. He said Balti's death was a great loss and would soon be avenged.Balti was commander of the TTP and served as the group's spokesman from 2011 to 2015, when he was arrested in Afghanistan. He was freed after the Taliban seized power in mid-August.Their capture of Afghanistan has emboldened the TTP.Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan is an umbrella group and is a separate organisation from the Afghan Taliban.In November, Pakistan announced a month-long cease-fire with the TTP. The group has been behind numerous attacks on security forces and civilians over the last 14 years.The cease-fire ended on December 9 and since then, the group has resumed attacks. The Taliban, who brokered the monthlong truce, have assured Islamabad that they will not allow TTP to use Afghan soil for violence in Pakistan.Pakistani authorities say the talks with the TTP failed because they presented demands that were non-negotiable. The demands have not been publicly disclosed.According to two Pakistani security officials, Balti was also a resident of Pakistan's northern Gilgit Baltistan region.He was planning terrorist attacks in Pakistan and was killed by unidentified assailants in Afghanistan, the officials said.The officials spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to speak to the media.No one has claimed responsibility for Balti's killing.TTP's chief Noor Wali and his fighters are believed to be hiding in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-taliban-confirm-ex-spokesman-s-death-in-afghanistan-101642113349489.html
14-01-2022||World||Britain's MI5 spy service warns lawmakers over Chinese agent of influence||Britain's domestic spy service MI5 has warned lawmakers that the Chinese Communist Party has been employing a woman to exert improper influence over members of parliament.MI5 sent out an alert and picture of the woman named Christine Lee on Thursday alleging she was "involved in political interference activities" in the United Kingdom on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party.Speaker Lindsay Hoyle, who circulated MI5's alert to lawmakers, said MI5 had found that Lee "has facilitated financial donations to serving and aspiring parliamentarians on behalf of foreign nationals based in Hong Kong and China".Hoyle said Lee had been involved with the now disbanded all-party parliamentary group, Chinese in Britain.Britain’s interior minister Priti Patel told reporters that Lee’s behaviour was currently below the criminal threshold to prosecute her, but she said that by putting the alert out the government was able to warn lawmakers about Lee's attempts to improperly influence them.Patel said it was "deeply concerning" that an individual working on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party had targeted lawmakers.Lee is the founder of a law firm, which has offices in London and Birmingham, according to a government official. A woman who answered the phone at the Birmingham office said: "we are not taking any calls now". A request for comment left at the London office went unanswered.The law firm lists on its website one of its roles as legal adviser to the Chinese embassy in Britain.The Chinese embassy in London did not respond to a request for comment.POLITICAL DONATIONSBarry Gardiner, a lawmaker for the opposition Labour Party, said he had received donations from Lee and said he has been liaising with intelligence services "for a number of years" about her."They have always known, and been made fully aware by me, of her engagement with my office and the donations she made to fund researchers in my office in the past," Gardiner said.Gardiner employed Lee's son as a diary manager but he resigned on Thursday.Iain Duncan Smith, a former leader of Britain's governing Conservative Party who has been sanctioned by China for highlighting alleged human right abuses in Xinjiang, called for an urgent update from the government on the issue.He questioned why the woman had not been deported and called for a tightening of the accreditation process for people gaining access to parliament, which he said was too lenient.The government would not confirm Lee's nationality and it was not clear whether she would be deported or if she had already left the country.Former defence minister Tobias Ellwood told parliament: "This is the sort grey-zone interference we now anticipate and expect from China."Britain's relations with China have deteriorated in recent years over issues including Hong Kong and Xinjiang.Last year MI5 urged British citizens to treat the threat of spying from Russia, China and Iran with as much vigilance as terrorism.British spies say China and Russia have each sought to steal commercially sensitive data and intellectual property as well as to interfere in domestic politics and sow misinformation.The Chinese ambassador to Britain was banned from attending an event in the British parliament last year because Beijing imposed sanctions on lawmakers who highlighted alleged human right abuses in Xinjiang.China placed the sanctions on nine British politicians, in March last year for spreading what it said were "lies and disinformation" over the treatment of Uighur Muslims in the country's far west.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britains-mi5-spy-service-warns-lawmakers-over-chinese-agent-of-influence-101642111922885.html

"We're ready to make progress at the negotiating table... and we're ready to take the necessary and proper steps to defend our allies, support our partners and respond robustly to any naked aggression that might occur."Russia has amassed tens of thousands of troops on the border with Ukraine as it demands guarantees that NATO will not expand the alliance eastward."The intelligence community has not made an assessment that the Russians have definitively decided to take a military course of action in Ukraine," Sullivan said."So as things stand right now, Russia has the opportunity to come to the table."Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, who led talks in Geneva with US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, in an interview Thursday did not rule out Moscow sending forces to allies Venezuela or Cuba if diplomacy failed."I don't want to confirm that... nor exclude it," he said.Sullivan called the remarks "bluster" and said Russia did not raise the idea in discussions."If Russia were to move in that direction, we would deal with it decisively," Sullivan said.The United States and the then-Soviet Union are considered to have come closest to nuclear war in 1962 when Moscow deployed ballistic missiles to Cuba, setting off crisis diplomacy.sms-sct/to||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-ready-for-russia-diplomacy-and-to-defend-allies-sullivan-101642111601867.html
14-01-2022||World||In blow to Biden, Supreme Court blocks vaccine mandate for businesses||The US Supreme Court delivered a blow to President Joe Biden on Thursday, blocking his Covid vaccination-or-testing mandate for employees of large businesses.At the same time, the nation's highest court allowed a vaccination mandate for health care workers at facilities receiving federal funding.Biden said he was "disappointed" in the court's decision striking down his mandate for businesses with 100 employees or more to vaccinate or test their workers for Covid-19."I am disappointed that the Supreme Court has chosen to block common-sense life-saving requirements for employees at large businesses that were grounded squarely in both science and the law," Biden said in a statement.The president welcomed the requirement that health care workers be vaccinated, saying it would affect some 10 million people working at facilities receiving federal funds and will "save lives."After months of public appeals to Americans to get vaccinated against Covid, which has killed more than 845,000 people in the United States, Biden announced in September that he was making vaccinations compulsory at large private companies.Unvaccinated employees would have to present weekly negative tests and wear face masks at work.The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), a federal agency, gave businesses until February 9 to be in compliance with the rules or face the possibility of fines.But the Supreme Court's six conservative justices ruled the mandate would represent a "significant encroachment into the lives -- and health -- of a vast number of employees.""Although Congress has indisputably given OSHA the power to regulate occupational dangers, it has not given that agency the power to regulate public health more broadly," they said."Requiring the vaccination of 84 million Americans, selected simply because they work for employers with more than 100 employees, certainly falls in the latter category," they added.The three liberal justices dissented, saying the ruling "stymies the federal government's ability to counter the unparalleled threat that Covid-19 poses to our nation's workers."'Do no harm'The vaccination mandate for health care workers at facilities receiving federal funding was approved in a 5-4 vote, with two conservatives -- Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh -- joining the liberals."Ensuring that providers take steps to avoid transmitting a dangerous virus to their patients is consistent with the fundamental principle of the medical profession: first, do no harm," they said in the majority opinion.Vaccination has become a politically polarizing issue in the United States, where approximately 63 percent of the population is fully vaccinated.A coalition of 26 business associations had filed suit against the OSHA regulations and several Republican-led states had challenged the mandate for health care workers.Republican Senator Rick Scott of Florida said the court's ruling "sends a clear message: Biden is not a king & his gross overreaches of federal power will not be tolerated.""I had COVID & got the vaccine, but I will NEVER support a vaccine mandate that bullies hardworking Americans & kills jobs," Scott said.And former president Donald Trump welcomed the ruling on businesses."The Supreme Court has spoken, confirming what we all knew: Biden's disastrous mandates are unconstitutional," Trump said in a statement. "We are proud of the Supreme Court for not backing down. No mandates!"In his statement, Biden said it is now up to states and individual employers to determine whether they should be requiring employees "to take the simple and effective step of getting vaccinated."He said the Supreme Court ruling "does not stop me from using my voice as president to advocate for employers to do the right thing to protect Americans' health and economy.""We have to keep working together if we want to save lives, keep people working, and put this pandemic behind us," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-blow-to-biden-supreme-court-blocks-vaccine-mandate-for-businesses-101642110963509.html
14-01-2022||World||US indicts founder of far-right Oath Keepers for sedition in Capitol attack||The founder of the far-right group Oath Keepers and 10 others were indicted for seditious conspiracy in the January 6, 2021 assault on the US Capitol, the Justice Department announced Thursday.It was the first use of the potent sedition charge in the sprawling investigation of the Capitol attack by supporters of then-president Donald Trump.Stewart Rhodes, 56, who founded and led the right-wing militia group, and another associate of the organization, Ed Vallejo, were arrested early Thursday.Nine men with ties to the Oath Keepers who had been previously arrested on lesser charges in the violent attack, which temporarily shut down the US Congress, were also named as part of the alleged seditious conspiracy."Following the Nov. 3, 2020, presidential election, Rhodes conspired with his co-defendants and others to oppose by force the execution of the laws governing the transfer of presidential power by Jan. 20, 2021," the Justice Department said in a statement.It said that beginning in December 2020, they secretly made plans to travel to Washington, to prevent certification of Joe Biden's victory over Trump in the presidential election.They brought weapons to Washington as part of their plans for "breaching and attempting to take control of the Capitol grounds and building," it said."While certain Oath Keepers members and affiliates breached the Capitol grounds and building, others remained stationed just outside of the city in quick reaction force (QRF) teams... prepared to rapidly transport firearms and other weapons into Washington" to halt the certification, the department said.If found guilty, they face up to 20 years in prison on the conspiracy to sedition charge alone. Most also face other charges such as assault on law enforcement and disrupting Congress.Conspiracy theoriesThe indictment did not link Rhodes or others to Trump or members of his circle now under investigation by a Congressional committee over their role in the January 6 attack.Rhodes has openly led the Oath Keepers since he founded the group in 2009. He is a former Army paratrooper and graduate of Yale Law School, and was on the staff of former congressman Ron Paul, a prominent libertarian.The group is only loosely organized around the belief that the federal government is growing too powerful and can be removed by force under certain conditions, according to a recent report on them published by the Combating Terrorism Center (CTC) of the US Army's West Point military academy."Conspiracy theories have always been a feature" of their ideology, the report said, and they have regularly shown up in combat gear and heavily armed at politically charged protests, in shows of force that critics label as intimidation.The group has targeted for recruitment primarily current and former military, police and first responders. A recently leaked database had 38,000 names of people who had registered with the Oath Keepers at one point or another.'Civil war'The indictment detailed the group's planning from text messages and chats between members beginning from the election in November 2020 through the day of January 6.Two days after Trump's defeat, Rhodes convened Oath Keepers leaders in an encrypted chat and told them, "We aren't getting through this without civil war."He issued a call to action, and on December 11 told the group that if Biden became president, "it will be a bloody and desperate fight... That can't be avoided."In the following weeks, they discussed tactics for January 6 and the likelihood of violence.Rhodes spent $18,000 ahead of the day on firearms, ammunition and other equipment including gunsights and night-vision gear for his group, the indictment said.The indictment focuses on the way they formed two "stacks," combat-like formations, to force their way past police and into the Capitol on January 6.They also designed routes for their multiple armed "QRFs" to come to their aid from the Washington suburbs if fighting broke out.The indictments on sedition charges took the January 6 investigation to a new level. Some 725 people have been charged overall, mostly for lesser charges such as illegally entering the Capitol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-indicts-founder-of-far-right-oath-keepers-for-sedition-in-capitol-attack-101642110558946.html
14-01-2022||World||US approves new antibody treatment -- for arthritic cats||Good news for senior felines hoping to get a spring back in their step.The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Thursday approved its first treatment to control pain associated with osteoarthritis in cats, which is also the first monoclonal antibody drug approved for any animal species.These lab-grown proteins have grabbed headlines during the pandemic for preventing high-risk people with Covid from getting severely ill.Not all monoclonal antibodies target pathogens however. Some that are approved in humans with cancer perform other functions, like tagging cancer cells so the immune system can recognize them better and fight them.Solensia, the new drug approved for cats, works by attaching itself to a protein called nerve growth factor (NGF) that is involved in the regulation of pain.When frunevetmab, the active ingredient in Solensia, binds to NGF, it prevents the pain signal from reaching the brain."Advancements in modern veterinary medicine have been instrumental in extending the lives of many animals, including cats," said Steven Solomon, director of the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine, in a statement."But with longer lives come chronic diseases, such as osteoarthritis," he added.Osteoarthritis occurs when the protective cartilage that cushions the ends of bones wears thin. Eventually the bones in a joint rub against each other, causing pain and lessening joint movement, and at times leading to bone spurs.Because cats are not good at describing their symptoms, researchers asked their owners about their level of impairment doing activities like jumping onto furniture, using their litter box, or grooming, and compared their abilities to before they developed osteoarthritis.The owners were then asked to assess their cats' response after receiving treatment.Overall, the cats in the treatment group had better assessment scores than those who received placebos during randomized clinical trials.Side-effects of the drug, which is injected under the skin by a veterinarian, included vomiting, diarrhea, injection site pain, scabbing on the head and neck, dermatitis and pruritus (itchy skin). The effects were mild and didn't require the treatment to stop.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-approves-new-antibody-treatment-for-arthritic-cats-101642110261251.html
