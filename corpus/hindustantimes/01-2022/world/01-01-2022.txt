In 2019, they accounted for only five percent.Of the 27.5 million vehicles set to be sold this year, according to CAAM, five million will be electric and hybrids.Overall growth in the world's largest market for vehicles will likely come in at 3.1 percent for 2021, according to CAAM -- the first year of sales growth since 2018.China, the world's largest polluter, has set ambitious goals for the widespread adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles, and aims to have the majority of cars powered with clean energy by 2035.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-scrap-subsidies-for-electric-vehicles-101641043706775.html
01-01-2022||World||Violence against women insults God, Pope voices in New Year's message||Pope Francis used his New Year's message on Saturday to issue a clarion call for an end to violence against women, saying it was insulting to God.Francis, 85, celebrated a Mass in St. Peter's Basilica on the day the Roman Catholic Church marks both the solemnity of Holy Mary Mother of God as well as its annual World Day of Peace.Francis appeared to be in good form on Saturday following an unexplained incident on New Year's Eve where he attended a service but at the last minute did not preside over it as he had been expected to.At the start of the Mass on Saturday, he walked the entire length of the central aisle of basilica, as opposed to Friday night, when he emerged from a side entrance close to the altar and watched from the sidelines.Francis suffers from a sciatica condition that causes pain in the legs, and sometimes a flare up prevents him from standing for long periods.Francis wove his New Year's homily around the themes of motherhood and women - saying it was they who kept together the threads of life - and used it to make one of his strongest calls yet for an end to violence against them."And since mothers bestow life, and women keep the world (together), let us all make greater efforts to promote mothers and to protect women," Francis said."How much violence is directed against women! Enough! To hurt a woman is to insult God, who from a woman took on our humanity - not through an angel, not directly, but through a woman," he said, in a reference to Jesus's mother Mary.During an Italian television programme last month, Francis told a woman who had been beaten by her ex-husband that men who commit violence against women engage in something that is "almost satanic".Since the COVID-19 pandemic began nearly two years ago, Francis has several times spoken out against domestic violence, which has increased in many countries since lockdowns left many women trapped with their abusers.Public participation at the Mass was lower than in some past years because of COVID restrictions. Italy, which surrounds Vatican City, reported coronavirus related cases on Friday and has recently imposed new measures such as an obligation to wear masks outdoors.In the text of his Message for the World Day of Peace, issued last month, Francis said nations should divert money spent on armaments to invest in education, and decried growing military costs at the expense of social services.The annual peace message is sent to heads of state and international organisations, and the pope gives a signed copy to leaders who make official visits to him at the Vatican during the upcoming year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/violence-against-women-insults-god-pope-voices-in-new-year-s-message-101641039621689.html
01-01-2022||World||European Union drafts plan to mark nuclear gas and investments as green||European Union has drawn up plans to label some natural gas and nuclear energy projects as "green" investments after a year-long battle between governments over which investments are truly climate friendly.The European Commission is expected to propose rules in January deciding whether gas and nuclear projects will be included in the EU "sustainable finance taxonomy".This is a list of economic activies and the environmental criteria they must meet to be labelled as green investments. By restricting the "green" label to truly climate friendly projects, the system aims to make those investments more attractive to private capital, and stop "greenwashing", where companies or investors overstate their eco-friendly credentials.Brussels has also made moves to apply the taxonomy to some EU funding, meaning the rules could decide which projects are eligible for certain public finance.A draft of the Commission's proposal, seen by Reuters, would label nuclear power plant investments as green if the project has a plan, funds and a site to safely dispose of radioactive waste. To be deemed green, new nuclear plants must receive construction permits before 2045.Investments in natural gas power plants would also be deemed green if they produce emissions below 270g of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt hour, replace a more polluting fossil fuel plant, and receive a construction permit by Dec. 31 2030. Such plants must meet other conditions including that they are technically equipped to burn low-carbon gases.Gas power generation would be labelled green on the grounds that it is a "transitional" activity - defined as one that is not fully sustainable, but which has emissions below industry average and does not lock in polluting assets during the shift to clean energy.The Commission could not immediately be reached for comment.EU countries and a panel of expert advisors will scrutinise the draft proposal, which could change before it is due to be published later in January. Once published, the proposal could be vetoed by a majority of EU countries or by the European Parliament.The policy has been mired in lobbying from governments for more than a year and EU countries disagree on which fuels are truly sustainable.Natural gas emits roughly half the CO2 emissions of coal when burned in power plants, but gas infrastructure is also associated with leaks of methane, a potent planet-warming gas.The EU's expert advisers had recommended that gas plants not be labelled as green investments unless they met a lower 100g CO2/kwh emissions limit, based on the deep emissions cuts scientists say are needed to avoid disastrous climate change.Nuclear power produces very low CO2 emissions but the Commission sought expert advice this year on whether the fuel should be deemed green given the potential environmental impact of radioactive waste disposal.Brussels finished the rules last year for parts of the green list including sectors such as buildings and transport and from this month investments not included in the taxonomy cannot be marketed as climate-friendly in the EU. The gas and nuclear rules will kick in later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-union-drafts-plan-to-mark-nuclear-gas-and-investments-as-green-101641038460298.html

According to the report, the highest number of injured were also reported from Balochistan where more than 50 per cent of the total injured were recorded.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was the second most affected region next to Balochistan, the report said.Experts are wary of Pakistan's role in Afghanistan, publicly supporting an end to the regional conflict but ultimately undermining any kind of peace that interferes with the self-interest of its leaders.They warn that such an act could backfire on Pakistan, especially on its military and intelligence establishment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/militant-attacks-rise-in-pakistan-after-taliban-offensive-in-afghanistan-report-101641029848877.html
01-01-2022||World||Media federation says 45 journalists killed in 2021||A total of 45 journalists and media professionals were killed in 20 countries in the year 2021, the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) said on Friday, adding that it is "one of the lowest death tolls" it has recorded since the body started publishing such tallies.According to the IFJ figures, it is a drop from 65 killings recorded last year in 2020. Since 1991, as many as 2721 journalists have been killed around the world.The figure represents one of the lowest death tolls since the IFJ began publishing annual reports on journalists killed in work-related incidents, including targeted killings, crossfire fatalities as well as bomb attacks, IFJ said in a statement.The Asia Pacific region tops the regional list with 20 killings, before the Americas (10), Africa (8), Europe (6) and the Middle East and Arab World on just one. There was also a deadly accident that cost the lives of two journalists in Iran.While this decrease is welcome news, it is small comfort in the face of continued violence which claimed the lives of journalists in countries like Afghanistan (9), and Mexico (8). Other South Asian countries including Pakistan also recorded incidents of violence."This also provides further evidence for a recurring finding in these publications that more journalists and media workers more often than not are killed for exposing corruption, crime and abuse of power in their communities, cities and countries," read the statement.It further reported that the risks associated with armed conflict have reduced in recent years due to limited exposure for media professionals who are increasingly fewer in reporting close-ups from war theatre.At the same time, the threats of a crime gang and drug cartels' rule from the slums in Mexico to the streets of European cities in Greece and the Netherlands continue to increase and account for many targeted killings of media workers in 2021, the statement added."These 45 colleagues we lost to violence this year remind us of the terrible sacrifice journalists across the world continue to pay for serving the public interest and we remain in the debt to them and thousands of others who paid the ultimate price," said IFJ General Secretary Anthony Bellanger."The IFJ believes that the only tribute fit for the cause to which they gave their lives should be an unrelenting pursuit for justice to them. That's why we continue to advocate for the adoption of a new United Nations Convention for the protection of journalists which would ensure accountability for journalists' killings."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/media-federation-says-45-journalists-killed-in-2021-101641029855110.html
01-01-2022||World||Funeral begins for South Africa's anti-apartheid veteran Desmond Tutu||The state funeral for Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a hero of the struggle against apartheid in South Africa, began on Saturday in St George's Cathedral, Cape Town, where for years he preached against racial injustice.President Cyril Ramaphosa was expected to deliver the main eulogy for Tutu, who was awarded the Nobel Peace prize in 1984 for his non-violent opposition to white minority rule. His death on Sunday aged 90 triggered an outpouring of tributes from around the world.Tutu's widow Nomalizo Leah, known as "Mama Leah", sat in a wheelchair in the front row of the church, draped in a purple scarf. Ramaphosa sat alongside her, with a matching necktie.The cathedral and the Table Mountain that rises above the city have been illuminated every night this week in purple, the colour of Tutu's clerical robes.Life-size posters of Tutu, with his hands clasped, were placed outside the cathedral, where the number of congregants was restricted in line with COVID-19 measures.Hundreds of well-wishers had queued on Thursday and Friday to pay their last respects to Tutu as he lay in state at the cathedral. On Saturday, his simple coffin was once again wheeled into the church as the requiem Mass got under way.The choir then gave a resounding rendition of "Great is Thy Faithfullness".Tutu was widely revered across South Africa's racial and cultural divides for his moral integrity. He never stopped fighting for his vision of a "Rainbow Nation" in which all races in post-apartheid South Africa could live in harmony.Cape Town, the city where Tutu lived for most of his later life, was unseasonably rainy on Saturday as mourners gathered to bid farewell to the man fondly known as "The Arch" and often described as South Africa's "moral compass".As Anglican archbishop of Cape Town, Tutu turned St George's into what is known as a "People's Cathedral" a refuge for anti-apartheid activists during the turbulent 1980s and 1990s when security forces brutally repressed the mass democratic movement.His body will be cremated in a private ceremony after the requiem Mass and will then be interred behind the pulpit from where he once denounced bigotry and racial tyranny.A small crowd of around 100 people followed the funeral proceedings on a big screen at the Grand Parade, opposite City Hall where Tutu joined Nelson Mandela when he gave his first speech after being freed from prison.Mandela, who became the country's first post-apartheid president and who died in December 2013, once said of his friend:"Sometimes strident, often tender, never afraid and seldom without humour, Desmond Tutu's voice will always be the voice of the voiceless."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/funeral-begins-for-south-africa-s-anti-apartheid-veteran-desmond-tutu-101641028014106.html
01-01-2022||World||What is Florona, flu plus Corona, first detected in Israel? All you need to know||Israel has reportedly recorded the first case of Florona, which is believed to be a double infection of Covid-19 and influenza. According to reports, the first case of this was recorded this week in a pregnant woman who was admitted to the Rabin Medical Centre to give birth. Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth reported that the young woman was not vaccinated.The news of Florona comes at a time when the world is battling a new surge of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic driven by the new variant Omicron, which was first detected in South Africa in November 2021. The fast-transmissible variant has already spread to most of the countries and has overtaken the previous variant Delta in the US and UK.Florona, however, is not a new variant, to dispel misgivings, as it is believed to be the occurrence of flu and corona at the same time. Israeli doctors said Florona is being studied as Isreal has seen a surge in influenza cases in the last few weeks.Dr Nahla Abdel Wahab, a doctor at Cairo University Hospital, told Israeli media that Florona may indicate a major breakdown of the immunity system as two viruses are entering the human body at the same time.Israel has already begun administering fourth vaccine shots against Covid-19 on Friday to individuals with a compromised immune system.Experts have also flagged Delmicron, a combination of Delta and Omicron variants, which might have caused the surge in the US and Europe. Delmicron, too, is not a new variant but the attack of Delta and Omicron strains together. Commenting on Delmicron, Moderna's chief medical officer Dr Paul Burton has said it was possible that both the strains can swap genes and trigger a more dangerous variant. "There's certainly data, there have been some papers published again from South Africa earlier from the pandemic when people - and certainly immunocompromised people - can harbour both viruses," Burton was quoted as saying by the Daily Mail.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-is-florona-flu-plus-corona-first-detected-in-israel-all-you-need-to-know-101641027672824.html
