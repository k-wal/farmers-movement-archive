In addressing delegates, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the organization’s director-general, urged collective vigilance in continuing to fight the pandemic. “There are different scenarios for how the pandemic could play out and how the acute phase could end. But it’s dangerous to assume that omicron will be the last variant or that we are in the endgame,” he said. “On the contrary, globally, the conditions are ideal for more variants to emerge.”The organization is asking member-states and donors for an additional $480 million for its next two-year budget period, including $430 million for its emergencies program to coordinate the global response to Covid-19.Tedros said that without the increase in funding, the WHO will be “set up to fail.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-omicron-offers-plausible-hope-for-stabilization-normalization-of-pandemic-says-top-europe-s-top-who-official-101643046859807.html
24-01-2022||World||US lawsuits accuse Google of tracking data without users' permission||A group of top US justice officials accused Google in lawsuits Monday of tracking and profiting from users' location data, despite leading consumers to think they could protect their privacy on the tech giant's services.Google builds detailed profiles and sells highly targeted advertising with data collected from its billions of users – with the location being a key piece of information, argued the suits that seek to block the alleged practices."Google falsely led consumers to believe that changing their account and device settings would allow customers to protect their privacy," said Karl Racine, the attorney general in the nation's capital Washington.These suits are the latest legal threats against Google and other US Big Tech giants, which have long faced probes and court cases but a lack of new national laws that would regulate their businesses.Attorneys general -- states' top law enforcers and legal advisors -- from Indiana, Washington, and Texas were to file suits making the same allegations against the tech colossus.Google said the officials' claims were inaccurate and based on outdated assertions about its settings."We have always built privacy features into our products and provided robust controls for location data," Google said in a statement. "We will vigorously defend ourselves and set the record straight."Racine argued that from 2014 to at least 2019, Google claimed that users could turn off their "Location History" setting and "the places you go are no longer stored.""That is false. Even when Location History is off, Google continues to collect and store users' locations," Racine's office said in a statement.The officials also allege the Silicon Valley giant has used "dark patterns," or design tricks aimed at subtly influencing consumers' choices in ways that benefit the company.Racine's office cited the example of repeatedly prompting users to provide location in certain apps and claiming products would not function properly without it, when in fact location was not needed for the app."Even a limited amount of location data, aggregated over time, can expose a person's identity and routines," Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita said in a statement.He noted that information can be used to infer "sensitive personal details" like political or religious beliefs, income, health, or life events like births and divorces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-lawsuits-accuse-google-of-tracking-data-without-users-permission-101643041713010.html
24-01-2022||World||After Covid-19, smog alert in Beijing ahead of Winter Olympics||After logging around 43 positive Covid-19 cases in little more than a week, Beijing’s notorious smog has re-emerged as a new irritant for the city days ahead of the Winter Olympics.Authorities have warned that weather conditions are likely to be extremely unfavourable during the Games, beginning on February 4, triggering heavy pollution. “The Beijing Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games coincide with the end of winter and the start of spring in northern China, when weather conditions are extremely unfavourable,” China’s environment ministry spokesperson Liu Youbin said on Monday.“When heavy pollution is predicted, all localities will launch emergency plans,” Liu was quoted as saying by Chinese state media.Beijing has experienced severe pollution in the last couple of days with concentrations of hazardous airborne particles known as PM2.5 at 205 micrograms per cubic metre on Monday morning. The World Health Organization says the count should not be more than 5.Liu said local authorities will initiate emergency responses to manage and control businesses and vehicles to tackle air pollution but balance it with economic activity.Meanwhile, the Games organisers have said that there have been 177 confirmed Covid-19 cases among 3,115 Olympics-related international arrivals from January 4 to January 23; one among who was an athlete or support staffer, as per Beijing 2022 data released on Sunday and Monday.Beijing on Monday reported nine locally transmitted Covid-19 cases, including five confirmed cases and four asymptomatic carriers until Sunday 4pm.Since January 15, the city has reported a total of 43 local Covid-19 cases, with six attributable to the Omicron variant and 37 to the Delta variant, Pang Xinghuo, deputy head of the municipal disease prevention and control centre was quoted as saying by the Xinhua news agency.Beijing 2022 eases Covid curbs for GamesThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) and Chinese authorities have lowered the threshold for producing a negative Covid-19 test for any participant arriving at the Games, dropping the cycle threshold (Ct) value from 40 to 35.A communication by Beijing 2022 was sent out on Sunday explaining the change, reports said.The changes, which take effect immediately and apply retrospectively, “have been developed in order to further adapt to the reality of the current environment and support the Games participants”, the IOC was quoted as saying in a statement.“The slight relaxing of rules for Games participants comes despite four more Chinese provinces finding recording infections linked to the Beijing cluster amid the Lunar New Year travel season,” Reuters said in a report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-covid-19-smog-alert-in-beijing-ahead-of-winter-olympics-101643037610055.html
24-01-2022||World||UK to end Covid-19 testing for fully vaccinated travellers||Fully vaccinated travellers entering England will soon be exempt from any Covid test requirements, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson revealed on Monday.Speaking to reporters during a visit to a hospital in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, Johnson said the daily Omicron variant data is getting better and it was time for the country to be more open for travellers. Over the weekend, the UK recorded 74,799 cases and 75 Covid deaths.“Although we have to be cautious, we are now moving through the Omicron wave, and you can see the figures are starting to get better,” Johnson said.“So what we're doing on travel, to show that this country is open for business, open for travellers, you will see changes so that people arriving no longer have to take tests if they have been vaccinated, if they have been double vaccinated," he said.Fully vaccinated travellers currently need to do a lateral flow or PCR test within two days of arriving in England after a pre-arrival test requirement was done away with earlier this week. The devolved regions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland usually adopt similar rules on travel.UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is expected to make a statement in the House of Commons outlining the Covid travel update when the exact time frame for the rule changes is likely to be confirmed.The move will be welcomed by the travel and tourism industry, one of the sectors most badly affected worldwide by coronavirus lockdown measures. There had been widespread calls for the government to abandon the burden of tests for those who have had at least two doses of a Covid vaccine.The government has indicated that the third booster dose is also likely to be added to the so-called Covid vaccine pass to qualify as fully vaccinated, sometime in the future.Under current rules, travellers who are not fully vaccinated must take a pre-departure test and two post-arrival PCR tests, which are more expensive than the lateral flow version. They must also self-isolate for 10 days.From Thursday, England’s stricter Plan B restrictions come to an end, which means Covid passes for entry to larger venues, and the mandatory wearing of face masks will be scrapped and people are no longer being told to work from home. It follows an announcement in Parliament last week confirming that the Omicron wave has most likely peaked in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-end-covid-19-testing-for-fully-vaccinated-travellers-101643033844328.html
24-01-2022||World||Taliban hold first talks in Europe since Afghan takeover||The Taliban and western diplomats have began their first official talks in Europe since they took over control of Afghanistan in August.The closed-door meetings were taking place at a hotel in the snow-capped mountains above the Norwegian capital. Taliban representatives will be certain to press their demand that nearly $10 billion frozen by the United States and other Western countries be released as Afghanistan faces a precarious humanitarian situation.“We are requesting them to unfreeze Afghan assets and not punish ordinary Afghans because of the political discourse,” said Taliban delegate Shafiullah Azam on Sunday night. “Because of the starvation, because of the deadly winter, I think it’s time for the international community to support Afghans, not punish them because of their political disputes.”Ahead of the talks, western diplomats met with Afghan women’s rights activists and human rights defenders to hear from civil society in Afghanistan and the Afghan diaspora about their demands and assessment of the current situation on the ground. The meeting was attended by representatives of the EU, the U.S., Britain, France, Italy and hosts Norway.Standing silent as attendees gathered, women's rights activist Heda Khamoush, who lives in Kabul, held up the photos of Tamana Zaryabi Paryani and Parwana Ibrahimkhel, two women arrested by the Taliban last week following an anti-Taliban protest against the compulsory Islamic headscarf, or hijab, for women. They haven't been seen since.Rejecting the accusation the Taliban had abducted them, Azam said he was “not aware of that” and suggested activists may be using this event to seek asylum.Speaking after the meeting, women’s rights activist Mahbouba Seraj angrily rejected this and warned that “if they continue this way —to tell us something and do something else — that’s when the trust is going to break, completely."The three-day talks opened on Sunday with direct meetings between the Taliban and civil society representatives.A joint statement tweeted overnight by Zabihullah Mujahid, the Afghan deputy culture and information minister, said “participants of the meeting recognized that understanding and joint cooperation are the only solutions to all the problems of Afghanistan,” and emphasized that “all Afghans need to work together for better political, economic and security outcomes in the country.”Seraj acknowledged the progress made. “Yes, they were listening. I should say that," she said Monday morning. "We gave them a paper. We asked them what we wanted. They took it. They were very, very cordial about it.”The talks come at a crucial time for Afghanistan as freezing temperatures are compounding misery from the downward spiral that has come with the fall of the U.S.-backed government and the Taliban takeover.Aid groups and international agencies estimate about 23 million people, more than half the country, face severe hunger and nearly 9 million are on the brink of starvation. People have resorted to selling possessions to buy food, burning furniture for warmth and even selling their children. The United Nations has managed to provide some liquidity and allowed the Taliban administration to pay for imports, including electricity.Faced with the Taliban’s request for funds, Western powers are likely to put the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan high on their agenda, along with the West’s recurring demand for the Taliban administration to share power with Afghanistan’s minority ethnic and religious groups.Since sweeping to power in mid-August, the Taliban have imposed widespread restrictions, many of them directed at women. Women have been banned from many jobs outside the health and education fields, their access to education has been restricted beyond sixth grade and they have been ordered to wear the hijab. The Taliban have, however, stopped short of imposing the burqa, which was compulsory when they previously ruled Afghanistan in the 1990s.The Taliban have increasingly targeted Afghanistan’s beleaguered rights groups, as well as journalists, detaining and sometimes beating television crews covering demonstrations.A U.S. delegation, led by Special Representative for Afghanistan Tom West, plans to discuss “the formation of a representative political system; responses to the urgent humanitarian and economic crises; security and counterterrorism concerns; and human rights, especially education for girls and women,” according to a statement released by the U.S. State Department.The Scandinavian country, home to the Nobel Peace Prize, is no stranger to diplomacy. It has been involved in peace efforts in a number of countries, including Mozambique, Afghanistan, Venezuela, Colombia, the Philippines, Israel and the Palestinian Territories, Syria, Myanmar, Somalia, Sri Lanka and South Sudan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-hold-first-talks-in-europe-since-afghan-takeover-101643023442696.html

"The respondent's application for leave to appeal to the supreme court is refused."This means the Supreme Court will have to decide whether or not it should hear his challenge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-wins-permission-to-appeal-against-extradition-to-us-101643022096408.html

We cannot let it continue to drag on, lurching between panic and neglect,” the WHO chief was quoted as saying by Reuters.Ghebreyesus made the statements during the 150th session of the WHO Executive Board meeting. During the week-long meeting, several key elements of the United Nation health agency, including Ghebreyesus' second term as the director general, and a proposal to make the agency more financially independent, are expected to be discussed, Reuters said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-conditions-are-ideal-for-more-covid-variants-to-emerge-who-chief-101643018361484.html
24-01-2022||World||Pakistan swears in Ayesha Malik as first woman supreme court judge||Pakistan swore in Ayesha Malik as its first female supreme court judge on Monday, a landmark occasion in a nation where activists say the law is often wielded against women.Malik attended a ceremony in the capital Islamabad where she now sits on the bench alongside 16 male colleagues at Pakistan's highest court."It's a huge step forward," lawyer and women's rights activist Nighat Dad told AFP."It is history in the making for Pakistan's judiciary."Malik was educated at Harvard University and served as a high court judge in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore for the past two decades.She has been credited with rolling back patriarchal legal mores in her Punjab province jurisdiction.Last year she outlawed a deeply invasive and medically discredited examination used to determine a woman's level of sexual experience.Women in Pakistan often struggle to gain justice in rape and sexual assault cases, and the test was deployed as a means of discrediting victims by casting aspersion on their character.Malik's elevation to the apex court of Pakistan may clear the way for more women to enter the historically conservative and male-dominated judiciary of the Islamic republic."She has broken all barriers in the judicial system and it will allow other women in the system to move forward," said lawyer and women's rights activist Khadija Siddiqi."I hope this will lead to more women-centric decisions by the judiciary in the future."But her appointment has been mired in controversy for the past four months, with claims she jumped a queue of more senior male candidates qualified for the post.Earlier this month the Pakistan Bar Council staged a strike to protest against Malik's nomination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-swears-in-ayesha-malik-as-first-woman-supreme-court-judge-101643017938576.html
24-01-2022||World||Mexican journalist murdered in Tijuana, second in less than a week||A journalist was killed in Tijuana Sunday, the local prosecutor said, the second media worker murdered in less than a week in the northern Mexican border city.Lourdes Maldonado Lopez was "attacked with a firearm while she was in a vehicle," said the Baja California state prosecutor's office.Mexico is one of the world's deadliest countries for reporters.Media rights watchdog Reporters Without Borders regularly ranks it alongside Afghanistan and Yemen among the world's most dangerous places for news media.Maldonado had worked for several media outlets, including Primer Sistema de Noticias (PSN), which is owned by Jaime Bonilla, who was governor of Baja California from 2019 to the end of 2021.She won a lawsuit a few days ago against PSN, which she had been suing for nine years for unfair dismissal, Mexican press reported.Two years ago, Maldonado had asked Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador for "support, help and justice" as she feared for her life, according to a video republished on social media after news broke of her assassination."I have been on trial for six years with him," she added about the governor, during one of Obrador's press conferences.NGO the Committee to Protect Journalists said on Twitter it was "shocked by the murder of Lourdes Maldonado, the second reporter to be killed in the city of Tijuana in less than a week."The group called on local authorities to "thoroughly and transparently investigate the attack."Its representative in Mexico, Jan-Albert Hootsen, added that he was "shocked and horrified by four brutal attacks on journalists in Mexico in barely two weeks," including a non-fatal knife attack on a media worker in Merida, Yucatan state.On Monday, photojournalist Margarito Martinez was found dead near his home in the city.The 49-year-old, who specialized in news related to the police, had a gunshot wound to the head, according to prosecutors.Authorities were also urged to investigate an attack earlier this month that led to the death of journalist and social media activist Jose Luis Gamboa in the eastern state of Veracruz.Gamboa was taken to the hospital on January 10 after he was stabbed and left lying on the street, but his body was not identified until Friday.It was unclear if the killing was related to his work.At least seven journalists were murdered in Mexico in 2021, according to an AFP count, although it has not been determined if all the killings were linked to their work.More than 100 reporters have been murdered since 2000 in Mexico and only a fraction of the crimes have resulted in convictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexican-journalist-murdered-in-tijuana-second-in-less-than-a-week-101643011033538.html
24-01-2022||World||‘Leave Ukraine’: US tells American citizens, families of diplomats amid tensions||WASHINGTON: As diplomatic talks over Ukraine fail to yield a breakthrough, and tensions with Russia deepen, the United States has ordered family members of its diplomats to leave Ukraine, and advised all US citizens to do the same, citing “the increased threat of Russian military action”. In an advisory on Sunday night, the US state department authorised the “voluntary departure” of US direct hire employees, and “ordered the departure of eligible family members” from its embassy in Kiev “due to the continued threat of Russian military action”. The advisory added that US citizens in Ukraine “should consider departing now using commercial or other privately available transportation options”.“There are reports Russia is planning significant military action against Ukraine. The security conditions, particularly along Ukraine’s borders, in Russia-occupied Crimea, and in Russia-controlled eastern Ukraine, are unpredictable and can deteriorate with little notice. Demonstrations, which have turned violent at times, regularly occur throughout Ukraine, including in Kiev.” In an additional nudge, the advisory said that US citizens “should be aware that Russian military action anywhere in Ukraine would severely impact” the American embassy’s ability to provide consular services, including assistance to citizens in departing Ukraine. The advisory comes in the backdrop of US President Joe Biden saying last week that while he thought Russian president Vldimir Putin would invade Ukraine. It also comes in the backdrop of sustained diplomatic talks between the US and Russia, including most recently in Geneva where secretary of state Antony Blinken met his Russian counterpart, foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, that have not yielded a breakthrough – during the talks, Blinken agreed to give written US responses to Russian security proposals, while reiterating the US demand that Russia de-escalate its military presence along Ukraine’s borders. It also comes in the backdrop of the United Kingdom claiming, based on intelligence assessments, that Moscow had plans to destabilise the government in Kiev and install a pro-Russian leader in power. Over the weekend, Biden also met his national security team at Camp David to review the situation, where, according to a report in The New York Times, the administration considered the option of sending 1,000 to 5,000 troops to NATO allies in eastern Europe – with the option of increasing the number 10-fold.Following the advisory, a senior state department official, “These decisions were made out of an abundance of caution due to continued Russian efforts to destabilise the country and undermine the security of Ukrainian citizens and others visiting or residing in Ukraine.” Also Read: US signal to China: Stay away from Taiwan during Ukraine crisisReferring to Biden’s statement that military action could take place at any time, the official said that the US government would then not be in a position to evacuate its citizens.But the official added that while these decisions were meant for the safety of its citizens and government employees, they do not undermine US support for Ukraine, and the American embassy would continue to operate. “In addition to our diplomatic coordination, we are assisting Ukraine with new lethal defensive security assistance, including ammunition for the front-line defenders of Ukraine. The first of several shipments for Ukrainian armed forces, totalling $200 million, arrived in Kiev on January 22, and more will arrive in weeks to come. With this new authorisation, the United States has committed more than $650 million of security assistance to Ukraine in the past year and more than $2.7 billion in total US security assistance to Ukraine since 2014.”When asked if the experience in Afghanistan – where the sudden Taliban takeover in Afghanistan had left many stranded, provoking widespread criticism of the Biden administration back at home – had prompted the advisory, the senior official quoted above said, “I can say for my part, this is very much a decision that is focused on the situation in Ukraine and what is best for embassy Kiev and American citizens in Ukraine.” 
24-01-2022||World||Will everyone get infected with Omicron? Here's what WHO has to say||With Omicron overtaking pre-existing coronavirus variants like Alpha, Beta and the deadly Delta across the world at a rapid pace, the World Health Organization's technical lead has urged to remain cautious as the variant is ‘efficiently transmitted between people’.Replying to query at a programme, WHO technical lead Maria Van Kerkhove said that Omicron is less severe than Delta but it can still lead to the full spectrum of disease as seen in the previous strains. "People who are infected with Omicron have the full spectrum of disease, everything from asymptomatic infection all the way through severe disease and death," she replied to a question on why people still ended up in the hospital or died."People with underlying conditions, people with advanced age, people who are unvaccinated can have a severe form of Covid-19 following infection from Omicron," Kerkhove said.On a query regarding if everyone will eventually get Omicron, the WHO tech lead said, "Omicron is overtaking Delta in terms of circulation, and it is very efficiently transmitted between people."Also Read | ‘Omicron will find everybody’: Fauci as US on 'threshold' of living with CovidKerkhove noted that although cases were high around the world, it still did not mean that everybody will get Omicron.The UN health agency had previously said that the preliminary evidence indicates that the available vaccines against Covid-19 may be less effective against Omicron transmission, which also carries a higher risk of reinfection."As a result of this, the overall risk related to the new variant of concern Omicron remains very high," it had said earlier this month.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had also reiterated that the pandemic was far from over. "This pandemic is nowhere near over," he had told reporters from the agency's headquarters in Geneva in response to people dismissing Omicron as a mild infection.Currently, the United States is at the top of the chart for coronavirus cases, followed by India at the second spot.However, US President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci has expressed optimism that the Omicron surge will soon peak, though the decline won’t be uniform throughout the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-everyone-get-infected-with-omicron-here-s-what-who-has-to-say-101642994501057.html
24-01-2022||World||Faculty members oppose caste in US university's non-discriminatory policy||Over 80 faculty members of the prestigious California State University have opposed a recent announcement of the university to include caste in its non-discriminatory policy as a "misguided overreach", saying it will actually cause discrimination by unconstitutionally singling out Hindu faculty of Indian and South Asian descent.According to the anti-discrimination policy recently announced by the California State University (CSU), caste-oppressed students will now be able to report anti-Dalit bias, which many students claim is a regular occurrence.According to the Dalit civil rights organisation Equity Labs, Dalit people are those who are at the bottom of India’s social caste system, one that is estimated to be thousands of years old, and who face discrimination and violence. They used to be called “untouchables” in India.Discrimination because of one’s caste status has been outlawed in India, but the practice continues, even in South Asian diasporas in the US, it said.In a blistering letter to the CSU Board of Trustees opposing the move to include caste in its non-discriminatory policy, the faculty members have written that the new policy would unfairly target a minority community for policing and disparate treatment.Adding caste as a specific and separate protected category would apply only to the faculty of Indian and South Asian descent, they said."The addition of caste is a misguided overreach given the existence of comprehensive policies that already protect against various forms of discrimination" said Praveen Sinha, professor of accountancy at CSU, Long Beach."We cannot but oppose the unique risk that CSU's move puts on us as they add a category that is only associated with people of Indian descent such as myself and thousands of other faculty and students in the CSU system. It is going to create divisions where they simply do not exist," he added.The faculty members have written that there are more than 600 CSU faculty of Indian and South Asian origin who would be rendered vulnerable should the collective bargaining agreement be passed as currently written, according to a media release."As a faculty member of Indian origin, I am well aware that discrimination is a daily reality for many students of varied backgrounds, and there is a robust mechanism to address all such complaints under the existing laws and the CSU policy," said Sunil Kumar, professor of engineering at the San Diego State University."But this policy change has been made in the absence of any scientifically reliable evidence or data. Rather than redressing discrimination, it will actually cause discrimination by unconstitutionally singling out and targeting Hindu faculty of Indian and South Asian descent as members of a suspect class because of deeply entrenched, false stereotypes about Indians, Hindus and caste," he said."We are disappointed that the CSU faculty association championed this move without holding discussions with the faculty concerned, even when three professors had alerted them way back in May 2021. In their meeting with these three professors on January 14 this year, some of the CFA leaders admitted that they did not understand the complexity of caste and that they dropped the ball," Kumar said.Earlier, lawyers at the Hindu American Foundation (HAF), Suhag Shukla, Samir Kalra and Nikhil Joshi, also sent a letter to the CSU Board of Trustees, the CSU Office of General Counsel, the CSU chancellor and the president of the California Faculty Association on behalf of the CSU faculty."It is simply unfathomable how system-wide leaders and a faculty union, which is contractually obligated to protect and represent all of its members regardless of their background, could negotiate a clause that will discriminate against faculty of a particular background or faith, especially where existing laws and policies already provide redress," Shukla said.Scheduled Castes is the official term for Dalits as per the Constitution of India. They were excluded from the four-fold varna system of Hinduism and were seen as forming a fifth varna.Although the caste system was abolished in India, discrimination is still rampant in many places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/faculty-members-oppose-caste-in-us-university-s-non-discriminatory-policy-101642996232975.html

Unvaccinated people, those at advanced age and with underlying conditions can have a severe form of Covid-19 following infection from Omicron, the global health body added.Omicron is currently the dominant variant in the European Union with a 78% pooled prevalence. In the United States, daily infections have begun to fall, indicating that Omicron is relenting. On the other hand, in India, the spread of the variant has reached the community transmission stage.Here are the latest updates on Omicron from across the world:> Russia's daily Covid-19 cases spiked for the third consecutive day with the highest ever single-day surge on Sunday at 63,205. According to authorities, Omicron has so far been detected in 64 of the 89 regions in the country.> In South Korea, daily cases shot up to 7,630 in the last 24 hours, the second highest single day spike seen in the country since the onset of the pandemic in 2020. The government is currently working towards a plan to change the medical response system to contain the spread of Omicron.> Even though the national daily tally of Covid-19 has started falling, in the United States indicating that the Omicron variant is relenting, fatalities are still surging, according to a report by the New York Times.> Protests in Brussels against the restrictions imposed to curb the spread of Omicron continue with police resorting to water cannon trucks firing powerful jets and tear gas to disperse the protesters.> Amid the variant's surge in New Zealand, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern called off her wedding.

24-01-2022||World||US signal to China: Stay away from Taiwan during Ukraine crisis||With two nuclear powered aircraft carrier strike groups patrolling the Philippines Sea and another one forwardly deployed to Yokosuka, Japan, the US has sent a strong message to China to stay away from Taiwan while the former is locked with Russia over Ukraine.The PLA on Sunday responded to the massive US naval drills by sending as many as 39 warplanes, largely fighters like J-10 and J-16, into Taiwan’s south-western air defense identification zone (ADIZ) as tensions escalated over the breakaway island country. The Taiwan air force resumed combat air patrol and activated surface to air missile systems to deter the aggressive PLA Air Force. This is the first time after October 2021 that the PLA has responded to US drills with so many fighters.This large-scale Taiwan airspace transgression by Chinese fighter took place when the US Navy has three aircraft carrier strike groups in support of Taipei and freedom of navigation operations in Philippines Sea. While USS Carl Vinson and Abraham Lincoln are patrolling near Taiwan, the USS Ronald Reagan is on standby near Yokosuka in Japan. The US has also large scale marine presence with presence of USS Essex amphibious ready group and USS America expeditionary strike group joining the aircraft carriers. Patrolling with the massive carrier force is Japanese Hyuga class helicopter destroyer with USS strike groups deploying as many as 26 F-35 fifth generation fighters.The US Navy build-up near Taiwan is a clear message to China that it cannot have a free pass to Taipei while Washington is locked up in a confrontation with Russia over Ukraine. “The message to China is that US has not taken off its eyes from Beijing and wants PLA to stay away from Taiwan till such time the Ukraine crisis gets resolved,” said a former Indian ambassador to US.Since the US-Russia escalation over Ukraine has started, many believed that this would give President Xi Jinping a free pass to aggressively pursue what China calls its core interests. The Biden administration has this month already conveyed to China that it is watching PLA build-up in Ladakh as the India-China stand-off on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) completes second winter on Tibetan plateau.

24-01-2022||World||US advises citizens against travel to Russia amid tensions on Ukraine border||The United States has warned its citizens against travelling to Russia in the wake of tensions on the border with Ukraine. Russia has amassed 100,000 troops near the Ukrainian border, a move which the US-led countries say is a prelude to war."Do not travel to Russia due to ongoing tension along the border with Ukraine," a statement from the US State Department said, adding that Americans could also face "harassment" and that the embassy would have "limited ability to assist US citizens."The families of American diplomats in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv have been ordered to leave the country “due to the continued threat of a Russian invasion”.Along with troops, Russia has also deployed tanks, fighting vehicles, artillery and missiles on its border with Ukraine.Intense diplomatic efforts have been launched to convince Russia to tone down its aggressive posturing but they have yielded little results.The Kremlin has so far denied any intentions to invade its neighbour - but is making de-escalation conditional on treaties guaranteeing non-expansion of Natos, especially to Ukraine, and a withdrawal of the alliance from Eastern Europe.On Sunday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken dismissed the idea of slapping punitive sanctions on Moscow before any potential invasion, saying they should be used as a means of "dissuading" an attack.However, British Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab warned Russia of “severe consequences” if it tries to invade Ukraine or install a puppet regime there.The minister made the accusation while speaking to Sky News on Saturday, also saying that Russian intelligence officers had been in contact with a number of former Ukrainian politicians as part of plans for an invasion.The New York Times said that US President Joe Biden was mulling plans to send 1,000 to 5,000 troops to Eastern European countries, with the possibility of increasing the number should tensions flare further.The United States has described the alleged plotting over Ukraine as deeply concerning, and US officials said they were bracing for Russian action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-advises-citizens-against-travel-to-russia-amid-tensions-on-ukraine-border-101642990982980.html
24-01-2022||World||New COVID-19 rapid tests to arrive in US schools this week: White House||US schools should receive the first additional COVID-19 rapid tests being made available by the federal government in about two weeks, a White House official said, as Washington races to keep classes open amid a record-setting Omicron surge.The new tests must be ordered through state governments, but the White House is also making available lab capacity to support five million monthly PCR tests that schools can order themselves if their states are not being helpful, the official said. Those should arrive in seven to 10 days.The Biden administration on Wednesday announced a new set of measures to keep classes open, including doubling COVID-19 testing capacity in schools with 10 million more tests, as the Omicron variant spreads rapidly through the United States.COVID-19 hospitalizations in the United States have increased by about 33% and deaths are up by about 40% from a week earlier, Rochelle Walensky, head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said on Wednesday.The Biden administration has urged states to spend $10 billion in resources distributed to them for testing under coronavirus legislation signed into law last year, although some have been slow to disburse the funds, the official said.Education sources said some school districts in states such as Pennsylvania, Texas and elsewhere have struggled to get access to tests, partly due to differences over safety protocols, as well as supply constraints."We don't want any state to stand in the way. Period," said the official, adding the administration would find other ways to provide resources to schools if they ran into trouble with their state governments."We've been really trying hard to make sure that everyone knows all the resources that are available to them right now," the official said.The U.S. Department of Education last year provided grant funding to a Florida school district that had state funds withheld because it mandated students wear masks in defiance of the Republican governor's ban on such mandates.The issue of school closures has remained politicized and contentious, but the White House says nearly 96% of schools nationwide held in-person classes this month, up from 46% of schools in January 2021.The official said the extra rapid tests would come from a "dedicated portion" of an existing contract, and sufficient capacity would be available given contracts the administration is now signing to procure 500 million rapid tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-covid-19-rapid-tests-to-arrive-in-us-schools-this-week-white-house-101642989886505.html
24-01-2022||World||Belgian police fire water cannon, tear gas during protest against Covid curbs, vaccine passes||Tens of thousands of people protested in Brussels on Sunday against Covid-19 restrictions, some clashing with police who fired water cannon and tear gas to disperse them near the European Commission's headquarters.The rally drew about 50,000 people, Belgian police said.It was peaceful at first as protesters chanted and filled streets, waving placards and balloons with slogans like: "We want to be free again" and "No Covid slave ticket", a reference to vaccine passes required for certain activities.Trouble flared later, with a building housing the European diplomatic service and a sandwich shop broken into, a Reuters journalist said. Police said more than 60 people were arrested, with three officers and 12 demonstrators taken to hospital.Belgium announced a slight easing of coronavirus restrictions on Friday despite record infections, but also said people must have booster shots after five months to keep passes for bars, cinemas and many other public spaces.‘Anti-dictator, not anti-vaxxer’ “I'm angry about the blackmail that the government is doing,” said protester Caroline van Landuyt, who had herself been vaccinated. Her children did not want to be inoculated but had to so as to travel and play sport, she said.Sunday's scenes in the Belgian capital were reminiscent of clashes last November, when around 35,000 protesters took to Brussels' streets and there was also violence.EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell thanked police and condemned "the senseless destruction and violence" in a tweet that showed him standing in front of a broken pane of glass.Some protesters let off fireworks as police advanced into a park. Riot officers ringed the water cannon. "I'm not an anti-vaxxer, I'm anti-dictator," read another placard.Belgium is facing a fifth wave of Covid-19 infections, with the peak not expected for at least a couple of weeks.Some 89% of Belgian adults are fully vaccinated and 67% have now also received a booster shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/belgian-police-fire-water-cannon-tear-gas-during-protest-against-covid-curbs-vaccine-passes-101642981802848.html

24-01-2022||World||At least 123 killed in Syria clashes||At least 123 people have been killed in Syria including seven civilians as battles between US-backed Kurdish forces and Islamic State group fighters raged for a fourth day, a war monitor said on Sunday.Fighting began late on Thursday with an assault by more than 100 Islamic State insurgents on the Kurdish-run Ghwayran jail in Hasakeh city - which housed the largest number of jihadists in the country -- marking the group’s most significant operation since its “caliphate” was declared defeated in Syria nearly three years ago.The assault coincided with riots inside the prison.Ongoing battles have seen IS fighters free fellow jihadists and seize weapons stored at the jail, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, in what experts have described as a blatant regrouping attempt.“At least 77 IS members and 39 Kurdish fighters, including internal security forces, prison guards and counter-terrorism forces have been killed” in violence inside and outside the prison since the start of the attack, the Observatory said.At least seven civilians have also been killed in the fighting, according to the monitor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-123-killed-in-syria-clashes-101642979494002.html

24-01-2022||World||‘Plot to install pro-Russia regime in Ukraine’||The UK government has taken the unusual step of making a formal statement to warn of a Russian plot to install a pro-Kremlin leader in Ukraine amid growing tensions in the region.The UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) named former Ukrainian MP Yevhen Murayev as a potential Kremlin candidate and once again warned Russia of “severe costs” of activities to subvert Ukraine.“The information being released today shines light on the extent of Russian activity designed to subvert Ukraine, and is an insight into Kremlin’s thinking,” UK foreign secretary Liz Truss said in a statement on Saturday.Russia rejects UK claimRussia on Sunday rejected a British claim that Russia was seeking to replace Ukraine’s government with a pro-Moscow administration.“The disinformation spread by the British Foreign Office is more evidence that it is the Nato countries, led by the Anglo-Saxons, who are escalating tensions around Ukraine,” Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on the Telegram messaging app on Sunday. “We call on the British Foreign Office to stop provocative activities, stop spreading nonsense.”The White House called the UK government assessment “deeply concerning” and said it stands with the duly elected Ukrainian government. “This kind of plotting is deeply concerning,” National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne said.Meanwhile, US secretary of state Antony Blinken on Sunday rebuffed the idea of imposing economic sanctions on Russia now, saying that doing so would undercut the West’s ability to deter potential Russian aggression against Ukraine.“When it comes to sanctions, the purpose of those sanctions is to deter Russian aggression. And so if they are triggered now, you lose the deterrent effect,” Blinken told CNN’s State of the Union programme in an interview.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/plot-to-install-pro-russia-regime-in-ukraine-101642977006027.html
24-01-2022||World||China: Beijing on alert as mass Covid-19 tests ordered for residents||Beijing’s local government on Sunday ordered mass tests for all the residents of a district in the capital as the number of cases in the city continued to rise less than two weeks ahead of the Winter Olympic Games, scheduled to begin on February 4.The capital has reported 39 Covid-19 infections since January 15, a mix of Delta and Omicron variants, with the highest number diagnosed in the Fengtai district, which has shut down wholesale markets, sealed apartment blocks and suspended gathering activities.Nucleic acid tests for all residents of Fengtai, one of the 16 Beijing districts, began on Sunday, health authorities said.Nine locally transmitted cases were found in Beijing for Saturday (January 22) the national health commission (NHC) said on Sunday, of which six were in the Fengtai district.Residents of areas deemed high-risk have been asked not to leave Beijing and health authorities have urged people to proactively conduct nucleic acid tests if they find themselves with Covid-19-like symptoms within 14 days of receiving any deliveries from overseas.State-run Global Times reported that three spilled-over cases, related to the chain of transmissions in Beijing, were reported in Jinan and Liaocheng, east China’s Shandong province and one in Datong city of north China’s Shanxi province.“All the cases were either cold storage workers in Beijing or close contacts of infected workers,” the report said.“The cold chain related transmission was caused by the Delta virus, affecting Chaoyang, Fengtai and Fangshan districts. The Omicron-related transmission chain was tracked to international mails, which concentrated in Haidian district,” it added.Meanwhile, as of Friday, over 200 million senior citizens in China have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19, the NHC has said.He Qinghua, a senior NHC official said that as of Friday, over 2.96 billion Covid-19 vaccine doses had been administered on the Chinese mainland.More than 1.22 billion people have been fully vaccinated, with 209 million of that number being aged 60 or above, the official was quoted by Xinhua as saying.The Chinese mainland recorded 19 locally transmitted Covid-19 infections on Saturday, the NHC said on Sunday.Besides the nine new local infections in Beijing, five were reported from neighbouring Tianjin, three in Guangdong and one each in Henan and Yunnan provinces respectively.As of Saturday, the Chinese mainland had reported 105,603 confirmed cases, including both local ones and those arriving from outside the mainland.
