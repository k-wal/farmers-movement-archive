Both sides had expressed caution about the outlook for the negotiations before they started.Russia is insisting on legally-binding guarantees of a halt to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization enlargement and an end to the alliance’s military presence in eastern and central European nations that joined the bloc since 1997. The U.S. has dismissed that as unrealistic, offering instead to curtail missile deployments and exercises in the region.Russia has amassed more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine, prompting warnings in Washington and Kyiv of the risk of an incursion into the ex-Soviet neighbor. The Kremlin denies it’s planning to attack, but says it’s responding to increased NATO activity on its borders and the threat of a Ukrainian offensive against Russian-backed separatists in the eastern Donbas region. Ukraine has rejected accusations of any planned invasion. The US and its allies have threatened to impose punishing sanctions on Russia if it invades. The talks in Geneva were the first of three sets of negotiations taking place this week. There will be Russian consultations with NATO in Brussels on Wednesday and discussions in Vienna under the framework of the 57-nation Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe a day later.Over the weekend, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had played down the possibility of any immediate “breakthroughs.” Presidents Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin decided last month to make a major diplomatic push to resolve their differences. Russia, which in 2014 annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and fomented a standoff in Donbas which has claimed 14,000 lives so far, is fiercely opposed to the NATO ambitions of Ukraine and another ex-Soviet state, Georgia.The US and its European allies are discussing a range of retaliatory measures if Putin does invade Ukraine, including cutting off Russia from Swift, the international payments system, limiting Russian banks’ ability to convert currencies and imposing export controls on advanced technologies used in aviation, semiconductors and other components, as well as computers and other consumer goods in more extreme scenarios.But concern among some big European nations about economic fallout raises the risk of a split with the US on how strongly to hit Russia with sanctions if it stages aggression against Ukraine, according to people familiar with the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-round-of-us-russia-security-talks-ends-amid-war-fears-101641832209913.html
10-01-2022||World||Afghan envoy to China quits after 6 months of no pay, leaves hand over note, keys to embassy's cars to successor||Afghanistan's ambassador to China left a colourful resignation note for his post-Taliban takeover successor on Monday -- revealing that staff had not been paid for months and that a lone receptionist had been left to answer phones.Javid Ahmad Qaem took to Twitter to detail how he had to scrape cash from the embassy's bank account to pay staff after the Taliban seized Afghanistan last August."Since we did not receive salaries from Kabul for the last six months, we assigned a committee from within the diplomats to solve the financial issues," Qaem wrote in a letter to Afghanistan's foreign ministry dated January 1 but posted to social media on Monday.Still, he left some funds for his successor."As of today, 1st January 2022, there is around $100,000 left in the account."He did not say where he was going next.In a portrait of a barely functioning embassy, Qaem's letter revealed he had left the keys for the embassy's five cars in his office and that a lone local hire had been assigned to answer queries after all the other diplomats left.Many of Afghanistan's embassies are in diplomatic limbo, run by staff still loyal to the Western-backed government toppled by the Taliban.Several Afghan diplomats have abandoned their Beijing postings since the fall of Kabul, Qaem wrote, calling his resignation "the end to an honourable responsibility" in an accompanying Tweet."I believe when the new person assigned, Mr Sadaat, arrives to Beijing, there will be no other diplomat left," the letter said, adding that China had been "well-informed".Diplomatic limboIt was not immediately clear of the whereabouts of his successor, or who had appointed him, and no immediate comment from Taliban officials in Kabul.The Afghan embassy in Beijing appeared open as usual on Monday afternoon, with the internationally recognised Afghan tricolour raised and two security guards outside.Qaem, who has served as ambassador since November 2019, had expressed concerns about the Taliban in media interviews shortly after China hosted a visiting delegation in July.Weeks later, the Taliban captured Kabul and formed a new Islamist government.Since then, Afghanistan has been plunged into financial chaos, with inflation and unemployment surging.China has provided millions to Afghanistan in aid since the takeover and the new regime sees Beijing as a crucial source of investment.The Taliban have not appointed new representatives to most missions, however, and their government is not recognised by any nation.Beijing is not the only Afghan embassy that has seemingly fallen into chaos.Police were called to the country's embassy in Rome last week when a sacked Afghan diplomat attacked the ambassador after claiming to have been appointed to replace him, the mission said.The Taliban's foreign ministry in Kabul said the diplomat still had a valid contract and his termination was illegal.There has also been a diplomatic standoff at the UN, with representatives of the former and current regime both claiming Afghanistan's seat.Late last year the UN Security Council indefinitely postponed making a decision on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-envoy-to-china-quits-after-6-months-of-no-pay-leaves-hand-over-note-keys-to-embassy-s-cars-to-successor-101641821651969.html
10-01-2022||World||Covid-19: Chinese capital on alert as partly-locked down Tianjin’s cases jump||China’s first community-based Omicron outbreak has partially locked down the northern city of Tianjin and put officials in neighbouring Beijing on high alert with health authorities tracking down cases from the same transmission chain to the central province of Henan.At least 21 more cases of Covid-19 were reported in the port city of Tianjin, some 130km and a 40-minute high-speed train ride away from Beijing, for Sunday, the national health commission (NHC) said on Monday, taking the total number to 40.At least two Omicron cases were confirmed on Sunday (for Saturday), health authorities said. It wasn’t clear if there were more cases of the highly transmissible Omicron variant among the 41 officially confirmed cases.Worryingly for the government, the Tianjin outbreak has been linked to two Omicron cases reported on Monday in the city of Anyang around 400km away in Henan province.Coming weeks ahead of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, the new outbreak will further test China’s “dynamic Covid” policy, which means stamping out the smallest number of cases with mass testing and lockdowns.Announcing a partial lockdown in Tianjin, city authorities have said the general public should not leave Tianjin unless it is essential to do so as health officials carry out nucleic acid tests on nearly 14 million residents of the city.Tianjin’s mass testing scheme, which is expected to be completed by the end of Monday, is part of its effort to “resolutely prevent the virus spreading to other provinces, regions and cities, especially Beijing”, the city government said in a letter to residents.Those who need to leave must obtain official permission and test negative for the virus within 48 hours of their departure, the local government added.Schools and university campuses have been closed, and Beijing-bound trains from Tianjin have been cancelled; road checkpoints have been set up to check vehicles before being allowed to enter the capital.“Tianjin’s experience with controlling and treating the Omicron variant will provide invaluable experience for other regions to fight the epidemic,” Zhang Boli, from the Chinese Academy of Engineering was quoted as saying by state media on Monday.Zhang added that the Tianjin outbreak showed that the proportion of young among the infected group, especially primary and secondary school students, was relatively high, and authorities should be vigilant about it.On Monday, Tianjin launched an emergency response mechanism to guarantee the supply of daily necessities.According to the Tianjin municipal bureau of commerce, local authorities have mobilised major wholesale suppliers, supermarkets and vegetable markets to add inventory in order to cope with the market demand for meat, eggs and vegetables.Across the mainland, there were 97 new local cases for Sunday, the NHC announced on Monday, besides 100 imported cases.In the northwest, Xian - whose 13 million residents have been in lockdown since December 23 - reported 15 new local symptomatic cases on Monday, down from 30 on Sunday.Xian has recorded more than 2,000 Covid-19 cases during the current outbreak.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases on the mainland had reached 103,776 by Sunday with the death toll at 4636.China has so far administered over 2.9 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines until Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-chinese-capital-on-alert-as-partly-locked-down-tianjin-s-cases-jump-101641819569717.html
10-01-2022||World||Pope backs Covid immunisation campaigns, warns of ideological misinformation||Pope Francis on Monday condemned "baseless" ideological misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines, backing national immunisation campaigns and calling health care a moral obligation.Francis spoke in his yearly address to the diplomatic corps accredited to the Vatican, sometimes called his "State of the World" address because it is a broad survey of the global situation.His words to diplomats from nearly 200 countries marked the closest he has ever come to a de facto backing of vaccine mandates, which have become controversial in Italy and other European countries."We have realised that in those places where an effective vaccination campaign has taken place, the risk of severe repercussions of the disease has decreased," he said."It is therefore important to continue the effort to immunise the general population as much as possible".Francis, who dedicated about a fifth of his six-page address to the pandemic, warned against ideological statements regarding vaccinations."Sadly, we are finding increasingly that we live in a world of strong ideological divides. Frequently people let themselves be influenced by the ideology of the moment, often bolstered by baseless information or poorly documented facts," he said."Vaccines are not a magical means of healing, yet surely they represent, in addition to other treatments that need to be developed, the most reasonable solution for the prevention of the disease," he told the diplomats gathered in the Vatican's frescoed Hall of the Benedictions.By saying that "health care is a moral obligation" in the context of a speech supporting vaccinations, Francis appeared to be responding to Catholics and other Christians, particularly in the United States, who say they have a religion-based right of conscientious objection to vaccines.Francis, who is fully vaccinated, called for a global political commitment "to pursue the good of the general population through measures of prevention and immunisation".He renewed his appeal for the equitable distribution of vaccines to poor nations, saying that "monopolistic rules" regarding patents should be put aside for the greater good.Francis also reiterated his defence of migrants, saying each country should accept as many as possible and that responsibility for their integration should be shared.On climate change, he said the results of last year's COP26 summit in Glasgow were "rather weak in light of the gravity of the problem" and hoped that action on global warming could be consolidated at COP27 planned for Egypt in November.He repeated calls for dialogue in areas of conflict or crisis such as Lebanon, Ukraine and Myanmar as well as his call for a ban on the possession of nuclear weapons.The Vatican, the world's smallest state, has diplomatic relations with 183 states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-backs-covid-immunisation-campaigns-warns-of-ideological-misinformation-101641818391058.html

However, the IS has operated in Afghanistan since 2014, carrying out dozens of horrific attacks and most often targeting the country's minority Shiite Muslims.Afghanistan is among the countries with the most unexploded land mines and other ordnance from the country's decades of war and conflict. When the ordnance detonates, the victims are often children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-explosion-kills-9-children-in-eastern-afghanistan-101641814921228.html
10-01-2022||World||Kazakhstan unrest: Here’s a timeline of the central Asian nation’s worst crisis||More than 160 people, including children, have died and more than 8000 have been detained in Kazakhstan over the past one week amid massive protests.Starting Wednesday, Almaty, the country's biggest city and former capital, was subject to an internet blackout that has finally been lifted with services resumed on January 10.The Kazakh protests that began on January 2 due to a hike in fuel prices have turned into one of the worst unrests faced by the country since its independence.Also Read | Explained: How Kazakhstan protests started and the bigger pictureThe Russian-led bloc has provided President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev with 2,030 troops and 250 pieces of military hardware. Kazakhstan's Committee of National Security says the situation in the country is under control now, with ‘terrorist hotbeds' neutralised, according to a Reuters report.Here’s a timeline of the recent crisis:January 3 - Thousands protested in Zhanaozen, Aqtau, Mangystau, Nur-Sultan, and other cities across the central Asian nation. A rise in oil prices will affect the price of everyday commodities like food, they complained. About three people were detained by police.January 4 - Tear gas and stun grenades were used to drive hundreds of protestors out of the main Almaty square. Over 20 demonstrators were arrested across the country, while eight police officers were killed. To appease the protesters, the government announced that some price caps would be restored on LPG.January 5 - A nationwide state of emergency was announced by the authorities after government buildings were stormed by demonstrators and protests turned violent. Almaty's city hall and president's residence both caught fire on Wednesday, according to Interfax.Also Read | Here are some of the biggest protests Kazakhstan saw in the past decadesThe same day, the Kazakhstan government resigned following violent attacks, while videos were released of people shouting "Old man, go away!” directed towards former president Nursultan Nazarbayev, reported news agency Reuters.January 6 - Armenia's prime minister announced that Russian-led ex-Soviet troops will be sent to quell Kazakh protests following the president's appeal for assistance."Almaty was attacked, destroyed, vandalised, the residents of Almaty became victims of attacks by terrorists, bandits. Therefore it is our duty... to take all possible actions to protect our state," said Tokayev on his television appearance.January 7 - The government said order has been “mainly restored”. Security officers accused protestors of killing 13 police officers and injuring 353. Tokayev permitted security in the country to “fire without warning”. More than 4,400 people were arrested and 26 demonstrators killed.January 8 - The Kazakhstan government blamed foreign-backed terrorists for the unrest and announced the arrest of former counterintelligence and anti-terror agency chief, Karim Masimov, for attempted overthrow of the government. This day saw a major drop in protests.Watch Now | Watch: Chinese president Xi Jinping lends support to Kazakhstan govt amid unrestJanuary 9 - For a second day in a row, the streets of the protest epicentre Almaty were eerily silent, except for sounds of occasional gunshots. It seemed to be a result of the arrival of Russians and the bloody shutdown of demonstrators by Kazakh security. The Kazakh presidency reported 160 deaths and 5800 detentions on Sunday. Property damage worth 170 million euros has also been quoted, including banks, vehicles and public buildings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kazakhstan-unrest-here-s-a-timeline-of-the-central-asian-nation-s-worst-crisis-101641810135989.html
10-01-2022||World||Singapore says 30% Covid-19 deaths in 2021 were fully vaccinated||Fully vaccinated individuals accounted for 30 per cent of Singapore’s total Covid-19 related deaths last year, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said in Parliament on Monday.The minister said that Singapore last year registered 802 deaths due to the coronavirus, out of which 247 were fully vaccinated people.Most of the vaccinated individuals, who died from Covid-19 related complications, had received non-mRNA vaccines, according to crude incidence rates of deaths provided by Ong.Ong provided the crude incidence rates based on type of vaccination: 11 deaths per 100,000 for those vaccinated with Sinovac, 7.8 per 100,000 for Sinopharm, 6.2 per 100,000 for Pfizer-BioNTech and 1 per 100,000 for Moderna."Be mindful, we are calculating this based on quite a small sample of 247 deaths… These rates are only indicative since they do not account for other factors which can affect mortality such as the age and timing of vaccination," Channel News Asia quoted Ong as saying in the House.The remaining 555 people who died from Covid-19 last year were not fully vaccinated.Although the unvaccinated represents a "small proportion" of Singapore's population, those deaths accounted for 70 per cent of the total Covid-19 deaths last year, Ong said.The Ministry of Health (MOH) has managed to vaccinate "well over 90 per cent" of every eligible age group over the past months, he said."We are especially happy to see that amongst seniors aged 60 to 69, and 70 and above, 96 per cent and 95 per cent have been fully vaccinated respectively," the minister said.As for those aged 12 to 19 years old, 95 per cent are fully vaccinated, said the minister, while response has been "good" and operations have been "smooth" for vaccinations among younger children aged five to 11."At this time, only the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine is authorised for use in ages below 18 years. We will continue to monitor closely the availability of other vaccines, including non-mRNA vaccines that are approved for use in children," Ong assured the House.Singapore's booster programme is "gathering pace", with about 46 per cent of the population having received their boosters (third injection), said Ong."We have recently brought some 900,000 individuals aged 18 to 29 into the booster programme, of whom 700,000 are already eligible to receive their boosters today," he said.The MOH has also set a validity period for full vaccination status of 270 days, to send "a strong signal to our population".However, it is "still too early to tell" whether there is a need for further booster shots, he said.Israel is the only country that has authorised a fourth dose for non-immunocompromised individuals.Meanwhile, the current Covid-19 safe measures will only be tightened as a "last resort" when Singapore's healthcare system is under heavy strain, Ong said."It is the (multi-ministry task force’s) hope that we can ride through the Omicron wave with the current safe management measures."If we have to tighten the restrictions, it will be as a last resort when our healthcare system is under severe pressure," he said, in response to questions on whether stricter rules will be put in place.Citing Singapore's experience with the Delta wave last year, Ong said that even after it subsided, authorities had refrained from "being too jubilant" and over-relaxing restrictions."That would have been a mistake," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-says-30-covid-19-deaths-in-2021-were-fully-vaccinated-101641805590022.html

10-01-2022||World||US, Russia open high-stakes talks on Ukraine||Top US and Russian diplomats kicked off crucial talks Monday on soaring tensions over Ukraine, amid fears of a Russian invasion of its pro-Western neighbour.US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and her Russian counterpart Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov opened their meeting at the US mission in Geneva at 8:55 am (0755 GMT), a State Department spokesperson said.A convoy of black vehicles with Russian diplomatic plates had arrived shortly before, and was ushered through the large iron gates under a billowing US flag.The two diplomats had already met informally in the Swiss city on Sunday evening, with Ryabkov afterwards telling the Interfax news agency the conversation was "businesslike" and "difficult".The United States and Russia have set firm lines with Washington warning of the risk of confrontation and Moscow ruling out concessions.The talks start a week of diplomacy in which Russia will meet with NATO and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) officials, with the US trying to reassure European allies that they will not be sidelined.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken stressed Sunday that Russia had to choose between dialogue and confrontation, warning on CNN that there would be "massive consequences for Russia if it renews its aggression on Ukraine."Since late last year, Russia amassed tens of thousands of troops at the Ukrainian border, drawing Washington into a Cold War-style stand-off.President Vladimir Putin's government is insisting NATO must never grant membership to ex-Soviet Ukraine, which is pushing to join.Ryabkov told Russian news agencies Sunday that his country had ruled out making any concessions at the talks, even as Washington said many of Moscow's demands were non-starters.'Avoid confrontation' Blinken however insisted that there was a possible "path of dialogue and diplomacy to try to resolve some these differences and avoid confrontation."A senior White House official indicated Saturday that Washington could be prepared to discuss with Russia the possibility of both sides reining in the deployment of missile systems and the size and scope of military exercises.Blinken warned though that any positive outcome from the talks would rely in part on Russia's willingness to stand down from its aggressive posture, which he likened to "an atmosphere of escalation with a gun to Ukraine's head.""So if we're actually going to make progress, we're going to have to see de-escalation, Russia pulling back from the threat that it currently poses to Ukraine," he told CNN.The talks come after Putin and US counterpart Joe Biden met in Geneva last June and agreed on regular "stability" talks between Sherman and Ryabkov.In two phone calls to Putin, Biden has warned of severe consequences if Russia invades Ukraine.Measures under consideration include sanctions on Putin's inner circle, cancelling Russia's controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany or, in the most drastic scenario, severing Russia's links to the world's banking system.Russia insists it was deceived after the Cold War and understood that NATO would not expand.Instead, the US-led alliance welcomed in most of the former Warsaw Pact countries and the three Baltic nations that were under Soviet rule.Russia has put intense pressure on Ukraine since 2014 after a revolution overthrew a government that had sided with the Kremlin against moving closer to Europe.Russia seized the Crimean peninsula and backs an insurgency in eastern Ukraine in which more than 13,000 people have died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-russia-open-high-stakes-talks-on-ukraine-101641804800733.html
10-01-2022||World||Developing countries at risk of 'economic turbulence': IMF||Emerging economies should gird for possible rough times as the US Federal Reserve prepares to raise interest rates and world economic growth slows because of the Omicron variant of Covid-19, the IMF warned Monday.The International Monetary Fund, which is scheduled to release updated economic forecasts on January 25, said that for now global economic recovery from the ravages of the pandemic should continue this year and next.But "risks to growth remain elevated by the stubbornly resurgent pandemic," IMF economists Stephan Danninger, Kenneth Kang and Helene Poirson wrote in a blog post.The highly contagious Omicron strain has spread like wildfire around the world since mid-December, causing record numbers of new Covid cases in the latest wave of the global health crisis.Omicron, which seems to cause less severe disease than previous strains of the coronavirus, is causing countries to reinstitute health measures that hamper economic growth."Given the risk that this could coincide with faster Fed tightening, emerging economies should prepare for potential bouts of economic turbulence," the economists said, as these countries are also confronting elevated inflation and substantially higher public debt.The Fed has signalled that it will raise key interest rates sooner and more aggressively than it had planned, in order to counter rampant inflation in the US that is hitting US households and consumption -- the engine of economic growth in America.Higher interest rates mean financing costs for some emerging economies with dollar-denominated debt will rise.These countries are already lagging behind in the global economic recovery and thus less able to absorb added expenditure."While dollar borrowing costs remain low for many, concerns about domestic inflation and stable foreign funding led several emerging markets last year, including Brazil, Russia, and South Africa, to start raising interest rates," the IMF said.Quicker Fed rate hikes could rattle financial markets and cause tighter financial conditions on a global scale, the blog says.The risk is there will be a slowing of demand and trade in the US, as well as capital flight and a depreciation of the dollar in markets of emerging countries.The IMF recommended that emerging economy nations "tailor their response based on their circumstances and vulnerabilities."And central banks that are raising interest rates to fight inflation should engage in "clear and consistent communication" so people better understand the need for price stability, the international lender said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/developing-countries-at-risk-of-economic-turbulence-imf-101641804957484.html
10-01-2022||World||Covid-19 hospitalisations spike across provinces in Canada||While the risk of hospitalisation from the Omicron variant of Covid-19 is lower than that for Delta, the fact that it’s extremely transmissible is driving up admissions because of the sheer volume of cases, Canada’s chief public health officer has said.In a series of tweets on Sunday as hospitalisations spiked across several provinces, Dr Theresa Tam said one of the key concerns was that while surveillance and recent studies indicates the risk of hospitalisation from Omicron was lower compared to Delta, “sudden acceleration” caused by the variant “with an enormous volume of cases is driving up severe illness trends”.The current daily case counts, she pointed out, were 400% higher than the peak for the third wave of the pandemic in Canada, when on average 8,730 cases were reported daily in mid-April last year. Given this scenario, she added that it was “not unexpected we’ll see further increases in hospitalisation trends”.Her remarks came as provinces like Quebec and Ontario reported high hospitalisation numbers. Quebec set a new record with 2,436 on Sunday, while Ontario had 2,419.The rapid spread of Omicron has also led to the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) being called in to assist health authorities. Members of the military were rendering help in the remote First Nations territory of Bearskin Lake in northern Ontario, where half the population has been infected.Defence minister Anita Anand has also said that 200 CAF personnel have been deployed at vaccination centres in Quebec, as it ramps up its drive to deliver boosters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-hospitalisations-spike-across-provinces-in-canada-101641800788306.html
10-01-2022||World||China detects more Omicron cases as cities tighten restrictions||China reported more cases of the highly transmissible Omicron coronavirus variant on Monday, with authorities on high alert over flare-ups in major cities just weeks ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympics.The emergence of the fast-spreading variant is yet another test of China's zero Covid strategy, with authorities already battling several outbreaks -- including in Xi'an where 13 million city residents were in their third week of lockdown.Fears grew about a cluster of infections in the northern city of Tianjin, which was linked to two Omicron cases reported Monday in the city of Anyang around 400 kilometres (250 miles) away."The general public should not leave Tianjin unless essential to do so," city officials said in a statement Sunday.Those who need to leave must obtain official permission and test negative for the virus within 48 hours of their departure, it added.Schools and university campuses have been closed, and trains into Beijing from Tianjin have been cancelled.Road checkpoints have been set up for vehicles entering the capital.Tianjin -- just 150 kilometres from Beijing -- has already ordered the testing of all 14 million residents.Another 21 cases were reported in the city Monday, although the strain of virus wasn't confirmed.Footage from state broadcaster CCTV showed masked people in Tianjin's Nankai district queueing for virus tests on Sunday from medical workers in white hazmat suits.Gu Qing, director of the Tianjin Municipal Health Commission, told reporters at the weekend that the new cases are "mainly students and their parents who go to the same nursery and school."Henan outbreak The world's most populous nation -- where the coronavirus was first detected in late 2019 -- slowed the spread of the virus to a trickle through its zero Covid strategy, which includes targeted lockdowns, border restrictions and lengthy quarantines.While China's total reported cases are far lower than other virus hotspots such as the United States and Europe, there is widespread concern about the impact of Omicron.Authorities in the city of Anyang in central Henan province also announced the testing of all residents -- more than five million people -- over the weekend.The city on Monday reported two Omicron cases linked to the Tianjin cluster.Henan reported 60 new cases Monday but did not break down the tally by variant. The provincial capital Zhengzhou has closed schools and kindergartens, and stopped restaurants from accepting dine-in customers.Before the latest cluster, China had reported just a handful of Omicron cases, all linked to imported infections.Authorities are especially wary of major outbreaks ahead of the Winter Olympics, which Beijing will host from February 4-20.The global event will coincide with the busy Lunar New Year holidays over which millions of people travel across the country.mjw/rox/qan||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-detects-more-omicron-cases-as-cities-tighten-restrictions-101641796180330.html
10-01-2022||World||Two years, 5.5 million deaths later, Beijing stonewalls on virus origins||More than two years ago, the Chinese Communist Party regime confirmed the first coronavirus case on December 8, 2019, in Wuhan. The WHO debated about the spread of virus in the following month (on January 23) whether to declare the outbreak, with 557 cases in China, as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The decision was postponed by the Emergency Committee despite the seriousness of the situation, to January 20, 2020. The WHO declared it a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 but by that time the virus has circled the earth many a times.Today, the world is facing the third or fourth wave of the virus with over 307 million cases and over 5.5 million deaths. The rapidly mutating virus has played havoc with both the world economy and society at large with many a child believing that the computer at home is actually a school and many a student haven’t seen what a college cafeteria or library looks like. Those beyond sixties are facing the worst home isolation because of which suffering from depression and general apathy. The anti-coronavirus vaccines, developed at a fantastic pace by global scientists, are now being questioned with omicron variant afflicting even those who already had the virus infection of Delta variant and were double vaccinated or even with a booster dose.While the pandemic has changed the world for all time to come, the world with all the UN, WHO and a plethora of agencies have not been able to fix accountability of China, where the origins of virus indisputably lie. The Canadian military officers who attended the Military Games in Wuhan in October 2019 have come out saying that the city was a ghost town during the games and many of the participants were afflicted with Covid-19 like symptoms like fatigue and breathlessness. According to news reports, Iranian participants even lost their lives after the infection in Wuhan games.Twenty-four months later, none of the global powers have been able to push the Chinese regime to come up the first victim of the virus on ground zero in Wuhan and the role of the Wuhan Virology Lab in spreading the deadly disease. The WHO, under China supported DG Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. like its parent UN continues to remain a talk shop with discussions in Geneva and New York but without any firm outcomes. It was as if the disease appeared from the sky and afflicted the globe without any one being responsible for it. The famed US intelligence is also far from forthcoming on the origins of the disease, clearly showing their lack of penetration in the communist regime ruling China. The Bamboo curtain clearly outstrips the Iron curtain when it comes to transparency. And it is quite evident that none of the power blocs, be it NATO or the ASEAN, are willing to question a rising military superpower in China for the fear of a nig stick retaliation. Australia under Prime Minister Scott Morrison had the temerity to stand up and ask for investigation on the origins of virus in China but the result was Beijing imposing sanctions on Canberra. Former World War II rival Japan and the EU are more worried about economy than how to stop the virus through Chinese patient zero. It clearly shows that Beijing has something to hide but even the US, the biggest military and economic power today, cannot force it to cough up the truth. The less said about the UN the better.
10-01-2022||World||Sri Lanka on the verge of bankruptcy as inflation rises to record levels: Report||Sri Lanka is facing a deepening financial and humanitarian crisis that could lead it to bankruptcy in 2022 as inflation rises to record levels, said a media report.Earlier, on August 30 last year, the Sri Lanka government announced a national financial emergency after a steep fall in the value of the country's currency which caused a spike in food prices.Writing in Colombo Gazette, Suhail Guptil said, Sri Lanka is continuously facing twin deficits, that is, fiscal deficit and trade deficit during a major part of the last decade. Since 2014, the foreign debt level of Sri Lanka has been on the rise and reached 42.6 per cent of GDP in 2019.Guptil explained that the cumulative foreign debt of the country was estimated at USD 33 billion in 2019, which puts a huge burden on the country for debt servicing.After this, several credit rating agencies including Standard and Poor's, Moody's and Fitch downgraded Sri Lanka's credit rating to B from C, which makes it difficult to obtain funds through International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs), Guptil said.The financial crisis in Sri Lanka is primarily caused by a low growth rate, currently at four per cent and huge debt service repayment obligations and the situation is worsening.As of November 2021, available foreign currency reserves were just USD 1.6 billion while in the next 12 months, the government and private sector of Sri Lanka will have to repay an estimated USD 7.3 billion in domestic and foreign loans, including a USD 500 million international sovereign bond repayment in January 2022, the report said.It further added that one of the most pressing problems for Sri Lanka is its huge foreign debt and debt service burden, in particular to China. It owes China more than USD 5 billion in debt and last year took an additional USD 1 billion loan from Beijing to wean off its acute financial crisis, which is being paid in installments.It is estimated that the foreign currency reserves of the country would completely deplete by January 2022 and it would need to borrow at least -USD 437 million for necessary payments. The major problem facing the country now is how to manage foreign debt service of USD 4.8 billion being due during February-October 2022, the report said.Inflation hit a record high of 11.1 per cent in November and escalating prices have left those who were previously well off struggling to feed their families, while basic goods are now unaffordable for many.After Rajapaksa declared Sri Lanka to be in an economic emergency, the military was given the power to ensure essential items, including rice and sugar, that was sold at set government prices - but it has done little to ease people's woes.The former central bank deputy governor, WA Wijewardena warned that the struggles of ordinary people would exacerbate the financial crisis, which would in turn make life harder for them. The World Bank estimates 500,000 people have fallen below the poverty line since the beginning of the pandemic, Guptil said.Guptil further stated that in an "attempt temporarily to ease the problems and stave off difficult and most likely unpopular policies", the government has resorted to temporary relief measures, such as credit lines to import foods, medicines and fuel from its neighbouring ally India, as well as currency swaps from India, China and Bangladesh and loans to purchase petroleum from Oman."The Sri Lankan government also plans to settle its past oil debts with Iran by paying them with tea, sending them USD 5 million worth of tea every month in order to save "much-needed currency".Moreover, Colombo has decided to close three overseas diplomatic missions from December 2021 to cut down expenditure in the face of the ongoing financial crisis and dollar crunch. However, these measures will provide only short-term relief and the loans will have to be paid back at high-interest rates, adding to Sri Lanka's debt load, Guptil added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lanka-on-the-verge-of-bankruptcy-as-inflation-rises-to-record-levels-report-101641789154026.html
10-01-2022||World||China: Xi Jinping appoints top Xinjiang police officer as Hong Kong PLA chief||A former senior paramilitary officer posted in Xinjiang has been appointed as the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) garrison chief in Hong Kong, the latest sign of Beijing taking an increasingly hardline stand on security in the financial hub.Major General Peng Jingtang was the deputy chief of staff of China’s paramilitary police force, the People’s Armed Police, national broadcaster, CCTV said in a report late on Sunday night, adding that his appointment was signed into order by Chinese President Xi Jinping.Peng was previously also chief of staff of the armed police force in Xinjiang, where western countries and international rights groups say Beijing is committing genocide against the minority Uighur community.China has denied the allegations, denouncing the charges as part of a smear campaign.Broadcaster CCTV quoted Peng as saying that he would in his new appointment work with all members of the garrison to follow the command of the ruling Communist Party and Xi, and resolutely defend national sovereignty and security interests.Hong Kong, a special administrative region, returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise that wide-ranging individual rights would be protected.Pro-democracy activists and rights groups, however, say freedoms have been eroded, in particular since China imposed a new national security law after months of at times violent protests in 2019.Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997, and a mini-constitution, called the Basic Law was created under the “one country, two systems” principle; it gave the city more freedoms than the mainland, including freedom of speech, and which are supposed to remain intact until 2047.Last March, China approved sweeping changes to Hong Kong’s electoral system, tightening Beijing’s control over the city and cutting down democratic representation in the legislature.In December, Xi told Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam that the city is developing in the right direction and heaped praise on her work, two days after an election installed Beijing’s loyalists in the financial hub’s legislature amid a low turnout.“In the past year, Hong Kong has consolidated the situation in which the city turned from chaos [during the 2019 social unrest] to peace, and has continued to develop in a positive direction,” Xi Jinping was quoted by official media as telling Carrie Lam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-xi-jinping-appoints-top-xinjiang-police-officer-as-hong-kong-pla-chief-101641794307811.html
10-01-2022||World||Myanmar's deposed leader Aung San Suu Kyi sentenced to 4 more years in prison||A Myanmar court on Monday sentenced Aung San Suu Kyi, the country's deposed leader, to four more years in prison after she was found guilty of illegally importing and possessing walkie-talkies and violating coronavirus disease (Covid-19) restrictions.In December last year, Suu Kyi was convicted on two other charges for incitement and breaching Covid-19 rules while campaigning and was awarded a sentence of four years.However, this got halved to two years and the 76-year-old Nobel Peace Prize laureate was allowed to serve her term under house arrest in the capital city of Naypyidaw.Monday's charge of possessing walkie-talkies stems from when soldiers raided Suu Kyi's residence on the day of the military coup on February 1, 2021, allegedly discovering the contraband equipment, according to news agency AFP.Right after Suu Kyi's government was ousted by the junta, Myanmar witnessed widespread protests against the military rule with security forces resorting to mass detentions and bloody crackdowns. More than 1,400 civilians have lost their lives.Suu Kyi is also on trial in nearly a dozen cases that carry combined maximum sentences of more than 100 years in prison. The ousted leader has denied all these charges.On the other hand, Suu Kyi's supporters have said that the charges are contrived to legitimise the military’s actions and prevent her return to politics.The military junta has not yet issued a statement on Suu Kyi's sentence but pointed out that she was being given due process by an independent court led by a judge appointed by her own administration.The junta has also refused to disclose the location where she will be detained. Suu Kyi's trial in Naypyitaw has been closed to journalists and lawyers are not allowed to speak to the media or public.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmars-deposed-leader-aung-san-suu-kyi-sentenced-to-4-more-years-in-prison-101641791335101.html

Our security forces have been engaging with violent mobs who were committing brazen acts of terror."Life was steadily returning to normal in Almaty Monday, AFP correspondents saw, with public transport visible on the city's roads for the first time since the violence began.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kazakhstans-largest-city-almaty-back-online-after-clashes-blackout-101641788351208.html

10-01-2022||World||‘Get out! Get out!’: Harrowing tales of escape after fire hits building in NYC||A malfunctioning space heater sparked a fire that filled a high-rise Bronx apartment building with thick smoke Sunday morning, killing 19 people including nine children in New York City’s deadliest blaze in three decades.Trapped residents broke windows for air and stuffed wet towels under doors as smoke rose from a lower-floor apartment where the fire started. Survivors told of fleeing in panic through darkened hallways, barely able to breathe.Multiple limp children were seen being given oxygen after they were carried out. Evacuees had faces covered in soot.Firefighters found victims on every floor, many of them in cardiac and respiratory arrest, said Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro. Some could not escape because of the volume of smoke, he said.Some residents said they initially ignored wailing smoke alarms because false alarms were so common in the 120-unit building, built in the early 1970s as affordable housing.More than five dozen people were hurt and 13 were hospitalized in critical condition. The fire commissioner said most of the victims had severe smoke inhalation.Firefighters continued making rescues even after their air supplies ran out, Mayor Eric Adams said.“Their oxygen tanks were empty and they still pushed through the smoke,” Adams said.Investigators said the fire triggered by the electric heater started in a duplex apartment on the second and third floors of the 19-story building.The flames didn't spread far — only charring the one unit and an adjacent hallway. But the door to the apartment and a door to a stairwell had been left open, letting smoke quickly spread throughout the building, Nigro said.New York City fire codes generally require apartment doors to be spring-loaded and slam shut automatically, but it was not immediately clear whether this building was covered by those rules.Building resident Sandra Clayton said she grabbed her dog Mocha and ran for her life when she saw the hallway filling with smoke and heard people screaming, “Get out! Get out!”Clayton, 61, said she groped her way down a darkened stairway, clutching Mocha in her arms. The smoke was so black that she couldn’t see, but she could hear neighbors wailing and crying nearby.“I just ran down the steps as much as I could but people was falling all over me, screaming,” Clayton recounted from a hospital where she was treated for smoke inhalation.In the commotion, her dog slipped from her grasp and was later found dead in the stairwell.About 200 firefighters responded to the building on East 181st Street around 11 a.m.Jose Henriquez, an immigrant from the Dominican Republic who lives on the 10th floor, said the building's fire alarms would frequently go off, but would turn out to be false.“It seems like today, they went off but the people didn’t pay attention,” Henriquez said in Spanish.He and his family stayed, wedging a wet towel beneath the door, once they realized the smoke in the halls would overpower them if they tried to flee.Luis Rosa said he also initially thought it was a false alarm. By the time he opened the door of his 13th-floor apartment, the smoke was so thick he couldn't see down the hallway. “So I said, OK, we can’t run down the stairs because if we run down the stairs, we’re going to end up suffocating.”“All we could do was wait,” he said.The children who died were 16 years old or younger, said Stefan Ringel, a senior adviser to they mayor. Adams said at a news conference that many residents were originally from the West African nation of Gambia. Many survivors were brought to temporary shelter in a nearby school.The drab, brown building looms over an intersection of smaller, aging brick buildings overlooking Webster Avenue, one of the Bronx’s main thoroughfares.By Sunday afternoon, all that remained visible of the unit where the fire started was a gaping black hole where the windows had been smashed.“There’s no guarantee that there’s a working fire alarm in every apartment, or in every common area," US Rep. Ritchie Torres, a Democrat who represents the area, told the AP. "Most of these buildings have no sprinkler system. And so the housing stock of the Bronx is much more susceptible to devastating fires than most of the housing stock in the city.”Nigro and Torres both compared the fire's severity to a 1990 blaze at the Happy Land social club where 87 people were killed when a man set fire to the building after getting into an argument with his former girlfriend and being thrown out of the Bronx club.Sunday's death toll was the highest for a fire in the city since the Happy Land fire, other than the Sept. 11 terror attacks. It was also the deadliest fire at a US residential apartment building in years. In 2017, 13 people died in an apartment building, also in the Bronx, according to data from the National Fire Protection Association.That fire started with a 3-year-old boy playing with stove burners and also spread because the door to an apartment that lacked a closing mechanism had been left open. It led to several changes in New York City, including having the fire department create a plan for educating children and parents on fire safety.Sunday’s fire happened just days after 12 people, including eight children, were killed in a house fire in Philadelphia. The deadliest fire prior to that was in 1989 when a Tennessee apartment building fire claimed the lives of 16 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/get-out-get-out-harrowing-tales-of-escape-after-fire-hits-building-in-nyc-101641786263569.html

10-01-2022||World||Myanmar's Suu Kyi to hear junta court's verdicts in delayed cases||A Myanmar junta court on Monday is expected to deliver verdicts on ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi in several delayed cases, the latest in a slew of judgements which could see her jailed for decades.The Nobel laureate has been detained since February 1 when her government was forced out in an early morning coup, ending Myanmar's short-lived experiment with democracy.The generals' power grab triggered widespread dissent, which security forces sought to quell with mass detentions and bloody crackdowns in which more than 1,400 civilians have been killed, according to a local monitoring group.Suu Kyi, 76, is facing a catalogue of accusations, and on Monday is set to hear the verdicts for allegedly importing and possessing walkies-talkies illegally, and for breaking coronavirus rules.The walkie-talkie charges stem from when soldiers raided her house on the day of the coup, allegedly discovering the contraband equipment.But under cross-examination in court hearings, members of the raiding party admitted they had not possessed a warrant for the raid, according to a source with knowledge of the matter.Verdicts for these cases have been repeatedly delayed.If found guilty on Monday, Suu Kyi faces a maximum of six years in prison.It will add to penalties the court gave her in December when she was jailed for four years for incitement and breaching Covid-19 rules while campaigning.Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing cut the sentence to two years and said she could serve her term under house arrest in the capital Naypyidaw.'Fear tactic'December's ruling drew international condemnation, and the Myanmar public reverted to old protesting tactics of banging pots and pans in a show of anger.Manny Maung, a Human Rights Watch researcher, said another conviction Monday would deepen nationwide discontent."The announcement of her last conviction resulted in one of the highest days of social media interactions from inside Myanmar, and deeply angered the public," she told AFP."The military is calculating this (the cases) as a fear tactic but it only serves to direct more anger from the public."Journalists have been barred from attending hearings, and Suu Kyi's lawyers have been muzzled from speaking to the media.Under a previous junta regime, Suu Kyi spent long spells of house arrest in her family mansion in Yangon, Myanmar's largest city.Today, she is confined to an undisclosed location in the capital, with her link to the outside world limited to brief pre-trial meetings with her lawyers.Besides Monday's cases, she is also facing multiple counts of corruption -- each of which is punishable by 15 years in jail -- and of violating the official secrets act.In November, she and 15 other officials, including Myanmar's president Win Myint, were also charged with alleged electoral fraud during the 2020 elections.Her National League for Democracy party had swept the polls in a landslide, trouncing a military-aligned party by a wider margin than the previous 2015 election.Since the coup, many of her political allies have been arrested, with one chief minister sentenced to 75 years in jail, while others are in hiding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmars-suu-kyi-to-hear-junta-court-s-verdicts-in-delayed-cases-101641781793927.html
10-01-2022||World||Ahead of talks with Russia, US rules out breakthrough, issues warning||WASHINGTON: As the United States and Russia prepare for crucial bilateral talks on Monday in Geneva, the first in a series of dialogues the two countries will have under different formats this week, Washington has reiterated its warning of “massive consequences” if Russia invades Ukraine, rejected Russian proposals about a change in the NATO’s engagement with allies and partners in eastern Europe, and lowered expectations by ruling out any breakthrough in talks. But the US has also emphasised the importance of diplomacy, opened the door for dialogue on reviving the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty that bans the deployment of medium-range nuclear missile in Europe and Russia, pointed out that Russian actions were leading to precisely the outcomes that Moscow sought to prevent, and expressed willingness to address Russia’s legitimate concerns on a reciprocal basis. On Monday, US deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman will meet her Russian counterpart, deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov, for bilateral talks under an extraordinary session of the Strategic Stability Dialogue in Geneva. On Wednesday, Brussels will host a NATO-Russia council meeting for the first time since 2019. And then, on Thursday, the 57-member Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) — of which both Russia and the US are members — will meet for a broader discussion on European security. These meetings between the US and Russia come in the wake of phone conversations between US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin in December meant to address the crisis in Ukraine. In television interviews on Sunday at home, when asked about consequences if Russia moved into Ukraine, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said, “We’ve been working in tremendous collaboration with European partners and allies and beyond to make it very clear that there will be massive consequences for Russia if it renews its aggression, by which I mean economic, financial and other consequences, as well as the NATO almost certainly having to reinforce its positions on its eastern flank near Russia, as well as continuing to provide defensive assistance to Ukraine.” While the US has ruled out any direct military involvement, Blinken said that these would include measures that had not been undertaken in the past. At the same time, Blinken kept the door open for dialogue and diplomacy. “I think there’s a way forward through dialogue, through diplomacy, to address whatever legitimate concerns Russia may have provided Russia also addresses our concerns,” he said. Also Read: Explained: How Kazakhstan protests started and the bigger pictureWhen asked to elaborate, the US secretary of state said, “Well, look, we’ve had in the past agreements that have addressed concerns on both sides, for example, the deployment of intermediate nuclear forces in Europe. There was a treaty... There may be grounds for renewing that. Similarly, there are agreements on the deployment of conventional forces in Europe on things like the scope and scale of exercises that, if adhered to reciprocally, that is, Russia makes good on its commitments which it’s repeatedly violated, then there are grounds for reducing tensions, creating greater transparency, creating greater confidence, all of which would address concerns that Russia purports to have.”Separately, on Saturday, a senior US administration official, while addressing possible overlapping areas, clarified what was not on the table, saying, “We have also seen reports of other things the US is open to discussing, like troop numbers or elements of force posture in NATO countries. I want to be clear that this is not on the table.” Observers believe that the fundamental gap between the two sides stems from Putin’s clear objective of seeking to restore a wider arc of influence over regions that were once a part of the Soviet Union — a proposition that the US and the NATO have categorically rejected.
10-01-2022||World||Covid-19: Chinese city tests 14 million people||Tianjin, a port city of 14 million near China’s capital Beijing, began mass testing on Sunday after a cluster of 20 adults and children tested positive for Covid-19 including at least two with the highly transmissible Omicron variant.Epidemiologists told state media that containing the Omicron variant in Tianjin, considered a “gateway” to Beijing will be the “first real” battle against the variant on the mainland.With less than a month left for the Winter Olympics, the discovery of a potential Omicron cluster near Beijing would have sent alarm bells ringing in the capital, some 130km away from Tianjin.The source of the cluster outbreak remains unknown and there’s a possibility of a spillover, they said.The Tianjin municipal government said the two cases were not linked with the imported Omicron case detected last December in the city. “Among the 20 infected people, 15 are children aged between 8 and 13. The cases are concentrated in Tianjin’s Jinnan and Nankai districts,” the tabloid, Global Times reported.The other infections are mainly students and their family members related to a daycare centre and a primary school. “The Tianjin outbreak poses risks to Beijing and the upcoming Winter Olympics, because of the large number of commuters working and living in the two cities,” the report said, citing an unnamed immunologist.Tianjin residents have been advised to remain home to be available for the mandatory nucleic acid testing.100k march in France against vaccine rulesA mandatory order would not be the most efficient way to encourage those not vaccinated against Covid-19 to get the shot and that plans to toughen health pass conditions were already yielding results, French government spokesman Gabriel Attal said on Sunday.People in France already have to show either proof of vaccination or a negative test to enter restaurants and bars and use inter-regional trains. But with Omicron infections surging, parliament is debating legislation that will drop the test option.More than 100,000 people across France protested on Saturday over what they say are government plans to further restrict the rights of the unvaccinated, days after French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to “piss off” those refusing the jab. Meanwhile, several thousand protesters marched in Brussels in Belgium on Sunday to oppose anti-coronavirus regulations, as European governments mull tighter rules in the face of the Omicron wave.Sigrid Kaag, who is set to become the first female finance minister of the Netherlands, said she has tested positive for the coronavirus, a day before the official swearing in ceremony on Monday.A Cypriot scientist defended his assertion that a new strain of Covid-19 exists that combines characteristics of the Delta and Omicron variants. Other scientists have speculated that Leonidos Kostrikis’ findings are a result of laboratory contamination. But he told Bloomberg in an emailed statement that the cases he has identified “indicate an evolutionary pressure to an ancestral strain to acquire these mutations and not a result of a single recombination event”.Australian state marks its highest death countAustralia’s most populous state, New South Wales, recorded its highest number of daily deaths on Saturday. The home to Sydney and a third of Australia’s 25mn people reported 16 deaths from the coronavirus in the previous day.UK minister supports reduced isolation periodReducing the self-isolation period for people who test positive from seven days to five would help British employers that have been hard hit by absences, education minister Nadhim Zahawi said on Sunday||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-chinese-city-tests-14-million-people-101641781070325.html

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director-general, said on January 7 that Omicron is hospitalising and killing people, just like previous variants.Also Read| Omicron mild or less severe? What latest observations experts have madeTwo more new variants - IHU and Deltacron - have emerged that have led to renewed concerns across the world. However, health experts have pointed out that both variants do not pose a threat at the moment.Here are the latest updates on Covid-19 from across the world:> Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said on Sunday that the country might see 2-4 million people getting infected in the ongoing Covid-19 wave as cases have nearly quadrupled over the past week compared to the previous one.> Another new variant of Covid-19 Deltacron has been detected in Cyprus. According to media reports, it has a similar genetic background to the Delta variant and some of the mutations from Omicron. However, experts have said that Deltacron is not something to be worried about at present.> In the United Kingdom, education minister Nadhim Zahawi has said that reducing the isolation period to five days from seven would be “helpful” for managing rising staff absences in schools and businesses. He is the first minister to request a cut in the isolation period.Also Read| Cyprus finds Covid-19 infections that combine Delta and Omicron> Scores of people in Belgium’s capital city Brussels protested against Covid-19 rules on Sunday. According to the police, as many as 5,000 protesters chanted “freedom, freedom!” and brandished banners denouncing what they called a “vaccine dictatorship”. No major incident of violence was reported but the police arrested over 40 protesters for carrying fireworks and projectiles.> Another European country, the Czech Republic, saw widespread protests against mandatory vaccination for citizens above 60 and over age group along with people employed in police, firefighting and medical services. In Prague, protesters questioned the effectiveness of current vaccines and rejected the administration of doses to children.> The Covid-19 task force in Nepal has announced a set of rules such as restrictions on gatherings, shutting down schools and making vaccination cards compulsory at public places to prevent the surge in cases.> The total number of Covid-19 cases in Africa have topped 10 million including 231,157 deaths, according to data released by the Africa Centres for Disease Control on Sunday. Daily cases have been surging in the continent due to Omicron and the overall vaccination rate is low due to poor access to doses and hesitancy among people to take the jab.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protests-against-curbs-new-variant-detected-latest-on-covid-across-the-world-101641775526064.html

A full day of talks was to follow Monday."I think that tomorrow we won't waste any time," Ryabkov said, adding that he "never loses optimism."The United States and Russia had set firm lines ahead of the high-stakes security talks on Ukraine, with Washington warning of the risk of confrontation and Moscow ruling out concessions.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Russia to steer away from aggression and choose the diplomatic path as the Kremlin, facing strong pressure to pull back troops from the Ukrainian border, demands wide-ranging new security arrangements with the West.For her part, during her initial talks with Ryabkov Sherman "stressed the United States' commitment to the international principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the freedom of sovereign nations to choose their own alliances," the State Department said in a statement.Ahead of the talks, Ryabkov told Russian news agencies that Moscow was "disappointed" with signals coming from Washington and from Brussels, where NATO and the European Union are based.The talks with the United States kick off a week of diplomacy during which Russian officials will meet representatives of NATO and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), as Washington tries to assure European allies they will not be sidelined."There's a path of dialogue and diplomacy to try to resolve some of these differences," Blinken told US news channel CNN on Sunday."The other path is confrontation and massive consequences for Russia if it renews its aggression on Ukraine. We are about to test the proposition about which path President (Vladimir) Putin is prepared to take."'Gun to Ukraine's head'Since late last year, Putin has amassed tens of thousands of troops at the Ukrainian border and demanded guarantees that NATO will not expand further eastward.The Kremlin is insisting NATO must never grant membership to ex-Soviet Ukraine, which is pushing to join.The United States says many of Moscow's proposals are non-starters.Blinken warned that any positive outcome from the talks would rely in part on Russia's willingness to stand down from its aggressive posture, which he likened to "an atmosphere of escalation with a gun to Ukraine's head"."If we're actually going to make progress, we're going to have to see de-escalation," US President Joe Biden's top diplomat said.Russia could otherwise face severe economic and financial consequences, "as well as NATO almost certainly having to reinforce its position near Russia as well as continuing to provide assistance to Ukraine", he told ABC television on Sunday.Putin met Biden in Geneva in June and agreed on regular "stability" talks between Sherman and Ryabkov. Previous rounds were held in the Swiss city in July and September.'Massive' retaliationIn two phone calls to Putin, Biden has warned of severe consequences if Russia invades Ukraine.Measures under consideration include sanctions on Putin's inner circle, cancelling Russia's controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany or, in the most drastic scenario, severing Russia's links to the world's banking system.Russia insists it was deceived after the Cold War and understood that NATO would not expand eastward.Instead, the US-led alliance welcomed most of the former Warsaw Pact countries and the three Baltic nations that were under Soviet rule.On Sunday in an interview for Russian news agency TASS in Geneva, Ryabkov accused NATO of trying for decades to "push back" Russia."So NATO should pack up and return to the borders of 1997," Ryabkov said.Russia has put intense pressure on Ukraine since 2014 after a revolution overthrew a government that had sided with the Kremlin against moving closer to Europe.Russia seized the Crimean peninsula and backs an insurgency in eastern Ukraine in which more than 13,000 people have died."It is very likely that we will encounter the reticence of our US and NATO colleagues to really perceive what we need," Ryabkov said Sunday.In spite "of the threats that are constantly formulated against us... we will make no concession," he said, adding it would "amount to acting against the interests of our security".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-russia-kick-off-difficult-talks-on-ukraine-101641772401941.html
10-01-2022||World||19 dead, including at least 9 children, after fire breaks out in NYC apartment||At least 19 people died and dozens were injured when a fire tore through a high-rise apartment building in New York City on Sunday, its mayor said, in one of America's worst residential fires in recent memory.Both the New York Times and CNN sourced unnamed officials as saying that nine children were among the dead."We know that we have 19 people who are confirmed dead, as well as several others in critical condition," Mayor Eric Adams told CNN, adding that 63 people had been wounded."This is going to be one of the worst fires in our history," he said.At least 200 firefighters responded to the blaze, which broke out mid-morning on the second and third floors of a 19-story building on East 181st Street, several blocks west of the Bronx Zoo.Neighbors spoke of seeing residents desperately waving from floors, apparently trapped and unable to escape."It was chaos," George King, who lives directly adjacent the building told AFP."I've been here 15 years and it's the first time I've seen something like this."I saw the smoke, a lot of people were panicking. You could see that no one wanted to jump from the building. People were waving from the windows," he added.The cause of the fire was not immediately clear.The injured were taken to five hospitals; many suffered from cardiac and respiratory arrest, the New York Times reported.The blaze comes just four days after a fire in Philadelphia killed 12 people, including eight children, in a three-story public housing building.In New York, there were fears of a growing toll."The last time we had a loss of life that may be this horrific was a fire which was over 30 years ago, also here in the Bronx," said Fire Marshal Dan Nigro, quoted by NBC News.Flames quickly engulfed much of the structure, and Nigro said the smoke was so dense as to be "unprecedented."Photographs and video posted on social media showed flames and thick black smoke billowing out of a third-story window of the brick building as firefighters operated on a nearby ladder."This is truly a tragedy," said Adams, adding that many residents had been displaced."This is really a horrific day for us," he said.In December 2017, 13 people were killed in a blaze in an apartment building in the Bronx in New York City's deadliest fire in 25 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/19-dead-including-at-least-9-children-after-fire-breaks-out-in-nyc-apartment-101641762915182.html
