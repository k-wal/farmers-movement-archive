Sharing five lessons from his fight against Omicron, Dr Younus informed that he had developed symptoms two weeks ago.Recounting how he got exposed to the virus, the health expert said he has been around Covid patients over 1,000 times in the last two years but did not get infected due to masks and PPE. He said he got exposed for two days at a maskless family gathering. Personal News: Omicron got me:)Two weeks ago I developed symptoms and tested +veSharing five lessons I learned from that experience and hoping you’ll find them helpfulThanking vaccines, Dr Younus said it is because of the vaccines that he is back to tell his story on Twitter within five days. He said he is also back to work, with a mask."I didn’t need monoclonal antibodies, steroids, antibiotics or paxlovid etc. Symptomatic therapy (that I’ve shared many times before) was enough. Definitely didn’t use ivermectin, HCQ, zinc," he added.Herd immunity is good, but herd mentality is bad, Dr Younus tweeted. "Covid or no Covid, think of your own mortality, often. It puts everything in perspective and allows us to make brave, meaningful decisions," he added.If despite wearing an N95 mask, Covid infects a person, he or she is likely to recover fully if vaccinated. "That family gathering was important for me. But your risk tolerance could be different," he said.Dr Faheem has been sharing Covid-related tips since the beginning of the pandemic. In the latest updates, the doctor said that Omicron cases are doubling in every two days compared to every two weeks for Delta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-us-health-expert-gets-infected-by-omicron-shares-5-lessons-from-experience-101642266649700.html
15-01-2022||World||What's next after Omicron? Maybe more worrisome Frankenvariants, say experts||Omicron which was earlier thought to be less severe and the probable end of the two-year-old pandemic may actually be a precursor to more worrisome variants, scientists now think. Leonardo Martinez, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Boston University, said, the faster the Omicron spreads, which is happening across the world, the more opportunities it gets for further mutations, leading to more variants. There is no way to confirm or predict the arrival of the next variant, but there is no guarantee either that the future variants will cause milder illness."The faster omicron spreads, the more opportunities there are for mutation, potentially leading to more variants,” Leonardo told AP.“People have wondered whether the virus will evolve to mildness. But there's no particular reason for it to do so. I don't think we can be confident that the virus will become less lethal over time," said Dr Stuart Campbell Ray, an infectious disease expert at Johns Hopkins University.UK's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies has predicted there will be a fresh wave of Omicron cases in the early summer as people resume social activities and the immunity achieved in the ongoing surge reduces, The Guardian reported.Here is what may happen after Omicron, according to experts1. Omicron is likely to lead to reinfections, experts think. People infected with Delta or other previous variants or even Omicron may get reinfected.2. It's a possibility that the virus becomes milder like a common cold but viruses don't always get less deadly over time. Omicron's initial behaviour has kindled the hope.3. Replicating is the main goal of a variant which is easily possible when the infected people develop mild symptoms and spread the virus to others without understanding.4. There are many possible avenues for evolution, the AP report said. Animals could potentially incubate and unleash new variants.5. Another possible avenue for Omicron is to create Frankenvariants with Delta, hybrids with characteristics of both Omicron and Delta.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/whats-next-after-omicron-maybe-more-worrisome-frankenvariants-say-experts-101642258811307.html
15-01-2022||World||Beijing reports first locally-transmitted Omicron case ahead of Winter Olympics||The Chinese capital Beijing on Saturday reported its first locally transmitted infection of the highly transmissible Omicron coronavirus variant, according to state media, just weeks ahead of its staging of the Olympic Winter Games.State television reported on Saturday that the new infection had been identified as the Omicron strain.Lab testing found "mutations specific to the Omicron variant" in the person, Pang Xinghuo, an official at the city's disease control authority, told a news briefing.Officials have sealed up the infected person's residential compound and workplace, and collected 2,430 samples for testing from people linked to the two locations, a Haidian district official said.The detection of the Omicron variant Beijing came as cities across the country ratchet up viral vigilance ahead of the Winter Olympics, due to start Feb. 4.Authorities have also warned that Omicron adds to the increased risk of COVID-19 transmission as more people travel across the country and return to China from overseas for the Lunar New Year holiday starting at the end of the month.Many local governments have advised residents not to leave town unnecessarily during the holiday, while dozens of international and domestic flights have been suspended.Aside from Beijing, China has reported locally transmitted infections of the Omicron variant in at least four other provinces and municipalities -- in the northern city of Tianjin, the central province of Henan, the southern province of Guangdong and the northeastern province of Liaoning. However, the total number Omicron cases remains unclear.He Qinghua, an official at the National Health Commission (NHC), said in a briefing earlier on Saturday that the Omicron variant was also detected in Shanghai, without specifying the case count. He did not say whether the variant had been found locally or among travellers from overseas.He said 14 provincial areas in China had found the Omicron variant in infected individuals arriving from overseas, without naming the regions.In a statement on Saturday, the NHC reported 165 new confirmed coronavirus cases for Jan. 14, down from 201 a day earlier.Of the new infections, 104 were locally transmitted, according to a statement by the National Health Commission, compared with 143 a day earlier.The new locally transmitted cases were in Henan, Tianjin, Guangdong, Shaanxi and Zhejiang.China also reported 25 new asymptomatic cases for Jan. 14, down from 42 infections a day earlier. China classifies asymptomatic cases separately from confirmed cases.There were no new deaths, leaving the death toll at 4,636.As of Jan. 14, mainland China had 104,745 confirmed cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-reports-first-locally-transmitted-omicron-case-ahead-of-winter-olympics-101642255944759.html
15-01-2022||World||Study finds one in 10 people might still be infectious for Covid after 10 days||A new study has found that one in 10 people might have clinically relevant levels of potentially infectious SARS-CoV-2 past the 10 day quarantine period.The study has been published in the 'International Journal of Infectious Diseases.The study, led by the University of Exeter and funded by Animal Free Research UK, used a newly adapted test that can detect whether the virus was potentially still active. It was applied to samples from 176 people in Exeter who had tested positive on standard PCR tests.The study found that 13 per cent of people still exhibited clinically-relevant levels of virus after 10 days, meaning they could potentially still be infectious. Some people retained these levels for up to 68 days. The authors believe this new test should be applied in settings where people are vulnerable, to stop the spread of Covid-19.Professor Lorna Harries, of the University of Exeter Medical School, oversaw the study. She said, "While this is a relatively small study, our results suggest that potentially active virus may sometimes persist beyond a 10 day period, and could pose a potential risk of onward transmission. Furthermore, there was nothing clinically remarkable about these people, which means we wouldn't be able to predict who they are".Conventional PCR tests work by testing for the presence of viral fragments. While they can tell if someone has recently had the virus, they cannot detect whether it is still active, and the person is infectious. The test used in the latest study however gives a positive result only when the virus is active and potentially capable of onward transmission.Lead author Merlin Davies, of the University of Exeter Medical School, said, "In some settings, such as people returning to care homes after illness, people continuing to be infectious after ten days could pose a serious public health risk. We may need to ensure people in those setting have a negative active virus test to ensure people are no longer infectious. We now want to conduct larger trials to investigate this further."Animal Free Research UK CEO, Carla Owen, said, "The University of Exeter team's discovery is exciting and potentially very important. Once more, it shows how focusing exclusively on human biology during medical research can produce results that are more reliable and more likely to benefit humans and animals.""Pioneering Animal Free work is providing the best chance of not only defeating Covid 19 but also finding better treatments for all human diseases. The results also send a loud and clear message to the Government to better fund modern medical research and make the UK a world leader in cutting edge, kinder science," Owen added.The research is a collaboration between the University of Exeter Medical School, the Royal Devon & Exeter NHS Foundation Trust, and the NIHR Exeter Clinical Research Facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/study-finds-one-in-10-people-might-still-be-infectious-for-covid-after-10-days-101642249951897.html

Dharmalingam's appeal against his execution will be heard by a five-judge panel of the Singapore's Supreme Court on January 24, according to a media report.Nagaenthran, 33, of Indian-origin and Malaysian citizenship, is appealing against a High Court decision denying him permission to start judicial review proceedings to challenge the death sentence.The appeal is set to be heard by a panel comprising Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon and Justices Andrew Phang, Judith Prakash, Belinda Ang and Chao Hick Tin, The Straits Times reported on Friday.Represented by lawyer M. Ravi, Nagaenthran has pleaded to not have the mental fitness to be considered as a regular drug trafficker. He has even asked the court to have him assessed by a panel of psychiatrists.Nagaenthran was arrested in 2009 with a stash of heroin strapped to his thigh. He was convicted of trafficking 42.72g of heroin in 2010 and sentenced to the death penalty, which was then mandatory.His appeals against his conviction and sentence were dismissed in 2011, the newspaper said.In 2015, he applied to be re-sentenced to life imprisonment after the law was changed to allow the alternative sentence. However, the high court upheld his death sentence in 2017 after considering the opinions of four psychological experts.Last year, Nagaenthran made an 11th-hour attempt to challenge his impending execution on November 10 - again pleading mental disabilities. However, on the day of his appeal on November 9, Nagaenthran tested positive for Covid-19. The three-judge panel then granted a stay on his execution.In this interim period, the hearing got further delayed after his lawyer, Ravi - also of Indian origin - was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The Law Society of Singapore (LawSoc) forced Ravi to go on leave from December 2 to January 13. Ravi has returned to practise now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianorigin-man-s-death-sentence-appeal-to-be-heard-on-jan-24-in-singapore-101642245622549.html
15-01-2022||World||Can you get Omicron twice? Possible, say epidemiologists||Omicron, the latest and the fastest-spreading variant of SARS-CoV-2, can infect the same person twice and it may not be very rare, experts said as the world is grappling with a fresh wave of the two-year-old pandemic, presently being driven by the Omicron. US epidemiologist Eric Feigl-Ding said Omicron reinfection is certainly possible if the first Omicron infection was of a 'low-dose' that did not stimulate the immune system enough. Another condition for Omicron reinfection could be heavily compromised immunity."There are lots of recent anecdotes about new Omicron reinfections after a recent Omicron infection. It’s certainly possible if your first Omicron infection was a low-dose one that didn’t stimulate your immune system enough or if you’re immunocompromised. Be careful folks," the epidemiologist tweeted.In new Covid guidelines, CDC says N95s offer ‘highest protection’, cloth masks ‘least’There are lots of recent anecdotes about new #Omicron reinfections after a recent Omicron infection. It’s certainly possible if your first Omicron infection was a low-dose one that didn’t stimulate your immune system enough or if you’re immunocompromised. Be careful folks. 🙏 https://t.co/k0lcBibyl7The world is familiar with Covid reinfection as in the subsequent waves of the pandemic it was found that people who have got infected once also stand at the risk of reinfection. It is also not new that people vaccinated against Covid are also contracting the infection again as the vaccines are not disease-preventing, but offer protection from severity and mortality. Reinfection by Omicron is a relatively new idea as Omicron is the variant active in the present wave. If people are getting reinfected by Omicron, it means they are getting the infection in a very short span of time. Natural immunity that the body develops after one infection should last at least seven to nine months. But Omicron reinfection indicates getting infected twice in a quick interval.People who have been earlier infected with earlier variants of Covid can certainly get Omicron. People can even get infected by Omicron twice. “Omicron is highly contagious and it would appear to not induce fantastic protective immunity,” Stanley Weiss, M.D., professor at the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School and the Department of Epidemiology at the Rutgers School of Public Health, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-you-get-omicron-twice-possible-say-epidemiologists-101642243745529.html

In his message, read out by Liberal Party MP Chandra Arya, Trudeau said, “The Hindu community has made important contributions to the Canadian business landscape and I’m sure the Chamber of Commerce will become an indispensable forum for representation, development and improvement.”The directors of the new Chamber belong to various parts of Canada and have roots in several states of India, as well as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka. It will also represent businesses of community members who have immigrated from the Caribbean, Nepal, Pakistan, SouthEast Asia and elsewhere.The organisers’ objective behind formation of the Chamber is to provide “unified and effective representation” to Hindu businesspersons.Also extending their congratulations via video messages on the creation of CHCC were Leader of the Opposition and Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole and the Premier of the province of Ontario Doug Ford.Trudeau also congratulated the organisers for the commitment in putting together CHCC despite the last two years being “exceptionally challenging” due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The Board of Directors of CHCC is led by its president Toronto-based Naresh Chavda.The inaugural event was virtual due to the constraints imposed by the latest wave of the coronavirus crisis. Those in attendance included representatives from three levels of government in the country, including MPs Arya and Melissa Lantsman, Ontario’s Associate Minister of Small Business and Red Tape Reduction Nina Tangri, and Mississauga councillor and former provincial Cabinet Minister Dipika Damerla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/entrepreneurs-set-up-canadian-hindu-chamber-of-commerce-101642236673053.html
15-01-2022||World||Covid-19: Omicron driving high case load in Canada||While the fifth wave of Covid-19 pandemic in Canada, driven by the Omicron variant, is leading to historic high numbers of daily infections as well as positivity rate, health authorities are hopeful the peak could arrive soon leading to a rapid decline in infections.In a statement released on Friday, Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam put the positivity rate at 28% of samples tested by laboratories, far exceeding previous counts.New modelling released by the Public Health Agency of Canada forecast daily case load reaching 150,000 but Tam said that the peak could be reached within days.However, while risk of hospitalisation from Omicron infections remains lower when compared to Delta, the sheer volume of cases being reported could result in new daily hospital admissions that “could still exceed previous historical peaks”.During the latest 7-day period, January 6 to 12, an average of 37,530 new cases were reported daily across Canada. Tam said that while this was a 10% decrease compared to the week prior, “this could in part be attributed to changes in testing policies across Canada that can underestimate the true number of infections”.An average of 6,779 people with Covid-19 were being treated in Canadian hospitals each day during that period, 84% higher than last week and higher than all previous peaks, she added. This included, on average, 884 people who were being treated in intensive care units (ICUs), which was 50% higher than the previous week. “Omicron disease activity has now eclipsed all previous waves of the pandemic and is trending far above daily counts for severe outcomes, nationally,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-omicron-driving-high-case-load-in-canada-101642229832877.html

Until now, the CDC had not explicitly addressed any difference between a regular cloth mask and protective N95 respirators.However, with more contagious strains like Omicron continuing to soar, experts have now urged the CDC to recommend N95 masks for all citizens.What is the new recommendation by the CDC?According to a report by The New York Times, in its previous version of the recommendations, the CDC had said individuals may choose to use a disposable N95 respirator instead of a mask “when supplies are available”.The agency has now recommended all Americans to “wear the most protective mask you can that fits well and that you will wear consistently”.Covid-19 has been spreading like a wildfire across the US and world, especially with the surge of Omicron, which targets the upper airways and has spread at least twice as quickly as Delta.“Our main message continues to be that any mask is better than no mask,” said Kristen Nordlund, a CDC spokeswoman, in a statement.However, the CDC has relaxed Covid-19 guidelines and reduced the isolation period for those infected to five days, provided their symptoms stop and if they wear masks in public for another five days.Masks are still recommended by the agency for people aged two years and older, regardless of vaccination status and indoor public spaces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-new-covid-guidelines-cdc-says-n95s-offer-highest-protection-cloth-masks-least-101642209672842.html

Reuters' phone calls to the business were not answered on Friday.Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson offered condolences to the family of the deceased and support for those awaiting word on the missing. "No words can take away the stress and devastation as these people await news about their relatives and friends," he wrote on Twitter.The city's police and fire departments were investigating the incident, along with the labor ministry, according to a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explosion-in-commercial-building-in-ottawa-6-feared-dead-101642205236004.html

But organized cybercriminals, many of them living in Russia, have gone after institutions aggressively in the past two years with ransomware, freezing data and computerized equipment needed to care for hospital patients.In some cases, those extortion attacks have led to patient deaths, according to litigation, media reports and medical professionals.Friday's attack on Ukrainian websites included a warning to "be afraid and expect the worst", at a time when Russia has amassed about 100,000 troops near Ukraine, raising fears in the West that it is considering an invasion. Moscow denies it wants to invade.Russia has repeatedly rejected hacking allegations leveled by Ukraine and other countries over the years. While a suspect in the new web defacements, Russia has not been directly accused by Ukraine.In 2014 Russian troops went into the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and annexed it from Ukraine. If Russia invades again, more cyberattacks would occur too, predicted former CrowdStrike cybersecurity executive Dmitri Alperovitch.They would most likely be disruptive, not fatal, Alperovitch said. "It will be a sideshow. The main show will be on the ground."US concerned Russia prepping for invasionUkraine has already borne the brunt of some of the largest hacks on infrastructure to date.In December 2015, a first-of-its-kind cyber attack cut the lights to 225,000 people in western Ukraine, with hackers also sabotaging power distribution equipment, complicating attempts to restore power.The average temperature during the winter in Ukraine is bellow freezing and losing heat is potentially lethal. Outages in the 2015 attack reportedly lasted six hours in some towns.In the last two months of 2016, hackers targeted Ukrainian state institutions about 6,500 times, officials said. The cyberattacks showed Russian security services were waging a cyberwar against Ukraine, the government said.An attack on the State Treasury halted its systems for several days, meaning state workers and pensioners had been unable to receive their salaries or payments on time.The attacks against Ukraine’s power grid are considered by experts as the first examples of hackers shutting off critical energy systems supplying heat and light to millions of homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-lights-no-heat-no-money-that-s-life-in-ukraine-during-cyber-warfare-101642204100619.html
15-01-2022||World||CDC encourages more Americans to consider N95 masks||US health officials on Friday encouraged more Americans to wear the kind of N95 or KN95 masks used by health-care workers to slow the spread of the coronavirus.Those kinds of masks are considered better at filtering the air. But they were in short supply previously, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials had said they should be prioritized for health care workers.In updated guidance posted late Friday afternoon, CDC officials removed concerns related to supply shortages and more clearly said that properly fitted N95 and KN95 masks offer the most protection.However, agency officials noted some masks are harder to tolerate than others, and urged people to choose good-fitting masks that they will wear consistently.“Our main message continues to be that any mask is better than no mask,” Kristen Nordlund, a CDC spokeswoman, said in a statement.The CDC has evolved its mask guidance throughout the pandemic.In its last update, in September, CDC officials became more encouraging of disposable N95 masks, saying they could be used in certain situations if supplies were available. Examples included being near a lot of people for extended periods of time on a train, bus or airplane; taking care of someone in poor health; or being more susceptible to severe illness.On Thursday, President Joe Biden announced that his administration was planning to make “high-quality masks,” including N95s, available for free. He said more details were coming next week. The federal government has a stockpile of more than 750 million N95 masks, the White House said.The latest CDC guidance notes that there is a special category of “surgical N95" masks, that are specially designed for protection against blood splashes and other operating room hazards. Those are not generally available for sale to the public, and should continue to be reserved for health care workers, the agency said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cdc-encourages-more-americans-to-consider-n95-masks-101642201387028.html
15-01-2022||World||As Omicron fuels surge, US students stage walkouts to protest in-person classes||Hundreds of students in Boston and Chicago walked out of classes on Friday to pressure officials to switch to remote learning, as a surge in Covid-19 cases fueled by the Omicron variant disrupts schools around the United States.About 600 students from 11 Boston schools participated, according to the school district. Many students returned to classrooms later, while others went home after taking part in peaceful demonstrations.An online petition started by a Boston high school senior saying schools are a "Covid-19 breeding ground" and calling for a remote option had gathered more than 8,000 signatures as of Friday morning.The Boston Student Advisory Council, which called for the walkout, posted a series of demands on Twitter, including two weeks of remote learning and improved Covid-19 testing for teachers and students.The latest wave of infections has renewed the debate over whether to keep schools open, as officials seek to balance fears about the highly contagious Omicron variant with concerns that kids could fall even further behind after two years of stop-and-start instruction. The result has been a patchwork of Covid-19 policies around the country that has left parents feeling exhausted and bewildered.Ash O'Brien, a 10th-grade student at Boston Latin School who left the building with about a dozen others on Friday, said he didn't feel safe staying in school."I live with two grandparents who are immune-compromised," he said. "So I don't want to go to school, risk getting sick and come home to them."In a statement, Boston Public Schools said it supports students advocating for their beliefs and vowed to listen to their concerns.In Chicago, a student group, Chicago Public School's radical Youth Alliance, organized a walkout at various city schools on Friday afternoon, followed by a rally outside the district's headquarters.Students had just returned to Chicago schools on Wednesday after a week of canceled classes due to a standoff between teachers and the school district over Covid protocols. The teachers union agreed to return to in-person instruction after striking a deal to strengthen safeguards.Earlier this week, students at several New York City schools staged a walkout to protest what they say are inadequate safety measures. Mayor Eric Adams said on Thursday his administration was considering a temporary remote learning option for the significant number of students who are staying home.Nearly 5,000 public schools across the country have closed for at least one day this week due to the pandemic, according to Burbio, a website that tracks school disruptions.The Omicron surge appears to be slowing in areas of the country that were hit first In the last week, new cases have risen only 5% in Northeastern and Southern states compared with the prior seven-day period, according to a Reuters analysis.

Opponents say he is unfit to rule and has misled parliament by denying Covid-19 guidance was breached.In an extraordinary twist to a saga that has been widely lampooned by comedians and cartoonists, the Daily Telegraph said drinks parties were held inside Downing Street on April 16, 2021, the day before Prince Philip's funeral."It is deeply regrettable this took place at a time of national mourning and No. 10 (Downing Street) has apologised to the Palace," Johnson's spokesman told reporters.Johnson was at his Chequers country residence that day and was not invited to any gathering, his spokesman said.Such was the revelry in Downing Street, the Telegraph said, that staff went to a nearby supermarket to buy a suitcase of alcohol, spilled wine on carpets, and broke a swing used by the prime minister's son.The next day, Queen Elizabeth bade farewell to Philip, her husband of 73 years, following his death aged 99.Dressed in black and in a white trimmed black face mask, the 95-year-old Elizabeth cut a poignant figure as she sat alone, in strict compliance with coronavirus rules, during his funeral service at Windsor Castle.'LEAVE THE STAGE'Opponents have called for Johnson, 57, to resign, casting him as a charlatan who demanded the British people follow some of the most onerous rules in peacetime history while his staff partied at the heart of government.A small but growing number in Johnson's Conservative Party have echoed those calls, fearing it will do lasting damage to its electoral prospects."Sadly, the Prime Minister's position has become untenable," said Conservative lawmaker Andrew Bridgen, a former Johnson supporter. "The time is right to leave the stage."In the latest report of rule-breaking, the Mirror newspaper said staff had bought a large wine fridge for Friday gatherings, events that were regularly observed by Johnson as he walked to his apartment in the building."If the PM tells you to 'let off steam', he's basically saying this is fine," it quoted one source as saying.Separately, the former head of the government unit behind COVID restrictions, Kate Josephs, apologised for holding her own drinks gathering when she left the job in December 2020.Johnson has given a variety of explanations of the parties, ranging from denials that any rules were broken to expressing understanding for the public anger at apparent hypocrisy at the heart of the British state.The Independent newspaper said Johnson had dubbed a plan to salvage his premiership as "Operation Save Big Dog".Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, seen as a possible successor, said "real mistakes" had been made."We need to look at the overall position we're in as a country, the fact that he (Johnson) has delivered Brexit, that we are recovering from COVID... He has apologised.""I think we now need to move on."To trigger a leadership challenge, 54 of the 360 Conservative members of parliament must write letters of no confidence to the chairman of the party's 1922 Committee.The Telegraph said as many as 30 such letters had been submitted.Johnson faces a tough year ahead: beyond Covid-19, inflation is soaring, energy bills are spiking, taxation will rise in April and his party faces local elections in May.British police said on Thursday they would not investigate gatherings held in Johnson's residence during a coronavirus lockdown unless an internal government inquiry finds evidence of potential criminal offences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deeply-regrettable-johnson-s-office-apologises-to-queen-for-party-on-eve-of-philip-s-funeral-101642200526475.html

15-01-2022||World||Omicron cases receding in New York, major cities: Data||The US’ Omicron wave is beginning to recede in New York and other major cities, official data showed this week, even as Covid-19 hospitalisations, a lagging indicator, reached new highs. The trend of explosive rises in Omicron cases followed by equally fast declines follows similar patterns seen in Britain and in South Africa, where the variant was first reported in late November.In New York city, the seven-day average of new daily cases has been falling since around January 2, when they peaked at 40,000 a day - an all-time record.The figure stood at around 28,500 on January 10, still higher than anything seen in previous waves caused by other strains, an official tracker showed on Friday. Similar drops were visible in New York state, New Jersey and Chicago, the country’s third-largest city, as well as in the capital Washington.But the nationwide average is still rising, with more than 750,000 cases per day, as infections continue to shoot up in most states.Even as US President Joe Biden termed the current surge as a “pandemic of the unvaccinated”, drawing a distinction between how it has affected those who have taken the jab and those who haven’t, the Supreme Court blocked the administration from enforcing a vaccine-or-testing mandate for large employers in the country.The court’s six conservative judges outnumbered the three liberal justices — and ruled against federal vaccine mandates, on the grounds that the federal executive branch did not have the authority to impose such a sweeping requirement.India flight ban extendedHong Kong extended social distancing measures and the city’s flight ban on eight countries to stem an outbreak of the infectious Omicron variant.The Asian financial hub will extend its passenger flight ban on Australia, Canada, France, India, Pakistan, the Philippines, the UK and the US, until February 4, Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam said on Friday .China further tightened its anti-pandemic measures in Beijing and across the country on Friday as scattered outbreaks continue. The city of Tianjin, about an hour from the capital, has ordered a third round of mass testing starting Saturday morning.With inputs from Prashant Jha||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-cases-receding-in-new-york-major-cities-data-101642193418695.html
15-01-2022||World||North Korea fires ballistic missiles in 3rd test of the year||North Korea fired two ballistic missiles Friday, the South and Japan said, in what would be its third weapons test this month, despite a fresh volley of US sanctions.The latest launches came just hours after Pyongyang warned of a “stronger and certain” reaction to the sanctions on five North Koreans linked to the country’s ballistic missile programme. Seoul’s joint chiefs of staff said it had detected two short-range ballistic missiles fired from North Pyongan province, adding they were “analysing the specifications”.The weapons likely “fell outside” Japan’s territorial waters, Tokyo’s defence minister Nobuo Kishi told reporters, adding that the repeated tests indicated Pyongyang was “aiming to improve its launch technology”.The Friday missiles came hours after Pyongyang accused the US of “provocation” over fresh sanctions imposed this week in response to a recent string of weapons tests.The launches were at 2.41pm and 2.52pm, with the weapons flying a distance of 430km at an altitude of 36km, according to Seoul’s joint chiefs of staff.Seoul’s National Security Council expressed “strong regret” over the recent missile launches, saying they “do not contribute to stability on the Korean Peninsula at this important juncture.”Pyongyang debuted a hypersonic missile in September last year, and carried out what it called two successful tests this month, as it looks to add the weapon to its arsenal.In response, the US imposed new sanctions on Pyongyang this week. On Friday, the US condemned North Korea’s latest ballistic missile launch.“We remain committed to a diplomatic approach to the DPRK and call on them to engage in dialogue. Our commitment to the defence of the Republic of Korea and Japan remains ironclad”, a state department spokesperson said in an emailed statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-fires-ballistic-missiles-in-3rd-test-of-the-year-101642192849270.html
15-01-2022||World||China dismisses spy claims||China on Friday dismissed a rare public warning by British security services that a suspected Chinese agent was trying to influence lawmakers, saying it was the result of watching “too many 007 movies”.British authorities said on Thursday that a London-based solicitor “knowingly engaged in political interference activities” inside parliament, citing Britain’s counter-intelligence and domestic spy agency MI5.Christine Lee had reportedly worked on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party to gain influence through donations, the office of House of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle said.China’s foreign ministry denied engaging in “interference activities”, blasting the accusations as “alarmist remarks based on some individuals’ subjective assumptions”.“Perhaps some individuals have watched too many 007 movies, leading to unnecessary mental associations,” foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a regular press conference, referring to the James Bond book and movie franchise.MI5’s security notice said Lee was acting “on behalf of the United Front Work Department of the Chinese Communist Party” and answered to figures in China and Hong Kong.‘Patriotism’: HK police switch to goose-steppingHong Kong’s police force will switch from colonial-era British marching drills to the goose-stepping style seen on the Chinese mainland, the city’s force said on Friday, citing the need to show officers’ “patriotism”.The stiff-legged marching technique was first publicly demonstrated by Hong Kong officers on April 15 during National Security Education Day - designated to mark a Beijing-imposed law that has empowered a crackdown on dissent.The force has “actively planned for the full roll-out of Chinese-style foot drills in order to show patriotism and foster love for our motherland and Hong Kong”, police said.Staff from China’s People’s Liberation Army barracks in Hong Kong have been teaching the city’s police officers the technique since February 2021.Taiwan adds mine-laying to defences against ChinaTaiwan on Friday commissioned new navy minelayers to add to its defences against China.President Tsai Ing-wen presided over a commissioning ceremony for the navy’s First and Second Mining Operations Squadrons, which will operate ships able to automatically sow large numbers of small but powerful mines at high speed without the need for divers.Such technologies are part of a strategy to deter any possible invasion from China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-dismisses-spy-claims-101642192968545.html
15-01-2022||World||US concerned Russia prepping for invasion||The Biden administration believes Russian actors are preparing potential sabotage operations against Russian forces and fabricating Ukrainian provocations in social media to justify an intervention and sow divisions in Ukraine, according to a US official who asked not to be identified.President Vladimir Putin’s government is laying the groundwork to justify an attack, including through sabotage activities and information operations, by accusing Ukraine of preparing offensive operations, according to the person.As part of the plan, Moscow has prepositioned operatives trained in urban warfare and in using explosives possibly to carry out acts of sabotage against Russia’s proxy forces in or near Ukraine, the person said, adding that the plan would likely be set in motion if diplomacy with the US, Nato and key European nations fail.The news follows a cyber attack that downed a wide range of Ukrainian government websites on Friday. In previous incursions in Ukraine’s Crimea region and in Georgia, Russia was accused of ramping up disinformation campaigns and staging “false flag” events to justify its interventions.President Joe Biden has been briefed on Friday’s attack but the US doesn’t yet have attribution for who was behind it, according to a spokesperson for the National Security Council. Russia has rejected those charges, and says it has no plans to attack Ukraine.With more than 100,000 Russian troops on Ukraine’s border, US officials have long warned that Moscow could try to create a “false flag” event to justify an incursion.Russia on Friday strongly reaffirmed its demand that Nato doesn’t expand eastward despite the rejection of that by the military alliance amid a Russian troop buildup near Ukraine.Foreign minister Sergey Lavrov warned that Moscow wouldn’t wait indefinitely for the Western response, saying he expects the US and Nato to provide a written answer next week.EU foreign ministers on Friday warned Russia of a “robust” response, fearing that a cyberattack against Ukraine could prepare the ground for military action by Moscow against its neighbour.Meanwhile, Ukraine has proposed three-way talks with Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin. “We are still waiting for the reaction on this, I think, from the Russian side. But our American partners take our proposal with some interest,” said the head of the president’s office, Andriy Yermak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-concerned-russia-prepping-for-invasion-101642192397247.html
