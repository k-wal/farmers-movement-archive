In China, the astonishing growth in the last decade of the high-speed rail network from zero to about 38,000 km at the cost of nearly a trillion dollars has eclipsed its concurrent investment in roads under Beijing’s 7918 plan — a network just a little longer than the US interstate system. To add to this, China built 8,000 km of urban metros in about 45 cities and increased hospital beds from 1.7 to 4.3 per thousand. All in this century (starting around when India began its national highway development) and accelerating after the global financial crisis to prop up the economy and achieve a smoother transition from double-digit growth to the current sedate 5% a year, which is still high, given China’s income level.
