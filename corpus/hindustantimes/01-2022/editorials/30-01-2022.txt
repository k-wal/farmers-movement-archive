In the second half of last year, a chronic foot injury after failing to defend his French Open throne inflicted a crushing blow to Nadal. Injuries aren’t a novelty for the Spaniard. He has had them on his knee, back, wrist, hip, hamstring and foot — each essential for an elite tennis player — through various points of his career and he believes this limited him from achieving further heights. And last year, as he went through another lengthy rehabilitation process, it emerges that Nadal wondered if the time had come. But like he so often does in a five-set slugfest that he so often wins — including the one on Sunday — Nadal pushed a little more in his quest to get back on court. This, at 35, an age by which most had predicted that his playing days would be long over from the wear and tear on the body due to his brutally taxing physical game style. But here was Nadal, back in Melbourne for his 17th appearance in the season-opening Grand Slam, proving all doubters wrong. More importantly, waving goodbye to his own goodbye thoughts from a few months ago.
