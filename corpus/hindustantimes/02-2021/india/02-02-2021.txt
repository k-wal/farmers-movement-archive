Well, you’d better not have made what the state’s top policeman termed “anti-national posts” on social media. Applying for a gun licence in Uttarakhand? See answer above. At a time when comments and posts seen as critical of the government are seen as anti-national, the comments of Ashok Kumar, the hill-state’s DGP have caused a stir. They were made on Tuesday, the concluding day of state Police Officers Conference held at police headquarters in Dehradun. “Until now, in cases of any person putting up any anti-national posts on social media, the police used to counsel them. A case was registered only if it was a very serious case,” he added. Under the new approach, he said, ”the police would scrutinise social media accounts to check if they were habitual posters of anti-national posts”. Those identified as such would see the police not signing off on their so-called police verification -- mandatorily required for passports or arms licences. A second police officer said the police took the decision to combat “an increase in the number of people putting anti-national posts on social media in the state.”“The number of such posts on social media platforms have increased which is a clear threat to the law and order.” Lawyers believe the move is an “infringement” of an individual’s freedom of expression. Kartikeya Gupta, senior lawyer at Uttarakhand High Court, said: “It is a complete infringement of an individual’s freedom expression. Police has no right to decide whether any post on social media is anti-national or not; it is the job of the courts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-anti-national-posts-to-hit-passport-clearance-101612289325781.html

02-02-2021||India||Opposition obstructing important discussions: Joshi||Union minister for parliamentary affairs Pralhad Joshi on Tuesday lashed out at opposition parties for creating disruptions in the Lok Sabha, which was adjourned several times during the day. Joshi said that the opposition parties were obstructing important discussions with their sloganeering. The Lok Sabha session was adjourned thrice on Tuesday as opposition leaders from the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Trinamool Congress (TMC) and Congress raised slogans demanding a total repeal of the farm laws passed in the previous session.“In the last session, when a decision was taken to not hold Question Hour due to pandemic they said it was the murder of democracy. Now when it is being conducted, they're obstructing. I appeal to them to hold discussions in Parliament,” Joshi was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Earlier in the day, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar told parliamentarians from opposition parties that the government is ready to hold discussions on the farm laws both ‘inside and outside Parliament.’ He said, “If members are ready to discuss the laws and issues related to farmers, the government is ready for debate inside and outside parliament. Had you started discussing and debating, half of the discussion would have completed by now.”Proceedings in the Rajya Sabha were also adjourned for the day as members of opposition parties protested against the implementation of the farm laws and demanded discussions regarding the violence that erupted during the tractor rally on January 26.Farmers are agitating since November last year against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. The farmers’ groups believe that these three laws will affect the procurement under the Minimum Support Price system and allow private and multinational companies to make profits off farmers as it will encourage corporate farming.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-obstructing-important-discussions-joshi-101612288545913.html

02-02-2021||India||Action on old vehicles, traffic congestion in Delhi's plan against air pollution||The task of curbing air pollution in Delhi will now require even state governments of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana to report action taken against polluting diesel and petrol vehicles that are over 10/15 years old once in every two months to the Commission on Air Quality Management, the body set up by the Central government to curb pollution in Delhi and adjoining areas.This was stated by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) in an affidavit submitted before the top court during the hearing of a set of petitions dealing with air pollution in Delhi.The affidavit highlighted the steps taken by the broad-based Commission having representatives from states adjoining Delhi along with representatives from Central ministries and representatives of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and state pollution control authorities.The Commission, appointed in November 2020, identified five focus areas while tackling the issue of pollution in Delhi-NCR. These included industrial pollution, agricultural stubble burning, municipal solid waste management and biomass burning, construction and demolition activities and vehicular pollution.During the interactions with representatives from Delhi and neighbouring states, the Commission noticed lack of enforcement against polluting, over-aged vehicles not just in Delhi but in neighbouring districts of the national capital. The neighbouring states also did not have a traffic management plan in place to tackle vehicular pollution.Also read: CAA rules are under preparation - Govt tells Lok SabhaThe affidavit said, “It was strongly reiterated that such overaged petrol/diesel vehicles more than 15/10 years of age, must not be allowed to ply in NCR at any cost and if found doing so, shall be taken off the roads immediately.”Accordingly, the Sub-Committee on “Safeguarding and Enforcement” working under the Commission on January 8 this year, prepared a reporting format to be submitted by Delhi and adjoining states every two months. This format has details about over-aged vehicles impounded, traffic congestion spots identified and resolved, new pollution under control (PUC) centres added, existing and proposed car parking facilities, and additional CNG fuelling stations.On industrial polluting units, the Commission examined nearly 6,642 units operating in Delhi-NCR, of which 3,138 were found to be using clean fuel (CNG/PNG). The Commission set a deadline of January 31 for remaining 2,904 units (Haryana -2220, UP- 420, Rajasthan-151) to convert to clean fuel.On stubble burning, the affidavit said that the Commission’s focus was on crop residue management by which the paddy straw, that is usually burnt, could be cut using farm machinery and used by other industries as the source of fuel. The affidavit said, “Stubble burning and pollution arising therefrom is a major area of concern, particularly during the months of October-November… The Commission identified Crop Residue Management as one of the priority areas.”To facilitate this, the Department of Agriculture Cooperation and Farmer Welfare, under the Central government, has developed an app-based aggregator platform for hiring and renting of farm machinery required for stubble cutting. The app called FARMS (Farm Machinery Solutions) has nearly 1.47 lakh individual farmers and over 22,000 custom hiring centres (CHC) across Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh. Nearly 1.58 lakh machines have been supplied to individual farmers and CHCs through the app and other financial incentive schemes, the affidavit stated.Though the issue of stubble burning affects the quality of air in Delhi during the winter months, the Commission is focusing on crop residue management as a technique to curb stubble burning incidents. The top court has expressed concerns over stubble burning after a public interest litigation (PIL) filed before the Court pointed out that pollution caused by stubble burning can impact mortality rate due to the coronavirus disease.In 2020, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh reported a decline in stubble burning incidents but Punjab reported a 15 per cent increase. In Haryana last year, 5,000 farm fires were reported as compared to 6,652 in 2019. Punjab reported 76,590 farm fires as against 52,991 in 2019.On Tuesday, the apex court took up the PILs on stubble burning and air pollution in Delhi but adjourned the matter after two weeks. The Centre’s affidavit will be examined by the Court on the next date of hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/action-on-old-vehicles-traffic-congestion-in-delhi-s-plan-against-air-pollution-101612286706178.html
02-02-2021||India||RJD, NCP hold alliance talks with TMC to fight BJP in Bengal assembly polls||Top leaders of Bihar's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Maharashtra's Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) held talks with the Trinamool Congress (TMC) leadership on Monday and agreed to form an alliance against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Bengal assembly polls due in March-April.RJD national general secretary Shyam Rajak met Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew and TMC youth wing president Abhishek Banerjee in Kolkata. TMC’s senior Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy held talks with NCP founder and former Union minister Sharad Pawar in Delhi. Pawar also spoke to Mamata Banerjee over phone.“I met Abhishek Banerjee and we agreed on one agenda - the BJP has to be defeated in Bengal. That is our only goal,” Rajak told HT after returning to Patna on Tuesday evening. “We did not discuss the issue of seat sharing in the first round of talks. That can take place later. We will be frequenting Bengal from now on,” he added. The RJD also held a workers’ meeting in Kolkata on Sunday.Roy said he was very happy that regional parties have offered their support to the TMC.“Pawar and I had a round of talks on Monday. He is in touch with Mamata Banerjee. The NCP’s Darjeeling district unit will hold a meeting on Wednesday,” said Roy.The Samajwadi Party (SP), the main opposition force in Uttar Pradesh, is also eager to form an alliance with the TMC, Roy said. “Akhilesh Yadav may visit Kolkata. This is a hopeful sign. A consensus is emerging that the BJP needs to be stopped,” said Roy.SP vice-president Kiranmoy Nanda, who served as fisheries minister in the Jyoti Basu and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee governments when his West Bengal Socialist Party merged with Yadav’s party, is in Kolkata since last week.HT reported on January 31 that while Mamata Banerjee is trying to consolidate anti-BJP votes, top parties from the Hindi heartland have geared up to enter the race, raising the possibility of a split in votes cast by Hindi-speaking and tribal people. The advantage of such a division, no matter how small, may help the TMC in some regions, feel political experts and TMC leaders.The BJP says it will win more than 200 of the state’s 294 seats while election strategist Prashant Kishor, who was roped in by Banerjee in 2019 after the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats, has announced on social media that he will leave his profession if the BJP bags more than 99 seats.Against this backdrop, Bihar’s ruling party, the Janata Dal (United) and Jharkhand’s ruling party, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Maharashtra’s Shiv Sena have also geared up to contest the Bengal polls either in alliance with local parties or, as independent forces. JD(U) and Sena leaders told HT last week that they will contest with an anti-BJP agenda.Though all these parties contested a few seats in Bengal in the past without much success, this time around, the electoral dynamics is significant because of the deep inroads made by the BJP which Banerjee has branded as “a party of outsiders” while simultaneously making efforts to reach out to Hindi-speaking voters. Bengal has a substantial number of Bihari voters.Last Thursday, Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren addressed his first rally at Jhargram, a district with a high tribal population. In the adjoining districts, the BJP won the Lok Sabha seats of Purulia, Bishnupur and Midnapore in 2019. Tribal people constitute a sizable chunk of voters in these seats. Soren spoke against the Centre in his speech.Kolkata-based political science professor Udayan Bandopadhyay said the TMC will benefit from the voices of these regional parties and that will matter more than the votes these parties may get in the bi-polar election.The BP shrugged off the NCP and the RJD as nonentities in Bengal"The NCP and RJD are nonentities in Bengal. This is a bi-polar contest between TMC and BJP. Banerjee's efforts are exposing the dichotomy in the TMC. On one hand, ruling party leaders call the BJP a party of Hindi-speaking outsiders while on the other they seek help from regional forces. As far as RJD is concerned, one must remember that its leader Laloo Prasad Yadav was put in jail in the fodder scam case by the then CBI joint director Upen Biswas who was later made a minister by Banerjee when she came to power in 2011," said Samik Bhattacharya BJP's chief spokesperson in Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rjd-ncp-hold-alliance-talks-with-tmc-to-fight-bjp-in-bengal-assembly-polls-101612285214711.html

The state government can frame a law. In the past, doubts were raised during the elections (about EVM tampering)."Voting is a fundamental right and one should have the option of casting vote using ballot papers or EVM, he said.Several parties, including the Congress, had in the past urged the Election Commission to revert to the ballot paper system, alleging tampering of EVMs in polls.Representing the applicant on Tuesday, advocate Satish Uke said it is the right of voters from the state to have the option of casting their votes via ballot paper as well.According to the statement, he said it should be left to people to decide whether EVMs or ballot papers are trustworthy and it is the legislature's responsibility to frame a law keeping in mind public sentiments.Several opposition parties across the country have in the past alleged tampering of EVMs and demanded reverting to the ballot paper system.However, the BJP had previously hit out at the opposition parties for raising doubts over the credibility of EVMs.In Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress are in power under the aegis of the Maha Vikas Aghadi, while the BJP is in the opposition in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-speaker-patole-calls-for-law-for-using-ballot-paper-in-polls-101612280682160.html

02-02-2021||India||Eviction of homeless people in Indore reunites couple||The eviction of homeless people to the city’s outskirts which became a major embarrassment for the Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC), brought happiness for a woman who reunited with her husband after 15 days.A resident of Damodar Nagar, Pushpa Salvi, 52, found her missing 55-year-old mentally unstable husband on Sunday after a municipal officer called her. “My husband went missing on January 3. I searched for him a lot but didn’t find him. I lodged a complaint with police on January 15 but police also failed to locate him,” Pushpa Salvi said.“On January 30, I got a call from a person who introduced himself as an officer of IMC. He asked me my husband’s name and his whereabouts. When I told him that he was missing, he told me that he was at Nipaniya’s by-pass. I hired a taxi and the officer directed the driver to the exact location,” said Salvi.She said that when she reached the site she found about six people including her husband sitting on the ground. “The IMC officials at the site allowed me to take my husband with me. I took him to a hospital for a health check-up. The doctor allowed him to go home on Monday,” said Salvi.Salvi said, “I came to know later that my husband was one of the victims, who were dumped outside the city by IMC officials.”The IMC had come under fire on Saturday after a video went viral showing municipal employees dropping elderly homeless people from a truck near Shipra village of the district. After villagers objected to such callous behavior, the IMC employees were seen herding the people back in the truck“If the villagers had not opposed the act of IMC officials of dumping elderly homeless people, I might have lost my husband for forever. IMC officials tried to locate the family members of these people including my husband after chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan took action against them,” Salvi added.Chandan Nagar police station town inspector Yogesh Tomar said Salvi’s husband became mentally unstable after an accident a few years ago“I am happy that Pushpa Salvi found her husband. The woman works as a daily wage earner and used to live alone with her husband. Her husband was injured in an accident a few years ago and became mentally ill,” said the police officer.Despite repeated attempts, IMC commissioner Pratibha Pal could not be contacted for comment.Following the outrage over the dumping of the elderly homeless people, the chief minister suspended IMC deputy commissioner Pratap Singh Solanki and sacked two contractual employees.The Madhya Pradesh Human Rights Commission (MPHRC) has also sought a report from the state's chief secretary, Indore divisional commissioner, district collector and IMC chief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eviction-of-homeless-people-in-indore-reunites-couple-101612283491719.html
02-02-2021||India||CAA rules are under preparation: Govt tells Lok Sabha||The Centre on Tuesday said it is preparing rules for the implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which was passed by both houses of Parliament in 2019.Union minister of state for the ministry of home affairs Nityanand Rai said the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019, came into force from January 10, 2020.“The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA) has been notified on 12.12.2019 and has come into force w.e.f. 10.01.2020. The Rules under The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA) are under preparation. The Committees on Subordinate Legislation, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha have granted extension of time upto 09.04.2021 and 09.07.2021 respectively to frame these rules under the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA),” Rai said in the Lok Sabha while replying to a question regarding the implementation of CAA.The act allows persecuted minorities belonging to the Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Buddhist, Parsi and Christian communities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan to avail Indian citizenship. People belonging to these communities who arrived in India till December 31, 2014, due to religious persecution in these three countries will not be treated as illegal migrants but will be provided with Indian citizenship. President of India Ram Nath Kovind gave his assent to the legislation on December 12, 2019.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that CAA will ensure that persecuted minorities will get access to a secure future while speaking at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in 2019 and assured that the law will not snatch anyone’s citizenship. Union home minister Amit Shah has also on several occasions said that CAA is meant to give persecuted minorities a chance towards living a dignified life.Opposition parties and several groups have protested against the implementation of CAA. CAA’s detractors believe that the law coupled with the National Register of Citizens (NRC) exercise is intended to target Muslims living in India. Several protests were held against CAA last year and agitation in northeast Delhi turned violent and spiralled into communal riots on February 24, 2020. More than 50 people died and 200 people were injured in the riots. Uttar Pradesh also witnessed riots and clashes between anti-CAA protesters and police officials at the beginning of 2020.The announcement made by Rai comes at a time when Assam and West Bengal is preparing to hold elections. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) during its campaign in both states have promised on several occasions to implement the CAA and NRC to resolve the issue of illegal migrants in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/caa-rules-are-under-preparation-govt-tells-lok-sabha-101612282653469.html

The appeal before the high court is restored to its original file,” it said.The bench, also comprising Justices R S Reddy and M R Shah, delivered the judgement on an appeal filed by state of Gujarat against the January 2015 verdict of the high court.The high court had acquitted the accused for the offences under the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act by setting aside the trial court verdict.The trial court had convicted the accused, who was working as assistant director in ITI Gandhi Nagar, for the offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act and awarded him five years imprisonment along with a fine of ₹10,000.While setting aside the high court verdict, the apex court said, “The approach of the high court in dealing/non-­dealing with the evidence was patently illegal leading to grave miscarriage of justice.”“Therefore, we are of the firm opinion that the impugned judgment and order passed by the high court acquitting the respondent–accused without adverting to the reasons given by the trial court while convicting the accused and without re-appreciating the entire evidence on record in detail cannot be sustained and the same deserves to be quashed and set aside,” the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-says-offence-under-prevention-of-corruption-act-is-against-society-101612282400506.html

Uttarakhand police won’t verify passport||Uttarakhand police will now scrutinise social media behaviour of those putting “anti-national” posts on such sites and may not clear verification for passport or arms licence if they are found to doing it habitually, state director general of police Ashok Kumar said on Tuesday."Till now, in case a person was putting anti-national posts or fake news on social media, the police used to counsel him and ask him not to repeat it in future. A case was registered only if it was a very serious case," Kumar said."From now onwards, the police will scrutinise the accused's social media behaviour to check if he is habitually putting such anti-national posts. If it is found so, then the police would mention it in his/her police verification and may not clear in his application for passport or arms license," he said on the concluding day of state police officers’ conference held at police headquarters in Dehradun.The development was among other measures discussed by the police officers during the conference to improve policing in the state."The decision was taken as there has been an increase in people putting anti-national posts on social media in the state," said another police officer privy to the development."The social media monitoring team has been keeping a strict eye to track down such people. It was found that the number of such posts on social media platforms has increased, which is a clear threat to law and order," the officer said.However, the legal experts have termed the move as an infringement of an individual's freedom of expression.Senior lawyer at Uttarakhand High Court, Kartikeya Gupta said, "It is a complete infringement of an individual's freedom expression. Police has no right to decide whether any post on social media is anti-national or not as it is the job of the courts."Gupta added, "Police cannot pass such a gag order. If police itself will decide that then what will the courts do?"||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/antinational-posts-on-social-media-uttarakhand-police-won-t-verify-passport-101612280497065.html

02-02-2021||India||Bhubaneswar civic body destroys heritage structures around Lingaraj temple||Bhubaneswar’s municipal corporation has razed portions of a heritage complex around Lingaraj temple in the Odisha capital to create more space for devotees to pray on Shivratri next month at the 11th-century shrine, conservation group Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) has said after an inspection by its eight-member team.Noted historian Anil Dhir, who led the INTACH team, said the municipal corporation’s action in the heritage zone, ostensibly part of a beautification attempt, was carried out in violation of the law governing archaeological sites and without the approval from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).Dhir said the corporation team even used mechanical equipment such as jackhammer drills in the sensitive heritage zone. “It was pathetic… We saw evidence of vandalism”.The historian said it is standard practice to carry out a ground-penetrating radar survey to image the subsurface before any construction or demolition at a heritage zone. This wasn’t done and has led to damage to the heritage structures.The state government wanted to use the area for peripheral development of Lingaraj temple under their Ekamra Kshetra Heritage project in the Old Town area of Bhubaneswar. The Ekamra Kshetra Heritage Project, announced in December 2019 by chief minister Naveen Patnaik, envisaged comprehensive developmental work near the Lingaraj temple.A portion of the area that has been demolished near Suka-Sari temple over ṭhe last few months is likely to be developed into an open prayer site for devotees of Lord Lingaraj during Shivratri.BMC commissioner Prem Chandra Chaudhury was dismissive of INTACH’s concerns. The demolition was done on private land and the corporation did not bulldoze its way through as is being alleged. "Who is the person levelling the allegation?... In any case, we have now written to ASI seeking their permission for redevelopment around the area. We are waiting for their permission," said Chaudhury.Arun Malik, the ASI’s superintending archaeologist, backed INTACH, underlining that the demolished structures were covered by the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act.“No one informed ASI over the last 3 months when the demolition was being done. We also don't know where the debris has gone,” Malik said, complaining how heritage structures had been removed and dumped somewhere.“We also don't know where the debris has gone. I have been looking for it since the debris also had huge heritage value... The bulldozers have damaged much of the heritage structures and nothing can be done to retrieve it," said Malik.Some of the important structures that were destroyed by the civic body was a Yoni Peeth, a revered icon in Hindu religion. The upper portion of the subsidiary shrines of Suka Sari temple that were discovered last week was destroyed in the demolition drive.Among the heritage structures demolished around the Lingaraj temple include the 11th century Ganesh temple called Budha Ganesh on the northern side of Lingaraj complex. It has been listed as a protected monument years ago and is one of the smallest Ganesh temples of Bhubaneswar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhubaneswar-civic-body-destroys-heritage-structures-around-lingaraj-temple-101612278122295.html

Their petitioners said the Mathura chief judicial magistrate did not have the jurisdiction to try the matter or remand them in custody. The petition added that Rehman and Masood were going to meet the bereaved family while Alam was transporting them to the destination.The PFI is an Islamic organisation formed as a successor to the National Development Front (NDF) in 2006. It has often been accused of involvement in anti-national and anti-social activities by the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-alleged-pfi-members-can-meet-lawyers-in-jail-up-govt-tells-allahabad-hc-101612278499203.html

02-02-2021||India||PIL in Delhi HC to include judges, judicial staff in first phase of Covid-19 vaccination||A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was filed in Delhi High Court on Tuesday seeking inclusion of judges, judicial staff, advocates and members of the legal fraternity in the first phase of Covid-19 vaccination.The petition seeks directions to Centre and Delhi Government to arrange and facilitate required infrastructure within two months in all court premises for Covid-19 vaccination.Petitioner Amrender Singh, a practising lawyer, said the rule of law depends on the functioning of courts and litigants are suffering delays in delivery of justice in absence of normal functioning of courts. The plea said several advocates amongst the legal fraternity had faced unprecedented times due to Covid-19 pandemic and were still dealing with the repercussions.It said the government "failed to include" the legal fraternity in its first vaccination drive "without having regard to the life, health and wellbeing of judges, practising advocates and other staff of the legal fraternity".It added that due to pandemic, the courts have not functioned to their full capacity and restricted audience, absence of examination of witnesses, limited hearing of cases, malfunctioning of software programmes and delays in the hearing were leading to a crisis not only for the litigants and lawyers but to many who draw their sustenance from the courts such as small canteen workers, couriers, photostat shops and stationers.Many are being driven to penury, the plea said.It sought directions to extend the present vaccination programme to the legal fraternity to usher in normalcy in the working of the judicial system."This will restore the faith of the people in the judiciary. Opening court halls and hearings in physical form are of seminal importance. It would be in the larger interests not only of the litigating public but also in the history of the administration. It will assuage a system that has been fractured by the pandemic," the plea said.It said the Supreme Court Bar Association had on January 18 requested the Union Law Minister to extend vaccination to judges, members of the staff and lawyers who work in the judicial system as frontline workers, "but no action has been taken to date to include the legal fraternity in present vaccination drive".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pil-in-delhi-hc-to-include-judges-judicial-staff-in-first-phase-of-covid-19-vaccination-101612275047163.html

The reply by the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) came amid the controversial anti-conversion laws brought by the governments of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.Assam and Karnataka have also announced that they would soon bring in a similar law to curb inter-faith marriages. All of these states are ruled by the BJP.In an unstarred question MHA was also asked whether the government is of the view that interfaith marriages are happening due to forceful conversions and does it have evidence with respect to the same.MHA's response stated, "‘Public Order’ and ‘Police’ are State subjects as per the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. Hence prevention, detection, registration, investigation and prosecution of offences related to religious conversions are primarily the concerns of the State Governments/Union Territory (UT) Administrations. Action is taken as per existing laws by the law enforcing agencies whenever instances of violation come to notice."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-intention-to-bring-central-anti-conversion-law-mha-tells-parliament-101612275009764.html

I have spoken to the Canara Bank chief manager and informed senior police officials. The trio will be felicitated soon. The cash-loading agency Writer Business Services Pvt Ltd staffers Vishal and Vinod told us they had mistakenly left ₹1.50 lakh in the ATM after loading ₹23.50 lakh cash,” Naresh Prasad Sinha, officer-in-charge of Azadnagar police station said.Wasim said he saw the cash lying behind the ATM when he entered the kiosk to withdraw money Monday evening.“I came out with the money and informed Shahid Akhtar and Abdul Rashid who were standing in the queue outside. We then pasted a notice on the ATM kiosk wall with our mobile numbers stating that the person to whom the money belongs may contact us on these numbers,” said Wasim.Shahid and Abdul said they later decided to take the money and deposit it at the Azadnagar police station“We had gone to our respective houses and then went to the police station and handed over the cash to the OC late last evening. We are happy that we are clear in our conscience and that the cash loaders didn’t have to face any consequence or financial loss,” said Shahid.Vishal, one of the cash loaders, acknowledged that they had indeed left the money and thanked Wasim, Shahid Akhtar and Abdul Rashid for their honesty.“We had come to the ATM around 7.30 pm with Vinod, security guard Manish Kumar and driver Prakash. We were supposed to load ₹25 lakh cash into the ATM but mistakenly left the ATM after loading only ₹23.50 lakh. We were in a hurry to load another ATM. Luckily, these three boys returned the money and saved our jobs,” Vishal, Writer Business staff, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cash-loaders-forget-rs-1-5-lakh-in-atm-in-jamshedpur-teens-return-it-to-cops-101612274530488.html
02-02-2021||India||Left with no option: Govt defends Delhi Police action on farmers||The Centre on Tuesday said the Delhi Police were left with no option but to use tear gas, water cannons and mild force to control the crowd after the tractor rally by protesting farmers in the national capital turned violent on January 26. The Union ministry of home affairs also informed Parliament that the Delhi Police have registered 39 cases against the farmers’ protesting against the three farm laws on the outskirts of Delhi between September to December 2020.“As regards the use of tear gas and resorting to Lathi charge against protesting farmers by the Delhi Police, it has been reported by Delhi Police that at Delhi border, large convoys of protesting farmers in tractor trolleys tried to furiously force their way and go past Police barricades to enter Delhi to mark their protest against the recently enacted ‘Farm Laws’,” minister of state for home affairs G Kishan Reddy said in his written reply in the Lok Sabha.“They aggressively resorted to rioting, damage to Government property and used criminal force to deter public servants from the discharge of their duty, thereby inflicting injuries to the on-duty police personnel. Moreover, social distancing was not followed by the farmers/protestors and they gathered in large numbers without face masks amid Covid-19 pandemic. The farmers’ actions left the Delhi Police with no option but to use tear gas, water cannons and mild force to control the crowd,” Reddy said.Reddy also said that Delhi Police, which report to the MHA, have also informed the Centre that one case of suicide has been reported to them during the protest against the farm laws at the Delhi border. The minister did not specifically respond to another question that asked the Union home ministry for evidence that “terrorists infiltrated the farm agitation”. Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava, whose department has been under fire for the heightened security at the Ghazipur and Tikri borders of the national capital, also defended the action. “I am surprised that when tractors were used, police were attacked, barricades were broken on January 26, no questions were raised. What did we do now? We have just strengthened barricading so that it's not broken again,” he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. Shrivastava, who had visited the Ghazipur border on Monday to inspect the security arrangements, was replying to a question about the barricading at Delhi’s borders.Farmers have been protesting on the different borders of the national capital since November 26 against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/left-with-no-option-govt-defends-delhi-police-action-on-farmers-101612273297535.html
02-02-2021||India||India's demand for Covid-19 drug remdesivir to fall, says Cipla||Drugmaker Cipla said on Tuesday that India's demand for Covid-19 drug remdesivir will likely fall in coming months, as daily coronavirus infections in the country continue to decline.Cipla was among the first companies in India to launch a generic version of remdesivir, developed by US-based Gilead Sciences, and as of September had sold more than 300,000 vials across India."There is a direct link between the number of cases and remdesivir sales," Kedar Upadhye, Cipla's global chief financial officer, told Reuters. He did not provide details on how much he expected demand to fall.Demand for the drug was still robust in October and November, but began to drop in December, Upadhye said.India's average daily coronavirus caseload was about 53,000 in October and November, and plunged to around 27,000 in December, according to a Reuters tally. Daily cases had hit a peak in September.The World Health Organization in November advised that the drug not be used for patients hospitalized with Covid-19, for lack of evidence it could improve patient survival.But there has been no change to protocols on remdesivir's use in India, Upadhye said.Mumbai-headquartered Cipla said on Friday its consolidated net profit more than doubled during the three months ended December 31, helped by higher demand for other drugs across its portfolio.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-demand-for-covid-19-drug-remdesivir-to-fall-says-cipla-101612272108086.html

Union government is employing cheap tactics of disconnecting water, electricity and internet connections at the agitation venues,” Himmat Singh Gujjar of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha said at the mahapanchayat.He alleged that the Centre is pro-corporate and is insensitive towards the farmers agitating under an open sky in the winter.Raman Simala, another leader of the Morcha, said the farmer agitation will continue till the three laws are withdrawn. He said a rally and another mahapanchayat of farmers will be organised in Dausa on February 5 and many such meetings will be held in neighbouring districts in coming days."Although the farmers at the mahapanchayat have called for Delhi march, a committee will take a final call on whether to go to Delhi or join the agitation at Shahjahanpur border in Alwar," he said.After the mahapanchayat, farmers submitted a memorandum to the sub-divisional magistrate against the farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-meet-in-rajasthan-s-dausa-calls-for-delhi-march-on-feb-7-101612271319718.html
02-02-2021||India||SC to hear on Wednesday pleas related to tractor rally violence on Republic Day||The Supreme Court on Wednesday will hear a batch of pleas pertaining to tractor rally violence in the national capital on the Republic Day, including the one which has sought setting up of a commission headed by a retired apex court judge to inquire into the incident.The tractor parade on January 26 that was to highlight the demands of farmer unions to repeal three new agri laws dissolved into anarchy on the streets of the national capital as thousands of protesters broke through barriers, fought with the police, overturned vehicles and hoisted a religious flag from the ramparts of the iconic Red Fort.The petitions would be taken up for hearing by a bench comprising Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.One of the pleas filed by advocate Vishal Tiwari has sought setting up of a three-member inquiry commission under the chairmanship of a former apex court judge and comprising of two retired high court judges for collecting and recording evidence and submit a report on the January 26 violence to the top court in a time bound manner.He has also sought direction to the concerned authority to lodge FIRs against individuals or organisations responsible for the violence and causing dishonour of the National Flag on January 26.Another petition has been filed by advocate Manohar Lal Sharma who has sought a direction to the concerned authority as well as the media not to declare farmers as "terrorist" without any evidence.Sharma has claimed in his plea that there was a “planned conspiracy” to sabotage the protest by farmers’ and they were allegedly declared as “terrorist” without any evidence.He has sought directions to prohibit propagation of “false allegations and actions declaring” farmers as terrorist without any evidence.Besides the petitions filed by Tiwari and Sharma, the court would also hear some other pleas related to the incident.In his petition, Tiwari has said that farmers’ protest against the three new agri laws is going on for over two months but it took a “violent turn” during the tractor parade.“Unfortunately, the tractor march took a violent turn leaving injuries and destruction of public property. This incident also effected the daily life of the public. The internet services were interrupted as government ordered the operators to suspend the same. In the present time, the internet services are very essential to carry out the work in different professions especially in advocacy as the courts and our Supreme Court of India is functioning online,” Tiwari has said in his plea.It said that clash between the farmers and police on the Republic Day has caught the attention of the entire world.“The matter is serious because when the protest was going on peacefully for last two months then suddenly, how it turned into violent movement and led violence on January 26. The question for consideration in national security and public interest arises that who is responsible for creating the disturbance and how and who turned the peaceful farmer protest into violent movement or how and who created the circumstances which let the protest turn violent,” it said.The plea said there may be some conspiracy by some “notorious forces or organizations” to cause disturbance and damage the peaceful protest and create clash between police and protesting farmers.On January 20, the Centre had withdrawn its application, filed through Delhi Police, seeking an injunction against the proposed tractor march on January 26 after the apex court had said that issue of tractor rally by farmers protesting against the new farms laws was in “executive domain”.On January 12, the apex court had stayed the implementation of the contentious new farm laws till further orders and constituted a four-member committee to make recommendations to resolve the impasse over them between the Centre and farmers' unions protesting at Delhi borders.The members of the court-appointed committee were -- Bhupinder Singh Mann, National President of Bhartiya Kisan Union, All India Kisan Coordination Committee; Parmod Kumar Joshi, Director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute; Ashok Gulati, agricultural economist and former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, and Anil Ghanwat, President of Shetkari Sanghatana.Later, Mann had recused himself from the committee.The top court had on January 12 said it would hear the pleas against the farm laws after eight weeks when the committee would give its suggestions to resolve the impasse after talking to the protesters and the government.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at various border points of Delhi for over a month now against the three laws -- the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-hear-on-wednesday-pleas-related-to-tractor-rally-violence-on-republic-day-101612270227232.html
02-02-2021||India||Andhra assembly to summon state election commissioner for breach of privilege||Andhra Pradesh’s state election commissioner Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar’s long-running battle with the Jagan Mohan Reddy government took another turn on Tuesday with the privileges committee of the state legislative assembly proposing to summon him for a personal appearance in the House.The committee wants to seek Ramesh Kumar’s explanation on some objectionable comments he had allegedly made against two ministers in the Jagan Mohan Reddy cabinet last week.It is for the first time in the history of Andhra Pradesh state legislature that an election commissioner, who is a Constitutional authority, would be summoned for a trial before the House.The privileges committee, headed by YSR Congress party MLA Kakani Goverdhan Reddy, held an emergency virtual meeting to look into the notice for a privilege motion forwarded to him Monday evening by state assembly Speaker Tammineni Sitaram.Reddy said under clauses 212 and 213 of the state legislature’s rules, the assembly can summon state election commissioner for causing breach of privilege of any members. He reminded that there was a precedent in Maharashtra state legislature in which the SEC was summoned before the assembly under similar conditions.Telugu Desam Party member of the privileges committee Anagani Satyaprasad, however, objected to summoning of the SEC. He said under Article 243K of the Constitution of India, the SEC enjoyed supreme powers and as such, he could not be called to the assembly.The committee decided to meet again next week physically, instead of virtually, to take a final decision on summoning the SEC after a detailed discussion, since it is a serious issue.The notice for a privilege motion against Ramesh Kumar was given to the Speaker on Saturday by two ministers – panchayat raj minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy and municipal administration minister Botsa Satyanarayana.The ministers, in their separate representations to the Speaker, alleged that the SEC had made certain objectionable comments against them in his letter to Governor Biswa Bhushan Harichandan last week.Stating that the tone and tenor of the letter was intimidating, the panchayat raj minister alleged that the SEC had made several castigating remarks which were libelous in nature and amounted to breach of privilege of the members.A YSRC leader familiar with the development said the privileges committee looked into a precedent in Maharashtra assembly in 2008, when it summoned then state election commissioner Nandlal to the House on charges of breach of privilege.“When Nandlal did not turn up before the assembly for giving an explanation, the assembly sentenced him to two days' simple imprisonment for contempt of the House. He was not even given a chance to move the state high court,” the YSRC leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-assembly-to-summon-state-election-commissioner-for-breach-of-privilege-101612268755953.html

02-02-2021||India||Ahead of Kerala assembly election Sabarimala comes under spotlight once more||Ahead of the assembly election in Kerala, the contentious issue of allowing women devotees into the Sabarimala temple is shaping up as a major factor for political parties with the Congress first off the blocks to leverage it.While the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) has questioned secular credentials of the Muslim League, one of the oldest allies of the opposition United Democratic Front(UDF), the Congress raked up emotional Sabarimala issue to corner both the government and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Congress leader Oommen Chandy had written a letter to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan last week asking him to approach the Supreme Court to expedite a ruling on the contentious temple issue and withdraw its earlier affidavit that favoured entry of women of all ages to the hilltop shrine. Chandy, a former chief minister, said the government’s affidavit had created much confusion which ultimately led to a Supreme Court verdict in 2018 that triggered violence in the state.One of the reasons for the drubbing of the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) in the 2019 general election in which it lost all but one of the 20 Lok Sabha seats was the government’s handling of the temple issue. In 2018 the state had witnessed unrest when the government tried to implement the Supreme Court verdict allowing women of all ages to enter the temple and worship the presiding deity Lord Ayyappa. After a long spell of unrest the apex court later referred the issue to a larger bench in 2019 and a final verdict is pending.“The government should withdraw its earlier affidavit and apologize to devotees for hurting their sentiments. Its position complicated the issue and it tried to enforce the verdict with brute force. It is time for the government to approach the court for a final decision,” said Chandy.Chandy played the Sabarimala card after CPI (M) state secretary A Vijayaraghavan taunted the Congress, questioning frequent trip of the party’s leaders to the house of Muslim League chief Panakkad Hyderali Thangal. He alleged that the Congress had surrendered to the League and questioned its secular credentials.“The League is controlling Congress these days. Even Oommen Chandy was brought in as per its initiative,” he claimed. After his comments sparked a row, Vijayaraghavan clarified that he was talking about a possible UDF alliance with the Jamaat-e-Islami, similar to the one during the last local body election. The League said it was wrong to dub the whole Muslim community as communal for a few votes and asked the CPI (M)’s central leadership to explain it.A worried CPI (M) has asked its leaders not to fall in the temple trap.“We all know why the Congress is raking it up now. We have already made it clear that what the court decides we will go by it,” said Finance Minister Thomas Issac.He also said the Congress was bereft of any issues so it was falling back on an old issue which is in the apex court.Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala, who is on a state-wide yatra, also said the UDF will bring legislation to protect believers if it comes to power. Assembly elections in Kerala and four other states are due in April-May.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is also upset with the Congress for hijacking a poll plank. Congress leaders also questioned top BJP leaders, including Amit Shah, who had promised to protect believers’ rights. “What happened to those tall promises made by PM Modi and then party president Amit Shah?” asked Chennithala.The BJP claimed that its initiatives led to a rethinking on the part of the Supreme Court which later referred it to it to a nine-member bench.“It is a live issue. We suffered most during the Sabarimala stir. Some of us are facing dozens of cases filed by the government,” said BJP’s Kerala unit chief K Surendran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-kerala-assembly-election-sabarimala-comes-under-spotlight-once-more-101612266493978.html
02-02-2021||India||TDP Andhra president arrested for allegedly threatening YSRC leader||The police in Andhra Pradesh’s Srikakulam district on Tuesday arrested former minister and Telugu Desam Party’s state unit president Kinjarapu Atchan Naidu for allegedly threatening and intimidating a YSR Congress party leader at his native village Nimmada a couple of days ago.The police swooped on the residence of Atchan Naidu, also a lawmaker from Tekkali assembly constituency, early in the morning and took him into custody. They questioned him at the Kotabommali police station for a few hours before producing him in a local court in the afternoon.The court remanded the TDP leader to 14-day judicial custody. He was later moved to Srikakulam district jail. He is expected to file a bail petition in a day or two.The police acted on a complaint by the YSR Congress party leaders that Atchan Naidu had threatened and intimidated a sarpanch candidate supported by their party asking him to withdraw his nomination in Nimmada village.While Atchan Naidu’s wife Vijaya Madhavi also filed her nomination for the sarpanch post, a YSRC leader has roped in his cousin, Kinjarapu Appanna, as a rival candidate for the same post.Also read: Delhi’s 5th sero survey - Over 56% people have antibodies against Covid-19Appanna alleged that Atchan Naidu had threatened him with dire consequences if he did not withdraw his nomination. However, the TDP leaders claimed that Atchan Naidu had only tried to convince Appanna to drop out from the contest.On Saturday, the last day of nominations, both TDP and YSRC leaders entered into an altercation at Nimmadda. The Kotabommali police booked cases against 22 people including Atchan Naidu.Strongly condemning the arrest of Atchan Naidu, TDP president and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu accused the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy government of resorting to vindictive politics against the TDP leaders.He alleged that the YSRC leaders were unleashing a reign of terror in the otherwise peaceful north-coastal Andhra districts of Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam.He pointed out that YSRC leader in-charge of Tekkali assembly constituency Duvvada Srinivas, along with his followers, came to Nimmada village brandishing rods, knives and axes and openly threatened the TDP cadres. Yet, the police did not file any case against him, but foisted cases against Atchan Naidu based on false complaints, he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tdp-andhra-president-arrested-for-allegedly-threatening-ysrc-leader-101612265162102.html
02-02-2021||India||After Delhi's 5th serosurvey, health minister Jain says don’t let guard down||Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said on Tuesday people should continue wearing masks and maintain Covid-19 appropriate behaviour even though more than half of the residents of the national capital exposed to coronavirus were found to have developed antibodies against it during the fifth serosurvey. The survey in the Capital showed that as many as 56.13% of the 28,000 people sampled were found to have developed antibodies against Sars-Cov-2. “We should not get into discussions over herd immunity. Everyone should follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour including wearing masks and sanitising hands regularly,” Jain said. The health minister also said that there is no clear yardstick to define the term ‘herd immunity’. “Some say herd immunity is achieved at 50%, others say it should be 60%. I don’t think we should get into the debate of herd immunity now. This is a new form of virus or disease, we should not loosen our precautionary measures because in October we had thought the virus was brought under control, but then we got the third wave,” said Jain.Herd immunity is when enough people have immunity to a disease so that the disease leaves very few vulnerable people for it to spread to, slowing the outbreak. In the case of coronavirus, experts believe that herd immunity will be achieved when 60-80 per cent of the population is immune to the virus. This was the fifth serosurvey conducted in the national capital and the largest in the country so far. The survey was conducted from January 15 to January 23.On Monday, the national capital reported 121 new Covid-19 cases and three deaths, the lowest in the last 10 months. Only 32 Covid-19 patients needed hospitalisation which was also the lowest in the last 10 months. With this, the death count mounted to 10,856 and the Covid-19 case tally count in the city rose to 6,35,217.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-5th-serosurvey-health-minister-jain-says-don-t-let-your-guard-down-101612264692531.html

02-02-2021||India||Farm loan waiver scheme kicks off in Jharkhand, 9 lakh farmers to benefit||Molindra Besra, 45, became Jharkhand’s first farmer to receive the benefit of JMM-led government’s ambitious farm loan waiver scheme.Out of total ₹91,693.26 loan burden on him, the state government has waived ₹50,000 of the total burden. He will now have to pay remaining ₹41,639.26 to the bank, officials said on Tuesday.Besra, a resident of Tarabahal village in Karmatand block of Jamtara district, said, “I had taken a loan for mustard and vegetable cultivation around two years back. However, the majority of the crops had got damaged due to drought. The loan had turned a very big burden on me, as I have to feed my family of six.”“I feel lucky that the government’s loan waiver scheme came at a time when I needed it badly. Now, I have to work hard to repay the rest of the amount to the bank,” he added.Chief minister Hemant Soren on December 29, on the occasion of one-year of his government, had officially announced the farm loan waiver scheme. In the first phase, the government has decided to waive farm loans up to ₹50,000. The state government expects the initiative would benefit around nine lakh farmers.State agriculture minister Badal Patralekh said, “We have formally started the process of farm loan waiver benefit to farmers from Monday. One farmer was given the benefit as token disbursement. Now, we have to ensure that the benefit reaches the last farmer in the state.”State agriculture director Nisha Oraon Singhmar said, “The department has set a target to disburse at least ₹1,000 crore by the end of March. Since the entire process is almost online, technical glitches partially delayed the launching.”She said, “We have identified nine lakh farmers under the loan waiver scheme. However, six lakh farmers have seeded their Aadhaar with banks. The process of Aadhaar seeding of rest three lakh farmers has been started.”However, the benefit will go to only those farmers who have taken loan before March 31, 2020 and have an Aadhar card. To get the benefit, farmers are going through a strict scrutiny.As per the process, the bank will upload the data of eligible farmers in batches which will be available for public view. With this, farmers will get SMS asking them to submit their loan details at nearest Pragya Kendra (common service centre) or to banking correspondents. If their loan details are found to be genuine, the farmers will have to furnish mobile number and ration card details.Under the scheme, only one loan in a family will be waived. If there are three farmers in a family, only one farmer will get the waiver, officials said.“The ration card details will be checked with PDS (public distribution system) data. Once it is found genuine, the farmer will be called for e-KYC. In the third step, eligible farmers will be asked to deposit Re 1. Then, district will issue a fund generate order, which will come to the director for final verification. The director will submit it in a system where every detail is checked through software. When the system finds it okay, the director will ask the nodal bank officer for disbursement,” Singhmar said.The Hemant Soren government had proposed ₹2,000 crore in budget for the current financial year (2020-21) for the waiver. State cabinet on December 24 had taken the decision of farm loan waiver, partly fulfilling the promise made by the ruling coalition ahead of the 2019 assembly elections.The ruling alliance had promised to waive farm loans of up to ₹2 lakh, ahead of the assembly elections last year, if voted to power. The farmers would be charged a service of Re 1 against the farm loan waiver.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-loan-waiver-scheme-kicks-off-in-jharkhand-9-lakh-farmers-to-benefit-101612263997962.html

Different kinds of flora and fauna including smaller species like butterflies and moths are found abundantly in Devalsari region. We are considering the proposal and once approved it will become the first state declared biodiversity heritage site,” said Bhartari.He added that the board has been working to declare places as biodiversity heritage sites, but villagers in most cases do not agree as the tag can restrict development activities. But in the case of Devalsari, about 80 km north of Dehradun, the villagers have themselves sent a proposal.A group of five van (forest) panchayats including Bangsil, Teva, Moldhar, Butkottheek and locals working to protect the area sent a detailed proposal to the biodiversity board last month. The Board is now examining a 25-km stretch of forests as part of the proposal.Arun Gaur, director of Devalsari Paryavaran Sanrakshan Samiti, who sent the proposal said, “Devalsari region is rich in biodiversity with different plants, animals, birds and butterflies being found there. The region also has a lot of potential for ecotourism. If it is declared as a biodiversity heritage site, then it will become more famous among tourists and protection of rare species can be done in a better manner.”In October last year, a rare day-flying moth, Achelura bifasciata was spotted in forests of Devalsari in the Garhwal Himalayas for the first time in history. Before this, the moth was last spotted in Kumaon region in 1890s after which it was spotted in large numbers in Tehri Garhwal district’s Sreedev Suman Titli Park, a butterfly park created by locals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/devalsari-likely-to-become-uttarakhand-s-first-biodiversity-heritage-site-101612263476564.html
02-02-2021||India||DMK walks out on first day of Tamil Nadu assembly session||The first day of the last assembly session under Tamil Nadu’s present regime on Tuesday saw high drama with the Opposition, led by Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) chief MK Stalin arguing with Governor Banwarilal Purhoit and walking out before his customary speech. The DMK will boycott the entire session, Stalin told reporters after leading the walkout. Stalin condemned the Governor’s inaction in deciding on the clemency of the seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case after the Cabinet had sent a resolution in 2019 for their release. “..,the Governor has not given any formal response nor created a situation for their release,” said Stalin. He also accused the Governor of colluding with chief minister Edapaddi Palaniswami and his ministers in corruption. Last December, Stalin had submitted a 97-page document with graft charges against Palaniswami, his deputy O Paneerselvam and six ministers. “We submitted the complaint with evidence but he didn’t take any action.”Also Read | Attacked by elephant when she was 3, 23-year-old finally gets compensationStalin had attempted to raise issues before the Governor could start his address. Purohit urged him to wait and reacted by saying that Tamil Nadu got ₹1 lakh crore in the Union Budget presented a day ago. “This is a day to rejoice towards infrastructure,” Purohit said, which was also objected to by the DMK. “We are not here to discuss the Central government,” responded DMK’s general secretary Duraimurugan. The Governor retaliated that he stated a fact. “I haven’t said anything wrong...Why are you shouting; getting angry on the contrary?” he told DMK members. Purohit urged the Opposition to cooperate as they were on their feet. “Mr Stalin, as leader of opposition, I’ve a request for you...this is the last session of this term. Take full advantage of it, take part in the debate,” Purohit said. “All of you senior leaders, you are one of the best orators, why don’t you use skills? I’ve a suggestion; if you want to register your protest, go out for five minutes and come back again.”But Stalin led a walkout and later, Congress MLAs who had wrapped green scarves over their heads in support of agitating farmers, also left the assembly. In his speech, the Governor lauded the state for its key achievements, including keeping the Covid-19 pandemic under control, receiving the Centre’s award for water management. He condemned the death of four fishermen who recently died after their boat collided with a Sri Lankan naval vessel and said that the Indian government is being proactive to bring back the remaining 12 fishermen from Lankan custody. He allayed concerns regarding the new National Education Policy stating that the two-language policy of the state will continue. The assembly session will conclude on February 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dmk-walks-out-on-first-day-of-tamil-nadu-assembly-session-101612263393808.html

02-02-2021||India||Crane tagged in Russia covers over 4300 km to reach Rajasthan||A Demoiselle crane tagged in Russia's Transbaikalia was spotted in Khinchan village in Jodhpur district on Sunday. The crane traveled about 4,368 km to reach here, the longest distance covered by the tagged migratory birds reported so far, bird experts claimed on Monday.On Sunday morning at the shelter site of migratory birds in Khinchan village, bird watcher Sewaram Mali saw the tagged crane, which he reported to bird expert Dr Dau Lal Bohra. Dr Bohra, associated with the international network engaged in the watch of migratory birds, verified that this bird was tagged on August 2, 2019 by Oleg Goroshko in Transbaikalia in Onon District near Novy Dutulgui village. Now it is the second winter in India for this crane.The last signal from this bird was on January 17 this year. Until January 17 this crane was in Gujrat in the area south of Kachchh Bay between Arabian sea coast and Manavadar. He said that this is the second crane found this winter season that was tagged, but the crane A-5, which was spotted on Sunday, covered the most distance to reach here.“Under the international project of “1000 Cranes”, Demoiselle cranes were tagged with color plastic rings and GPS-GSM transmitters in Russia and Mongolia in 2018 and 2019. Main objectives of the research were to identify pre-migration staging areas, migratory stopovers and wintering grounds along the flyways to India through tagging of cranes and subsequent tracking. In 2018 Demoiselle Cranes tagged in Russia and Mongolia were sighted in Rajasthan and Gujarat, where their wintering grounds are located,” he added.According to the report, “Threats to cranes at wintering grounds in India” published by the Severtsov’ Institute of Ecology and Evolution Russian Academy of Science, in Rajasthan, power lines are also a big issue for migratory bird’s mortality. More than 1000 lethal electrical poles are near feeding and roosting sites, and collisions with electric wires are a major issue for Demoiselle Cranes mortality.In 2012, 19 cranes were dead due to electrocution near a feeding station. At the end of 2019, around 47 Demoiselle Cranes were found dead in a single observation caused by electrocution. The other threats are plastic and sewage water pollution, semi-wild dogs and heavy salt water which probably causes leg injuries or sarcoma.“Rajasthan and Gujarat both are big states and very important for migratory and wintering cranes. Therefore, work on identifying and assessment of threats to cranes and other birds should be conducted with a focus on places determined through crane tagging and tracking. It is necessary to identify where the electric power lines have the greatest negative impact on birds during migration and in wintering grounds, as well as what types of pesticides cause their poisoning,” Dr Bohra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/crane-tagged-in-russia-covers-over-4300-km-to-reach-rajasthan-101612261806908.html

02-02-2021||India||Attacked by elephant when she was 3, 23-year-old finally gets compensation||The Madurai bench of the Madras High Court has ordered monetary compensation and compassionate employment for a woman injured by a temple elephant in 1999 when she was three years old.The court ordered the state to provide ₹25 lakh compensation and employment on compassionate grounds as the woman, now 23, had suffered permanent grievous injuries to her throat.“Life does not mean mere survival or living an immobile or animal existence,” observed Justice Krishnan Ramasamy.Medical records state that her wind and food pipe were completely damaged and it was diagnosed as laryngopharyngeal traumatic injury which isn't curable. She has sought treatment in at least nine hospitals. An artificial tracheal tube was inserted in her throat for her to breathe and is dependent on a liquid-only diet for sustenance.“It is the basic expectation of every human being to live a healthy and active life. If such expectation is breached due to the negligence of the state or its agencies, then it becomes an obligation of the state to do the needful,” the court said.

Jaishankar to Colombo to shore up support for the 2019 deal, that also involved Japan and India's Adani Group ."The commitment of the Government of Sri Lanka ... has been conveyed several times in the recent past, including at the leadership level," a spokesman for India's embassy in Colombo said in an emailed statement on Tuesday."Sri Lanka's cabinet also took a decision three months ago to implement the project with foreign investors. All sides should continue to abide by the existing understandings and commitment."Spokesmen for Adani, the Japanese embassy in Colombo and Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Sri Lanka is key in the battle for influence in South Asia between traditional power India and China, which has been making increasing inroads there.The island nation is a crucial staging post for much of the cargo coming in and out of India, and China's growing influence has alarmed New Delhi.Beijing took over Hambantota port in the south of the country in 2016 after Sri Lanka failed to keep up with debt repayments, and is involved in the construction and operation of a neighbouring port terminal in Colombo, as well as other critical infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-tells-sri-lanka-to-honour-pact-after-colombo-takes-back-port-contract-101612259350983.html

Thousands of farmers been protesting on the outskirts of Delhi in protest against the laws introduced by the Centre in September last year. The government says the new laws will open up opportunities for farmers and reform the agriculture sector but the protesters say the laws will benefit big corporations.“Our slogan is 'kanoon wapsi nahi, to ghar wapsi nahi'. This agitation will not conclude before October, it will not end anytime soon,” Rakesh Tikait, who is the spokesperson for BKU, was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha, the umbrella organisation of over 40 Indian farmers unions leading the agitation, said earlier on Tuesday that there can be no "formal" talks with the government until "harassment" by police and administration stops and detained farmers are released. The organisation alleged that increased barricading, including digging trenches, fixing nails on roads, setting up barbed-wire fences, closing internal roads, stopping internet services and "orchestrating protests through BJP-RSS workers" are part of "attacks" being organised by the government, its police and administration against the farmers."The SKM decided in its meeting on Monday that there can be no formal talks with the government until police and administration's harassment of different kinds against the farmers' movement is immediately stopped. Though no formal proposal for talks came from the government, we clearly state that the talks will be held only after the unconditional release of farmers who are in illegal police custody,” it said.The protesting farmers and the government have held 11 rounds of negotiations over the farm laws — the last one on January 22. Farm unions have rejected the government’s offer to put the three laws in abeyance for at least one-and-a-half years. The government had offered to suspend them in its most far-reaching proposal yet in the 10th round of negotiations. But the farmers hardened their already rigid position and have said they will not budge from their demand for a complete repeal of the laws.Also read | 'Ego won't help run the country': Raut after meeting Rakesh Tikait at GhazipurThousands of farmers have been protesting at the Delhi borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, demanding a rollback of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, since November last year.The protesting farmers have expressed the apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations. The Centre, however, has said that the new laws will bring better opportunities to farmers and reform the agricultural sector.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said during an all-party meeting on last Saturday the government's offer to suspend the farm laws for 18 months was still on the table and that Union agriculture minister Narendra Tomar was just a phone call away to take the talks forward. The morcha had reacted to Modi's statement by reiterating its demand for repeal of the three laws. The protesting farmers have also declared a nationwide 'chakka jam' or road blockade on highways on February 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protests-against-farms-laws-won-t-end-anytime-soon-says-bku-s-rakesh-tikait-101612257494217.html

02-02-2021||India||Meet the tribal Halbi rappers of Chhattisgarh’s Maoist-hit Bastar||The Halbi rap song “Ram Ram Sadu” is a new sensation in Maoist-affected Bastar with around 2.5 lakh hits on YouTube (and counting).‘Boya Raja’, the rapper of this song and the resident of village Kumravan in Bastar district, is a happy teenager and hopes that one day the Halbi rap will become a ‘phenomenal identity’ of the region.The hip hop scene is flourishing in the region.“Boya in halbi means mad and Raja is King. I write about festivals and love. The aim is to encourage Halbi, which is the traditional language of tribes in this region,” said Lalit Kumar Kashyap, a tribal, famous as Boya Raja.Kashyap is a great fan of Mumbai-based rapper Emiway Bantai and dreams that one day he will rap with him in Halbi.“I have deep respect for my mother tongue Halbi and hence my aim is to make Halbi rap songs famous in the music industry. Till now, I have made only three songs, but things are going well,” said Kashyap, whose father is a marginal farmer.Halbi, also known as Bastari, is an Eastern Indo-Aryan language and is spoken by tribes across the central part of India. It is written in Devanagari and Odia script, as per experts.Kashyap, along with two of his friends, records the video and then gets it edited in studio in the nearest city of Jagdalpur.“The rap scene in Halbi started a couple of years ago. There are around six young Halbi rappers and people across seven districts of Bastar and even in Odisha love Halbi rap songs. We all have a similar goal: to make our language Halbi famous and to give our tribal culture a new platform,” said Kashyap, who is writing a new song on Maoist problems in the Bastar region.Till now most of the hip hop scene in the Bastar region is focused on love, betrayal, food and festivals.The other famous halbi rappers are Rapper Ram, Rapper Anil and others.“Initially, we focused on writing about common topics, but now we have decided to write on issues faced by our community in this Maoist-affected Bastar region,” said Suresh Kumar, a resident of Kondagaon district, one of the seven districts of Bastar region.People in Bastar believe that rapping in Halbi is a new thing and surely it will help the local language and culture in many ways.“I believe that rap songs are a very simple way of expressing emotions, rage and anger. The Halbi rappers in the region are amateurs but doing well...The people of Bastar, who mostly live in the jungles and mountains, are connecting with the outside world and this connection is also visible in the field of art. Bastaria rap songs have their own taste and in coming days there will be an art explosion internationally,” said Avinash Prasad, a filmmaker and writer, who directed the film in Halbi.Shivnarayan Pandey, alias Koyla, a local artist who is working on Halbi language since last decade said the language is spoken in many parts of Bastar region, including Gondi, Dorli and other dialects.“Halbi was a trade and state language of Bastar when kings used to rule this region. Halbi connects people and hence is popular in deep forests also. There is a history of songwriting and music in Halbi. I believe that if youth are doing it they should focus on purity. There are many words in Halbi which are extinct now and through these youths we believe that these words will come into existence again,” said Pandey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meet-the-tribal-halbi-rappers-of-chhattisgarh-s-maoist-hit-bastar-101612253955930.html

The family hid the truth for a decade and buried her with help from two people,” said Sameer Yadav, additional superintendent of police, Sehore.The girl would have turned 25 this year.The police officer said, “The girl’s father lodged a complaint at Mandi police station Sehore in 2011 that his daughter was allegedly kidnapped by an unidentified man. Later, the family recovered the girl from Bhopal but did not inform the police.”“The girl’s father told police that he had come to know that the girl was in a relationship with two different people and one of the men took her to Bhopal. The girl’s mother chided her and asked her to stay away from them. Upset over it, the girl consumed poison.

Harjeet Singh, her father, also thanked PM Modi for mentioning her daughter’s achievement in his radio programme.The PM had said that Gurleen’s experiment had shown that growing strawberries was possible in Jhansi too.Experts said the PM’s mention during the ongoing strawberry festival is now likely to help push up strawberry cultivation in Bundelkhand region.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath had virtually inaugurated the festival in Jhansi on January 17. The festival ends on February 16.Later, in a tweet, Yogi Adityanath thanked the PM for mentioning strawberry cultivation in Jhansi in his radio talk show. During his meeting, Yogi encouraged Gurleen to promote strawberry cultivation.The soil of Bundelkhand region is suited for strawberry farming as it is free of pesticides, experts said. Initially, strawberry was grown at the roof–top of a house in Jhansi and thereafter it was cultivated in a field with the help of drip irrigation.“There is a general belief that the soil of the Bundelkhand region is not suitable for such fruits. Strawberry could prove to be an additional mode of earning for farmers of the region,” said an expert.Andre Vamsi, district magistrate of Jhansi, assured all help to farmers who opt to cultivate strawberries. “Strawberry cultivation will be promoted all over Bundelkhand. Farmers of the region can benefit a lot from this fruit crop,” said Raja Bundela, vice chairman, Bundelkhand Development Board.He said the Board will also help popularise strawberry cultivation in Bundelkhand.Experts said that on 1.5 acres of land, around 10,000 kg of strawberry is grown which could be sold for ₹100 per kg.Mahabaleshwar in south-western Maharashtra is also known for strawberry cultivation. Nearly 85 per cent of the country’s strawberries are produced there.Along with strawberry, raspberry, mulberry and gooseberry are also produced there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jhansi-strawberry-cultivator-meets-yogi-adityanath-day-after-pm-praises-her-101612246739713.html

Even after getting 99 marks, they could not secure a job and there are such people in this meeting."Reddy mentioned that all government officers include officers from backward castes, who don't know any work, which has led to the state becoming 'spoiled', adding that there was an outrage among upper castes due to this matter."Today for example in our constituency, they came to us and said there is a good officer (Officer from Backward caste). I asked them if he excelled in his work to which they replied in affirmative and then he was brought here. He (Officer from Backward Caste) doesn't know a single word, I asked them that why did they bring such an officer here, their reply was that when asked to give his signature, he will sign wherever we want but if a good officer comes he will refuse to sign."Responding to Reddy's statements, Senior Telangana Congress leader and spokesperson Sravan Dasoju on Monday slammed the TRS MLA and called for filing a criminal case against him for 'racist arrogance'."Criminal case should be filed against TRS MLA Challa Dharma Reddy for his racist arrogance and derogatory comments on downtrodden sections," he tweeted.

02-02-2021||India||World Wetlands Day: The origin, purpose and theme this year||Today is World Wetlands Day, which marks the date of the adoption of the Convention on Wetlands on February 2, 1971, in the Iranian city of Ramsar on the shores of the Caspian Sea. It is one of the oldest intergovernmental accord signed by members countries to preserve the ecological character of their wetlands of international importance.According to Union environment ministry, the theme this year is "Wetland and Water". The ministry said that with the theme, the intention is to bring the focus to the availability of water and its usage.It said that only 2.5 per cent of water on earth is fresh and less than 1 per cent is usable. "Our water use has increased six-fold in the last 100 years and rises by 1 per cent each year," the environment ministry said.Natural wetlands are permanently or seasonally saturated in water and create habitats for aquatic plants. They retain large volumes of water and their slow release makes them important for combating extreme weather conditions like floods and droughts. Termed 'kidneys of landscape', wetlands contribute to water purification, water regulation, biodiversity, aesthetics and recreation, according to the United Nations.India has maximum wetlands in South Asia - 7.7 lakh - covering the country’s 4.6 per cent geographical area, according to a report of NGO Wetland International. The number of wetlands in India is only next to Japan and China in Asia.Last year, Ramsar declared 10 more wetland sites from India as sites of international importance.According to environment ministry, 35 per cent of wetlands have disappeared since the 1970s and 87 per cent have been lost since the 1700s. Causes of wetland loss are drainage and infilling for agriculture and construction, pollution, overexploitation of resources (like overfishing), invasive species and climate change.It has asked state governments and other agencies involved to ensure that wetlands are preserved as the future of many species depend on the health of these regions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/world-wetlands-day-the-origin-purpose-and-theme-this-year-101612239233865.html

02-02-2021||India||After two days of peace, Opposition fireworks to return in Parliament||After two peaceful days of proceedings, fireworks over farm protests will dominate the third day of the Budget Session of Parliament as both Houses start debate on the President’s speech. The Congress and other Opposition parties have decided to join two key debates on the President’s speech and the Union Budget after launching protests over three farm laws inside and outside Parliament, according to people aware of the developments.The Opposition leaders indicated that protests and frequent disruptions will be a part of their strategy in the discussion on the President’s speech on Tuesday.Opposition parties such as the Congress, Trinamool Congress and Left outfits have prepared to push an adjournment motion on the farm issue in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. Also read | What Union Budget means for your moneyOne Opposition leader, however, added, that they might allow the Question Hour to run in the Rajya Sabha as they had been demanding it after it was dropped in the last session.In Lok Sabha, the second question listed for the Question Hour is related to minimum support price for the farmers -- potential ammunition to attack the government over the farm bills. At the third and last all-party meeting on Sunday over the Budget Session, the government’s managers suggested that the Opposition parties can raise all issues related to the farm laws during the debate on the President’s speech and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, when he intervenes in the debate, would reply to them, another leader said. Among other senior ministers, defence minister Rajnath Singh is expected to speak in the debate, he added.At Sunday’s meeting, convened by Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu, six ministers and 25 leaders of various parties were present. A press statement said, “Chairman Naidu today made a fervent appeal to leaders of various parties to ensure effective functioning of the House during the ongoing Budget Session. In response, the leaders assured that there will be full participation in all the debates and discussions in the House.”The Opposition, however, plans to corner the government on the issue of the three contentious farm laws. “We will press for a separate debate on the farm issue given the gravity of the situation. But the government wants to tackle the issue in the President’s speech debate only. This might lead to another flashpoint,” another leader said, asking not to be named.Thousands of farmers have hunkered down at the Capital’s borders for more than two months to protest against the three farm laws that they say will erode their bargaining power, weaken a system of assured prices, and leave them vulnerable to exploitation by big agri businesses. The government has maintained that the laws aim to ease restrictions on farm trade by setting up free markets, allow traders to stockpile large stocks of food for future sales and lay down a framework for contract farming..Meanwhile, upcoming assembly elections are also set to find political space in the debate on the President’s speech. As per the current schedule, first-time BJP MP from West Bengal, Locket Chatterjee, will initiate the debate in Lok Sabha to send a political message to the voters of Bengal. The President’s speech to the joint session of the House, too, had prominent references about poll-bound Assam, Bengal and Kerala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-two-days-of-peace-opposition-fireworks-to-return-in-parliament-101612237600915.html

02-02-2021||India||Decade after scam, Odisha imposes penalty of ₹2056 cr for illegal mining||A decade after the mining scam rocked Odisha leading to tightening of rules governing raising and transportation of minerals, the state mining department for the first time detected a major illegality, imposing penalty of ₹2,056 crore on Sarda Mines, a merchant miner for excess mining.The joint director of mines in Joda of mines-rich Keonjhar district last week sent the notice to Sarda Mines under Section 21 (5) of The Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) (MMDR) Act, 1957, for raising 4.2 million tonnes of iron ore in excess of the limits stipulated under environmental clearance, mining plan as well as the limit set by State Pollution Control Board.The mines department in its penalty demand said the Thakurani Block-B iron mines held by Sarda Mines in Keonjhar district over an area of 947.046 hectare produced at least 7 times of the limit set up by different government agencies such as Indian Bureau of Mines, the OPCB as well as the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Climate Change for the financial year 2019-20The demand note from the joint director of mines said the excess mining happened in the month of February and March 2020. The mines department calculated the penalty taking into account the price of lump ore decided by the Indian Bureau of Mines. In February 2020, the highest price of lump ore was ₹4,691 per tonne while in March it was ₹4,835 per tonne.Also read: Twitter restores 250 accounts blocked in India for a controversial hashtag"This is the biggest ever penalty on any mining company after the mining scam broke out a decade ago," confirmed joint director of mines, Salil Behera. He, however, could not clarify how the company raised so much ore in excess of the limits set by various authorities even after many regulations were brought in after the mining scam. In 2010, the state mining department had started Integrated Mines and Minerals Management System (i3MS), a comprehensive information technology-based e-Governance initiative that provided an end-to-end tracking of minerals produced, despatched and consumed in all the 14 mining circles.Other senior mining officials did not comment on the penalty imposed. HN Singh, vice-president of Sarda Mines, said his company would challenge the order in High Court. "We don't agree with the penalty demand. There are several flaws in it," he said.After the mining scam was unearthed in Odisha in 2009, Justice MB Shah Commission of Enquiry had found that around ₹60,000 crore worth of ore was mined illegally from Keonjhar and Sundargarh between 2000 and 2010. However, in 2017, central empowered committee, that was appointed by Supreme Court to probe into illegal mining in Odisha, put the amount at ₹17,576.17 crore following which the apex court ruled that the errant companies have to pay the amount. The CEC calculated the figure for illegal extraction of 215.5 million tonnes of iron and manganese ore between 2000-01 and 2010-11.The Thakurani B iron ore mines in Joda area leased to Sarda Mines in August 1991 was a supplier of high-quality ore to the Naveen Jindal-led Jindal Steel and Power Limited plant before it was closed on March 31, 2014, due to lack of environment clearances. In January last year, the Supreme Court had allowed it to resume mining operations after directing to pay around ₹933 crore towards environmental compensation to the state government.However, in September last year, the Ministry of Environment and Forest and Climate Change asked Sarda Mines to stop operation immediately noting that its environment clearance was invalid. Sarda Mines, however, got a stay against the order from Delhi High Court and resumed its operation. Its lease over the Thakurani B mines is scheduled to end in August this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/decade-after-scam-odisha-imposes-penalty-of-rs-2056-cr-for-illegal-mining-101612209948737.html

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is sparing no effort wo win West Bengal and Puducherry, at least improve its position in Kerala and Tamil Nadu and retain power in Assam.The BJP is paying special attention to these states, especially West Bengal, the state with the third largest representation in the Lok Sabha with 42 seats. ‘’Faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark,’’ Sitharaman quoted from Tagore to emphasize how India is well poised to be a land of promise and hope in a world that is battling to end the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.And for good measure, she also quoted Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar: “A king/ruler is the one who creates and acquires wealth, protects and distributes it for common good.”. .Among the projects she unveiled for the poll-bound states were 675 km of highways in West Bengal worth Rs25,000 crore; more than 1,300 kms of highways valued at Rs. 34,000 crore in Assam, where work is already in progress on roads worth Rs19,000 crore; and 1,100 km of highways in Kerala with an investment of Rs. 65,000 crore . Her budget also proposed ₹1,000 crores for the welfare of tea workers, especially women and their children, in Assam and West Bengal—a major social issue that has wider political ramifications in the BJP’s citadel in north Bengal and Assam. “We will undertake future dedicated freight corridor projects namely East-Coast Corridor from Kharagpur to Vijayawada, East-West Corridor from Bhusaval to Kharagpur to Dankuni and North-South corridor from Itarsi to Vijayawada. Detailed Project Reports will be undertaken in the first phase.” Kharagpur and Dankuni are key towns in West Bengal. Two more road projects running through the poll-bound states also found a mention in the budget speech. Sitharaman announced that Bengaluru–Chennai and Chennai–Salem expressways will be contracted out soon and construction work on them would start in FY21-22. These projects will not only fill critical gaps in connectivity in these states but also generate jobs for locals. The long list of infrastructure projects also includes Central counterpart funding for 11.5 kms in the second phase of the Kochi Metro Railway, 118.9 km in Phase-II of the Chennai Metro Railway and similar projects in Bengaluru and Nagpur. The finance minister also announced plans for fishing harbours in Kochi, Chennai and Bengal’s Petuaghat apart from Andhra Pradesh’s Visakhapatnam and Odisha’s Paradip. “We will also develop inland fishing harbours and fish-landing centres along the banks of rivers and waterways,” the minister said. The BJP was able to open its account in Kerala in the last assembly polls. It has three MLAs in Bengal but in the 2019 national elections, the party won 18 seats in the Lok Sabha, ts best tally ever in the largest eastern state. The BJP doesn’t have any seat in Tamil Nadu, but hopes to be part of a key alliance with the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam.“As expected, the FM has paid special attention to election-bound states. She announced large capital outlays for Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Assam. People are not fools: they know that the proposals are only outlays and the actual expenditure will happen only after the schemes are approved,” former finance minister P Chidambaram said..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/highways-to-welfare-funds-4-poll-bound-states-get-infra-boost-101612206211416.html
02-02-2021||India||Will the Budget alleviate distress?||India imposed one of the most stringent lockdowns in the world to prevent the spread of Covid-19 infections. The Economic Survey justified this by arguing that it prevented up to 3.7 million Covid-19 cases, but the strategy also caused a massive disruption to economic activity, affecting incomes and employment of those at the bottom of the pyramid. In response, several economists, including Raghuram Rajan, the former RBI governor and Abhijit Banerjee, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics in 2019, argued for putting more money in the hands of the poor to compensate for this disruption. The government did that in 2020-21. It enhanced allocation under key welfare programmes such as the MGNREGS , provided additional food grains to the poorest at subsidised rates, and made direct cash transfers to over 400 million people. These measures have been withdrawn in the 2021-22 Budget, which has focused more on boosting capital spending and growth rather than welfare spending. In short, the government is hoping that growth will address the issue. Budgetary numbers show this clearly. The 2021-22 (BE) allocation for MGNREGS is ₹73,000 crore, compared to an allocation of ₹1.12 lakh crore in the 2020-21 Revised Estimates (RE). This seems to be a cut in real terms even from the 2019-20 allocation of ₹71,687 crore. Similarly, allocation for National Social Assistance Programme, which was increased to ₹42,617 crore in 2020-21 (RE) from the 2020-21 BE allocation of ₹9,197 crore has been brought down to ₹9,200 crore in the 2021-22 BE numbers. PM-KISAN, this government’s flagship scheme for boosting farm incomes actually saw a decline even during the pandemic. Against a 2020-21 BE allocation of ₹75,000 crore, the RE number for 2020-21 is ₹65,000 crore, which is also the allocation for 2021-22 BE. The government spent ₹3.4 lakh crore in food subsidy payments to the Food Corporation of India in 2020-21 according to the RE numbers. These cannot be compared with the 2020-21 BE numbers, because the government has rightly discontinued the practice of treating this spending as an off-budget item. However, this too has been brought down to ₹2 lakh crore in the 2021-22 BE allocation. An analysis of spending on important pro-poor heads such as agriculture, social welfare, housing for poor (Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna) have also seen a decline in 2021-22 BE allocations compared to 2020-21 RE numbers. The macro takeaway from these statistics is clear. While the government did spend more than what the last budget allocated to this heads, it has decided against continuing its distress relief push in the next fiscal year as things return to normal. Instead, the spending push has been reoriented towards capital spending, by which the government hopes to boost growth in days to come. This clearly suggests that the government is pinning its hopes on the ongoing economic recovery to take care of those at the bottom of the pyramid. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman explained this in an interview. “The balance (between welfare and capital spending) is expected to get reset largely by the fact that the money is going only for capital expenditure. When you create windows for capital expenditure, you’re confident that what you’re spending money on is actually asset creation,” Sitharaman said. “Therefore, the kind of money going into the hands of the people directly, without looking at what it’s going to create — it will create short-term demand, yes — but when it goes through this [asset creation] route, it also gives encouragement for sectors that will help create better roads, ports, other infrastructure facilities. Thus, it’s both a short-term and long-term impact,” she added. Not everyone is convinced. “Cutting back on welfare spending at a time when labour markets are in distress and the poor are still dealing with the loss of incomes and livelihoods, and more importantly a wage squeeze due to the pandemic, will only worsen the demand problem in the economy,” said Himanshu, associate professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University. “There is enough evidence to show that the sequential recovery in the economy was driven by profits, even as employment and wages took a hit. A reduction in welfare spending will increase the burden on the poor and erode their bargaining power in the economy, which will generate headwinds for rural demand going forward,” he added. High-frequency indicators seem to paint a mixed picture. The Purchasing Mangers’ Index (PMI) for manufacturing in January 2020 was reported at 57.7, significantly above the threshold of 50 which signifies an improvement in economic activity over the previous month. This rise in production notwithstanding, employment went down for the tenth consecutive month, although the pace of decline in employment continued to moderate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-the-budget-alleviate-distress-101612206208769.html
02-02-2021||India||Farmers, villages at heart of budget: PM||New Delhi : Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday described the Union Budget 2021-22 as “not just active but proactive” , and stressed that villages and farmers were “at its heart”.In a televised address shortly after Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the budget in Parliament, the PM said the Budget will enhance ease of living for the common man by simplifying procedure and rules and bring positive changes for individuals, investors, industry and infrastructure sector. “The budget has the vision of self-reliance and features every section of the society,” Modi said.The principles behind the budget, he said, included expansion of new opportunities for growth, opportunities for the youth, giving a new dimension to human resources, infrastructure development; and helping new sectors grow.“This budget has a special focus on strengthening the agriculture sector and boosting farmers’ income. Villages and farmers are at its heart,” he said.The PM had earlier said the Union Budget should be seen in continuation of the four to five “mini budgets”, or the over ₹20 lakh crore economic packages, announced by the finance minister in 2020.At a time when a section of farmers are agitating against the recently announced farm bills that they allege are anti-farmers and will only benefit corporates, the PM offered reassurance that the budget focuses on increasing farmers’ income. He said farmers will be able to get loans easily, and the new laws will allow for the strengthening of Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMCs) with the help of the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund. Modi further said that the government, while keeping in with fiscal sustainability, stressed on increasing the budget size, and did not put pressure on the citizens.On the provisions in the budget for the development needs of southern states, the North-east states, and Ladakh, he said these aspects will play a key role particularly in turning the coastal states such as Tamil Nadu, Kerala, West Bengal into “business powerhouses”. All three states go to the polls in the first half of 2021, along with Assam and the Union territory of Puducherry.During the budget speech, the finance minister said national highway projects of 8,500km will be awarded by March 2022, and an additional 11,000km of National Highway Corridor will be completed. She announced new road and rail projects for Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and West Bengal.Referring to the government’s Covid response Modi said, it was not reactive but proactive, and that the budget, too, doesn’t have a reactive approach. “We have gone beyond active and have given a proactive budget”, he said.While the Prime Minister said the “positive early response” to the budget -- the Sensex, for example, rose 5% -- is indicative of the government giving proper attentions to its responsibility towards fiscal sustainability, while increasing the size of the budget.Opposition parties, however, slammed the budget.“Forget putting cash in the hands of people, the Modi government plans to handover India’s assets to his crony capitalist friends,” Congress MP and former party president Rahul Gandhi said.Addressing the media former finance minister and Congress leader P Chidambaram said that the budget was a “let-down” and the increase in cess on petrol and diesel were a cruel act on poor and farmers. He said it was a vengeful act against the thousands of farmers who took out the largest tractor rally in history. “It is also a cruel blow to federalism because states do not get a share in the revenue from cesses,” he said. The MSMEs were dismissed in a sentence and the intent of this government is clear - let the PSBs bleed slowly so they can all be privatised in short term he went on to add. Congress MPs Jasbir Singh Gill and Gurjeet Singh Aujla wore wearing gowns to Parliament on Monday as a mark of protest over the farm laws.The BJP’s former ally the Shiromani Akali Dal staged a walkout while the budget was being presented. SAD MP, Harsimrat Badal, who is also a former food supplies minister in the Modi Cabinet, termed it “unfortunate” that the government not thinking of the farmers sitting in protests on their doorstep on the outskirts of the Capital.Nagaur MP Hanuman Beniwal, whose Rashtriya Loktantrik Party also broke away from the National Democratic Alliance over the farm laws, also staged a walkout.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-villages-at-heart-of-budget-pm-101612206150488.html
02-02-2021||India||Long term finance and a bigger playing field for private sector to lead infra push||The Narendra Modi government has set itself a target of creating a ₹111 lakh crore National Infrastructure Pipeline by 2025. The 2021-22 budget has deployed a mix of old and new to achieve this target. This year’s budget has announced the creation of a Development Finance Institution (DFI), an idea India tried in the pre-reforms era before giving up. What is new is the unprecedented expansion in scope for private sector activity in infrastructure this budget proposes. If the ideas discussed in the budget are actually implemented, India might see more privately owned and operated roads, airports, railways, freight corridors, and ports. Both these ideas are extremely important and potentially game-changing.Let us take the idea of DFI first. Collapse of infrastructure projects, partly due to over optimistic revenue projections and partly because of courts cancelling resource allocations such as telecom spectrum and coal mines, played a big role in creating the bad loan crisis in Indian banks after the 2008 global financial crisis. While it did not help that banks, especially the government-owned ones, had poor governance mechanisms and kept evergreening stressed loans so that they would not have to make extra provisioning to meet capital adequacy norms, many experts have pointed out that banks were not the best suited institutions to lend to infrastructure projects. This was because infrastructure projects take a long time to break even, while banks deal with mostly short-term deposits.Experts call this an asset-liability mismatch. It is in this context that the discussion about recreating a DFI framework started doing the rounds. This budget has tried to tap into this sentiment. The fact that the proposed DFI will begin with a budgetary allocation of just ₹20,000 crore, suggests that the government wants to test the waters. It has set itself a modest target of building a portfolio of ₹5 lakh crore for this DFI in three years’ time.The other potential game changer in the infra sector is the focus on asset monetisation. The budget speech says that “monetizing operating public infrastructure assets is a very important financing option for new infrastructure construction” and has proposed that even existing infrastructure assets including those with National Highway Authority of India, Power Grid Corporation, freight corridors of railways, airports, and oil and gas pipelines will be a part of the asset monetisation programme. To be sure, the asset monetisation programme is being taken along with a sharp rise in capital expenditure allocation in 2021-22. The budget proposes to award contracts for construction of 8,500km of roads by March 2022, and completion of an additional 11,000km of national highway corridors. Ambitious targets have also been set in railways, waterways and urban transport infrastructure including public buses and metro rail network. The budget has also made an outlay of ₹3 lakh crore over the next five years towards reforms-based and results-linked power distribution sector scheme to address the viability crisis in power distribution companiesIt also seeks to provide a bigger playing field to foreign capital in the field of infrastructure by proposing to make amendments to relevant legislations to allow debt financing of InVITs (infrastructure investment trusts) and REITs (real estate investment trusts) by foreign portfolio investors. “The FY22 budget, by announcing the setting up a development finance institutions (DFI) with a corpus of ₹20,000 crore will go a long way in filling up the gap created by the demise of erstwhile DFIs namely Industrial Finance Corporation of India, Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India, and Industrial Development Bank of India. DFIs, unlike banks, besides bringing in the knowledge of project financing are known to have the patient capital suited for infrastructure financing. The debt financing of InVITs and REITs by foreign portfolio inflows and monetisation of operating public infrastructure assets are the right steps towards infrastructure financing,” said a note by India Ratings and Research.To be sure, some have pointed to part of the infra-push as being driven by the upcoming assembly elections in five states. “The budget announced construction of roads in states going for elections, is there any motive behind it? Why not other states? It announced road projects of 625km in West Bengal, but the state government has already constructed 88,841km of rural roads in 10 years, which has been recognised by the Government of India,” said Amit Mitra finance minister of West Bengal. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi took a dig at the government’s asset monetisation plan in a tweet criticising the Budget. “Forget putting cash in the hands of people, Modi Govt plans to handover India’s assets to his crony capitalist friends.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/long-term-finance-and-a-bigger-playing-field-for-private-sector-to-lead-infra-push-101612206150958.html
02-02-2021||India||How the fiscal math changed during and after the pandemic?||When Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the 2020-21 Union Budget last year, she announced that the Revised Estimate (RE) for the 2019-20 fiscal deficit would be 3.8% of GDP, 50 basis points higher than the Budget Estimate (BE) of 3.3%. It was seen as an undesirable development by the markets. The BSE Sensex fell by 2.4% on February 1, 2020. Sitharaman pegged the 2021-22 fiscal deficit at 3.5% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Then the pandemic struck, making budgetary calculations completely irrelevant. Not only has the fiscal deficit reached an all-time high of 9.5% of GDP in 2020-21,as per the Revised Estimates (RE) given in the 2021-22 budget, it is not expected to come down anytime soon. Sitharaman said in her budget speech on Monday that she expects the fiscal deficit to come down to 4.5% by 2025-26. In normal times, this would have created a huge uproar. But these are not normal times, and the BSE Sensex endorsed the fiscal deviation, which is crucial for growth, by rising 5% on budget day. It is useful to understand how the government’s fiscal math changed during and after the pandemic, and the assumption behind the 2021-22 Budget Estimate (BE). India’s absolute fiscal deficit almost doubled from ₹9.3 lakh crore in 2019-20 to ₹19.5 lakh crore 2020-21 (RE). When compared to the 2020-21 BE numbers, the 2020-21 RE fiscal deficit has increased by 2.3 times. To be sure, this is not the additional government spending during the pandemic. Total central government spending increased 1.3 times from ₹26.9 lakh crore in 2019-20 to ₹34.5 lakh crore in 2020-21 (RE). When compared to the BE figure of ₹30.4 lakh crore for 2020-21, the increase was 13.5%. The rest of the increase in fiscal deficit can be attributed to two factors. The first is the fall in nominal GDP in 2020-21 , a contraction of 4.4%. With the denominator going down, the fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP can increase for the same amount of absolute deficit. The other big reason for an increase in the fiscal deficit is a sharp fall in revenue collections, the biggest components of the three receipt items – revenue receipts, recovery of loans and other receipts (disinvestment). These three are subtracted from the government’s total spending to calculate the fiscal deficit. Revenue receipts, as per RE figures, fell short of the 2020-21 BE numbers by more than ₹4.6 lakh crore. Disinvestment income is expected to be just ₹32,000 crore (RE) against the BE target of ₹2.1 lakh crore. How is the fiscal math going to change in the next fiscal year? There is not much of a difference between the 2021-22 BE numbers with the 2020-21 RE numbers. The central government has retained spending at the levels seen during the pandemic. It also does not expect much of a revival in revenue receipts. The 2021-22 BE figure of ₹17.9 lakh crore is lower than the 2020-21 BE projection of ₹20.2 lakh crore. A disinvestment target of ₹1.75 lakh crore for 2021-22 (BE), when read with the ₹2.1 lakh crore target in 2020-21 (BE) and a realisation of just ₹32,000 crore (RE) means that the government will try to accomplish in the next fiscal year, what it started in 2020-21. Given the fact that the government has announced disinvestment of a general insurance company and a public sector bank — neither was on the cards earlier — this also suggests a moderation in expectations of disinvestment income. How realistic are the fiscal deficit calculations for 2021-22? The core assumption behind fiscal calculations, especially when there are no major changes in tax slabs, is the projected nominal GDP growth. Taxes, after all, are a fraction of nominal GDP. By assuming 14.4% nominal GDP growth in 2021-22, one percentage point less than what the Economic Survey said it will be, Budget 2021-22 seems to have taken a conservative approach. Finance minister Niramala Sitharaman admitted as much in an interview, saying that the finance ministry has been “reasonable... in assessing” what it can do. Most importantly, Union Budget 2021-22 has won a lot of praise for bringing a lot of off-budgetary spending back into the budget calculations. The biggest manifestation of this is the allocation for subsidy to the Food Corporation of India under the National Food Security Act from ₹77,983 crore in 2020-21 (BE) to ₹3.4 lakh crore in 2020-21 (RE) and ₹2 lakh crore in 2021-22 (BE). The higher fiscal deficit numbers, going forward, need to be seen in this context as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-the-fiscal-math-changed-during-and-after-the-pandemic-101612206089328.html
02-02-2021||India||What does the budget do to boost growth?||The 2021-22 budget, on the face of it, has given a massive fiscal boost to the economy. Fiscal deficit as a share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has gone up from the 2020-21 Budget Estimate (BE) of 3.5% to a massive 9.5% according to the Revised Estimate (RE) numbers. Fiscal deficit is expected to remain high going forward. It may only come down to 4.5% by 2025-26. Does this mean that the budget provides a massive fiscal boost to growth? A careful reading suggests a more nuanced picture. A large part of the increase in fiscal deficit is explained by lower tax collections. Gross Tax Revenue in 2021-22, as per the BE figures, is not expected to reach 2020-21 BE levels. In absolute terms, the 2021-22 fiscal deficit (BE) is expected to be lower than the 2020-21 fiscal deficit (RE) by ₹3 lakh crore. So, where will the boost to growth come from in 2021-22? The central government has pinned its hopes from public and private capital spending, and further enhancing ease of doing business. There is a direct boost to the first. Capital expenditure was increased from ₹4.12 lakh crore in 2020-21 (BE) to ₹4.39 lakh crore (RE) during the pandemic. This has been increased further to ₹5.54 lakh crore for 2021-22 (BE). This takes the share of central government capital expenditure in India’s GDP to 2.48% in 2021-22, the highest since 2015-16, the earliest period for which capital spending data is available at the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy’s (CMIE) database. In addition to the cap-ex push, the Budget also talks about incentivising state governments to take up additional investment expenditure. As far as private sector investment is concerned, the government has placed its bet on infrastructure and financial sector. In keeping with the targets laid down in the National Infrastructure Pipeline, which targets investment of ₹111 lakh crore by 2025, the Budget has announced three ways to boost infra spending: creating the institutional structure for it; focusing on monetising assets; and enhancing the share of capital expenditure in central and state budgets. The first will be taken care of by setting up a Development Finance Institution (DFI), while the second will implemented by setting up a National Monetization Pipeline which will involve toll roads, gas pipelines, airports and government owned warehouses. This, the budget speech says, will help in providing “viability to investors”. The budget has also announced the privatisation of two state-owned banks, a general insurance company, and an IPO for the Life Insurance Corporation, along with an increase in FDI limit from 49% to 74% in the insurance sector. The government clearly hopes that this will bring in fresh capital. The budget has also proposed a conciliation mechanism and mandated its use for quick resolution of contractual disputes for businesses dealing with central public sector enterprises. It has allocated ₹1.97 lakh crore to the production linked incentive (PLI) scheme to boost domestic manufacturing in 13 key sectors, so as to make companies in these an “integral part of global supply chains, possess core competence and cutting-edge technology”. The budget has also tried to boost the construction sector, a crucial source of non-farm employment by continuing to incentivise the affordable housing sector. Additional tax exemption of ₹1.5 lakh crore for affordable housing and a tax holiday for affordable housing projects have been extended by a year up to March 31, 2022. “The finance minister has presented a progressive budget, focused on achieving growth through capital investment, job creation, infrastructure and health care build out which will be part funded through disinvestment and privatisation. The finance minister has also kept direct tax rates unchanged and proposed to simplify contractual regulations and investment regulations and proposed creation of more enabling organizations”, said Bhavik Damodar, Partner, Deal Advisory, Office Managing Partner-Mumbai, KPMG in India. To be sure, the budget could also generate some headwinds to growth because of a roll back in revenue spending compared to the 2020-21 RE figures. While capital spending has seen an increase, revenue spending, especially on welfare heads such as MGNREGS and even the flagship PM-KISAN scheme has been reduced. Some experts believe that this ignores the crisis facing the poorest sections in the economy. “The proposed increased in capital expenditure is coming at the expense of non-capital expenditure, keeping aggregate spending the same. This shift is desirable in normal times, but in these times, it leaves a massive livelihoods crisis unaddressed”, said Amit Basole, an associate professor of economics at Azim Premji University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-does-the-budget-do-to-boost-growth-101612206029281.html
02-02-2021||India||Supreme Court recalls 2019 order on employee pension||The Supreme Court has recalled its 2019 order which had paved way for higher pension for employees by removing the current salary ceiling of ₹15,000.An SC bench, headed by Justice Uday U Lalit, allowed the review petitions filed by the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) and decided to reconsider the previous order that permitted grant of Provident Fund pension proportionate to the salary.The bench, which also included Justices Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat, jointly heard the EPFO’s review petition and the appeal filed by the Central government on Friday last week. The court order was released a day ago.Starting February 25, the bench will now re-examine the 2018 Kerala high court judgement, which had asked the organisation to pay full pension to retiring employees on the basis of their total salary instead of capping the amount, on which the contribution of a pensioner is calculated, at a maximum of ₹15,000 per month.The HC had then noted that some workers made more contribution voluntarily towards EPFO but their pension calculation was on the ₹15,000 salary ceiling, which was not fair on workers post their retirement.Also read: Law ministry gets allocation for purchases of EVMs by ECThe top court, however, withdrew its approval to the HC judgment after hearing Attorney General KK Venugopal and senior advocate CA Sundaram, on behalf of the Union government and the EPFO, and agreed to review the correctness of the HC judgment. The bench further took note of an argument that the Kerala HC’s judgment would lead to benefit upon employees retrospectively which, in turn, would create great imbalance.Venugopal and Sundaram further pointed out that another bench in the Kerala HC has expressed doubts over its 2018 judgment in the pension matter and the case there had also been referred to a larger bench for a re-look.On April 1, 2019, by a brief order, the Supreme Court had dismissed the EPFO’s appeal against the Kerala HC’s judgment, compelling the retirement fund body to file a review petition. At the same time, the union labour ministry also decided to file a separate appeal against the HC’s judgment to highlight that such an order will make the organisation financially unviable since there will be shortage of several thousand crores every year.Citing the pendency of the case in the Supreme Court, the Kerala HC judgment was not implemented while the labour ministry pleaded for a stay of the HC ruling.At present, an organised sector employee pays 12 per cent of his basic salary as mandatory Employee Provident Fund (EPF) contribution every month and a matching amount is contributed by the employer. Of the employer’s contribution, 8.33 per cent goes towards pension contribution but this amount is capped at ₹1,250 a month. The remaining 3.67 per cent goes to the provident fund corpus.While the EPFO gets an EPS contribution of around ₹36,000 crore per annum from over 60 million subscribers, it has over 2.3 million pensioners, who receive a pension of ₹1,000 every month. Their contribution to PF is, however, less than a quarter of it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-recalls-2019-order-on-employee-pension-101612206028694.html
02-02-2021||India||Sasikala may fight EC move on poll symbol||Expelled All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) leader VK Sasikala is likely to challenge in the Supreme Court the Election Commission’s 2017 decision of allotting the party name and the iconic two-leaves symbol to sitting Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami’s party, her lawyer announced on Monday.At the time, two factions of the AIADMK were fighting for control of the party and the poll watchdog decided in favour of the Palaniswami-led faction. Sasikala was close aide of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa.“We will file a curative petition soon,” said Sasikala’s lawyer Raja Senthoor Pandian. “We haven’t filed a case so far due to the pandemic and we had expected her to be released by August on remission. So we thought of filing it once she is out. We have to discuss.”Also read: TN poll battle heats up as Sasikala leaves hospitalOn November 23, 2017, the EC allotted Palaniswami-led faction with the ‘two leaves’ symbol after freezing it briefly when two factions – the other led by current Tamil Nadu deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam -- were vying for it following Jayalalithaa’s death in December 2016. Sasikala and her nephew TTV Dhinakaran challenged this decision in the Delhi high court, which upheld the EC order in 2019. The Supreme Court also dismissed two petitions -- in March 2019 and in July 2020.A curative petition is the last legal option in a case, and is usually filed if the petitioners believe that a legal error was committed while deciding a case. It is rare for curative petition to succeed. Tamil Nadu is scheduled to go the polls in April-May.Sasikala was hospitalised a week before her release from prison in Bengaluru on January 27 after serving a four-year jail term in a disproportionate assets case. On Sunday, she was discharged from the city’s Victoria hospital where she was treated for Covid-19. Sending out her first political message, Sasikala left the hospital in a car bearing the AIADMK flag. She is expected to return to Chennai WHEN after completing week-long quarantine in Bengaluru.AIADMK, which expelled Sasikala and Dhinakaran on September 12, 2017, have condemned her for using the flag and termed it illegal. Law minister C V Shunmugam warned of legal action against ‘Sasikala or anyone’ who is not a member of the party and ‘misusing the flag’.But Dinakaran justified her move. Dinakaran, an independent MLA, floated the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) with some of Sasikala’s supporters who want her to unite them by reclaiming the AIADMK. Palaniswami, who is the chief ministerial candidate of the AIADMK-led National Democratic Alliance, has made clear that Sasikala will not be taken back.Sasikala briefly held the reins of the party after Jayalalithaa’s death in 2016 amidst a power struggle with her loyalist-turned-rebel Paneerselvam. She handpicked Palaniswami as chief minister before surrendering in prison but he later united with Paneerselvam. After ousting her, AIADMK created new posts with Paneerselvam as coordinator and Palaniswami as joint coordinator and Jayalalithaa as the ‘eternal general secretary’.Sasikala challenged this decision and the matter is pending before the Madras high court. The AIADMK expelled party functionaries who put up posters welcoming Sasikala after her release. “She may gain some supporters but the AIADMK status quo will continue,” says political analyst Ravindran Duraisamy. “The present AIADMK has contested the 2019 parliamentary elections and by-elections on the symbol and name without any hindrance. It’s a settled matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sasikala-may-fight-ec-move-on-poll-symbol-101612205068673.html
02-02-2021||India||Twitter temporarily blocks 250 handles amid farm stir||Twitter temporarily blocked in India, nearly 250 accounts that allegedly used a controversial hashtag after the central government asked the social media company to block access to the handles, in a move aimed “to prevent an escalation of violence” in the backdrop of the ongoing farmers agitation, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.The local ban was imposed in the morning. By evening, the accounts were restored and the microblogging company said the content constituted free speech and was newsworthy. At least one of the handles to be restricted said it deleted a tweet that used the controversial hashtag.“Pending our discussions with the regulatory authorities, we temporarily withheld these accounts in India under our Country Withheld Content policy in response to a valid legal request from the Ministry of electronics and information technology(MeitY),” Twitter said. “During our subsequent meetings with the officials, Twitter conveyed that the accounts and tweets in question constitute free speech and are newsworthy. Therefore, these tweets and accounts have now been un-withheld. Protecting public conversation and transparency is fundamental to the work we do at Twitter,” the company added.HT reached out to MEITY but did not get a response immediately. MeitY issued the directions under section 69 (A) of the Information Technology Act after the ministry of home affairs (MHA) stepped in, the people cited above said. “The home ministry said that the tweets could lead to an adverse law and order situation. The accounts have been withheld to prevent an escalation of violence,” a government official familiar with the matter said.The action was criticised by activists and free speech advocates who said the temporary suspension of the accounts violated constitutional rights to freedom of speech, and alleged the microblogging site had different standards of moderation and complying to government orders in different countries.Under Section 69(A) of the IT Act, the government can suspend accounts that pose a threat to public order. It wasn’t immediately clear if the owners of the blocked handles were notified in advance. Users outside India could still see tweets from them.Among the handles was that of Kisan Ekta Morcha, a farm organisation linked to the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, which is an umbrella group leading the ongoing farmers’ protest on Delhi’s borders. Action was also taken again the Twitter accounts of media outlet Caravan, Prasar Bharati CEO Shashi Shekhar, activist Hansraj Meena, former Lok Sabha MP and CPI(M) leader Mohammed Salim, and actor Sushant Singh, among others. All accounts were restored by evening.Withholding an account under Twitter’s policy restricts access to posts by the user. This is different from a suspension, as the account can be made available again and the restrictions are limited to the “specific jurisdiction that has issued the valid legal demand or where the content has been found to violate local law”. The accounts, according to the message displayed by the site, were withheld in India upon receipt of a legal demand. They are accessible outside the country.The government official cited above said MHA conveyed to MeitY last week that the “situation had the potential to spiral”. “The accounts were tweeting about an impending farmer genocide. The government can’t allow anyone to incite violence,” the official said.The blocking of Prasar Bharati CEO Shekhar’s account was likely a mistake because he drew the government’s attention to the controversial hashtag, the same official added.On January 27, the microblogging website took down at least 500 accounts for “spam and platform manipulation”, a day after violence erupted during a rally by farmers in the national capital on Republic Day.Digital rights advocacy group Internet Freedom Foundation tweeted that decision to withhold accounts was taken under the “opaque” IT Act.“Section 69A and the IT blocking rules prevent intermediaries like Twitter from disclosing any information about blocking of an account or tweet. The confidentiality requirement present under Rule 16 of the IT Blocking Rules creates a bizarre situation where citizens have the right to challenge blocking of online content, but they are unable to do so because they don’t have access to these legal orders,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-temporarily-blocks-250-handles-amid-farm-stir-101612205008568.html
