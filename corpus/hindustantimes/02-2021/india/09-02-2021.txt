We have decided to unite all farmers in the country by holding mahapanchayats in every state. We will organise such panchayats in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, and bring 40 lakh [four million] tractors to the agitation,” Tikait said while addressing a gathering at Gumthla Garhu in Haryana’s Kurukshetra.The farm leader also targeted the PM for his remarks warning the country against “aandolanjeevis” (those who live off protests), and the influence of FDI (“foreign destructive ideology”). “This government has lost its conscience. They are terming us as parjeevi (parasites) and andolanjeevi. I want to ask them whether freedom fighter Bhagat Singh was also a parjeevi for he led the andolan for the freedom of this country,” Tikait said. Addressing mediapersons later in the day, Tikait said, “Hum andolankari hai, par jumlebaaz nahi [We are agitators, not those who make false promises].”Responding to the debate on the motion of thanks on the President’s address in the Rajya Sabha on Monday, the PM said, “We are familiar with shramjivi (those who labour), and buddhijivis (intellectuals). But I see that a new group has emerged in this country... The country must be saved from these ‘andolanjeevis’…They are ‘parijeevis’ (parasites)…”At the gathering in Haryana, Tikait also urged the farmers to stay united during the agitation. “They are trying to divide us on the basis of religion, region and size of land holdings. But a farmer is a farmer and we all are united against these laws,” he said, adding that the agitation will go on till October 2 and beyond if required. “This movement needs your support and you have to ensure that one member of every family stays on the Delhi borders so that one day we can return from Delhi with dignity,” he said. Thousands of farmers have been camping at Delhi’s borders since November last year, seeking a repeal of the new farm laws, which they say will erode their bargaining power, weaken a system of assured prices, and leave them vulnerable to exploitation by big agri businesses. The government has maintained that the laws aim to ease restrictions on farm trade by setting up free markets, allow traders to stockpile large stocks of food for future sales and lay down a framework for contract farming.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-hold-mahapanchayats-across-the-country-says-tikait-in-haryana-101612895037534.html
09-02-2021||India||Bengal BJP MLAs offered state security day after meeting Mamata Banerjee||Sunil Singh and Biswajit Das, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislators who met chief minister Mamata Banerjee in her chamber at the state assembly on Monday afternoon, sparking speculations of their return to the old party, made news again on Tuesday when the government offered them personal security cover.Though no Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader or government official commented on the development, Singh and Das, who represent Noapara and Bongaon North constituencies of North 24 Parganas district respectively, said police personnel went to their residences on Tuesday morning but they refused the security cover.Singh is the brother-in-law of Arjun Singh, the BJP’s heavyweight Lok Sabha member from Barrackpore, who left the TMC prior to the Lok Sabha polls and wrested the seat by defeating the ruling party’s then sitting MP Dinesh Trivedi.“Two policemen from Noapara police station came to me and said they had been sent to provide security. I sent them back. Central paramilitary forces are already deployed for me. Why should I need state police personnel?” said Sunil Singh.Dismissing the speculations, he said, “I am very much in the BJP. Has any TMC leader said on record that I am returning to their party? We met the chief minister and had talks on some ongoing projects.”Das gave a similar reaction. “I do not need security from the state government. People are reading too much into our meeting with the chief minister,” he said.With turncoats from TMC boosting the BJP ahead of the assembly election in April-May, Banerjee’s meeting with the legislators made news.Singh and Das were welcomed into the BJP at the party’s headquarters in Delhi in June 2019, a month after the BJP set a record by winning 18 of Bengal’s 42 Lok Sabha seats.Banerjee went to the assembly to attend the budget session. Das was seen touching her feet to seek her blessings. Urban development minister Firhad Hakim and food and supplies minister Jyoti Priyo Mullick were present during the 20-minute meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-bjp-mlas-offered-state-security-day-after-meeting-mamata-banerjee-101612892905215.html
09-02-2021||India||Unease in AIADMK as Sasikala returns to Tamil Nadu||There is unease in AIADMK as VK Sasikala returned to Chennai from Bengaluru after a 23-hour road-show early on Tuesday morning amid some party leaders saying that keeping her out could be detrimental for party prospects in forthcoming elections.There is also criticism within the party the way chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami and his deputy O Paneerselvam dealt with her return.“We should have just ignored her,” said a veteran AIADMK leader on condition of anonymity. “Going to the police, closing the memorial ended up giving her unnecessary attention. Our advantage is that the public has a good perception of the present regime especially after how we handled the Covid-19 crisis.”Another narrative building in the party is that public sentiment is against Sasikala. “We had celebrated you as ‘Chinamma’ (mother’s younger sister) after ‘Amma’ (how cadres addressed Jayalalithaa), but the people didn’t accept you,” said spokesperson Vaigaichelvan during a public speech in Sivaganga district on Tuesday.Also read: Xi Jinping was testing Biden admin. The answer is 2 American aircraft carriersPalaniswami on Tuesday said, “some people are plotting to split the AIADMK to help the evil force of the DMK” during his campaign at Vellore Tuesday night. “Some people are trying to split the AIADMK... TTV Dhinakaran has not been in the party for ten years. Amma had expelled him from basic membership. After her death, he announced that he’s joining the party. Then he took away our 18 MLAs and left them in the lurch. Those who believe him will be left in the middle of the road,” he said.Earlier, he had ruled out her return to the party. Some other party leaders said such open actions were important to send a clear message to people.A divided AIADMK, where unspoken tensions continue between Palaniswami-Paneerselvam, works to the advantage of the DMK (in alliance with the Congress) which has been out of power since 2011.“Sasikala isn't a charismatic leader to make an impact," said political analyst TN Gopalan. “There is a possibility she may capture the party if it's wiped out in the elections but then the bigger question would be what is left of the party if it loses?”On Tuesday, Sasikala’s nephew TTV Dhinakaran reiterated that Sasikala would continue her legal battle to reclaim the AIADMK. He said that actor Rajinikanth, who recently ditched his political entry, had enquired about Sasikala’s health to send a message that she was still relevant in Tamil Nadu. Dinakaran had floated Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) in 2018, having the support of several Sasikala sympathizers.A key question is whether the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a junior ally of AIADMK in Tamil Nadu, would negotiate for an amicable solution between the AIADMK and Dinakaran-floated AMMK.“If the AIADMK and the AMMK issue could have been resolved, it may have been smooth but they are at each other throats wasting time when we should be focusing on election preparedness,” said a BJP state leader on condition of anonymity.However, political commentator, Sriram Seshadri, said, “It’s a no loss or gain polls for the BJP so they may choose to mediate between the factions or sit it out because they can strengthen themselves even if one of the kazhagams (party) breaks down.”A lot has changed in the AIADMK since Sasikala surrendered at Bengaluru court on February 15 2017, convicted in the disproportionate assets case. While she was in prison, Palaniswami and Paneerselvam buried their rivalries and expelled Sasikala and her nephew TTV Dhinakaran.While the present AIADMK has fortified its stand to not allow Sasikala back, her political ambitions have not weaned either despite serving a four-year jail sentence and recovering from a Covid-19 infection. It was clear on Monday when she announced her willingness to enter state politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unease-in-aiadmk-as-sasikala-returns-to-tamil-nadu-101612892970378.html
09-02-2021||India||Treatment meted out to farmers should be extended to Chinese aggressors: Owaisi||Asking the government to withdraw the three farm laws, AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi (AIMIM) on Tuesday accused the Centre of treating farmers the way it should be treating China on the borders of the country.Participating in a discussion in Lok Sabha on the Motion of Thanks to the President for his address, Owaisi said the "infrastructure" that should have been created at the borders to check Chinese troops was erected at Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur borders to prevent farmers from entering Delhi.He wanted to know why Prime Minister Narendra Modi was "shying" away from taking the name of China which is responsible for the killing of Indian soldiers and constructing a village in Arunachal Pradesh.Owaisi hoped that during his reply to the debate, PM Modi will blame China for its actions against India.He said the government should rescind the three controversial farm laws and contended that Parliament was not competent to legislate on agriculture which is a state subject.He also wondered as to how the government decided to suspend the three farm laws for one-and-half years once they have been passed by Parliament.Owaisi also came down heavily on the government for not filing an appeal against the court judgement in the Babri demolition case acquitting all the accused.It is a signal to the cadre to repeat similar kinds of activities at Mathura and Kashi, he allegedReferring to the 'andolanjivi' remark of Modi, Owaisi said that he was an 'andolanjivi' as it was the right of people to protest against the policies of the government.India is a democracy and not a monarchy, he added.Hanuman Beniwal (RLP) said that he had left the NDA because of the farm laws and will not hesitate to quit Lok Sabha in support of the demands of the farmers who are protesting at the borders of Delhi.He claimed that even BJP members privately admit that they will have to face problems in the next general elections on account of the farm laws.Meenakshi Lekhi (BJP) said that there was an international conspiracy to destabilise and defame India over the farmers' protest issue.She said that protests were organised at the time of the visit of the then US President Donald Trump and now on January 26 to catch the attention of global media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/treatment-meted-out-to-farmers-should-be-extended-to-chinese-aggressors-owaisi-101612891543372.html
09-02-2021||India||S Jaishankar, Antony Blinken discuss situation in Myanmar||External affairs minister S Jaishankar and US secretary of state Antony Blinken on Tuesday discussed the situation in Myanmar following the military coup and reviewed developments across the Indo-Pacific region.These issues came up in the second phone conversation between Jaishankar and Blinken in a little more than a week. The new secretary of state made his introductory call to Jaishankar on January 29, when Blinken described India as a “preeminent US partner in the Indo-Pacific” and discussed working together in the region, including through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.“Welcomed the comprehensive discussion today with @SecBlinken. Reviewed Indo-Pacific developments and the Quad cooperation. Exchanged views on the situation in Myanmar. Look forward to remaining in touch,” Jaishankar tweeted on Tuesday night.There was no official word from either side on the conversation.A readout from the White House after a phone conversation between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Joe Biden on Monday had said the two leaders had “resolved that the rule of law and the democratic process must be upheld” in Myanmar.Shortly after Myanmar’s military ejected the elected government and assumed power for a year on February 1, Biden had said the US would review its sanction laws and take “appropriate action” against the country. He described the coup and the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi as “a direct assault on the country’s transition to democracy and the rule of law”.India has adopted a more nuanced position in view of its relations with both the military and civilian leadership of Myanmar and called for the democratic process to be upheld.During their earlier phone conversation, Jaishankar and Blinken had pledged to expand the India-US strategic partnership and to work for peace and security in the Indo-Pacific. They had also discussed efforts by both sides to fight the Covid-19 pandemic.US defence secretary Lloyd Austin has also spoken to defence minister Rajnath Singh and US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has talked to his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval, with the two sides committing themselves to enhanced cooperation on defence and security issues and in the Indo-Pacific.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/s-jaishankar-antony-blinken-discuss-situation-in-myanmar-101612892061475.html

The party has become backward oriented. Why should forwards vote for it?” asked Gyanu, who claimed that he has the support of 15 MLAs. “Many more MLAs are angry and we will decide our future course of action,” he added ominously.Criticizing the party’s decision to give new faces a chance in the cabinet he said, “The party has ignored old, experienced and dedicated leaders.” He denied that he was riled for not getting a cabinet berth. “Nobody from Magadh region has been accommodated,” he contended.The BJP leader alleged that some party leaders were presenting a wrong picture to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah. “Almost all forward caste MLAs are angry,” claimed GyanuThe Barh MLA also took a swipe at the two deputy CMs. “Lobbying is on in the party. The deputy CM’s chair has been given to a leader who doesn’t know anything. Some leaders have made the party their pocket organisation.“Only those candidates who lobby actively have been made ministers Forward classes have been ignored. Neither the regional nor the social equations have been taken into account,” said Gyanu, a Rajput.However, out of the 17 ministers sworn in on Tuesday, four are from Rajput community, two each are Muslims, Brahmins and Kushwaha while three are from EBC, two are Dalits, one is OBC and one from Kayastha.The JD (U) on the other hand, seemingly cold-shouldered the demand of other alliance partners, Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) (HAM-S) and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) of one more ministerial berth each for their respective MLAs. The HAM-S and VIP both have a strength of four MLAs each in the 243-member Bihar Assembly.BJP unit chief in Bihar Dr Sanay Jaiswal denied that there was any dissent in the party. “I was in the party office during the day. I did not see any dissent,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-now-backward-oriented-says-mla-overlooked-for-ministerial-post-in-bihar-101612889815303.html

09-02-2021||India||PM Modi's reply to motion of thanks to President's address likely in Lok Sabha tomorrow||Prime Minister Narendra Modi may reply to the motion of thanks to the President's address in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday. According to the list of business uploaded on the Lok Sabha website, there will be no Question Hour tomorrow.News agency ANI reported that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has issued three-line whip to all its MPs for Wednesday, asking them to be present in the House throughout the day to support government's stand.Lok Sabha has been witnessing repeated disruptions in the first part of the budget session over the opposition's demand for discussion on contentious farm laws. Farmers have been protesting near Delhi since November 26 last year, demanding withdrawal of the three laws.The discussion on President's motion of thanks was taken up by the Lok Sabha on Monday.PM Modi had delivered his reply to the President's address in the Rajya Sabha on Monday where he quoted his predecessor Manmohan Singh on the need for reforms in the farm sector and also cautioned the nation about a new form of "FDI" which he referred to as "foreign destructive ideology" after international attention on the protest."I am quoting former PM Manmohan Singh ji as the opposition may not listen to me but may listen to what Manmohan Singh ji has said. 'There are other rigidities because of marketing regime set up in the 1930s which prevent our farmers from selling their produce where they get the highest rate of return. It is our intention to remove all those handicaps which come in the way of India realising its vast potential as one large common market,' Manmohan Singh had said. But now there is clear U-turn of the Congress," the Prime Minister had said.PM Modi also sought to allay the fears of the protesting farmers over minimum support price (MSP). "The system will always be there, as it is and has been in the past. We should not spread misinformation about this."The protesting farmers say that the laws will take away the MSP arrangement, putting them at the mercy of big corporate house.The Centre has said that these laws are historic and urged the farmers to not listen to misinformation being spread. Eleven rounds of talks have taken place so far, but no resolution has come out. The government has again invited the farmers for talks, which they have agreed to.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-s-reply-to-president-s-address-may-take-place-in-ls-tomorrow-101612887658595.html
09-02-2021||India||Govt looking to double farmers' income by 2022, says Agriculture Minister||The government has been pursuing the target of doubling farmers' income by 2022 and several interventions taken are showing a "positive impact", Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar told Parliament on Tuesday.In 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government had set a highly ambitious target of doubling farmers incomes by 2022. An inter-ministerial committee on "Doubling of Farmers' Income" was set up in April 2016 to recommend strategies to achieve this goal.In a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha, Tomar said the committee submitted its report in September 2018. After acceptance of the panel's recommendations, the government has set up an 'Empowered Body' to review and monitor the progress.Responding to a query whether the target fixed for the year 2022 can be achieved at the present annual growth, the minister said, "The government has been pursuing the target of doubling farmers' income."He said the implementation of various recommendations of the committee and comprehensive interventions of the government are "having a positive impact on growth of agriculture and income of farmers".The government has adopted several developmental programmes, schemes, reforms and policies that focus on higher incomes for the farmers, the minister said responding to a separate query on the same topic.All these policies and programmes are being supported by higher budgetary allocations, non-budgetary financial resources by way of creating corpus funds, and supplementary income transfers under PM-KISAN.The latest major intervention includes the 'Atma Nirbhar Bharat- Agriculture package' which includes comprehensive market reforms and creation of 'Agricultural Infrastructure Fund' worth ₹1 lakh crore.The minister was also asked about state-wise details of the income/wages earned per year by farmers from the base year till date and the annual growth percentage required to achieve the targets fixed for the year 2022. He replied that the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) during its 70th round had conducted 'Situation Assessment Survey (SAS) of Agricultural Households' in rural areas in the crop year 2012-13 (July-June)."There has been no further assessment of the farmers' income thereafter," he said.As per the NSO survey results, the average monthly income per agricultural household from all sources was estimated to be ₹6,426, he added.The minister also mentioned that the committee on doubling farmers' income recommended seven sources of income growth.These include improvement in crop productivity; improvement in livestock productivity; resource use efficiency or savings in the cost of production; and increase in the cropping intensity. Diversification towards high value crops, improvement in real prices received by farmers, and shift from farm to non-farm occupations are also included, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-looking-to-double-farmers-income-by-2022-says-agriculture-minister-101612887140200.html

It is an optional programme in any case. Secondly, the first time Centre sent the Covishield vaccine, which was absolutely fine but subsequently it sent some Covaxin along with Covishield after which I sent a letter opposing it but the Centre again sent another installment of Covaxin. Hence I sent a letter again a few days ago,” the minister said.Claiming that the government is not in position to tell the people of Chhattisgarh to use the vaccine because the trials have not been completed yet, Singhdeo said , “Covaxin is not being given freely and given only after each individual fills a form .. When you are taking Covishield vaccine the government has not prescribed any form to be filled. This clearly indicates that phase three trials are not complete.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-send-covaxin-till-trials-are-complete-chhattisgarh-minister-tells-centre-101612886752969.html
09-02-2021||India||TMC is mother of corruption, prepare to atone, JP Nadda tells Mamata Banerjee||Flagging off two more rath yatras or roadshows rechristened Parivartan Yatra (journey for change) in poll-bound West Bengal on Tuesday, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) national president J P Nadda launched another scathing attack on chief minister Mamata Banerjee, accusing her of insulting the state’s rich culture and presiding over corruption.“The culture once nurtured by icons such as Rabindranath Tagore, Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay and Shyama Prasad Mookerjee can be revived only after you (Banerjee) are ousted,” Nadda said at a rally at Lalgarh, an erstwhile Maoist stronghold in Jhargram district, where he launched a roadshow.In the afternoon, Nadda flagged off the day’s first roadshow in Birbhum district after offering prayers at Tarapith temple, one of the most popular destinations among Hindu pilgrims.With these, the BJP launched three roadshows since February 6. Two more have been planned. The roadshows will cover Bengal’s 294 assembly constituencies. The BJP insists that it will win at least 200 seats in the assembly polls due in April-May.Though the roadshows Nadda flagged off on Tuesday started without any hitch, the first one he launched in Nadia district on February 6 was stopped for the second consecutive day in the adjoining Murshidabad district.On Tuesday morning, BJP leaders had to alter plans for the roadshow in Murshidabad because of the chief minister’s election rally. She started her tour of Murshidabad, Malda, North Dinajpur and East Burdwan, the districts having the highest Muslim populations in the state.Police stopped the roadshow’s main vehicle, referred to as the rath (chariot) in Berhampore soon after it rolled out from the Madhupur area. The administration allowed it only after imposing conditions.On Monday, BJP workers held a demonstration for almost two hours in Murshidabad’s Beldanga after the police stopped the roadshow saying there could be unrest if it passed through Beldanga, Nowda and Hariharpara where the Muslims are in majority.Nadda sharpened the poll rhetoric at his rallies in Birbhum and Jhargram, accusing Banerjee of indulging in appeasement. “She stops processions during Saraswati Puja and Durga Puja but allows the same during Muharram. Curfew is ordered in Bengal when the foundation stone of the Ram Mandir is laid. This is appeasement,” Nadda said in Jhargram.Alleging that Bengal was worse than other states in crimes such as rape, human trafficking, acid attack, attempted murder and domestic violence, Nadda said, “Rising crime, theft of calamity relief fund sent by the Centre, corruption et al prove that Mamata Banerjee has insulted the culture of Bengal. The Trinamool Congress (TMC) is the mother of corruption and you are the party’s leader. Come to your senses and prepare for atonement.”Nadda’s plane landed in the morning at Andal airport in West Burdwan district from where he took a chopper to Birbhum district and later to Jhargram.TMC’s top leaders did not comment on Nadda’s speeches. However, the ruling party’s Birbhum district unit president Anubrata Mondal, whose cryptic slogan “khela hobe” (let’s play) has become popular across Bengal, said, “The crowd was thin at Nadda’s rally because we have played well. There will be more play in the coming days,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-is-mother-of-corruption-prepare-to-atone-jp-nadda-tells-mamata-banerjee-101612885443940.html

The two sides also “agreed to continue their engagement on key issues” on the Security Council’s agenda, the statement added.India began a two-year stint as a non-permanent member of the Security Council earlier this month.Also read: Rescuers race against time to save 37 men trapped in tunnel in Chamoli’s TapovanLast year, the Indian side listed an effective response to global terrorism, reforming the multilateral system, a comprehensive approach to international peace and security, and promoting technology with a human touch among its priorities for its stint in the Security Council.Prakash Gupta, joint secretary (UNP and summits) in the external affairs ministry, led the Indian delegation that included officials from the East Asia and UN economic and social divisions, the permanent mission of India in New York and the embassy in Beijing.The Chinese delegation was led by Yang Tao, director-general of the department of international organisations in China’s foreign ministry.Since the standoff in Ladakh sector of the LAC emerged in the open in May last year, the main interactions between the two countries have been meetings of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs and senior military commanders that focused on taking forward disengagement and de-escalation along the disputed border.External affairs minister S Jaishankar and defence minister Rajnath Singh met their Chinese counterparts on the margins of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meetings in Moscow last September. The Special Representatives on the border issue have also held consultations, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping have participated in several virtual meetings of multilateral organisations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-hold-consultations-on-agenda-of-un-security-council-101612884189992.html

As part of their decision, the Congress would start a one-month long recruitment drive throughout the state at the earliest."We have decided to recruit 100 people from total 60 Assembly constituencies each and 1,000 people from two Lok Sabha seats each for our party's social media cell.

09-02-2021||India||Rescuers race against time to save 37 men trapped in tunnel in Chamoli’s Tapovan||Rescuers on Tuesday used excavators to remove slush, drones to gauge the situation inside and rappelled inside a tunnel at NTPC's hydroelectric plant in Tapovan in Uttarakhand where at least 37 men are trapped since Sunday morning, but failed to reach any of them.There was no contact with the trapped men till the evening amid fears that time could be running out. The 37 men include engineers and casual labourers who were working inside the tunnel when a glacier burst and triggered a flash food."We have been able to clear about 110 metres of the slush from the tunnel, but we may have not covered even half of the distance. The drones didn't help much. We can't say how long the rescue operation will go on," said Benudhar Nayak, commandant of the ITBP's First Battalion, who is overseeing the operations along with teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and the Indian Army.According to a map available with the authorities, the 37 trapped men were stranded around a point in the 1.7-km long main tunnel where it is joined by a 240-metre long subsidiary tunnel. Rescuers, who are currently trying to enter through the subsidiary tunnel will have to first make their way through 240 metres then probably some more on either sides of the main tunnel before they can find the trapped men.At the other end of the tunnel, the ITBP on Sunday evening successfully rescued 12 men who were trapped for seven hours.Rescuers have learnt that a bulldozer and two multi-utility vehicles (MUVs) too are trapped around the 37 men.Officers saw a silver lining in this information. "We see that as good news. The vehicles could possibly have stopped slush from drowning the trapped men. They could also have served as a safe space for them," said Major General Rajiv Chhibber, one of the officers overseeing the rescue operations.At the other end of the same tunnel, an excavator available with the 12 trapped men -- who were eventually rescued -- served them well.Rescuers said that removing each scoop of slush from inside the tunnel was a time consuming task. "Only one vehicle is able to go in. When it returns to dump the slush, much of it falls along the way. Each round takes several minutes," said Jagdish Uniyal, an ITBP officer.The slush along the route has also made it difficult for rescuers to walk. General Chhibber said that rescuers were using wooden planks to negate this hurdle.Rescuers even tried to rappel into the tunnel by fixing hooks to the roof, but they were unable to make much progress. "We tried to push in our men, but there isn't enough working space inside. Also, as we go deeper, we are facing a barrage of slush and debris hurtling towards us," said an army lieutenant colonel who did not wish to be namedWhile officers weren't able to give a likely timeframe in which the trapped men could be accessed, the families of those trapped continued to wait in hope despite no immediate breakthrough in sight. "I couldn't bear the cold at night. I don't know how my brother will survive inside. I am just hoping he has found a space inside one of the vehicles stranded inside," said Sunil Pal, whose brother Amit Pal is among those sti inside the tunnel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rescuers-race-against-time-to-save-37-men-trapped-in-tunnel-in-chamoli-s-tapovan-101612883293456.html

The reference to the place I sat is a window and anyone can sit there," Shah said.Shah said that "a former president of the country, (another former President) Pranab Mukherjee, (former Prime Minister) Rajiv Gandhi...and even I sat there (window)"."And when Bangladesh's Prime Minister paid a visit, she also sat at the same place and penned her comments," Shah said.Chowdhury had on Monday claimed in the House that Shah during his visit to Shantiniketan sat on Tagore's chair.Shah said before speaking in the House, members should ascertain the facts."It hurts the dignity of the House if something lifted from the social media is stated here," he said, adding the member who made the remarks committed the mistake due to the background of his party."I did not sit there. But Jawaharlal Nehru sat on the same seat where Tagore used to sit. This is on record and the second photograph is of Rajiv Gandhi who is sitting on Tagore's sofa having tea," Shah said with photographs to support his rebuttal.Shah also rejected certain claims made by Chowdhury against BJP president J P Nadda. He said since Nadda is not a member of the House, he should not have been named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-didn-t-sit-there-shah-clarifies-in-lok-sabha-on-tagore-s-seat-row-101612882181826.html

The maximum increase was witnessed in Laokhowa-Burhachapori Wildlife Sanctuary where the number of birds increased from 9244 to 71902,” said a KNPTR release.The rise in the number of birds visiting Kaziranga has been attributed to improved habitat management and water conservation measures carried out by the KNPTR authority.A total of 36 birders were involved in the exercise which had the objectives to record and estimate waterfowl and winter migratory birds and to monitor and assess the health of wetlands.The highest number of species (26) was found from family Anatidae, which form the family of ducks and geese. The top three species counted by number are Eurasian Coot (50,432), Bar-headed Geese (7860) and Common Teal (4667).Of the 112 waterfowl species found in Kaizranga, 58 are migratory species visiting the area from different parts of the world including Europe, Central Asia and East Asia.On a negative note, the area under wetlands (beels) in the KNPTR has reduced from 8.5% of the total area to 6.7% from 1967 to 1997. The third waterfowl census carried out last week found siltation, erosion, fragmentation of 'beels' and presence of invasive species in the wetlands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/175-rise-in-waterfowls-in-kaziranga-national-park-in-new-census-101612881476788.html

09-02-2021||India||Astronauts on Gaganyaan mission to carry biryani, khichdi, pickle||When India’s first crewed spaceflight, Gaganyaan, lifts off next year kicking off a new era of space exploration, the astronauts onboard will carry a selection of special foods developed by a military laboratory after experimenting with ingredients for almost two years, people familiar with the development said.The menu will offer Indian astronauts – hand-picked fighter pilots from the Indian Air Force who are undergoing training in Russia – a variety of options to suit their palate during the seven-day mission: Chicken biryani, chicken korma, shahi paneer, dal-chawal, aloo paratha, preserved chapatis, dal makhni, khichdi and beans in sauce.Even the humble mango pickle figures on the menu prepared by Mysuru-based Defence Food Research Laboratory (DFRL) that comes under the Defence Research and Development Organisation.The DFRL’s Space Food and Logistics wing, which showcased its products at Aero India-2021 held at Yelahanka air base last week, has catered to the sweet tooth too with offerings such as moong dal halwa, sooji halwa, dried apricot and a range of flavoured energy bars, the people said.“We have focused on nutrient adequacy and wholesomeness. Low fragmentation is equally critical in the zero-gravity environment. The astronauts will eat three meals a day, with the diet adding up to 2,500 calories,” said a senior scientist with the DFRL.The laboratory has prepared the menu in collaboration with the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) that is conducting the crewed mission to space. “American astronauts carry food that suits their taste. So do the Russians. We Indians like saying ‘it tastes just like home food.’ And home food is what our astronauts will carry,” said a second scientist.The foods (essentially paste products) carried by Indian astronauts will be packed in 100gm/200 packets. The contents of the food kits for the spaceflight will vary with the individual preferences of the astronauts.“The final composition of the spaceflight is not known yet but four Indian astronauts are being trained in Russia. The idea is to give them balanced meals that are lightweight, low volume and easy to consume. The packaging aspect is quite technical as liquids can’t be used,” said the first scientist.The kits carried by the astronauts will include special straws (or what the DFRL calls liquid delivery system) for drinking water and instant coffee/tea, food warmers and waste restraining bags.The pilots from the IAF are being trained at the Yuri Gagarin Research and Test Cosmonaut Training Center at Star City near Moscow. They began their training in Russia in February 2020 but some activities at the Russian facility were temporarily suspended last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Indians have made good progress in the training so far and cleared some crucial tests, as previously reported by Hindustan Times.The training programme for the Indian pilots, who were chosen from among hundreds of applicants, will conclude this year. It focuses on both basic astronaut training and issues specific to the Gaganyaan mission.The Human Space Flight Centre of ISRO and Russia’s state-run Glavkosmos signed a contract for the training programme in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/astronauts-on-gaganyaan-mission-to-carry-biryani-khichdi-pickle-101612880038344.html

Yadav said that inspite of the country achieving countless rights through agitation, those who carry on the tradition are being earmarked as "andolanjivis".“The nation attained Independence through agitation. Innumerable rights were received through agitation. Women received the right to vote through agitation. Mahatma Gandhi became the father of the nation because he agitated for Africa, the world and the nation.” Yadav said in Lok Sabha.“What is being said about the agitations? That people are 'aandolan jivi'. What should I call the people who go out to collect donations? Are they not members of 'chanda jivi sangathan'?” he further said.Yadav took on the Centre over the new farm laws asking why they are not being repealed when the farmers themselves are against it, citing the allegations of corporate houses getting powerful.“If the government says that laws are for farmers, why is it not taking it back if farmers aren't accepting it? People, for whom it has been formed, don't want it. Who is stopping the government? Are allegations that you rolled out carpet for corporates and brought these laws not right?” Yadav asked in the Lok SabhaCommenting on the Prime Minister’s words on the continuation of minimum support price (MSP) in Parliament, the SP chief said that farmers have not been getting MSP for their crops for a long time. He praised the protesting farmers for awakening all farmers across India through their agitation.“Yesterday I heard 'MSP tha, MSP hai, MSP rahega'. It's just in speech but not on ground. Farmers aren't getting it, had they been getting, they wouldn't have been sitting in Delhi. I congratulate agitating farmers that they have awakened farmers across India,” said Yadav.Yadav has also been constantly tweeting in support of the protesting farmers. He took to Twitter on Monday to criticise the PM's ‘andolanjivis’ remark saying it as an insult to the country’s martyrs and revolutionaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-nation-attained-independence-through-agitation-akhilesh-yadav-on-pm-modi-s-andolanjivi-remarks-101612879114325.html

Last month, 36 vultures had died in Dhulijan village of the same district after eating a poisoned carcass of a cow that was dumped in a padd field to target stray dogs.“Preliminary investigation suggests that a cow had been poisoned and kept in a paddy field. The vultures ate its meat and died as a result,” Atikur Rahman, divisional forest officer, Doomdooma, said.While 13 of the dead vultures are from the Himalayan Griffon species, seven are White Rumped, listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).All the vultures were buried at the spot after taking samples for tests. The forest department has filed an FIR in the local police station and investigation is underway to nab those involved in poisoning the cow's carcass.Ten sick vultures, eight Himalayan Griffons and two Slender Billed (also listed as critically endangered by IUCN) were rescued by veterinarians and are being treated at a Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) facility.“A cow had died in the village a few days back leaving a small calf, which was later killed by stray dogs. In order to target the dogs, the cow’s carcass was poisoned by the villagers. But the vultures ate its meat and died,” said Khanin Changmai, veterinarian with WTI.On January 18-19, 36 vultures had died after eating the carcass of a cow, which had died after drinking water from a pond where villagers had mixed poison for a community fishing event.In April last year, 19 vultures had died on a single day in Sivasagar district after eating a cow’s carcass. In March 2019, 39 vultures had died in the same district after eating poisoned meat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/20-vultures-die-due-to-poisoning-in-assam-second-incident-within-a-month-101612878389152.html

Hindustan Times first reported this story on February 4."Since the events at our Narasapura facility in December, we have been working hard on improvements across the board to raise standards and fix the issues. All employees have been promptly and fully paid, and we implemented new hiring and payroll systems to ensure everyone is paid correctly and provided the correct documentation going forward," Wistron said in a statement on Tuesday.The Taiwanese manufacturing giant produces Apple's iPhone-7 and iPhone-SE among other products at its plant in Narasapura.The manufacturing operations at the plant have been shut since December 12 when a protest by contract workers over non-payment of wages, unexplained salary cuts and long work hours among other reasons, took a violent turn.Videos of hundreds of people setting fire to company vehicles, damaging property and screaming profanities against Wistron flooded social media and made global headlines. The incident threatened to dent Karnataka's pro-investor friendly image and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's flagship 'make in India' campaign.At least two Karnataka government commissioned reports pointed out serious irregularities by the company and its workforce contractors who were blamed for taking a lion's share of workers wages that eventually led to the crisis."We will be delivering enhanced training programs for all workers, and have put in a place a new system for workers to get information and raise any concerns they may have, anonymously. We are looking forward to restarting our operations and welcoming back team members and we thank them for their patience and support as we worked through corrective actions," Wistron said in its statement.Apple had also suspended new businesses to Wistron after its own preliminary investigation potined to lapses and violation of its supplier code of conduct guidelines.Apple on Tuesday said that for the last eight weeks it has tried to ensure all necessary systems were in place at the Narasapura facility."A comprehensive set of corrective actions has now been completed and Wistron has restructured their recruiting team and enhanced training and support for workers," Apple said in its statement.The Cupertino, California-based company added that its employees and independent auditors will remain on site to validate that the new processes are effective."Wistron remains on probation and we will monitor their progress closely," Apple said.Senior government officials in the Karnataka industries department said that police verification of around 6000 employees was complete and updated licences had been issued to the company.The suspension of new business had given an unexpected lift to rival suppliers Foxconn and Pegatron, who are angling to capture a larger share of Apple's business orders in India as well as from other companies.The development has also come as a relief to the contract workers, as many were in hiding after Wistron made a police complaint against over 7000 people for the violence, arson and loot."I submitted all my documents 15 days ago and my verification was also done. But we are yet to receive any date of joining," said one contract worker of Wistron, requesting not to be named. The worker, who has been with the company for around six months, said that she was paid her wage dues.The worker's sibling, who was jailed for his suspected role in the violence, was not so fortunate. The father, a daily wage labourer, had to pledge his land with the court and bailed his son who claims to be innocent."I was added to a WhatsApp group and the police suspected that whoever was in that group was involved in the violence. I had gone there for my first shift and left when the violence started," said the 21-year-old contract worker."I went to work due to our problem and now I don’t even want to be part of the company," the worker added.Several others were also jailed and later let go either on bail or were let off after an investigation by the police.Though Wistron had initially pegged damages at ₹437 crore, including over ₹400 crore in stolen products, it revised the loss estimate between ₹26-52 crore after the company's share went into a free fall in the Taiwan Stock Exchange.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/apple-manufacturing-partner-wistron-may-restart-karnataka-plant-next-week-101612878249594.html
09-02-2021||India||SC dismisses plea challenging colonial era provision of sedition||The Supreme Court Tuesday dismissed a plea which challenged the Constitutional validity of colonial era provision of sedition under the Indian Penal Code, on the ground that it is being used to stifle freedom of speech and expression of citizens.A bench of Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian dismissed the plea saying that there was no cause of action and the petitioners are not the affected parties.During the brief hearing, senior advocate Anoop George Chaudhary, appearing for the petitioners who are advocates, said that this is a public interest matter and people are being charged under the provision.The bench observed that a law cannot be challenged without appropriate cause of action.“You are not facing any prosecution under the Section. What is the cause of the action? We don't have any case before us right now. We don't have any case in front of us where somebody is rotting in jail. If someone is in jail then we will consider. Dismissed”, the bench told Chaudhary.The plea filed by three advocates Aditya Ranjan, Varun Thakur, V Elanchezhiyan said that section 124-A of IPC (sedition), the provision which was used by the British against Mahatma Gandhi and Bal Gangadhar Tilak is still stifling the freedom of speech and expression in the country if they choose to express dissent against policies of the Governments in power.“It is submitted that under the continuously expanding scope of the fundamental rights, a colonial provision like section 124-A which was intended to subjugate the subjects of British crown should not be permitted to continue in a democratic republic,” the plea said.It said that a constitution bench of the top court had in 1962 upheld the validity of section 124-A of IPC in Kedar Nath Singh versus State of Bihar by reading down the provision and preferring a narrow interpretation of 'sedition' to save the provision from unconstitutionality.“However, after six decades of experience with the sedition law, it is clear that the said judgment requires reconsideration especially in the light of spate of sedition charges imposed against various persons speaking out against the governments of the day and their policies. Section 124-A has a chilling effect on any dissenting free speech and/or criticism of the government which is an essence of democracy,” it said.The plea sought declaring of section 124-A as ultra-vires of the constitution and alternatively direction to DGPs to ensure that top court's 1962 verdict is strictly followed.The lawyers in their plea submitted that the continuance of a draconian colonial provision like section 124-A in the penal code without corresponding safeguards as provided under the UAPA is “unreasonable and unwarranted”.“Neither there is any institutional responsibility on the Police in case of misuse of section 124-A of IPC nor are any procedural safeguards provided in code of Criminal Procedure unlike UAPA. Therefore, now section 124-A needs to be examined under the changed facts and circumstances and also on the anvil of ever evolving tests of necessity, proportionality and arbitrariness,” the plea said.They said that despite the interpretation of law of sedition to save it from unconstitutionality, the provision of sedition is being “grossly abused” across the geographical spectrum of this country.“Section 124-A of the Indian Penal Code instils a certain chilling effect on the general public at large inasmuch as it recognises 'sedition' as a criminal offence and the consequence of committing 'sedition' are excessive damages and penalties which are substantial punishments,” the plea said.The plea said that mere slapping of charge of sedition against a citizen endangers the right to live with dignity of the person and his family members forever.It said that the media portrays the person charged as "Deshdrohi" (anti-national) whereas the seditious activities are imputed against the Government and in Hindi it may translate into "Raj Droh" (anti-government) which is not the same as "Deshdroh" and cannot be equated.“It causes chilling effect on other citizens and prevents them from exercising their fundamental right to criticize the Government and its policies through legitimate means. Our freedom fighters were charged by the Britishers under section 124-A but they were not "anti-national". The social and political stigma attached to a person charged under section 124-A is irreparable,” the plea said.It referred to the decision of top court in decriminalising section 377 of IPC in 2018 and scrapping of section 66A of IT Act in 2015, where constitutional provisions were given a re-look.“It is, therefore, imperative and the need of the hour that a colonial provision like section 124-A which is very severe and actually being misused frequently in contravention of the law laid down by this court may be tested on the anvil of the expanding scope of fundamental rights in the twenty first century,” the plea said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-dismisses-plea-challenging-colonial-era-provision-of-sedition-101612876579412.html

There is a shortage of 76.37 MLD water for drinking purpose," the CM told reporters.He said some areas, especially Bardez taluka which comprises North Goa tourism belt, are experiencing the shortage of drinking water.When asked about the measures being undertaken to mitigate the water crisis, Sawant said engineers of PWD have been asked to prepare a micro plan."An additional 10 MLD of water would be treated and provided to residents by March 31, which includes partial commissioning of a water treatment plant at Porvorim (near Panaji). A plan is also afoot to pump out water from abandoned pits, which were earlier used to mine iron ore in the state," the chief minister said.Lobo said the tourism belt is facing the acute shortage of drinking water as new commercial establishments have come up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-government-proposes-new-measures-to-tackle-shortage-of-drinking-water-101612876532989.html
09-02-2021||India||India backs AstraZeneca Covid-19 shot despite South Africa halt||India said on Tuesday it had no concerns over the efficacy of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine despite South Africa putting it on hold, and ordered 10 million more doses of the shot for its own huge immunisation campaign.South Africa delayed use of the vaccine after researchers found it offered minimal protection against mild-to-moderate Covid-19 disease caused by the country's dominant coronavirus variant.India, with the highest number of infections after the United States, has yet to detect the South African variant and will continue to use the vaccine in an inoculation drive that has covered 6.3 million front-line workers since Jan. 16."Our vaccination programme is robust and valid, and I assure you that we are going ahead with it, not worried at the moment," Vinod Kumar Paul, a top Indian vaccine official, told a news conference."We will intensify our surveillance and we will be watching other developments in due course."The Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's biggest vaccine maker, has licenced the vaccine from AstraZeneca and Oxford University and markets it as COVISHIELD for low-and middle-income countries.India has ordered 10 million more doses of COVISHIELD on top of 11 million supplied earlier, an SII spokesman told Reuters on Tuesday. SII has agreed to sell at least 100 million doses to the government at a discounted price of 200 rupees ($2.74) each, though the government says firm orders will be staggered based on its needs, and also on vaccine shelf-life.COVISHIELD is about 72% effective, based on late-stage trials done abroad, India's drug regulator says.The country is also using the COVAXIN shot developed at home by Bharat Biotech with the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research. Bharat Biotech has supplied 5.5 million doses to the government and is selling 4.5 million more, a company spokeswoman told Reuters.The government wants to cover 300 million people by August, reaching the elderly and those with existing conditions by March.India has reported 10.85 million infections and more than 155,000 deaths - though cases have fallen sharply since September.MAKE IN INDIAPaul said Johnson & Johnson could manufacture its shot in India. He also said many more vaccines, including Russia's Sputnik V, Cadila Healthcare's ZyCov-D and a Novavax product, were in the queue."India is fortunate to have two great made-in-India vaccines, and as many as six-seven vaccines in the pipeline and perhaps many more," he said, days after Pfizer Inc pulled an application seeking emergency-use authorisation in the country.The U.S. company had declined to immediately do a small local safety study for its shot and produce it in India, unlike the other vaccine developers.New Delhi, meanwhile, is aggressively pushing the SII and Bharat Biotech vaccines abroad as part of a diplomatic campaign to recoup ground lost to China.Bharat Biotech told Reuters it could export its vaccine to Brazil and the United Arab Emirates this week, a major success for the shot approved at home for emergency use without efficacy data from a late-stage trial.The company expects results from an ongoing trial involving 25,800 participants in India only by March, though the country's drug regulator has called the vaccine safe and effective amid criticism from doctors and health experts. A study on 26 participants has found COVAXIN effective against the UK strain of the coronavirus.Bharat Biotech has also applied to conduct a Phase III trial for COVAXIN in Brazil, which plans to import 8 million doses in February and another 12 million in March.Bharat Biotech has also sought emergency use authorisation in the Philippines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-backs-astrazeneca-covid-19-shot-despite-south-africa-halt-101612876379401.html

09-02-2021||India||India has more than 10,000 glaciers but less than 30 being monitored: Experts||Sunday's disaster in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district has put spotlight on the lack of monitoring of glaciers in the Indian Himalayan region due to various challenges.Scientists from Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG) Dehradun said that 25-30 glaciers are being monitored across the country which has around 10,000-15,000 glaciers.SK Rai, senior scientist with glaciology and hydrology department with WIHG said, “Of the total 10,000-15,000 glaciers that are situated in India, intense and regular monitoring is done for maximum 25 glaciers across the Indian Himalayan Region. A minuscule percentage of total glaciers are studied but there is constant effort to increase this number.”In Uttarakhand which has approximately 1,400 glaciers, less than ten are being monitored. The glaciers being monitored in Uttarakhand by scientists from the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology include Gangotri, Chorabari, Dunagiri, Dokriyani and Pindari.Listing the challenges in studying and monitoring glaciers, Rai said that there are issues like lack of resource and good quality equipment which include proper snow kits for scientists which cost up to lakhs of rupees, automatic weather systems, good infrastructure like huts, good quality ropes; logistical issues like proper drivers and vehicles. He also said that regular permissions from departments concerned like forests or border areas for studying the glaciers are few of the major problems.“Only after meeting these challenges fulfilling departmental requirements can we visit the areas and stay for 15-20 days to collect data. Another very important reason for the lack of studies on glaciers is that our country has very less institutes where glaciology is taught. Other topics of sciences may be taught in 500 or more institutes but glaciology is taught in barely five institutes. As glaciers are the main source of fresh water, more research is needed in this field,” said Rai.Kalachand Sain, director of WIHG said that inaccessibility to the glacial regions is another important reason due to which not many studies are conducted.“All mapping of glaciers has been done through satellite data, but glaciers are all in high-altitude and inaccessible regions, so monitoring those areas automatically becomes difficult. Even if we have large manpower it is difficult to monitor them,” said Sain.The director further said that the area where the disaster took place in Chamoli district, there are 25 glaciers of which only a few are being monitored.“It is true that all glaciers are not covered and very few are being monitored. We are in touch with our scientists and departments concerned to increase the capacity, generate more knowledge about the glaciers, future consequences (if any) in down streams,” he added.Speaking on the importance of studying glaciers, geologist Navin Juyal, scientist who has retired from the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad said that glaciers are like umbilical cords for all climate processes, especially monsoon.“Glaciers are the major drivers of climate change. Any climate variability on this planet, whether it has happened in the past or happening at present, is dictated by the movement of the glaciers. The expansion and contraction of glaciers affect monsoon, hydrological changes in the river system and many other climate variabilities. Glaciers are like umbilical cords of the climate system, as everything is linked,” said Juyal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-has-more-than-10-000-glaciers-but-less-than-30-being-monitored-experts-101612874601355.html

09-02-2021||India||Scientists suggest early Indian monsoon forecasts could benefit farmers||Farmers in India should be provided with early forecasts of expected variations in the monsoon season in order to reduce crop losses, said a team of scientists.Researchers at the University of Reading and the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) led the first-ever in-depth study into how accurately ECMWF's latest long-term global weather forecasting system can predict when the summer monsoon will start, and how much rainfall it will bring.They found the model provided accurate forecasts a month in advance for the timing of the monsoon in India's major agricultural regions. Providing this information to farmers could help them prepare earlier for unexpected heavy rainfall or extended dry periods, both of which regularly destroy crops in India.Dr Amulya Chevuturi, a monsoon researcher at the University of Reading and lead author of the study said, "The Indian monsoon brings around 80 per cent of India's annual rainfall, so even small variations in the timing of its arrival can have a huge impact on agriculture. Accurately predicting these year-to-year variations is challenging, but could be the difference between prosperity or poverty for many families."Dr Chevuturi added, "The forecasting accuracy we identified in India's main agricultural regions provides a clear opportunity for this system to make a positive difference to people's lives. A month's warning of drought or deluge is a valuable time to understand the likely impact on water availability and for farmers to make provisions to reduce the threat to food supplies.""Better forecasts save lives, and this kind of in-depth global analysis is only possible when the best scientists and leading research institutes work together for the benefit of the whole planet," Dr Chevuturi noted.The Indian monsoon season starts around 1 June every year, beginning in southwest India before spreading across the whole subcontinent. Scientists looked at 36 years' worth of monsoon data to evaluate for the first time the effectiveness of the ECMWF's latest seasonal forecasting system - SEAS5 - in predicting how the Indian monsoon would differ from the long-term average.The team compared forecasts from 1 May each year from 1981-2016 with actual observations of the monsoons that followed.Their study, published in 'Climate Dynamics', found the forecasts were accurate for the large-scale processes, like temperature and winds, that drives the monsoon rainfall across India. The study also found that SEAS5 was good at predicting early or late monsoon arrival over the important agricultural regions along the river Ganges plains and the eastern and western coasts of India.It also identified deficiencies in the system that could pave the way for model improvements, potentially providing more detailed and accurate seasonal long-term monsoon forecasts.The study showed the forecasts tended to overestimate rainfall over the mountainous Western Ghats and Himalayan regions and underestimated rainfall along the plains of the river Ganges in the north of the country and its delta at the Bay of Bengal.However, the forecasts were correct for the monsoon rainfall pattern across India, making them useful for planning purposes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scientists-suggest-early-indian-monsoon-forecasts-could-benefit-farmers-101612874879530.html

I am confident of bringing the glory back to the state,” Sharmila told the reporters, after interacting with her supporters at her residence in Hyderabad.Sharmila (47), who briefly helmed the YSR Congress when her brother was in jail for 16 months after his arrest in May 2012, said the feedback she had received from her supporters was very encouraging. “Everybody felt that there is definitely a space in Telangana and scope to establish Rajanna Rayam. I will continue to interact with my followers and supporters of late YSR in all the districts of Telangana one after the other and announce my decision,” she said.Sharmila hinted at undertaking a padayatra. “We shall work out all the details in the coming days. I shall confine myself to the issues concerning Telangana,” she said.Asked whether she had the support of her brother Jagan Mohan Reddy, Sharmila said she hoped so. “He is my elder brother and I am sure he will support me in my endeavours,” she said.The ruling Telangana Rashtiya Samithi (TRS) which has an overwhelming majority of 102 lawmakers in the 119-member assembly dismissed any possible threat from a new party.Telangana food and civil supplies minister Gangula Kamalakar said there was absolutely no space for any other regional party in the state as long as the TRS was there. “The people won’t own up a political party launched by an Andhra leader,” he said.Earlier, addressing her followers from Nalgonda, Sharmila said the absence of her father was clearly visible in Telangana.“During his regime, the farmer lived the life of a king. His dream was to provide housing to every poor family, to see every poor student to go in for higher studies, access to and better medical facilities for every person in the state through Arogya Sri scheme in the state. I want all his dreams fulfilled,” she said.Stating that only she could bring back the golden period of her father, Sharmila said she had taken the first step in this direction. “You are aware of the ground realities and based on your feedback, I will make further moves,” she said.More than 3,000 people gathered at her residence and cheered her as she came out. They burst crackers and danced as she announced her political plans. Flex boards were erected at her residence welcoming YSR fans to strengthen her handsSenior YSR Congress party leader and advisor (public affairs) to Andhra Pradesh government Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy said Sharmila had chosen to launch her own party in Telangana without paying heed to the appeals of her brother Jagan Mohan Reddy.“We were aware of her plans to launch a new political party in Telangana for the last three months. Jagan tried to convince her to drop her plans, because it will ruin our relations with Telangana. But she might have thought there was a need for a party like YSR Congress in Telangana, too,” Reddy told reporters in Amaravati.He, however, denied the rumours that there were serious differences between Jagan and his sister. “There could only be different opinions between the two on launching the new party,” he said.Reddy acknowledged that Sharmila had shouldered the responsibility of the YSRC when her brother was in jail and had undertaken a padayatra but underlined that it was because of the YSRC that she got recognition.“Jagan could have given her enough opportunities in the party, but it would have led to criticism that he was encouraging family rule,” he said.Political analyst and Osmania University professor K Nageshwar said there could be a bigger force behind Sharmila’s plan to launch a new party. “I don’t think she alone can take such a big decision. There are other forces behind it definitely. It is too early to predict whether she will succeed in her attempts,” he said.Asked whether there is any space for her party in the crowded political scenario in Telangana, Nageshwar said it was too early to predict. “But one thing is certain. YSR was from Andhra Pradesh and so his family is also viewed as a Andhra family. That is precisely why YSR Congress could not succeed in expanding its footprints in Telangana. So, I doubt whether Sharmila’s party will get a different result,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagan-reddy-s-sister-sharmila-to-launch-new-party-in-telangana-101612870106639.html

The three-member committee is holding consultations with stakeholders both through the online mode and in person.In a statement, the committee said it held interactions with various agro-processing industries, associations and procurement agencies on Tuesday.Amid the agitation by farmers who are camping on Delhi's borders since November end, the Supreme Court had on January 12 stayed the implementation of the three contentious farm laws for two months and asked the committee to submit a report after consulting the stakeholders during this period.In total, 18 different stakeholder organisations participated through video conference in the detailed deliberation with the committee members, the panel said.These stakeholders included Amul, ITC, Suguna Foods, Venkateshwara Hatcheries, industry bodies CII and FICCI, as well as state-run Food Corporation of India, Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA)Among sector-specific associations, Horticulture Produce Exporters Association, Seafood Exporters Association, All India Rice Miller Association, All India Rice Exporters Association, Tractor Manufacture Association, Cotton Association of India, Fertiliser Association of India, India Pulses and Grain Association and All India Poultry Feed Manufacturer Association participated in the deliberations.Representatives of the Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA) participated in the meeting in person."All the stakeholder participants gave their detailed views and valuable suggestions on the three farm laws," the committee said in the statement.Thousands of farmers, especially from Punjab, Haryana and parts of Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Delhi's borders for over two months now seeking the repeal of the new laws introduced by the Centre last year, claiming they were pro-corporate and could weaken the mandi system.The 11 rounds of the talks between the Centre and 41 protesting farmer unions have failed to end the deadlock even though the former has offered concessions including suspension of the legislations for 18 months which the unions have rejected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-sc-appointed-panel-holds-consultations-with-agro-processing-industries-101612872711947.html

09-02-2021||India||India, Afghanistan ink deal for new dam, PM Modi calls for immediate ceasefire||Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday called for an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire in Afghanistan to end a spike in violence, as the two countries signed an agreement for building a dam to supply water to Kabul city. Modi expressed concern over a surge in violence in Afghanistan at a virtual meeting with President Ashraf Ghani, saying both countries want a region free of terrorism. Ghani sought guarantees for a stable Afghanistan and, in an apparent reference to Pakistan, said the world must ask all stakeholders to “stop giving sanctuaries and stop interfering in the affairs of their neighbours”. External affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Afghan counterpart Haneef Atmar signed the memorandum of understanding for building Lalandar or Shatoot dam, which will meet the drinking water needs of two million people in Kabul, provide irrigation water to nearby areas and rejuvenate irrigation and drainage networks. Also Read | Bomb attack on security outpost in Afghan’s Nangarhar, 1 cop killed, two injuredThe project is a sign of India’s continuing commitment to Afghanistan against the backdrop of the troubled peace process with the Taliban and a sustained wave of violence targeting officials, civil society activists and journalists in cities across the war-torn country. The agreement was signed on a day when eight people were killed in four targeted attacks in Kabul. “We are concerned by the increasing violence in Afghanistan. Innocent citizens, journalists and activists are being targeted in a cowardly manner. We have called for an immediate end to violence and we support an immediate comprehensive ceasefire. Violence and peace counteract each other and both cannot co-exist,” Modi said, speaking in Hindi. “From Badakhshan to Nimroz and from Herat to Kandahar, I want to assure all Afghan brothers and sisters that India is standing with you. On every step of your journey of patience, courage and resolve, India will stay with you. No external force can stop Afghanistan’s development or India-Afghanistan friendship,” he said. Modi said the two countries, as close neighbours and strategic partners, “want to see a region free from the problems of terrorism and extremism”, and New Delhi backs a peace process that is Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled. Ghani referred to India’s role in efforts to usher in peace in Afghanistan and said: “We are in an open moment of history, a moment of great opportunity and simultaneously and unfortunately, [of] great threat...” India, he added, has provided “principled support for the end state of a sovereign, democratic, united Afghanistan”. Regional and international consensus on guarantees for a stable and prosperous Afghanistan is essential, Ghani said. “We must ask the world to ask all stakeholders to respect the rules of sovereignty in international relations, stop giving sanctuaries and stop interfering in the affairs of their neighbours,” he said, in an apparent reference to Pakistan’s role in the region. He added, “Peace in Afghanistan is within grasp if parties and their backers in the Taliban embrace a true political solution, but Afghans will not submit to surrender. It must be understood that our heroic security forces are not defeated and neither have we lost our will or capacity for serving our people.” If Afghanistan is plunged into uncertainty, the “consequences for the region and the world will be dire”, Ghani warned. The Taliban have been blamed for the violence across Afghanistan. The group’s top leadership lives in Pakistan and a recent video featured top Taliban negotiator Abdul Ghani Baradar saying that the group makes all decisions regarding the peace process after consulting the leadership in Pakistan. Shahtoot dam is the second major dam being built by India in Afghanistan, after the Friendship Dam or Salma dam, inaugurated by Modi and Ghani in June 2016. The MoU on the dam reflects “India’s strong and long-term commitment towards the socio-economic development of Afghanistan and the enduring partnership between our two countries”, the external affairs ministry said. Pakistan has in the past opposed plans to build the dam on a tributary of the Kabul river that flows into its Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, saying the project will reduce the flow of water.India has completed more than 400 projects in all 34 provinces of Afghanistan, and its pledges totalling $3 billion make it largest donor in the region. Last year, India shipped 75,000 tonnes of wheat as aid to Afghanistan via Iran’s Chabahar port, and it supplied 500,000 doses of Covishield vaccine on Sunday. Ghani described the donation of vaccines as “an act of exceptional generosity” and thanked India for the “gift of water” that will flow from Shahtoot dam. The new reservoir will help restore the natural beauty of Kabul that “captivated the imagination of [Mughal emperor] Babur and generations of renowned poets”, he said. Both Modi and Ghani cited author Rabindranath Tagore’s short story Kabuliwala while referring to ancient ties between the two sides and the Afghan president said: “Today, on behalf of Kabuliwalas, I would like to say a great thank you to you.” Ghani said India-backed projects – including Salma dam, the Parliament building, 1,000 annual scholarships and power transmission lines – have changed the lives of people, while an air corridor with India has been extended to more than 50 countries, and the land corridor from Chabahar to Zaranj is a “symbol of great fortitude”. Modi said these projects had strengthened India-Afghanistan friendship. “The same friendship was seen during the Covid-19 epidemic. Whether it is medicines and PPEs, or the supply of made-in-India vaccines, Afghanistan’s needs have always been important to us and will remain important,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-afghanistan-ink-deal-for-new-dam-pm-modi-calls-for-immediate-ceasefire-101612870741697.html

Gandhi said in a tweet that the Singh is "helping China make a case against India"."Why is a BJP minister helping China make a case against India? He should’ve been sacked. Not sacking him means insulting every Indian Jawan," Gandhi tweeted.Why is a BJP minister helping China make a case against India?He should’ve been sacked.Not sacking him means insulting every Indian Jawan. pic.twitter.com/8NK5nCJTG4Singh, the minister of state for transport and highways and a former four-star general, had told the media in Madurai on Sunday that the border with China has never been demarcated. He also said that both countries have crossed their perceptions of the undemarcated LAC many times.“...none of you come to know how many times we have transgressed as per our perception. Chinese media does not cover it,” Singh said, according to The Hindu newspaper.“Let me assure you, if China has transgressed 10 times, we must have done it at least 50 times,” he was quoted as saying.The Chinese foreign ministry quickly jumped on to the statement and blamed India for the ongoing border conflict along the LAC in eastern Ladakh. "It is the root cause of the tension," the spokesperson of China's foreign ministry Wang Wenbin said.“This is an unwitting confession by the Indian side. For a long time, the Indian side has conducted frequent acts of trespass in the border area in an attempt to encroach on China’s territory and constantly created disputes and frictions, which is the root cause of the tensions at the China-India border,” he said.“We urge the Indian side to follow through on the consensus, agreements and treaties it reached with China, and uphold peace and stability... with concrete actions,” he added.India has repeatedly blamed China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of provoking and transgressing across the LAC.Anurag Srivastava, the spokesperson of the ministry of external affairs (MEA), had earlier spelt out the Indian government’s position on the tension and the disengagement process, saying the LAC “must be strictly respected and observed as this is the basis for peace and tranquility in the border areas”.India and China are enganed in a standoff in eastern Ladakh along the LAC, following aggressive actions by the Chinese army. The two sides have held nine rounds of commander-level talks. Twenty Indian soldiers had laid down their lives and an unspecified number of Chinese soldiers were killed during a clash in the Galwan Valley in June last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-attacks-vk-singh-for-lac-statement-says-he-should-ve-been-sacked-101612868568835.html

The government has also aggressively pushed locally-made vaccines abroad as part of a diplomatic campaign."Mostly yes," a Bharat Biotech spokeswoman told Reuters when asked if exports to the two countries could begin this week as reported by local media.The company expects results from an ongoing trial involving 25,800 participants in India only by March, though the country's drug regulator has called the vaccine safe and effective amid criticism from doctors and health experts. A study on 26 participants has found COVAXIN effective against the UK strain of the coronavirus.Bharat Biotech has also applied to conduct a Phase III trial for COVAXIN in Brazil, which plans to import 8 million doses of it in February and another 12 million in March.Bharat Biotech has also sought emergency use authorisation in the Philippines.The company has supplied 5.5 million doses to the Indian government and is selling 4.5 million more, the spokeswoman added.India has also ordered 10 million more doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from the Serum Institute of India (SII), a company spokesman told Reuters. SII is mainly manufacturing the shot for low-and middle-income countries.INDIA CAMPAIGNThe two shots have been used in what India calls the world's biggest immunisation programme to cover 300 million people by August, starting with healthcare and other workers to reach the elderly and those with existing conditions by March.SII, the world's biggest vaccine maker, had supplied 11 million doses for the inoculation drive, which has covered 6.3 million front-line workers since it began on Jan. 16."The second order is already in place, it's for 10 million doses," an SII spokesman said, adding that the figure was part of the 100 million doses the company has agreed to sell to the government for 200 rupees ($2.74) each.India's drug regulator says SII's COVISHIELD vaccine is about 72% effective.The regulator is expected to approve Russia's Sputnik V and Cadila Healthcare's ZyCov-D vaccines in the next few months.India's infections rose 9,110 in the last 24 hours to stand at 10.85 million, the world's highest tally after the United States, though they have fallen sharply from a mid-September peak of nearly 100,000.The health ministry said a daily toll of less than 100 deaths over the last four days took the total to more than 155,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-exports-of-country-s-homegrown-bharat-biotech-covid-shot-likely-this-week-101612867031275.html
09-02-2021||India||Have extended only issue-based support to BJP: Kumaraswamy||The Janata Dal (Secular), or JD(S), on Tuesday allied with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to have its leader Basavaraj Horatti elected as the chairman of Karnataka Legislative Council. JD(S) leader HD Kumaraswamy spoke to Sharan Poovanna about the development two years after he lost power to the BJP in the state, the implications of the anti-cattle slaughter legislation, and the way forward for the regional party. Edited excerpts: Why did you ally with the BJP for the chairmanship?Horatti is the senior-most MLC [member of the legislative council] and has won elections for 42 years straight. When I was chief minister, we requested the Congress to give the chairmanship to our party since they had the Speaker’s post. The Congress did not accept the request. Later, we had the same discussion with the BJP, and it agreed that Horatti should be made the chairman. He has one year left [in his tenure] and will carry out the duties efficiently.Will this alliance extend beyond the council?There is no question of any other alliance... We supported them for the deputy chairman’s post, and they backed us for the chairman. We have extended only issue-based support. We will back any government scheme or programme that benefits the people and will oppose anything that harms the state. We will continue to oppose bills that are not for the people’s benefit. This alliance is non-binding.The alliance helped the passage of the anti-cattle slaughter bill...We were not soft on this bill and opposed it from the beginning. We wanted to bring in an amendment, but Congress...protested and created a ruckus, and the deputy chairman took up the bill and passed it through a voice vote.Also Read | Kannada has been ignored: Kumaraswamy accuses ShahHow will you oppose the anti-cattle slaughter legislation now?The reasons given by the government cannot be believed. They say that the cost of maintaining one cow in a shelter is Rs17.50. Is this believable? It costs over Rs150-200 per cow per day. The promises made by the BJP that it will build more shelters and make allocations in the budget is a way for them to make money. Nothing else. This bill will have a big impact on the farming community. We will see the reactions coming in from the farming community. When a new government comes in, they can repeal this legislation.How will you justify the alliance ahead of the local and assembly by-polls?Make no mistake. It is still a triangular fight in Karnataka. We also know that Congress is our main rival where we are present and not the BJP. There is no question of an alliance for seats. We will fight on our own. But there are places where the BJP and Congress are in alliance and places where the BJP and JD(S) are in the alliance... Such local alliances have existed based on local equations.The Congress has called yours a “party of convenience”. How would you respond?Why does not this apply to Congress? When the state delivered a fractured verdict [in 2018], the Congress asked for an alliance. We did not go to them. They are a national party, who allied with a regional party for their own convenience to keep the BJP out. We also went along for our own reasons.In 2018, you said the Congress is more dangerous than the BJP. Do you still stand by this statement?I continue to endorse this view.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/have-extended-only-issue-based-support-to-bjp-kumaraswamy-101612866656672.html

About 120 metres of the tunnel entrance stretch is now clear," ITBP spokesperson Vivek Kumar Pandey said in Delhi on Tuesday.Also Watch: CM meets affected villagers, undertakes aerial surveyGiving details about the ongoing rescue operation near the tunnel, Uttarakhand Police chief Ashok Kumar said that they are taking help of technology."A Hyderabad-based team has got a remote sensing device that can detect debris up to 500 metres deep in the ground. We are using the device with the help of a chopper," said Kumar."We can't estimate exact time to remove debris as there's 90-degrees turn in the tunnel. We've asked project engineers to make alternative entry to reach through. We'll attempt this today," he added.The Director general of Police also ruled out that there is a decrease in the oxygen level. "I don't think there'll be insufficient oxygen and water as the tunnel is 2.5 kilometre long," said Kumar.The missing people include those working at NTPC's 480 MW Tapovan-Vishnugad project and the 13.2 MW Rishiganga Hydel Project and villagers whose homes nearby were washed away."93 NTPC workers are missing, 39 are still stuck in the tunnel. We're trying to reach them. We are planning to install Early Warning System as a precautionary measure against an avalanche. Financial aid of ₹20 lakh will be given to deceased's family," Union power minister RK Singh said in Delhi today.News agency PTI quoted a senior official as saying that the rescuers have not been able to make any contact with those stuck inside but are hopeful for "signs of life".The ITBP and other rescuers are carrying tall wooden planks which are being used by rescuers to wade in through the slush and will later also help create a platform to pull out the trapped people using ropes.The rescue teams are ready with dragon light sets, oxygen cylinders and stretchers to provide immediate medical help to those trapped inside.Additional heavy machines could be pressed into service to expedite the process of clearing the tonnes of debris inside the tunnel, blocking the path of rescue personnel.The teams have been working since Sunday to clear the tunnel and rescue the trapped.Relief is also being distributed by helicopters among villagers cut off due to the washing away of a bridge in the avalanche at Malari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-tapovan-tunnel-focal-point-rescuers-detect-signs-of-life-101612864309429.html

Here's a list of probables||With the tenure of Ghulam Nabi Azad in Rajya Sabha nearing an end, the Congress party is busy in deciding who is going to be the next Leader of Opposition (LoP). Azad's term is ending on February 15.According to Hindustan Times' sister publication Livehindustan, former finance minister P Chidambaram and former Railway minister Mallikarjun Khadge are the frontrunners. Khadge has held the position of LoP in the Lok Sabha and been the party's voice on many issues in the Lower House.Deputy Leader of Opposition Anand Sharma and Kapil Sibal are the other senior leaders who might be considered for the post, but they have raised voice in the past suggesting overhaul of the party and that could be an issue, Livehindustan reported.The Congress, however, is keen to bring Azad back to the Upper House. A senior party leader, who did not wish to be named, earlier told HT that Azad could be nominated from Kerala in April when three members from the state retire.Azad was elected to the Rajya Sabha from Jammu and Kashmir in 2015. But now that it has turned into a union territory, there's a possibility that Azad will have to leave his home state in order to come back to Rajya Sabha.Meanwhile, in his farewell speech on Tuesday, Azad said that he is proud to be and Indian Muslim. "I am among those fortunate people who never went to Pakistan. When I read about circumstances in Pakistan, I feel proud to be a Hindustani Muslim."Watch: ‘Proud to be a Hindustani Muslim’, says Azad"If any Muslim should feel proud in the world, it should be the Indian Muslim. Over the years, we have seen how Muslims countries from Afghanistan to Iraq getting destroyed. There are no Hindus or Christians there - they are fighting amongst themselves," he added.The 71-year-old summed up his more than four-decade-old political career in few Urdu couplets and a brief speech.Before his speech, an emotional Prime Minister Narendra Modi bid adieu to Azad, recalling his contribution to the country, the House and also his party.PM Modi also said that the person who will replace Azad as Leader of Opposition "will have difficulty matching his work because he was not only concerned about his party but also about the country and the House".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-could-replace-azad-as-leader-of-opposition-in-rs-list-of-probables-101612862440112.html

Trans fats are largely present in partially hydrogenated vegetable fats/oils, vanaspati, margarine and bakery shortenings, and can be found in baked and fried foods.Research has shown that higher intakes of industrially produced trans fatty acids are associated with increased risk of high cholesterol and heart diseases. According to 2017 estimates, every year at least 1.5 million deaths in India are due to coronary heart disease, of which nearly 5% (71,000) are due to trans fats intake.The regulation excludes trans-fatty acids from dairy, meat, fish and their products.World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2018, had also called for elimination of industrially-produced trans-fat from the food supply by 2023.“To facilitate the transition towards a Trans Fatty Acids free food supply, FSSAI is also building capacities of the industry and in this regard, recently concluded a series of webinars on trans fats. Each webinar was planned to target specific stakeholders focusing on challenges faced by them towards making a shift to trans-fat-free products and suggesting practical technological solutions through talks delivered by national and international experts,” FSSAI said.The webinars were attended by nearly 3,700 participants from the edible oil industry, food businesses, bakers, chefs, restaurateur and hoteliers, sweet and namkeen manufacturers, food analysts from food analytical laboratories and academic institutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aim-to-limit-use-of-industrial-trans-fats-by-2022-says-fssai-101612862276623.html

A Bharat Biotech spokeswoman said it was selling 4.5 million more.India's drug regulator says SII's COVISHIELD vaccine is about 72% effective, while Bharat Biotech says COVAXIN’s last-stage trial results are expected by March.The regulator is expected to approve Russia's Sputnik V and Cadila Healthcare's ZyCov-D vaccines in the next few months.India's infections rose 9,110 in the last 24 hours to stand at 10.85 million, the world's highest tally after the United States, though they have fallen sharply from a mid-September peak of nearly 100,000.The health ministry said a daily toll of less than 100 deaths over the last four days took the total to more than 155,000.

It has pointed out that Christians are in majority in Mizoram, Meghalaya, and Nagaland and there is a significant Christian population in Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Kerala, Manipur, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal, but they are treated as a minority community.Likewise, Sikhs are in majority in Punjab and there is a significant Sikh population in Delhi, Chandigarh and Haryana, but they are treated as a minority community, it said. Muslims are a majority in Lakshadweep (96.20 per cent), Jammu and Kashmir (68.30 per cent) and there is a significant representation of the community in Assam (34.20 per cent), West Bengal (27.5 per cent), Kerala (26.60 per cent), Uttar Pradesh (19.30 per cent) and Bihar (18 per cent).However, they are enjoying the minority status and communities, which are real minorities, are not getting their legitimate share, jeopardising their basic rights guaranteed under Articles 14, 15, 19 and 21 of the Constitution, the petition has said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-issues-notice-to-centre-on-transfer-plea-seeking-minority-status-for-hindus-in-6-states-and-2-uts-101612860307008.html

The worst disaster to hit the region in eight years struck when a glacier breach under the Nanda Devi, the country’s second-highest peak, sent a torrent of water, rock, and dust down a valley into the Rishiganga river, where workers were building a dam.Officials said earlier on Monday night, 26 bodies were recovered. Out of 206 missing persons, mostly workers from two dam projects sites, about 175 remain untraceable.Also Read | Central agencies and state monitoring situation in Uttarakhand: Amit ShahPraveen Alok, an SDRF spokesman, said, “Till Tuesday noon, 31 bodies were recovered including five from the river on Tuesday morning.

They include 173 workers from the dam sites, mostly from Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, 12 villagers, and two policemen.On Tuesday, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat visited the 13 villages and also met the injured in the army hospital in Joshimath near the disaster site.The government is providing ration packets and other relief material to 2,500 people of these villages by air.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-glacier-burst-31-bodies-recovered-175-still-missing-101612860179536.html
09-02-2021||India||Bihar CM Nitish Kumar expands Cabinet, 17 new ministers inducted today||Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar expanded his Cabinet on Tuesday ahead of the Budget session with the induction of 17 new ministers. This takes the total number of ministers in the state Cabinet to 30, with six more berths remaining vacant. Governor Phagu Chouhan administered the oath of office to the new ministers – nine from the BJP and eight from the JD(U) – at a function at the Raj Bhavan. Former Union minister and national spokesperson of the BJP Shahnawaz Hussain, who was recently elected to the legislative council, was the first to take oath. He was followed by JD(U)’s Shravan Kumar and Madan Sahni. Apart from the chief minister, others gracing the occasion included deputy CMs Tar Kishore Prasad and Renu Devi, Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha, legislative council chairman Avadhesh Narayan Singh, and Rajya Sabha member Sushil Kumar Modi. Leader of the Opposition Tejaswhi Prasad Yadav could not make it as he is reportedly in Delhi. What is significant about the expansion is that several new faces, especially from the BJP, have found their way in the Cabinet. Leaders like Prem Kumar and Nand Kishore Yadav, who were part of all previous NDA governments, have not found a place this time, while Sushil Kumar Modi has been sent to the Rajya Sabha. From the last Cabinet, BJP has retained only two ministers this time – Mangal Pandey and Pramod Kumar. On the other hand, JD(U) has retained several old guards. Also Read | Bihar CM Nitish Kumar appeals to firm to complete PMCH facility within 5 yearsJD(U) has accommodated two new faces, Sumit Singh, who won from Chakai as an independent candidate and extended support, and Jama Khan, who won on the BSP ticket from Chainpur but recently joined the party. Khan is the lone Muslim face from the JD(U) in the Cabinet, while Singh is the youngest. The party has also given an opportunity to first-time MLAs --former DG Sunil Kumar and Jayant Raj. Bihar BJP president Sanjay Jaiswal said the Cabinet expansion was done with a view to give pace to Bihar’s development, in keeping with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s expectations and plans for the eastern region. “Talent has been given preference and social and regional balance have been kept in mind. Generational change is quite natural,” he added. BJP insiders admit the gradual generational shift in the party, with more room for new and younger leaders, started soon after the Lok Sabha election with the surprise elevation of Dr Sanjay Jaiswal as the Bihar party president. After the expansion, all eyes will now be on the nomination on 12 seats of the state legislative council from the Governor’s quota, which has remained vacant since May 2020. BJP has also inducted former MP Janak Ram in the Cabinet. Ram is not a member of any House and would need to be accommodated in the council. JD(U)’s Ashok Choudhary is not a member of any House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-cm-nitish-kumar-expands-cabinet-17-new-ministers-inducted-today-101612859456487.html

The process of elections was not followed since the Congress did not participate. Deputy chairman MK Pranesh said Horatti was elected unanimously since the Congress did not even field a candidate. The developments come days after the BJP and JD(S) formalised their alliance in the Upper House of the legislature to first elect Pranesh as deputy chairman and then remove Congress’s Pratapchandra Shetty to take control of the council where they do not have a majority on their own. The BJP has 31 members in the council, JD(S) has 11 and the Congress has 28 members in the Upper House. The BJP had allied with the JD(S) with whom it has shared a tempestuous relationship to muster support for easy passage of bills and retain a majority in both the Houses of the legislature.Also Read | PM Modi offered me chief ministership for 5 years if JD(S) allied with BJP: KumaraswamyThe contentious anti-cattle slaughter bill was passed on Monday amid ruckus in the council. Though the JD(S) were also protesting against the bill, the deputy chairman passed the bill through a voice vote and rejected demands for a division of votes. However, people aware of the developments said that the JD(S) would not object to the bill due to the new alliance with which the two parties hope to gain against their common rival, the Congress. The JD(S) has tried to maintain that the party had only extended an “issue-based support”. Former prime minister HD Deve Gowda and former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy-led JD(S) is the only major political outfit in the state that has allied with both the Congress and BJP in the past.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jds-leader-elected-chairperson-of-karnataka-legislative-council-101612857476487.html

Azad had earlier received a wholehearted adieu from leaders across the political spectrum with Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying that the Congress leader had distinguished himself in Parliament and was not only concerned about the party but also cared about the country.“I am among those fortunate people who never went to Pakistan. When I read about circumstances in Pakistan, I feel proud to be a Hindustani Muslim,” Azad said during his farewell speech in the Rajya Sabha. The veteran Congress leader is set to retire from the Upper House on February 15 along with three other leaders from Jammu and Kashmir - Shamsher Singh, Nazir Ahmed Laway and Mohammad Fayaz.Also Read| A salute, effusive praise in PM's emotional farewell to Ghulam Nabi AzadTalking about his first public meeting in Sopore as Jammu and Kashmir’s chief minister, the 71-year old Azad cited his remarks where he stated that his government would be for the people and he would feel ashamed if any of his ministers did justice on the basis of religion, caste or the political party. Azad also thanked former prime minister late Indira Gandhi and politician late Sanjay Gandhi in his speech, saying he was able to reach this platform because of them.PM Modi during his farewell to Azad got emotional as he remembered a terrorist attack in which some people from Gujarat were stuck in J-K. He said that Azad constantly followed up and was concerned about the people. “I will never forget Shri Azad’s efforts and Shri Pranab Mukherjee’s efforts when people from Gujarat were stuck in Kashmir due to a terror attack. Ghulam Nabi Ji was constantly following up, he sounded as concerned as if those stuck were his own family member,” the Prime Minister said.Requesting the Congress leader to remain in the house, Union minister and Republican Party of India (RPI) chief Ramdas Athawale said that he was ready to bring Azad back if the Congress party wouldn’t do it. “You should return to the House. If Congress doesn’t bring you back, then, we are ready to do it.

09-02-2021||India||Misinformation may hit vaccination drive: Study||Misinformation about vaccines could threaten the goal of herd immunity to Covid-19, according to the findings of a first-of-its-kind experiment in which thousands of people in the US and UK became less willing to take doses once they were exposed to myths about vaccine safety and potential harm.The researchers carried out a randomised controlled trial with 8,001 people, of which 6,001 (split into groups of 3,000 in the UK and 3,001 in the US) were exposed to misinformation and their willingness to take a vaccine was recorded before and after the exposure. They found that willingness to take a vaccine dropped by an aggregate of 6.2 percentage points in the UK and 6.4 points in the US. “The most crucial takeaway is that we need to be cautious about the role of misinformation on uptake rates. While it’s unlikely to have an overwhelming impact, it might serve to lower immunisation rates enough to threaten herd immunity goals,” Alex de Figueiredo, one of the lead authors, told HT over email. Figueiredo is the statistics lead on the Vaccine Confidence Project at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).Vaccine scepticism has been a persistent problem in several countries for years, but it is now a centre-stage issue since widespread inoculation at present is the only way to beat back the pandemic. The study, published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour on Friday, is the first to use a randomised controlled trial to quantify how misinformation can make this worse.The authors found that while willingness decreased across all groups – whether split by age, gender, or educational qualifications – there were some differences among groups. “Some groups in the US appear to be more vulnerable to Covid-19 vaccine misinformation, such as women and high-income groups; while Jewish respondents are more robust than Christians in the UK,” said Imperial College London researcher Sahil Loomba, who also led the study.“Also, while there is no evidence that individuals who trust health authorities or scientists are any more or less likely to be impacted by misinformation, trust in non-expert sources of info seemed to be relevant. In particular, trust in celebrities in the UK is associated with robustness, whereas trust in family and friends in the US is associated with susceptibility to misinformation,” Loomba said to HT in an interaction over email.Misinformation on online media has arisen as a growing threat on multiple aspects, including politics and law and order. In 2017. Misinformation spread through communication tools triggered a spate of lynchings in Indian villages when people were falsely led to believe that gangs were out to abduct children. Similarly, targeted falsified information, or disinformation, is believed to have manipulated to some extent the Brexit referendum and the US presidential election in 2016.“There has been widely circulating false information about the pandemic on social media platforms, such as that 5G mobile networks are linked with the virus, that vaccine trial participants have died after taking a candidate COVID-19 vaccine, and that the pandemic is a conspiracy or a bioweapon,” the researchers note in their paper.The problem appears to be less acute in India, but the effects still demonstrate the risks. “Indeed, India also seems to have high confidence in a Covid-19 vaccine. We recently analysed data from a 32 country survey on intent to accept a vaccine and India ranked second with 90.7% (95% credible interval, 88.1 to 93.2) of respondents stating that they would “definitely” or “probably” take a vaccine. India was only behind Vietnam (96.8%),” said Figueiredo.In India, the average turnout during the coronavirus vaccination that began on January 16 has hovered around 50% of the targets. Health ministry data from February 7 showed there had been 5.8 million vaccinations in 116,478 sessions. This translates to roughly 50 people turning up for each session on average, against a target of 100.Loomba said that effect of misinformation appeared to be correlated to the message seeming scientific. “For example, the image with the largest impact on UK respondents had shared the following: “scientists have expressed doubts over the effectiveness of a coronavirus vaccine that has been rushed to human trials, after all the monkeys used in initial testing later contracted coronavirus,” which espouses concerns of vaccine safety upon “rushed” procedures.” This, he said, could be similar to a case where the approval of some vaccines may have appeared rushed, or the conversations around them focussed on serious side-effects. “It is crucial that any vaccine candidate must prove safe and efficacious as per established standards of scientific scrutiny before receiving regulatory approval, else it may induce undue vaccine hesitancy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/misinformation-may-hit-vaccination-drive-study-101612855795529.html

A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde issued a notice on the petitions filed by Tharoor, Sardesai and five other journalists to quash the multiple first information reports (FIRs) pending against them in several states.The top court said the stay on the arrest will continue till the next date of hearing, after two weeks, and also issued notices to Delhi Police and Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Haryana.Also read | 'Can't condone': Tharoor says farmers' flag on Red Fort is 'unfortunate'The Delhi Police opposed the stay. "We will show the horrendous effect these tweets have had. These Twitter handles have lakhs of followers," Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who was appearing for Delhi Police, said.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who was representing Tharoor, said that interim protection was needed as the Congress leader is in Delhi and the charge is serious. "The investigating agency can arrest me anytime," Sibal said.The top court bench asked Mehta, "We will hear you. But are you going to arrest him?" Mehta replied, "We know our responsibility." He assured that he will convey the assurance to other states.But the bench noted that Mehta was representing just the Delhi Police. "Issue notice. Stay of arrest in the meantime. List after two weeks," said the bench also comprising Justice AS Bopanna and Justice V Ramasubramanian.Mrinal Pande, Zafar Agha, Paresh Nath, Anant Nath and Vinod Jose are among the other journalists.The Delhi Police lodged a case on January 30 against Tharoor, Sardesai and several others for alleged misreporting and spreading disharmony. Simultaneously, cases were lodged at Gurugram in Haryana and in Madhya Pradesh under serious charges of sedition besides provisions of promoting enmity, making assertions prejudicial to national integration under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), among other provisions under the Information Technology Act.Tharoor and Sardesai had petitioned the top court challenging the registration of FIRs against him in several states and for quashing of the criminal cases against them. They had sought protection of their fundamental right to free speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. They had stated that the multiple FIRs against them were a malafide exercise that was politically motivated as the contents of the FIRs were identical. The other people who have been named in these FIRs also have reportedly approached the top court seeking similar relief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-stays-arrest-of-shashi-tharoor-rajdeep-and-5-other-journalists-101612853461913.html
09-02-2021||India||Japanese PM Suga and Abe to be invited for launch of Kashi convention centre||Japanese prime minister Yoshihide Suga and his predecessor Shinzo Abe will be invited for the inauguration of Kashi’s International Cooperation and Convention Centre, also known as Varanasi convention centre Rudraksha, said officials.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to inaugurate the Rudraksha Convention Centre after March 2021, said Deepak Agarwal, divisional commissioner, Varanasi, however, a date for the inauguration is yet to be fixed by the prime minister’s office (PMO), he said.Invitation to attend the inaugural ceremony will be sent to Japanese PM Yoshihide Suga and his predecessor Abe by the government of India. The inauguration of the Varanasi convention centre is most likely in April this year.Construction work of the Rudraksha centre will be completed by the end of February. Thereafter, its trial will be done in March. The trial has to be completed by March 31, said divisional commissioner.Varanasi Municipal Commissioner Gaurang Rathi said that an agreement has been signed with ISWHC to operate the convention centre for 10 years. It has been given a target to generate ₹one crore revenue from the convention centre annually.The Kashi convention centre project was worth over ₹182 crore and was designed by Japanese architect Yoko Saka. It has a seating capacity of 1,200 and is equipped with state of the art facilities including high-tech parking. The convention centre has been built near Varanasi Nagar Nigam office.Shinzo Abe gifted Rudraksha Convention Centre to Kashi during his visit to the ancient city in December 2015 as the Japanese Prime Minister.Later in September 2017, Modi named the centre as Rudraksh, the symbol of love and ‘prasad’ of Lord Shiva.PM Narendra Modi and the then Japanese PM Abe conceived the centre during their visit to the holy city in December 2015, a fact revealed by PM Modi at the September 2017 launch of the convention centre’s design in Ahmedabad.“You know that the ancient and holy city of Varanasi is my second home. The project of Varanasi Convention Centre is a symbol of cultural co-operation between Kyoto city of Japan and Varanasi. It was conceived by Prime Minister Abe and I, when we visited Varanasi together in 2015,” PM Modi had said at that time.Also Read: PM Modi talks to health workers to dispel fears over vaccines“I have named it Rudraksh – the symbol of love, and the Prasad of Lord Shiva to humanity.

It held a live demonstration on Monday to show how it is possible.The dogs were trained on specific biomarkers emanating from urine and sweat samples of Covid-19 positive patients.“Scientifically, it is evident that affected body tissues release unique volatile metabolic biomarkers which are used as disease signatures for detection of disease by the medical detection dogs,” said the Army in a statement.“Various countries like Britain, Finland, Russia, France, UAE, Germany, Lebanon have started training dogs for Covid-19 detection by screening passengers at airports and railway stations.”Also Read | Indian military sees threefold increase in women personnel in 6 yearsTaking a leaf out of the global trends of using medical detection dogs for diseases like cancer, malaria, diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, etc, the Army has undertaken trials for the detection of Covid-19 using dogs in controlled conditions, it said.Positive and suspected samples were obtained from Military Hospital, Meerut Cantonment, and Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Subharti Medical College, Meerut, for the purpose of training.According to Army vets, a concerted effort was made to train an indigenous Chippiparai and a Cocker Spaniel dog to detect the volatilome of Covid-19 disease by comparatory method.“The sensitivity and specificity of both the dogs obtained from the screening of 279 urine and 267 sweat samples during the initial trial procedure were found to be very high,” the statement said.After training, the dogs were deployed at a Transit Camp in Delhi for the screening of transients moving to the operational areas through the transit camp.At least 3,000 samples have been screened so far. To date, 18 samples have been found positive by detection dogs.“From the trials and operational deployment, it has been inferred that Covid-19 volatile metabolic biomarkers are within the threshold limit of olfactory detection capability of trained dog and can help in quick and real-time detection of disease. Keeping in mind the success of the trial, more dogs have been incorporated in training for Covid-19 detection,” the statement said.It is probably the first time that the olfactory capability of canines has been exploited to detect tissues infected with pathogens releasing volatile metabolic biomarkers.“The use of such canines in the detection of Covid-19 can assist in quick and real-time detection of the disease. The effort will turn out to be the part of detectable disease signatures, thereby paving the way forward for real-time detection of various medical diseases by use of trained medical detection dog,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-trains-dogs-to-detect-covid19-101612853876168.html

Speaking about Azad, the Prime Minister said that he was ‘worried’ that whoever succeeds the senior Congress MP will have big boots to fill. “Whoever succeeds Ghulam Nabi Ji will face great difficulties in matching up to him. This is because while Azad Ji was concerned about his party, he was equally concerned about the House and the country,” PM Modi said, adding that he also places the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, who is also a member of the Upper House, in this ‘category.’Azad is currently the Leader of the Opposition in the Upper House.The Prime Minister then recalled a meeting of floor leaders he was to chair during the coronavirus crisis. The same day, PM Modi recalled, he got a call from Azad and quoted the Congress leader as saying, “It’s good what you are doing Modi Ji, but please also call a meeting of leaders of all parties.” “I did what he advised me to do,” he said.

The summit between Modi and Ghani will be held at 1.15pm and an agreement on building Shahtoot Dam in the Kabul river basin is on the agenda, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The dam was part of new development initiatives unveiled by India last November. India is also taking up 150 community projects worth $80 million in Afghanistan, part of measures to take development to small communities through schemes that have a direct impact on the lives of the people. Also Read | Pakistani Taliban reunified splinter groups in Afghanistan, poses threat: UNShahtoot Dam will provide drinking water to two million residents of Kabul city and also feed irrigation projects. It will build on the 202-km Pul-e-Khumri electricity transmission line built in 2009 to provide power to Kabul. These initiatives come against the backdrop of mounting global concern over increased attacks by the Taliban even as it engages the Afghan government in talks in Qatar. The new Biden administration in the US has said it is reviewing an agreement signed with the Taliban last year, and a final decision is yet to be made on completing the drawdown of American forces in Afghanistan by May. While announcing India’s commitment to build the dam last November, external affairs minister S Jaishankar told a virtual international pledging conference that India is committed to a long-term role for the development of Afghanistan. India’s development portfolio for Afghanistan is worth more than $3 billion, with officials saying much of the funds are aimed at building the capabilities of the Afghan people and institutions in order to improve governance. India has so far completed more than 400 projects across all 34 provinces of Afghanistan. India is also among the countries that have expressed concern at the spike in violence in Afghanistan, much of it targeting officials, civil society activists and journalists. Cities across Afghanistan have witnessed a wave of targeted bombings and assassinations. New Delhi has backed a peace process that is Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled, while calling for an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire to ensure peace and stability in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modighani-virtual-meet-today-india-afghanistan-to-sign-agreement-on-new-dam-101612852796351.html
09-02-2021||India||Belong to the family of leaders like ex-VP: Mukhtar Ansari to SC||Gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari has, in the Supreme Court, accused the Uttar Pradesh government of conspiring to kill him in a “state-sponsored encounter”, while emphasising that he was part of a family that contributed immensely to India’s freedom struggle and gave leaders such as former vice-president Hamid Ansari. The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLA from Mau in the UP assembly also opposed the Yogi Adityanath government’s plea in the top court to shift him back to the state for trial in 14 criminal cases from a jail in Punjab, where he is presently lodged in connection with an extortion case.“There is a grave threat and impending danger to the life of the respondent in the state of UP under the present political regime. The present petition is merely to seek a death warrant on the life of the respondent (Ansari),” Ansari’s affidavit read.Invoking his pedigree, Ansari said that he was a “part of a family that has made immense contribution to the Indian freedom movement and has given India many leaders in the form of Shri Muhammad Hamid Ansari who was the vice president of India, Shri Shaukatullah Ansari who served as the governor of Odisha, Justice Asif Ansari who was the judge of the Allahabad high court, and his own father Subhanullah Ansari who was a freedom fighter and social worker.”Contending that a free and fair trial was not possible in UP where various BJP leaders have issued open threats to his life in complicity with the state government, Ansari said that his “personal custody is being sought only with the intent of killing him” since trials could go on through video-conferencing as well.“The respondent ought not be brought physically to the state of UP as it will amount to being a death warrant for him,” the affidavit read. “The petitioner’s (UP’s) insistence on personal appearance of the respondent in the state of UP itself gives credence to the fact that his life is in grave danger and he will be killed if he is physically produced there,” he said, naming BJP MLAs Brijesh Singh and his nephew Sushil Singh from UP as the ones who had been reportedly trying to eliminate him. The court fixed the matter for a detailed hearing on February 24 and asked the UP government to submit its replies to the affidavit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/belong-to-the-family-of-leaders-like-ex-vp-mukhtar-ansari-to-sc-101612852418439.html

She repeatedly stopped to greet her supporters, who had gathered in large numbers to welcome her along the route that normally takes six hours to cover.Sasikala announced her return to politics during the journey after serving a four-year jail sentence in a disproportionate assets case and recovering from Covid-19. She called for a united AIADMK to challenge a common rival, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, which has been out of power since 2011. The AIADMK has maintained she will not be re-inducted into the party. The AIADMK expelled Sasikala, who was a close aide to late former chief minister J Jayalalithaa, while she was in prison.AIADMK’s breakaway faction, Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK), and her loyalists within the party she cultivated over her three-decade association with Jayalalithaa organised the reception for her. Seven AIADMK members, including the one who lent his car to Sasikala, were expelled from the party on Monday night for the reception. The police even intervened against her use of the AIADMK flag.“The party has faced several struggles and risen like a phoenix in the past,” Sasikala said as she projected herself as a Jayalalithaa heir in the run-up to the polls in Tamil Nadu this year.Sasikala’s nephew, TTV Dhinakaran, has maintained his aunt remains AIADMK general secretary and her supporters will help her reclaim the party. Dhinakaran, a lawmaker, led the AMMK in the 2019 parliamentary polls and got a 4% vote share.The AIADMK has been fragmented since Jayalalithaa’s death in December 2016. Sasikala’s former loyalists, chief minister Edapaddi Palaniswami and his deputy, O Paneerselvam, turned against her at different points and merged their factions.Political commentator Sriram Seshadri said Sasikala will wait and act after the elections.

Among those with the syndrome, 90% needed oxygen support with one in three needing mechanical ventilators, according to a recently published study from the hospital in the Journal of Tropical Medicine. This is much higher compared to just 4.16% of the patients with Covid-19 who needed mechanical ventilation as per data shared by the Union health ministry in June, when the pandemic was still spreading in India. Also Read | India records 9,110 new Covid-19 cases, 78 deaths; tally over 10.8 millionMIS-C is a serious condition that appears to be linked to the Covid-19 infection; it results in various severe inflammation of organs and tissues, such as the heart, lungs, blood vessels, kidneys, digestive system, brain, skin or eyes. The study followed the trajectory of infection and symptoms of 41 children between the ages of 0 and 12 years admitted to Safdarjung Hospital between April and July with coronavirus disease. The study shows that almost half of them developed the severe inflammatory condition. According to experts, this is surprising as the condition is thought to be rare. The study found that mortality was also higher in children who developed the syndrome. As per the study, around 60% of the children died in comparison to just one of the children without MIS-C dying due to Covid-19. The researchers stated, “Delay in diagnosis and referral may have adversely affected the prognosis and outcome.” The researchers had started collecting data on MIS-C to address the paucity of data on the condition from India, with most of the data so far coming from Europe, USA or China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-1-in-3-kids-with-inflammatory-syndrome-needed-ventilator-says-study-101612846495740.html

He also pointed out there will be changes in the final rules.The Union labour ministry is in the process to finalise the rules under the four labour codes, Code on Wages, Industrial Relations, Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions (OSH) and Social Security Codes. “The rule making process is already underway and likely to complete in the coming week. All stakeholders are also consulted in the framing of rules. This ministry would soon be in a position to bring into force the four Codes, viz., Code on Wages, Industrial Relations, Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions (OSH) and Social Security Codes,” Chandra said during the briefing.

09-02-2021||India||Indian military sees threefold increase in women personnel in 6 years||The headcount of women in the military has increased almost three-fold over the last six years, with more avenues being opened for them at a steady pace, latest government figures showed. There are 9,118 women currently serving the army, navy and air force, with the services giving them more opportunities to boost career progression, the government told Parliament on Monday. The headcount of women officers in the armed forces hovered around 3,000 in 2014-15. Since then, the government has taken a raft of measures to empower women, including allowing them to fly fighter planes, naval aircraft and giving them permanent commission in different branches. Excluding the medical wing in which women have been serving for decades, the army accounts for 6,807 women officers, the air force 1,607 and the navy 704 women officers. In percentage terms, women still form a small part of the military—0.56% of the army, 1.08% of the air force and 6.5% of the navy. Also Read | Army prepared to take on the security challenges, says top generalThere has been an increase in the number of women personnel in the armed forces (excluding medical, dental and nursing cadres) in 2020 compared to the previous year, minister of state for defence Shripad Naik told Rajya Sabha. He added that the government has sanctioned 1,700 posts for women in Corps of Military Police (CMP) in the non-officer cadre. The CMP is the first cadre to induct women in the non-officer rank. One of the turning points for women in the military came in 2015 when the IAF decided to induct them into the fighter stream. The navy has also opened more avenues for women in recent years—the first naval women were inducted as pilots of maritime reconnaissance aircraft in 2016. Warships, tanks and combat positions in infantry are still no-go zones for women, who were allowed to join the armed forces outside the medical stream for the first time in 1992. The armed forces began inducting women by granting them short-service commission for five to 10 years before the government came out with a new policy in 2008 to give them permanent commission in a few arms and services. The number of arms and services in which women are now being granted permanent commission has gone up. Last November, almost 70% of women officers who were considered for permanent commission in the army by a special selection board were selected to serve a full term in the army. Of the 615 women considered for permanent commission, 422 were found fit for the role. The board was convened months after the government issued a formal order in July 2020 granting permanent commission to women following a Supreme Court verdict. The government’s July 23, 2020 order specified grant of permanent commission to women officers in 10 streams—Army Air Defence (AAD), Signals, Engineers, Army Aviation, Electronics and Mechanical Engineers (EME), Army Service Corps (ASC), Army Ordnance Corps (AOC), and Intelligence Corps in addition to the existing streams of Judge and Advocate General (JAG) and Army Educational Corps (AEC). The Supreme Court in February 2020 ruled that women be considered for command roles and that all women officers were entitled to permanent commission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-military-sees-threefold-increase-in-women-personnel-in-6-years-101612843615626.html

The lower part of the ablation zone (zone of the glacier which has melted or calved and formed a lake) is also receiving a significant amount of water from a tributary glacier located at the northern side of the Nanda Devi glacier. “If this depression filled with water develops appropriate hydrostatic pressure, it can accelerate the lower part of the ablation zone, possibly releasing water from the underground lake. It could be the potential reason for the flash flood,” a note prepared by the IISC team said.“This is a new tool developed in IISc by our team which can be very useful to study such disasters. The tool is based on Laminar flow equation and surface slope; known as Himalayan Glacier Thickness Mapper (HIGHTHIM). The tool was used successfully to map depressions below South Lhonak lake in Sikkim and further estimate the future expansion of the lake,” said Professor Anil Kulkarni, distinguished scientist, Divecha Center for Climate Change.Responding to some US-based scientists who had suggested that a landslide had triggered the flash floods based on satellite data, Kulkarni said “It appears to me that they looked at the adjacent valley. Initial reports suggest that flash flood was caused due to breaking of Nanda Devi glacier. The observation was widely published by numerous news media and also supported by reconnaissance survey carried out by the Indian Air Force. We went deeper to see what happened under the surface.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-underground-glacial-lake-led-to-flash-floods-says-iisc-analysis-101612842535639.html

Here is what we know so far about the worst disaster to hit the region in eight years:• The toll from the tragedy on Monday climbed to 26 with 171 people still missing even as at least 1,000 disaster response, military and paramilitary personnel worked to clear a 1.7-km tunnel in the badly hit hydroelectric power project of Tapovan.Also Read | ‘Had lost all hope’: Survivors recall horror tales of Chamoli disaster• At least 35 people are still stranded in waist-deep muck at the project site.• The surging waters on Sunday washed away homes, damaged two major dams, cut off 13 villages, and snapped crucial road links and bridges that connect far-flung areas in the Himalayan region.• The missing include 11 villagers, two police personnel and workers from the two dam sites. • Rescue workers were scanning the Alaknanda river to find bodies and visiting the affected villages to provide them relief. • US-based scientists, who looked at satellite images, suggested the tragedy was caused by a landslide onto a glacier which led to debris flooding the river.• But a group of Indian scientists said there was no landslide or avalanche but pointed at the possibility of a glacial lake that led to the breach. They said the release of water from an underground glacial lake led to flash floods and inundation in the valley.• Many flood victims in the upper reaches of Uttarakhand blamed unchecked construction and environmental damage for the tragedy. • The disaster is the worst to hit Uttarakhand since the 2013 Kedarnath floods killed 5,700 people and highlighted the impact of the climate crisis and degradation of the fragile ecology.• The disaster on Sunday struck at 9.30am when a glacier breach under the Nanda Devi, the country’s second-highest peak, sent a torrent of water, rock and dust down a valley into the Rishiganga river, where workers were building a dam.Also Read | Uttarakhand flash flood: Rescuers struggle to reach trapped men• Visuals showed the muddy floodwaters smashing most of the plant and inundating bridges before roaring downstream into the Dhauliganga and partially damaging the National Thermal Power Corporation’s 530 MW Tapovan Vishnugad project, roughly 8 km away.• Columns of slush and debris have been strewn across at least 30km area, where authorities have airdropped ration packets to stranded villagers.• Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, Union ministers RK Sinha and Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank have been among the politicians who visited the site.• Sinha said Tapovan suffered a loss of about ₹1,500 crore, but ruled out the possibility of scrapping the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-glacier-burst-what-we-know-about-region-s-worst-disaster-in-8-yrs-101612842175828.html

He is one of the experts who are a part of government’s outreach initiative to address concerns regarding Covid-19 vaccination. Also Read | Covid-19 vaccination drive: 3 mn Mumbaiites will qualify for phase 3, says BMC“If there is any specific doubt, potential beneficiaries with comorbidities can consult their doctor before taking the shot. It is important to complete the full course of vaccination as antibodies against the virus develop only 15 days after having taken the second dose of Covid-19 vaccine, and we are fully protected,” he added.It is also important for those persons to take the shot who have had Covid-19 in the past.“We have seen that one third of those with Covid-19 do not develop neutralising antibodies, and there is no definitive answer to how long these antibodies last among Indians. As a result it is important for everyone to take the vaccine for us to prevent getting the disease,” he said.India started the Covid-19 vaccination drive on January 16 this year, with the aim of vaccinating close to 10 million healthcare workers in the initial phases.As states began scaling up the vaccination sessions, the Centre directed states to also begin vaccinating their frontline workers simultaneously. On February 2, the states began to do so. As on Monday, February 8, more than 6 million beneficiaries (60,35,660) were vaccinated that included 54,12,270 health care workers and 6,23,390 frontline workers in the country.India has become the fastest country to vaccinate 6 million beneficiaries countrywide.“This feat was achieved in just 24 days. USA took 26 days to reach this mark whereas the UK achieved this in 46 days. Till Monday, 8,257 vaccination sessions were held,” said Union health ministry in a statement.Eleven states have already vaccinated at least 65% of the registered healthcare workers.“Eleven States/UTs have reported less than 40% coverage of vaccinating healthcare workers. These are—Delhi, J&K, Ladakh, Punjab, D&NH (Dadar and Nagar Haveli), Chandigarh, Tamil Nadu, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, and Puducherry. Ten States account for 75.12% of the total beneficiaries vaccinated today (Monday),” the statement further read.A total of 29 persons who were given the shot have been hospitalised so far, which comprises 0.0005% of the total vaccinations.Of the 29 cases of hospitalisations, 19 were discharged after treatment, while nine persons died, according to the health ministry data.The most recent hospitalisation is of a person who is suffering from bilateral facial palsy, and has been admitted at Kerala Institute of Medical Sciences, Thiruvananathpuram. The patient is stable. A total of 23 deaths have been recorded to date, which comprise 0.0004% of the total vaccinations. Of the 23, nine persons died in the hospital while 14 deaths have been recorded outside the hospital. In last 24 hours, one death has been reported of a 29-year-old female, a resident of Srikakulam, Andhra Pradesh. None of these deaths have been causally linked with Covid-19 vaccination. “No case of serious/severe AEFI/death is attributable to vaccination, till date,” said the ministry statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-deaths-15-20-times-higher-with-comorbidities-icmr-101612841696024.html

The second such mahapanchayat would be held in Fatehpur district in Prayagraj division on February 23.The Fatehpur mahapanchayat would be followed by similar gatherings in Gorakhpur, Basti and Mirzapur, the BKU leader said.“Kisan leaders were getting demands (for widening the protests) from farmers and other organisations in Purvanchal after successfully mobilising protests for the Raj Bhavan ‘gherao’ programme on January 23,” said Digamber Singh, BKU’s youth wing state president.He said the issue was discussed in meetings of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) and it was unanimously decided to hold kisan mahapanchayat in Purvanchal to mobilise farmers for the ongoing movement against the three agriculture reform laws.BKU’s Lucknow divisional president Harnam Singh Verma said he was confident that these maha panchayats would draw large crowds though farmers in Purvanchal had limited resources in comparison to their western UP counterparts.Verma said, “Procurement of crops at MSP (minimum support price) has always been a major issue for farmers in Purvanchal. It was a major demand of SKM, too. Therefore, farmers would come out in large numbers and join the movement.”Also Read: Several Delhi borders remain closed due to farmers’ protest, traffic divertedVerma said a large section of people from different castes and communities could also join the farmers’ movement through the maha panchayats to voice their concerns. Farmer leaders said that SKM’s call for a protest at the Raj Bhavan in Lucknow on January 23 saw an overwhelming response with the participation of around 600 tractors at a short notice of four days. “This shows people are annoyed and they would show their strength through the maha panchayats in Purvanchal,” said Verma.Meanwhile, people familiar with the developments said BKU leader Rakesh Tikait, BKU chief Naresh Tikait and his son Gaurav Tikait (national president of BKU’s youth wing) would be present at some of these maha panchayats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-unions-to-widen-protest-against-farm-laws-with-panchayats-in-purvanchal-101612840835271.html

CAs have particularly been asked to verify whether the associations are eligible to receive foreign contribution; ensure whether it is using the designated bank account for the same and assist in properly preparing and maintaining the prescribed books of accounts. “Since the FCRA deals with the national security, associations are required to exercise extreme care and caution in utilising foreign contribution. CAs examine and audit all relevant books of accounts and bills and vouchers of FCRA associations and then present audited accounts which are submitted/uploaded online to the government. Therefore they are obliged to conduct performance as well as forensic audits to ensure that receipt and utilisation of foreign contribution has happened within the four corners of law,” the Charter issued by MHA states. “Hence, they are expected to provide proper guidance to the associations in maintaining proper accounts and utilising foreign contribution only as provided under the FCRA law,” it added. The Centre has, last year, made FCRA stringent by barring public servants from receiving any funds from abroad. It also made Aadhar registration mandatory for NGOs; prohibited transfer of foreign funds to another person and designated State Bank of India, New Delhi, as the only bank where such funds can be received.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/get-acquainted-with-foreign-funding-act-to-help-ngos-home-ministry-to-cas-101612840075877.html

Both were killed on the suspicion of being police informers and were relatives of panchayat representatives.“We have issued an advisory, not a notice to panchayat representatives who are on target of Maoists. We have urged them to move to some relative’s place or safer places because Maoists’ activity has increased. We are not forcing anyone, they can do whatever they want but they should take precautions about their security,” said additional superintendent of police Jayprakash Badai.“The aim is to make the panchayat representatives aware of the situation, nothing more than that. We have told them to take precautions because of the increase in Maoist activity and the recent killings of tribals,” said Rajnandgaon superintendent of police (SP), D Shravan.Also Read: CoBRA jawan, two Maoists injured in encounter in JharkhandOther senior police officers said the language of the notice was not correct.“The SHO might have given the notice thinking about the inability to provide security to the panchayat representatives but this is not the correct way. By this argument, all the tribals living in jungles of Bastar and other Maoist areas should move to other places. The aim of police is to provide security to the people,” said an IPS officer posted in the Maoist-affected district of the state. He didn’t wish to be named.There are about 200 armed cadres of CPI (Maoist) working in MMC zone since the last three years. Police believe that the Maoists were moving towards the MMC zone since anti-Maoist operations had increased over the last year in the Bastar region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-police-notice-to-panchayat-representatives-to-move-to-safer-area-101612838622696.html

09-02-2021||India||Delhi HC: Give cogent reasons for denying information under RTI in ongoing case||The Delhi high court has said that whenever information is sought under the right to information (RTI) in a pending criminal case, “cogent reasons” have to be given by a public authority for denying information and explain as to how and why the investigation will get hampered by giving the details.Justice Jayant Nath made the remarks while hearing a plea by a government employee, accused of impersonation, cheating and bribery in 2012 by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).The man had challenged an order of the Central Information Commission (CIC) on January 15, 2018 where he was denied certain information that he had sought regarding his case pending in the Patiala House Court.“….cogent reasons have to be given by the public authority as to how and why the investigation or prosecution will get impaired or hampered by giving the information in question,” justice Nath said in his order of February 5.A case was registered against the man on May 5, 2012 on the allegation of criminal conspiracy of cheating by impersonation, demand of illegal gratification and misuse of official position. He was taken into custody and was later released on bail on May 25, 2012.He was also suspended from service on May 24, 2020 in accordance with the Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, (CCS Rules, 1965). The suspension was subsequently revoked on March 10, 2015 on the recommendations of the Suspension Review Committee.Both the CBI and the departmental enquiry against the man have not attained finality. During this time, he filed an RTI application on Sep 5, 2016 posing 25 queries seeking details of the officer conducting the information and related documents to his case.However, it was dismissed by the Central Public Information Officer (CPIO) and later the CIC stating that the case is pending trial.On Feb 5, the high court, while deciding his challenge to the CIC’s order said that no attempt has been made by CIC to show as to how giving the information sought for would hamper the investigation and the on-going disciplinary proceedings.“The impugned order concludes that a charge-sheet has been filed in the criminal case by the CBI but in the disciplinary proceedings the matter is still pending. … No reasons are spelt out as to how the investigation or prosecution will be hampered,” the judge said in his 12-page order.Also Read: 73 nominations filed for Delhi civic bypollsThe court also noted that the RTI application given by the man is “vague” and “confusing”. It said that the entire focus of the application is on the name of the officer who has been directed to support the probe of the investigating agency.“Numerous queries are raised regarding the said alleged officer who has been directed to support the investigation of the investigating agency,” it said.It quashed the order of CIC and remanded the matter back to it for fresh consideration in terms of the noted legal position.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-give-cogent-reasons-for-denying-information-under-rti-in-ongoing-case-101612836668294.html
09-02-2021||India||PM Modi's speech offered no solution: Opposition||Minutes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke about the farm issue in his reply on the President’s speech in the Rajya Sabha, the Congress criticised his speech on Monday and said that the address did not offer any solution to farmers protesting against three contentious agri laws.Senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge said: “We expected that the PM, looking at the ongoing agitations across the country, will withdraw the three black laws and take all stakeholders into confidence to review the laws. He spoke in his own style but didn’t say a word about relief to farmers.”Congress leaders also said that the PM tried to suggest that no one knows the contents of the three laws. “Is it possible? There are experts among the farmers and entire opposition leaders know about the laws. The first law promoted black market, the second one helps the rich people and the third one helps hoarding,” Kharge said.Another Congress MP, Deepender Hooda, alleged that “the PM disappointed the farmers. The government is unable to understand the seriousness of the situation.” Congress chief whip Jairam Ramesh said: “PM Modi said that FDI is also ‘Foreign Destructive Ideology’. This from someone whose governance has been based solely on FDI — Fear, Deception, Intimidation.” Reacting to PM’s speech in the Rajya Sabha, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) senior vice president Prem Singh Chandumajra said that it appeared that the country’s backbone peasantry has a bigger test to prove the genuineness of their cause. He added that it was expected from the PM to make a big announcement but by criticising the farmers who are protesting on the borders of Delhi, he denied them the legitimate right.According to Chandumajra, the PM did not give clarity on MSP, despite his party leaders making announcements on the public forum that the new farm laws will not impact the MSP. “He (PM) has made no commitment to make MSP a legal right,” added the former MPBJP president J P Nadda asserted on Monday that PM Narendra Modi’s address in Rajya Sabha has dispelled the web of confusion being created over a host of issues and laid out a clear direction for the country.Modi has made it clear that the government is taking all necessary steps for farmers’ welfare, which is its priority, Nadda said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-s-speech-offered-no-solution-opposition-101612834006582.html

09-02-2021||India||Farm stir, Bengal polls dominate Lok Sabha debate on President speech||The ongoing farmers protest dominated the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President’s speech, which resumed in the Lok Sabha on Monday after four consecutive days of disruption.The debate started after protracted backchannel negotiations involving defence minister Rajnath Singh and Opposition leaders. Singh appealed to the Opposition not to break the longstanding tradition of the House to debate the President’s speech before anything else.Locket Chatterjee, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member from Bengal, initiated the debate and focused entirely on attacking the eastern state’s ruling Trinamool Congress, with an eye on the upcoming assembly polls.Speaking in Hindi, Bengali and English, Chatterjee said Trinamool stole ration provided by the Centre during the pandemic, tents during the Amphan cyclone and even Covid-19 vaccines. She said the BJP will not allow anyone to make Bengal into “East Pakistan”.“Mamata (Banerjee) government insults Ram and Sita. They (Bengal government) practise appeasement politics. They practice politics of 30%. We will not allow making Bengal into East Pakistan,” she said. Bengal is scheduled to go to the polls in April-May.Congress floor leader Adhir Chowdhury demanded a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) into the Republic Day vandalism in Delhi’s Red Fort and alleged it was the government that sent “vandals” to defame the farmers agitation. He demanded another parliamentary investigation into the alleged TRP (target rating point) scam.“How can some people reach the Red Fort, that too on January 26 when the highest level of security was in place in Delhi?” he asked.“Why isn’t there a proper investigation into it,” he alleged.Chowdhury alleged the government “trapped” farmers and criticised the government for what he saw as a bid to “create a rift between Punjab and other states,” referring to the government’s stand that only one state had a problem with the new farm laws.He also wondered why the government is making “Greta a persona non grata”, referring to climate activist Greta Thunberg’s support for the farm stir and the consequent backlash.The second speaker, BJP’s Virendra Kumar, maintained that the Narendra Modi government was committed to the welfare of farmers and was trying to double the their income through various measures.Trinamool’s Mahua Moitra lashed out at the BJP and alleged that the ruling dispensation was making “hate and bigotry” a part of its narrative.The government’s decision to impose a nationwide lockdown following the outbreak of Covid-19 inflicted “untold misery” on people with “lakhs of people” forced to walk to their homes, she alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-stir-bengal-polls-dominate-lok-sabha-debate-on-president-speech-101612833427524.html
09-02-2021||India||Lok Sabha begins work as logjam finally ends||After Lok Sabha proceedings were blocked for four consecutive days last week, defence minister Rajnath Singh stepped in on Monday for intense negotiations to salvage the debate on the President’s speech in the Lower House.Though the Lok Sabha started on Monday afternoon with the usual disruptions as the Opposition again demanded a separate debate on the farm laws -- some leaders, including Congress MPs Manish Tewari and Jasbir Gill and CPI(M)’s AM Ariff, pushed adjournment motion notices demanding the repealing of three laws -- but the matter was eventually resolved in a closed-door meeting.Singh, along with ministers Piyush Goyal and Prahlad Joshi invited the Opposition for talks to the Speaker’s chamber, to find a resolution. According to people familiar with the matter, Singh said that the week’s agenda is already decided (debates on President speech and general budget) and appealed to the MPs that the House has a long tradition of passing the Motion of Thanks to the President’s address, urging them not to break this tradition.The Congress floor leader Adhir Chowdhury said that they don’t want to disrespect the President, but were voicing concern over a serious issue. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla said that if both sides can find a solution, he will give as much time as required to debate all issues including the farmers’ protests.With Congress agreeing to this, other Opposition parties too decided to join the debate. The only party that expressed serious reservation was the Shiromani Akali Dal. Its leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal refused to budge, and Rajnath once again, spoke to her separately.It was decided that Singh will make an appeal in the House, following which the debate will start. Minutes later, after the House convened at 5pm, Singh said the tradition of thanking the President has been continuing for long and it should not be broken in a healthy democracy. He also said that Rajya Sabha has already passed the Motion of Thanks after PM Narendra Modi’s reply and “I appeal to members not to break this tradition in the Lok Sabha”.Congress leader Chowdhury, too, said that this tradition has been continuing since 1921 and should not be broken. “Our demand was to discuss the issue of farmers who have been sitting in the cold on the borders of Delhi in protest against farm laws. It is regrettable that they are being stopped from entering the capital by sharp nails and barbed wires,” he said referring to the reinforced barricading at the farmers’ protest sites. He added the Opposition wanted an assurance from the government for a standalone discussion on the farmers’ issue.Birla also appealed to the members to allow the House to function and not indulge in sloganeering. Acknowledging Singh’s role, Birla said, “I want to thank Rajnath Singh, deputy leader of the House, for participating in the meeting and helping us resolve the issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lok-sabha-begins-work-as-logjam-finally-ends-101612833118860.html
09-02-2021||India||Delhiwale: Like an ascetic, but with a family||His face exudes immense calm, and sitting beside him is somewhat relaxing. He has the vibes of a fakir, an ascetic, which is nothing surprising when you know that he spends his days sitting in one of the courtyards of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya’s sufi shrine, in central Delhi.“I’ve been a khidmatgar in the dargah for decades,” says Muhammed Naeem Khan, referring to himself as a server of the shrine. It is a pleasantly cool evening. The worst part of winter is gone. The brilliantly blue sky has receded into hues of darkness. Mr Khan is sitting by a grave, alone. The shrine houses the grave of the aforementioned mystic as well as of other historical figures, famous and obscure, including a Mughal emperor.Lighting up a beedi, Mr Khan recalls his past—“when we were seven brothers and three sisters... now we are two brothers and two sisters.” In his 60s, he says that his father was from Amroha in UP, and worked in Delhi as a cook in the bungalow of a certain “Mr Kelly”, who lived in what was then known as Aurangzeb Road. “Father lived here in the ‘basti’, and cycled to work every day”—by basti, he means the village surrounding this shrine.Pondering on how he ended as a shrine server, or khidmatgar, Mr Khan confesses that he had no idea that this is what he would become. The circumstances pushed him in this direction. “Father died when I was in the 10th standard.” The loss forced him and his brothers to immediately launch into an active working life, and to give up all hopes of education. Mr Khan worked for many years in a local meat shop, but later, when his six sons began earning for themselves, he gave up his job and started spending more time in the shrine—his home is very close. He would take care of select visitors, and receive token money from the shrine’s caretakers for his services. “This money is important... my children are very caring but I don’t want to depend on them,” he says in a voice so full of kindness that it feels like being offered a piece of blanket in the sharpest cold.But it’s almost seven in the evening, and Mr Khan arrived in the dargah some 12 hours ago. He shall now walk back home, a few lanes away, to wife, Aamna Khatoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-like-an-ascetic-but-with-a-family-101612832464819.html
09-02-2021||India||Allahabad high court dismisses plea against allotment of land for mosque||The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court on Monday dismissed a petition challenging the allotment of five acres of land in Dhannipur village of Ayodhya district for the construction of a mosque after the Delhi-based sisters who challenged the move withdrew their plea.The Uttar Pradesh government allotted the land to the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board (UPSCWB) for construction of a mosque in compliance with the Supreme Court’s November 2019 order that allotted the site, where the Babi mosque once stood, to the Hindu claimants. The court order ended a decades-old dispute between Hindu and Muslim claimants to the land.A two-judge bench of justices Devendra Kumar Upadhyay and justice Manish Kumar of the high court passed Monday’s order after the petitioners agreed to withdraw the plea. The high court also gave the petitioners permission to file a fresh plea after ascertaining facts.Delhi-based sisters Rani Kapoor Punjabi alias Rani Baluja and Rama Rani Punjabi filed the petition on February 3, claiming ownership of the five-acre land.“After arguing at some length, the learned senior advocate appearing for the petitioners stated that he be permitted to withdraw the petition with liberty to the petitioner to file afresh petition,” the court said.“In view of the aforesaid, the writ petition is dismissed as withdrawn with the aforesaid liberty,” the court added.Senior advocate HGS Parihar appeared on behalf of the petitioners, assisted by advocate Meenakshi Singh. Additional advocate general RK Singh appeared before the court on behalf of the state government.Opposing the writ petition, Singh told the court that the plot numbers allotted for the construction of the mosque were different from those mentioned in the petition.The state presented a letter before the HC on behalf of the Ayodhya administration, stating that the land being disputed by the petitioners was in the adjoining village of Sheikhpur Jafar, and not in Dhannipur village.The two sisters claimed in their petition that their father Gyan Chand Punjabi was allotted 28 acres in Dhannipur village by the Nazul department (responsible for government land allotments) for five years for ₹1,560 when the family moved to Faizabad district (now Ayodhya) from Punjab in Pakistan after Partition in 1947. They said their father remained in possession of the land beyond that period. Later, his name was included in the revenue records, the petitioners added. Subsequently, when his name was removed, their father filed an appeal before the additional commissioner, Ayodhya, which was allowed, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/allahabad-high-court-dismisses-plea-against-allotment-of-land-for-mosque-101612831936775.html
09-02-2021||India||Farm laws: Elderly protesters recount ’88 stir, stare at a long haul||On a bright February morning, 101-year-old Layak Ram makes for a picture of steely resolve as he speaks about the ongoing farmers’ protests against three laws enacted by the Centre in September to open up the country’s agricultural markets.“ I am not going anywhere till the farm laws are repealed,” said the centenarian, clad in a white kurta-pyjama and a grey jacket, resting against a pile of blankets inside a yellow tarpaulin tent pitched under the Delhi-Meerut expressway at the Ghazipur border.The Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border is one of the epicentres of the farmers’ 75-day-old campaign against the agricultural laws they say would erode their bargaining power, put them at the mercy of powerful agribusinesses and could lead to the dismantling of the system of minimum support prices (MSPs) for farm produce.Ram, who arrived at the Ghazipur site from Amroha, Uttar Pradesh, in November, is one of the oldest protesters in the agitation and one of the few who also participated in the late Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Mahendra Singh Tikait’s movement that brought Delhi to a halt in 1988.About half-a-million farmers from western Uttar Pradesh arrived in Delhi in October 1988 and took over the Boat Club lawns in the heart of the Capital, close to Parliament, with demands ranging from more remunerative prices for farm produce to cuts in power and water tariffs.Ram remembers that protest well. “The place had turned into a village panchayat, with charpoys, hookahs, bullock carts and buffaloes all around. That is where we cooked, ate and slept,” he said.“The difference is that then prime minister Rajiv Gandhi conceded our demands, but this government seems adamant and is just not listening to us,” added Ram, who often wags a finger in the air to make a point. A passionate storyteller, Ram lets you know that his “tryst with history” goes beyond his participation in farmers’ agitations.“I do not remember the date, but I was born in 1919, the year of the Jallianwallah Bagh massacre. Our farmers’ leader Mahendra Singh Tikait was 16 years younger to me, but he was a visionary and knew the pulse of the farmers, ”said Ram, who these days wakes up at 6 am and eats at the community kitchen set up at the protest site. “I eat my dinner at 7pm and go to bed by 8pm; it is too cold here in Delhi under the highway.”He is visibly upset at what he calls the government’s unreasonable stance. “I witnessed the struggle for the independence of this country. We have won against the British and against our own governments in the past. But today’s government is very adamant and this is going to be a long struggle.”Ram has not been in touch with his family since he arrived. He suffers from an old injury and wears a bandage around his head, which he has been told, has turned cancerous. “I have lived up to 101 years; and now I do not care if I if I die here.”Two tents ahead is another tarpaulin tent where Ram Kumar Singh, a 90-year-old farmer from Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh, is camping. Unlike Ram, Singh, joined the agitation recently, after the Republic Day.Singh too was a part of the farmers’ movement led by Tikait. And he too has many stories to share.“The then government did not use force on us to drive us out of the city like it happened on Republic Day; it bowed before the country’s farmers respecting their demands,” said Singh, his voice firm and his lips covered by a thick, drooping moustache.Singh, who suffers from blurred vision in one eye, contends that the ongoing fight is tough, but reckoned that Rakesh Tikait, the son of Mahendra Singh Tikait and the BKU’s national spokesperson, who has emerged as the face of the farmers’ campaign, will eventually lead farmers to victory. “He is determined, tenacious and tactful like his father,” said Singh.While Singh and Ram have many memories of their participation in the 1988 farmers’ agitation, Dharm Pal, a 73-year-old farmer from Baghpat, UP, proudly shows off a picture with Mahendra Singh Tikait, set as the wallpaper of his mobile phone. “It is from one of the farmers’ rallies 1994 or 1995,” he said, showing his phone screen.Pal, who is camping in Ghazipur, said he was shot with a rubber bullet during the 1988 protest. “It took me and many others days to be able to walk properly, but we are here again. Tikait was like my elder brother. He also attended my son’s wedding. This is the reason why I am here today to support his son, who is fighting for our rights,” he said.“ I was born in 1948, a year after the country got Independence. Even after so many years, the farmers of this country are forced to sit on the roads to be heard,” said the septuagenarian, smoking a hookah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-elderly-protesters-recount-88-stir-stare-at-a-long-haul-101612831691108.html
09-02-2021||India||Twitter says seeking dialogue with minister, safety of staff key||Social media company Twitter said on Monday that it has reached out to electronics and information technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad for a formal dialogue and that it had shared an update with the government after it was sent a notice for not complying with an order to restrict access to some accounts.Last week, the company restored access to 257 profiles it had temporarily blocked after an order from the government, setting up a rare confrontation with the ministry. The government later sent a notice saying Twitter was not in a position to judge the order and that it was an intermediary liable to follow directions as per the law, which could include penal provisions.“Safety of our employees is a top priority for us at Twitter. We continue to be engaged with the government of India from a position of respect and have reached out to the honourable minister for a formal dialogue. An acknowledgement to the receipt of the non-compliance notice has also been formally communicated,” a spokesperson said.It also indicated that its position on the government’s request has not changed. “We strongly believe that the open and free exchange of information has a positive global impact, and that the Tweets must continue to flow,” the spokesperson added.“We review every report we receive from the government as expeditiously as possible, and take appropriate action regarding such reports while making sure we hold firm to our fundamental values and commitment to protecting the public conversation.”People familiar with discussions at Twitter said the company was concerned of “undue penal action against its employees”. “There have been indications of possible penal action and Twitter makes its employees its top priority,” the person said, asking not to be named.A government official said that no communication had been received so far from Twitter. “We are giving them time to take action. Otherwise, the government will have to consider its options.”Last week’s confrontation began over an order to block accounts the government stated were alluding to the occurrence of a “farmer genocide”. The ministry of electronics and information technology asked the company to take down an additional 1,178 accounts that may “foment trouble” on February 4.People familiar with Twitter’s policy said that that some of the accounts mentioned by the government may draw action for being in violation of the company’s rules and such requests are routinely received by the microblogging site. “Others will get an alert that a legal demand against their account, then the company will analyse if there’s been a violation,” this person said. The alerts were likely to be issued over Monday.According to the Twitter transparency report released last month, the company received 2,800 legal demands from January 2020 to June 2020. Demands were made against 13,200 accounts, of which the company withheld only 17, while 1,200 others were found to be violating Twitter rules.The directions to block the 1,178 accounts were sent to the microblogging site at least three days ago; a second official familiar with the matter said on Monday. “Similar kinds of accounts, as the 257 flagged earlier, were identified,” this official said, asking not to be named.“Some of these seem to bots, some propped by other countries. They all aim to foment trouble and unsettle the situation.”The directions have been issued under section 69 (A) of the IT Act that allows the government to take action against posts and accounts that may pose a threat to public order.A third official stated that the accounts were flagged by security agencies as “accounts of Khalistan sympathizers or backed by Pakistan and operating from foreign territories and causing threat to public order in view of the ongoing farmers protests in some parts of India”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-says-seeking-dialogue-with-minister-safety-of-staff-key-101612831078525.html
09-02-2021||India||PM slams ‘andolanjeevi’ in Rajya Sabha farm laws defence||While warning the country against “andolanjeevis” (those who live off protests), and the influence of FDI (“foreign destructive ideology”), Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday strongly defended the recent farm laws, touted their benefits, particularly for small and marginal farmers, and reiterated the government’s commitment to modernising agricultural markets (mandis) and retaining the minimum support price (MSP)-based procurement regime.At the same time, the PM appealed to agitating farm groups to call off their protests, said all doors for suggestions and improvement remain open, and invited them for continued discussions.Responding to the debate on the motion of thanks on the President’s address in the Rajya Sabha, Modi cited the history of political backing for agricultural reforms, including by former PM Manmohan Singh, and criticised the Opposition for their “U-turn” on the issue.At a time when there is increasing criticism about India’s democratic record, the PM also called India the “mother of democracy”, and at a time when some have labelled protesting Sikh farmers as extremists, he hailed the contribution of Sikhs to nation-building and underscored the sensitivity of Punjab given its history.Modi also praised the manner in which Indian citizens battled Covid-19, spoke of the immense goodwill generated for India with its supply of medicines and now vaccines to other countries, and highlighted India’s post-Covid-19 economic recovery. On the continued stand-off with China at the Line of Actual Control, he said that India’s position was clear and there was no question of any relaxation in India’s commitment to “border security”and “border infrastructure”.Highlighting the urgency of agri reforms, which formed the core of his speech in the House, the PM said: “This is the time to make agriculture prosperous... Give the reforms a chance and see whether we benefit from it. If there is any weakness, we will remedy it..the doors are not closed... If we delay this, if we get caught up in our political calculations, we will push farmers to darkness. I pray to all of you to think about this.”The PM also warned against those he termed “andolanjeevis”. “We are familiar with shramjivi (those who labour), and buddhijivis (intellectuals). But I see that a new group has emerged in this country. If there is a lawyers movement, a students movement, a workers movement, they will be there — either in the front or behind the scenes. They cannot live without andolans (movements). They get to all places, give an ideological stand, mislead and show new ways. The country must be saved from these ‘andolanjeevis’. The interesting thing is they cannot do anything on their own but if something is happening, they will be there. They are ‘parijeevis’ (parasites).”He added that even as the country was talking about foreign direct investment (FDI), another form of FDI had emerged. “This is foreign destructive ideology. To save the country from this FDI, we need to be more aware.” The PM’s comments come in the wake of tweets by global figures — including pop icon Rihanna and environmental activist Greta Thunberg — in solidarity with farm protests, which triggered an official government response blaming “vested interests” for propaganda. At the same time, Modi emphasised the importance of Punjab. “There are people who are making constant efforts to weaken and destabilise India. Don’t forget what happened with Punjab. During Partition, Punjab suffered the worst. During 1984, the maximum tears were shed in Punjab. The most horrific incidents happened in Punjab... all governments have known who was behind it.”He also sent out a message on the Sikh community. “Some people are trying to mislead the minds of Sikhs in particular. This country is proud of every Sikh. What have they not done for this country? However much we respect them, it will be less.”Senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge said Modi’s speech did not offer any solution for the protesting farmers but tried to divert the issue. “He spoke in his own style but didn’t say a word about relief to farmers,” he said. Samyukta Kisan Morcha, the umbrella body of farmers unions, condemned the Prime Minister’s ‘”andolanjivi” remark and said it was an insult to the farmers. “Farmers would like to remind the PM that it is ‘andolans’ that have liberated India from colonial rulers and that is why we are proud to be ‘Andolan-jivi’,” a statement from the organisation said.On the laws, Modi first spoke about the scale and marginalisation of small farmers in India and cited the late farm leader and former prime minister, Chaudhary Charan Singh — this was symbolic, for it is Singh’s community, the Jats, who are currently at the forefront of the protests in Singh’s geographical base, western Uttar Pradesh. The PM said that Singh, citing the 1971 farm census, had often spoken of how 51% of Indian farmers had less than a hectare of land. This figure was now 68%, while 86% of farmers in India were small and marginal. Modi claimed that this large segment had been neglected — while big farmers got the benefits of bank loans, bank loan waivers, insurance schemes, irrigation, free power. It was his government, Modi claimed, which had expanded benefits to small and marginal farmers — through direct income assistance, expansion of Kisan credit cards and insurance scheme and initiatives such as Kisan rail and Kisan udan to enable them to reach distant markets. The PM then spoke about increasing land fragmentation and the need to generate livelihoods for members of farming families. He gave the example of the dairy sector — which contributes 28% of India’s agri economy — and said that milk and vegetable producers were able to directly get better rates from the market. “Why should foodgrain and lentil producers not have the same freedom as those who produce milk and vegetables?”Citing Manmohan Singh as having said that Indian farmers must be allowed to sell their produce where they can get higher rates of return and there should be a common agricultural market, the PM said, “Maybe those making U-turns won’t accept my view but accept his views...You should be proud that Manmohan Singh said it and Modi is doing it.” The entire discussion on the subject in the House, the PM claimed, had not been about the law but had revolved around complaints about the method and that it was hurried or there wasn’t enough consultation. “This happens. Even when there is a wedding in the family, a relative may say she was not called... this happens in such large families.” The PM also spoke about the resistance to any change as being natural — and claimed that even during the Green Revolution, the then Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri had to face opposition from his Planning Commission, from members of his cabinet including the finance minister, from Left forces (“they are using the same language today they used then”), and appointed C Subramanian as agriculture minister when other politicians feared that taking over the portfolio would antagonise farmers and jeopardise their political careers. “But the result is that from seeking food under the PL-480 (an American aid programme), our farmers did record production domestically.” Modi projected the reforms as inevitable, claiming that those parties opposing the reforms at the moment had done similar, even if partial, reforms, in their states. “We will have to explain to protesters that whoever is here will have to do it, if not today, then tomorrow. Today I have done it, tomorrow you will have to do it. Attribute the negative to me, take the credit yourself. But let us move forward.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-slams-andolanjeevi-in-rajya-sabha-farm-laws-defence-101612830718006.html
09-02-2021||India||75% pedestrian facilities unsafe, in violation of norms: Study||At least 75% of Delhi’s pedestrian facilities do not follow international standards of road safety, according to a survey by independent researchers which found that spaces meant for pedestrians were either encroached by people to feed birds or by the authorities to plant trees and place other obstructive installations.The researchers, who are alumni from IIT-Bombay, School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) and IIT-Kanpur, studied 60 traffic refuge islands in Delhi and NCR towns. They found that 57 of them were not safe for pedestrians.Traffic refuge islands are large platforms constructed at big intersections where pedestrians do not get enough time to cross over to the other side while the signal is green for them. The islands provide a safe space for pedestrians as they wait between carriageways for the traffic to clear.To be sure, in 2019, nearly 46% of the total 1,463 road accident deaths in Delhi were that of pedestrians, according to data provided by Delhi traffic police. There are over 10 million registered vehicles in Delhi.“These spaces are made in a triangular pattern so that it can hold maximum number of pedestrians. If you look at international standards of road safety, road owning agencies are not permitted to use any space. But here, we have found that these open spaces have been wrongly used for road beautification,” said Sumukhi Surendran, an independent researcher who works on traffic and road safety issues and led the survey in Delhi.The researchers studied pedestrian infrastructure in Delhi, Noida, Gurugram and Ghaziabad between October 15 and December 31.The survey found that at least 12 traffic refuge islands in central Delhi were beautified with saplings, statues or other installations, leaving little space for pedestrians to wait while the traffic signal was green for the vehicles.The safety report also found that in cases where the traffic islands were not encroached, the space was being used by local residents to feed birds and street animals.Globally, the urban design guidelines mandate that every large intersection where the time taken by pedestrians to take a complete round of the intersection is greater than three minutes, requires agencies to have refuge islands. These islands are meant to hold maximum number of pedestrians safe from the fast moving traffic. For instance, in China’s Beijing these traffic refuge islands have slopes so that pedestrians standing on the traffic island don’t face the risk of suddenly falling onto the moving traffic.In Delhi, traffic refuge islands in areas such Govindpuri, Nehru Place, CR Park and Connaught Place were found “unfit for use” because grains and bits of food was laid out for birds.Also, 32 of 50 road dividers and 12 out of 25 zebra crossings in Delhi were found in violation of the international road safety norms.“Large trees were planted on dividers in areas near Dilshad Garden, Vivek Vihar, Uttam Nagar, Greater Kailash and Jasola Vihar...which were turning out to be safety hazards for pedestrians and motorists as it blocked the view of the incoming traffic and signals. Zebra crossing in many areas was ending in Metro pillars or encroachments,” the report read.The report highlights that when a pedestrian is crossing the road, the view of the traffic signal and the incoming traffic should be clearly visible to them.“No installation or plantation should be made over or around the traffic signal. While planting saplings on the road dividers, the agencies must ensure that the canopies of the trees, once it attains the adult age, should not block the view of incoming traffic,” the report read.Maximum of these problems were found on roads under the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC). The civic body did not respond to repeated requests for a comment on the matter. The Public Works Department which also maintains large stretches of roads also refused to comment on the findings of the study.Delhi traffic police said it conducted a similar survey in 2014, listing out inaccessible pedestrian facilities and conducted a series of meetings with road maintaining agencies asking them to fix the faults.“We conduct regular meetings with local authorities to ensure that public spaces remain accessible to commuters, especially pedestrians. If trees are not pruned and posters are found blocking the view of traffic signals, such information is also shared with the civic agencies,” the traffic police said in a text response.Raghu Shaurya, a resident of south Delhi’s CR Park, who has been wheelchair-bound for over a decade, said even in upscale neighbourhoods of the city, the public facilities are not designed for people.“Road dividers and footpaths here are so high that even a normal healthy person will find it difficult to access it. Their solution for everything is to create footover bridges. Why should those on foot risk their lives and sweat extra only so that the cars can zoom faster? Every developed economy is now moving towards developing facilities that put pedestrians first,” Shaurya.Experts also agree that civic agencies need a better understanding of safe urban designs.“The problem is that there are so many agencies and even within an agency there are several departments that have little coordination among them. Aesthetics are important but so is the purpose of traffic refuge islands, zebra crossings and dividers. You cannot in the name of beautification defeat the whole purpose of a public facility. Experts need to be more actively roped in by the civic and road owning authorities before making such decisions,” said Sewa Ram, from School of Planning and Architecture.Gurugram-based urban design and infrastructure expert Khushbu Prasad said a thorough audit of road infrastructure and public spaces should be conducted. “In 2012, when the Delhi Metro construction was on, we conducted a survey for the Delhi government and found that many zebra crossings were ending with Metro pillars. Our public spaces are designed only for cars, pedestrians feature way down in the hierarchy,” said Prasad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/75-pedestrian-facilities-unsafe-in-violation-of-norms-study-101612830137371.html

The court said that stringent action was taken in the past by suspending advocates when the issue was prevalent and it was subsequently brought under control. “It looks like the lockdown period (due to Covid-19), has again revived this despicable practice and once again some advocates are indulging in illegal activities of grabbing properties,” the court said, vowing to bring it under control again.The petitioner, PS Kirubakaran, approached the court as the plea said police protection wasn’t given to the property due to the presence of advocates despite a disruption in law and order. In its interim order on Monday, the court directed the police authority to provide protection to the property. The court said that advocates’ participation was evident from photographs submitted and called for the advocates to be identified. “This report will form the basis for this Court to give a complaint before the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry against the concerned advocates,” the court stated. The matter has now been posted for March 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/zero-tolerance-for-lawyers-who-spoil-image-of-profession-madras-high-court-101612828740352.html
09-02-2021||India||Sasikala announces return to Tamil Nadu politics||Spelling more trouble for the already jittery All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), expelled general secretary V K Sasikala, a close aide to the late party supremo J Jayalalithaa, returned to Chennai with fanfare on Monday, announced her return to politics and urged the party cadre to unite to take on common foe M.K. Stalin’s Dravida Munnetra Kaqzhagam (DMK) in upcoming assembly elections.Sasikala, who last month finished serving a four-year prison term in Bengaluru after her conviction in a disproportionate assets case and was treated for Covid-19, read aloud from notes she had prepared on a stopover in the Tamil Nadu town of Vaniyambadi.“My intention is that everyone must work in unity and not let the common enemy capture the throne,” she told reporters and hundreds of supporters who greeted her, referring to the DMK. “The party has faced several struggles and risen like a phoenix in the past,” she said referring to the work done by founder MG Ramachandran and his successor Jayalalithaa, who died in December 2016.Sasikala’s release from prison and her return to Chennai ahead of the assembly elections adds an intriguing new factor to the political dynamics of Tamil Nadu, where the DMK and the Congress are preparing to take on the AIADMK and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), While she was in prison, the AIADMK expelled her from the party, and said she wouldn’t be taken back into the party’s fold.Sasikala left Bengaluru on Monday morning and received a rousing reception on her way by car to Chennai. She made several pit stops to greet thousands of her supporters and cadre of the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) a breakaway faction of the AIADMK formed by her nephew TTV Dhinakaran. Supporters played music, drones carried banners greeting her and her car was garlanded.Sasikala isn’t a political novice although she has never contested or campaigned in elections and the Representation of People’s Act, 1951 bars her from contesting or holding any constitutional post for the next six years. In her three-decade-long association with Jayalalithaa, Sasikala cultivated her own constituency within the AIADMK, particularly among the Thevar community, which remains a loyal vote bank of the party.She quoted a song from MGR’s 1977 Tamil film to say that she is enslaved by the people’s affection but will not yield to oppression. Clad in a green saree-- a colour Jayalalithaa often wore-- Sasikala sat inside her car, bearing an AIADMK flag undeterred by police complaints by AIADMK leaders against her, for using the party flag.Sasikala switched two cars during her journey- one reportedly belonging to an AIADMK functionary. Responding to a question by reporter, AIADMK spokesperson and minister D Jayakumar said: “There will be a few betrayers; it is negligible. It will not affect the party.” AIADMK has announced multiple times that it won’t take Sasikala back nor will it merge with AMMK.Sasaikala briefly held the reins of the AIADMK, between Jayalalithaa’s death and her imprisonment in the disproportionate assets case in February 2017. Her former loyalists-- chief minister Edapaddi Palaniswami and his deputy O Paneerselvam -- turned against her at different points of time and buried their own factional rivalries to unite against Sasikala.Since her release, Dhinakaran has insisted that Sasikala remains the general secretary and her supporters will help her reclaim the AIADMK. Dhinakaran, who is an independent MLA, led the AMMK in the 2019 parliamentary polls with a 4% vote share.AIADMK ministers have filed two complaints with the director general of police’s office against Sasikala for using the party flag and of her supposed plans to disrupt law and order. On Sunday night, the government took ownership of six properties belonging to J Ilavarasi and VN Sudhakaran, Sasikala’s relatives and co-accused in the disproportionate assets case. Security has bee tightened at the AIADMK headquarters in Chennai, Jayalalithaa’s Veda Nilayam residence which the government has converted into a memorial and her burial place on the Marina beach is closed to the public to keep Sasikala from places associated with Jayalalithaa. AIADMK on Monday night expelled seven party functionaries for ‘anti-party activities’. They reportedly participated in welcome rallies and Sasikala had even travelled in car belonging to one of the members, D Dakshinamurthy from Thiruvallur district.“AIADMK has overreacted,” said political commentator Sriram Seshadri. “They should have let Sasikala pitch for herself first. Or they could have said that she is welcome to work like any other cadre for the party. That would have put her in a spot and public perception of Palaniswami would have been elevated. But now their fear has been exposed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sasikala-announces-return-to-tamil-nadu-politics-101612828746555.html

Mishra demanded that the police remove anti-CAA protesters within three days. The Delhi Police, in their charge sheets, have acknowledged that two groups of pro-CAA and anti-CAA protesters clashed at Jafrabad at the start of the riots. They did not mention Mishra’s name.The matter will be heard next on March 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-riots-police-seeks-report-on-plea-seeking-fir-against-kapil-mishra-101612828789374.html
09-02-2021||India||Ex-servicemen to help CISF secure sensitive installations||The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) that secures airports and other sensitive government installations in the country will soon have to induct ex-servicemen, who will assist the paramilitary force on a contractual basis.The appointments are being made on an experimental basis, on the directions of the ministry of home affairs, officials in the know of the matter said. To start with, 2,000 ex-forces personnel will be posted at 13 PSUs (public sector undertakings) across the country, including thermal power plants and coal fields.An order, dated February 5, 2021, issued from the office of the director-general of the CISF, said the ministry of home affairs has directed the deployment of ex-servicemen in the CISF in the ratio of 75:25 (75% CISF staff and 25% contractual staff) at selected units by engaging 2,000 ex-forces personnel in different posts on an experimental basis.The order, seen by HT, mentions 13 PSUs at which these veterans are to be posted. The locations include South Eastern Coalfields Limited (SECL) in Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh; Anpara thermal power plant in Uttar Pradesh; Oil and Natural Gas Corporation in Nazira, Assam; and Raichur Thermal Power Station in Karnataka. So far, none of the 13 selected locations is in Delhi.The order further states, “The deployment in these selected units in the above ratio will be reviewed by MHA after six months and 12 months for considering further expansion of such deployment at other units.” The force is also inviting applications from eligible candidates.Deputy inspector general (operations) Anil Kumar Pandey said these personnel will be used for “non-core” duties.“They will be unarmed and assist our men. They will be deployed at places that are not sensitive from the security point of view,” Pandey said.However, an officer who is not authorized to speak to the media, said the appointments of ex-servicemen will be done on four posts – constable, head constable, assistant sub inspector and sub-inspector. Only those below the age of 50 years will be considered for appointment, based on their fitness, and provided they match the physical requirement, the officer said.“For the post of sub-inspector, ex-servicemen who have served in the rank of subedar or above will be considered. Similarly, naib subedar and above will be considered for the post of assistant sub-inspector and havildar and above will be eligible for the post of head constable. Sepoys will be considered for constables,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/exservicemen-to-help-cisf-secure-sensitive-installations-101612828798377.html
09-02-2021||India||Uttarakhand flash flood: Rescuers struggle to reach trapped men||Luck played a part in the timely rescue of 12 workers from one end of the 1.7km-long tunnel of NTPC Limited’s hydropower project in Uttarakhand’s Tapovan in the immediate aftermath of the flash flood on Sunday. The rescuers toiled for at least four hours to remove the waist-deep slush from the tunnel’s exit; then an engineer employed at the project alerted the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) about an escape door located about 300 feet away from the exit that could serve as an extraction point for the workers.Thereafter, it took ITBP men just about 90 minutes to rescue the dozen workers, three of whom were unconscious, and all of suffering from hypothermia. Importantly, all were alive.But as the sun set over the snow-capped mountain peaks, so did the luck of the rescuers. When it came to saving workers -- at least 37 of them -- trapped at the other end of the tunnel, the rescuers continued to labour till well into the day on Monday, in an effort to reach them.“We believe the workers are trapped at least 200 metres inside the tunnel. The only choice we have is to use an earth mover to remove the slush, one scoop at a time. We have been able to move 50 metres (into the tunnel) so far (until Monday afternoon). Unlike the other end of the tunnel, there is no safety valve on this side,” said Benudhar Nayak, commandant of ITBP first Batallion, who is overseeing the operations along with teams of NDRF and the Indian Army.About 8km from this spot, in Raini village, another group of rescuers is removing slush in front of a smaller hydropower project that was completely washed away by the flash flood, but their progress has been slow. “There is no rescue going on here. We are just hoping to recover bodies that may be trapped in the gates of the power plant,” said Sumit Kalkhudiya, an Indian Army officer.That the floods happened on a Sunday helped save lives.On Sundays, just about half the staff work at the two project sites. At the Tapovan site, about 150 workers were on duty and at Raini site, about 50.At Tapovan, around 50 men were working in the tunnel; the others were deployed elsewhere. But when the water and debris came gushing down the Dhauli Ganga river around 10.45am, all workers, in the tunnel and out of it, were all under water level.As the flash flood roared, many workers tried to run up the hill. Some succeeded. Others were washed away within seconds. And some others were trapped in the tunnel.THE TUNNEL According to rescuers and workers, the 1.7 km-long slanting tunnel under construction is about 20 feet high and 15 feet wide. “Inside, the main tunnel is joined by another tunnel about 300 metres long,” said Harinder Singh, a welder at the project who helplessly watched from the road above as many of his friends and colleagues were washed away or trapped inside.When the flood hit, the tunnel was quickly filled with water, mud and debris. The rescuers, who arrived at the scene a little after noon, and began by focusing on the tunnel’s exit as it was down the slope and had much less slush than at the entrance. At that time, the rescuers weren’t sure how many workers were trapped at that end.“Since this end of the tunnel was difficult to access with our machines, we used wooden planks and steel sheets to reach the entrance. Then we used basic tools to keep removing the slush. We weren’t making much progress when an engineer walked up to us and mentioned an escape door, about 8 by 8 feet, on the side of the tunnel,” said Nayak.The rescue was briefly halted as villagers used whistle to warn about the water level rising again, but the operation resumed soon.THE BREAKTHROUGH “In the next 45 minutes, we were able to locate the escape door amid the slush, broke it open, and removed the iron mesh,” Nayak added.The rescuers found the workers trapped just about 30-40 feet away from the valve. “Many of them had lost their shoes, and three of them were waist deep in the slush, but they had all held on to iron grills inside,” said Kalam Singh Negi, head constable with ITBP.The rescuers threw ropes to the trapped workers, but they were so weak, tired and affected by the cold that they couldn’t grab them.“One of our officers then entered the tunnel to tie each of them with ropes before we pulled them out,” said Negi. By the time the last of the men inside was brought out, it was 5.45pm on Sunday.Three of the rescued men were unconscious. The others were suffering from hypothermia. Some raised their arms to celebrate their rescue.“They were all shivering. Some of them begged us for hot water. We washed them with warm water, gave them necessary injections, dressed them in ITBP uniforms and used our phones to help them make video calls to their families,” said Maneesh Chandra, an ITBP constable.BACK TO DESPAIR The other end of the tunnel, meanwhile, remained inaccessible despite the use of earth movers.Initially, three earth movers of various types worked to remove the slush at the entrance of the tunnel, but once the entrance was breached, the progress slowed since only one machine could work at once.ITBP officers estimated that the workers trapped on this side were about 200 metres into the tunnel. The workers, however, estimated that they were trapped at least 500 metres inside. “At the rate the work is going on, it could take up to a week to rescue them. It is so cold even out in the sun, I don’t know if my brother will make it,” said Joginder Tamta, whose brother, a worker at the site, is trapped inside. The two are from Chamoli.Every now and then, Tamta dialled his brother’s phone number. “Often it is switched off. But sometimes the number comes across as busy. That is the only thing that has kept me hopeful,” said Tamta, squatting in anticipation a few hundred metres from the rescue site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-flash-flood-rescuers-struggle-to-reach-trapped-men-101612828805472.html
09-02-2021||India||Farm protests: Additional deployment at Delhi borders withdrawn||Additional deployment of Delhi Police personnel at the three borders points of Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur, where farmers are camping for over two months to protest against the three farm laws,was withdrawn from Monday evening. The security arrangements in these places will now be taken care of by personnel belonging to the police districts concerned, senior police officers privy to the development said.Hundreds of personnel from various Delhi Police units such as crime, police control room (PCR), railways, vigilance, economic offences wing (EOW), licensing, headquarters, and police training college (PTC), were mobilised to the three borders points on security duty during the farmers’ tractor rally on January 26 and the chakka jam call on February 6.On Monday, special commissioner of police (operations and licensing) Muktesh Chandra issued a message, referred to as TPM, to all the units and their heads regarding the withdrawal of the internal mobilisation done for the farmers’ rally and law and order duty.The entire staff have been told to return to their respective units from Tuesday.“The available resources in the districts concerned will now be used to maintain law and order and security at the farmers’ agitation sites. They will be assisted by personnel from the paramilitary forces,” said a senior police officer, who did not want to be named.Deputy commissioner of police (outer-north) Rajeev Ranjan said, “The situation at the Singhu border is under control and peaceful. We have adequate force deployed round-the-clock at the border to deal with any contingency.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-protests-additional-deployment-at-delhi-borders-withdrawn-101612828812409.html
09-02-2021||India||Ascertain whereabouts of man who went missing during tractor rally: HC to police||The Delhi high court on Monday asked the Delhi Police to ascertain the whereabouts of a 27-year-old man, who had allegedly gone missing from the Nangloi area during the tractor rally on Republic Day, held by farmers protesting against the Centres three farm laws.A bench of justice Siddharth Mridul and justice Anup J Bhambhani directed the police to update it about the whereabouts of the missing man, Bajinder, on a plea filed by his cousin Baljeet.Baljeet in his complaint said his brother was missing since January 26 when he had participated in the rally. He also raised the suspicion that the police had “illegally detained” Bajinder since they were deliberately putting off the registering of a missing person complaint.Baljeet said he had tried searching for his brother in the neighbouring areas and have also contacted all relatives and friends, but Bajinder could not be found nor traced. Baljeet said he went to the Nangloi police station multiple times for registration of a missing person complaint.“…however to his complete shock, the police refused to register any missing person complaint and further failed to take any action on his plea.“The inaction and negligent attitude have led to the apprehension that the brother of the petitioner (Bajinder) has been illegally detained by the police and therefore, they are deliberately resisting the writing of any official complaint / FIR and providing any information…,”the plea said.The court listed the matter for February 9.The tractor parade on January 26, which was to highlight the demands of the farmer unions currently sitting on a protest at Delhi’s borders, had resulted in violence in the national capital. Thousands of protesters had allegedly broke through barriers, and hoisted a religious flag from the ramparts of the Red Fort.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ascertain-whereabouts-of-man-who-went-missing-during-tractor-rally-hc-to-police-101612828033671.html
09-02-2021||India||Uttarakhand flash floods: At least 26 dead, 171 still missing amid rescue ops||Rescue workers dug through a mountain of mud and slush on Monday to free people trapped under debris of devastating flash floods in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli as the toll of the worst disaster to hit the Himalayan region in eight years climbed to 26, with 171 still missing.At least 1,000 disaster response, military and paramilitary personnel worked to clear a 1.7-km tunnel in the badly hit hydroelectric power project of Tapovan, where at least 35 people are still stranded in waist-deep muck.The surging waters washed away homes, damaged two major dams, cut off 13 villages, and snapped crucial road links and bridges that connect far-flung areas in the mountainous region.“The rescue workers have recovered total 26 bodies with about 171 still missing, which includes 11 villagers and two cops, while remaining ones are workers from the two dam sites,” said state director general of police Ashok Kumar, who is monitoring the rescue operation.The disaster is the worst to hit the state since the 2013 Kedarnath floods killed 5,700 people and highlighted the impact of the climate crisis and degradation of the fragile ecology.It struck at 9.30am on Sunday when a glacier breach under the Nanda Devi, the country’s second-highest peak, sent a torrent of water, rock and dust down a valley into the Rishiganga river, where workers were building a dam.Visuals showed the muddy floodwaters smashing most of the plant and inundating bridges before roaring downstream into the Dhauliganga and partially damaging the National Thermal Power Corporation’s 530 MW Tapovan Vishnugrad project, roughly 8 km away.Manish Kumar, a worker in Tapovan, was standing outside the tunnel that would later trap most of his colleagues, but sprinted up a hill when he noticed a dense plume of smoke and rumbling waters. “Those who turned around to see were washed away,” he said on Monday.The tragedy left columns of slush and debris in its wake, strewn across at least 30km downstream, where authorities had to airdrop ration packets to stranded villagers.“There was a very loud and scary noise. I turned around to see water and debris gushing towards us. It was as if the mountains were crumbling,” said Godambari Devi, a resident of Raini village who was tending to her apple trees when the tragedy struck.Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, Union power minister RK Sinha, Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’, and other senior politicians visited the site.“The rescue work is going on at all possible speed. We will leave no stone unturned to help the needy ones with the Centre also assuring all the help needed,” said Rawat.In Delhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met a delegation of state MPs and assured them that the Centre was working to strengthen infrastructure there to deal with any natural disaster in the future.According to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Anil Baluni, a Rajya Sabha member from the state, Modi said the central government stood with Uttarkhand’s people and was monitoring ongoing rescue operations. Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP president JP Nadda were present at the meeting.At Dehradun, Sinha said Tapovan suffered a loss of about ₹1,500 crore but ruled out the possibility of scrapping the project.“It (NTPC Tapovan project) was supposed to be commissioned by 2023 but now it is obvious that the target year would be pushed ahead. However, we have no intention to scrap the project with the main focus right now on the rescue operation,” said Sinha.The rescue operation was helmed by 300 personnel of the state and national disaster response force, and 700 personnel from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), and army. On Sunday, they had rescued 12 people stuck in a small tunnel at the NTPC dam site.“Of about 120 workers missing from NTPC dam, the labour contractor is unable to inform us about the identities of 100 labourers. Right now, we are focusing on clearing muck from the tunnel where about 35 workers are feared to be trapped inside,” said Kumar. On Sunday, 12 workers were rescued from one end of the tunnel with authorities saying far fewer workers were on duty because it was a Sunday.He said rescue workers were scanning the Alaknanda river to find bodies and visiting the affected villages to provide them relief. “The SDRF teams are scanning the river on motorboat and walking on the riverside to find bodies,” Kumar added.At the 13.2 MW Rishiganga dam site, rescuers were more sombre as they cut slowly through the slush. “There is no rescue going on here. We are just hoping to recover bodies that may be trapped in the gates of the power plant,” said Sumit Kalkhudiya, an army officer.Experts differed on what triggered the disastrous flash floods. US-based scientists who looked at satellite images suggested it was caused by a landslide onto a glacier which led to debris flooding the river.But a group of Indian scientists said there was no landslide or avalanche but pointed at the possibility of a glacial lake that led to the breach. They said release of water from an underground glacial lake led to flash floods and inundation in the valley.The landslide theory was backed by Rawat, who told reporters that scientists of Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) revealed to him that the tragedy was caused by a mix of snow and rock avalanche and that satellite images have shown no glacier breakage.“It was due to lakhs of metric tonnes of snow sliding down abruptly from a trigger point on top of a naked hill,” he said.Still, many flood victims in the upper reaches of Uttarakhand blamed unchecked construction and environmental damage for the tragedy. “When you dig all around and use gunpowder to shake the mountains, this is what happens. No one in these villages was infected by coronavirus, but a man-made tragedy has left six villagers dead,” said Rajni Bhandari, the Chamoli Zilla Parishad president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-flash-floods-at-least-26-dead-171-still-missing-amid-rescue-ops-101612828040432.html
09-02-2021||India||Survivors recall striking rarity of floods in winter||The first sign of trouble at NTPC Limited’s hydropower project in Tapovan on Sunday morning was a power failure that forced all machines to come to a halt .Exactly five minutes later, 27-year-old Manish Kumar, a workman at the site, heard people shout “baadh, baadh (flood, flood)”. Even as he was thinking about the improbability of a flood striking in winters, he noticed something that resembled dense smoke.Kumar was standing right outside the entrance of a tunnel that would later emerge to be a trap for many of his friends and colleagues.Without another thought, Kumar sprinted up the unpaved and slushy path that led uphill. He didn’t turn around until he was at a safe spot up the hill. Two others who were right behind him weren’t as lucky.“Those who turned around to see the situation were washed away. People behind me were shouting for help, but they couldn’t have been helped,” said Kumar on Monday afternoon as he waited in hope for his roommate, Mahendra, to be rescued from the tunnel.Sunday was supposed to be a holiday for most workers. Many of them would visit the Joshimath market, about 25 km away, to shop, eat , or simply walk around. But there were quite a few who were called in to put in an extra day of work. Kumar and Mahendra were among such workers.While the workers at the hydropower plants along the stretch of the Dhauli Ganga river, anticipate trouble during the monsoons, they let their guard down in the winter months.So, when the tragedy struck, none of was prepared.“There was a group of workers sitting on an excavator and a truck right next to the dam. When the water and debris came gushing down, most were immediately swept away, but two of them managed to escape,” said Harinder Singh, a welder who watched the tragedy unfold from a safe distance on his day off.“Both of them managed to catch hold of thick cables dangling near them. As the water rose up, the two men climbed higher and swung themselves onto the hill nearby. They both survived,” said Singh.Then there were a few workers who tried to save themselves by holding each other to form chains.“There were seven-eight of them holding on to each other. In about 30 seconds, each of them was swept away,” said Manish Pant, who too survived, thanks to his weekly off.The Tapovan hydropower plant was totally destroyed. Many workers have left for their homes, while others have stayed on hoping to see their friends rescued or to help recover their bodies.Those working that day included engineers overseeing operations, specialists and casual labourers hired for odd-jobs and to do the heavy lifting.Downstream up the Tapovan site is Raini village where at least six residents are believed to have died. One of them was 76-year-old Amrita Devi, who was tending to her apple trees along with her grandson and daughter-in-law, Godambari Devi, near a 90-metre0long bridge when the tragedy struck.“There was a very loud and scary noise. I turned around to see water and debris gushing towards us. It was as if the mountains were crumbling,” Godambari said.As her 15-year-old son sprinted to safety, Godambari turned towards her mother-in-law to warn her. “I had just stretched out my hand towards her when the strong wind accompanying the flood threw me away. The next moment, I saw my mother-in-law covered by the debris from all sides,” she said.By the time Godambari regained her senses, there was no sign of the hydropower plant towering above her moments ago. Also missing was the bridge that connected the Niti Valley, near the Indo-China border, to the rest of India. A pillar with a few broken rods at one end of the bridge was all that remained.Raini village was the first point where the severity of the flash floods was first noticed on Sunday. “Since the river gets very narrow here, the impact was much higher,” said Shobha Rana, the village chief.Residents of Raini village, which played an important role during the Chipko Movement in 1973, blamed the “ched-chaad” (meddling) with the environment for the tragedy. “When you dig all around and use gunpowder to shake the mountains, this is what happens. No one in these villages was infected by Coronavirus, but a man-made tragedy has left six villagers dead,” said Rajni Bhandari, the Chamoli Zilla Parishad president.Devaki Devi, a homemaker, blamed the demolition of a Kali temple in the village during the construction of the power project last year for the flash floods. “We’ll have to rebuild the temple.”While the flow of water to the river has returned to normal, it has completely changed the lay of the land.“There was a boulder the size of a large truck in the river below,” said Birju Singh, a restaurant owner in Hailang, about 30 km downstream from Tapovan“I can’t find it today.” .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/survivors-recall-striking-rarity-of-floods-in-winter-101612811190420.html
09-02-2021||India||Path to a just transition to lower CO2 emissions||Data released last month by Carbon Monitor, a global collaboration of research groups, showed that global carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production fell 4.4% in 2020 compared to 2019. This was likely a result of global lockdowns imposed to control the Covid-19 pandemic. Even at the time these lockdowns were imposed, an improvement in indicators of air quality raised hopes that a world with lower emissions from burning of fossil fuels was not an unachievable target. Continuing this trend of lower CO2 emissions, however, will also have socio-economic consequences, such as workers in fossil-fuel based power plants or in coal mines falling out of the workforce. An HT analysis of various data sets shows what such a path will entail for India.1. Which sectors contribute the most to CO2 emissions?Preparing for the socio-economic impact of CO2 emissions requires an understanding of which sector will be affected the most. The reduction in CO2 emissions in India in 2020 compared to 2019 was 8.3%, according to the Carbon Monitor dataset. Electricity generation played an important role in that reduction. The decline in CO2 emissions from the sector was a quarter (24.5%) of the total decline. It is also the sector that contributes most to such emissions in India; the daily average share being 46.6% in 2019. As India makes a transition to cleaner fuels, it will likely be the sector where a large share of workers will be impacted directly.2. Which states will have to work hardest to shift fossil fuel jobs?The Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) gives six sub-classes of industries that are directly related to electric power generation. Of these, two are based on fossil fuels: coal and non-coal (diesel, gas, for instance) based thermal power plants. Coal and lignite mining can also be considered to be part of this, although parts of it also fuel industries other than those related to electric power generation. Power generation industries listed in the PLFS that do not rely on fossil fuels are those related to hydroelectric power generation, solar energy and other non-conventional sources.The fossil-fuel based power generation industries had a three-fourth share (73.8%) in the total number of jobs in all the power generation industries listed above in 2018-19, according to PLFS. These jobs, however, were not equally distributed across the country. Workers of the industry had a higher share among workers of states such as Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and Telangana and a very low share in states such as Haryana, Tamil Nadu, and Rajasthan. States with a higher share of such workers will have to make the most effort to transfer them to other jobs.States such as Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, and Jharkhand have an incentive for making this transition. They are likely to face a big decline in living standards (measured by per capita consumption expenditure) due to the climate crisis by 2050 itself, as per data from a World Bank report on climate crisis hot spots. Others such as Telangana, West Bengal, or Karnataka may not have to contend with such problems. So they will need other kinds of incentives to bear the pain of job losses.3. Can clean energy jobs replace coal jobs?A way in which job losses can be avoided is by shifting workers from coal-based power plants to industries related to power generation from cleaner energy. The current educational level of workers suggests that such a shift will require a massive re-training exercise.Compared to industries that generate electricity without fossil fuels, a much larger proportion of workers in fossil-fuel based power generation industries are either illiterate or literate below primary level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/path-to-a-just-transition-to-lower-co2-emissions-101612819859591.html
09-02-2021||India||Supreme Court says society must learn to accept intercaste, interfaith marriages||The Supreme Court on Monday underscored the right of the adults to choose their life partner, and added that it is time society learns to accept inter-caste and inter-faith marriages without hounding the couples.A Supreme Court bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy further noted that it would “hardly be a desirable social exercise” for parents to shun their children only because they decided to marry outside their caste or community.The judges, in their order, also emphasised the need for specific guidelines and a training module for policemen to deal with such “socially sensitive cases”, so that couples can get due protection available to them under the law should the parents lodge criminal cases against them.It took note that “educated young boys and girls are increasingly choosing their life partner on their own”, which might be viewed as a deviation by the society and the parents, but the police authorities were duty-bound to keep such couples out of harm’s way if there was no violation of the law.The apex court’s comments are significant because they come in the wake of controversial ordinances passed by Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh that can be misused to obstruct inter-faith marriages.The bench was hearing a case of an inter-caste marriage from Karnataka; the couple approached the top court, seeking protection from a criminal case lodged by the woman’s father.The woman, 28, is from Karnataka while the man, 26, is from Uttar Pradesh. They fell in love while being trained for their jobs as assistant professor and lecturer in a college, and decided to get married. The woman’s parents strongly opposed this alliance. Her father filed a missing persons complaint lodged; this was converted into an FIR at Belagavi in Karnataka.The couple rushed to the Supreme Court for protection, which stayed the first information report (FIR) by an order in December last year, and sought a response from the Karnataka government.On Monday, advocate Subhranshu Padhi, appearing for the state government, informed the bench that the woman was yet to record her statement before at the concerned police station in Belagavi about her consensual relationship with the man concerned, and hence the investigation into the father’s complaint was still underway.But the bench questioned Padhi as to why the investigating officer did not accept the woman’s request to record her statement at a place of her choice so that she could feel safe.Advocate Prabhat Kumar Rai, who represented the couple, referred to the woman’s letter to the investigating officer and various other senior police officials in Karnataka. These letters disclosed that the couple were married in October 2020; and she also sent a copy of her marriage certificate. “The woman feared for her safety if she were to go to Belagavi for recording her statement. The right to marry a person of (one’s) own choice is an integral part of Article 21 (right to life and liberty),” added Rai.Lamenting the attitude of the police officer, the court said the investigating officer should receive counselling and that the Karnataka government must consider conducting a training programme for all its police officers to sensitise them about such cases. The bench observed that it was desirable for all the police departments to lay down guidelines for handling such cases.It regretted that the parents of the woman opposed the choice of their daughter even though both the man and the woman were highly qualified, independent professionals and Hindus, but not of the same caste and not from the same state.Quashing the FIR, the bench stated that once two adults chose to be with each other and had a consensual relationship, they could not be made accused in a criminal case only on account of their parents’ refusal to accept their relationship.“We hope that the parents of the petitioner no.1 (woman) will have better sense and accept the marriage to re-establish social ties with their daughter and her husband. That, we think, is the only way forward,” recorded the court in its order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-says-society-must-learn-to-accept-intercaste-interfaith-marriages-101612813613037.html
09-02-2021||India||Work on Anand Vihar RRTS station begins; it will be a multimodal hub: Officials||The National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) has started construction of the Anand Vihar station on the Regional Rapid Transit System’s Delhi-Meerut corridor with the NCRTC officials stating that the station will be developed as a multimodal hub.On the 82km Delhi-Meerut corridor, there will be 22 RRTS stations, of which four will be in Delhi, including the one at Anand Vihar.A NCRTC spokesperson said, “We have commenced the construction work on Anand Vihar RRTS station. Activities such as soil investigation, identification and diversion of utilities are underway. Tunnel boring work is expected to start in the second half of the year.”Anand Vihar is an important transit point in the national capital as it already has a railway station, an interstate bus terminal, and two metro corridors ---the Blue Line (Vaishali to Dwarka) and the Pink Line (Majlis Park to Shiv Vihar).Another NCRTC official, on condition of anonymity, said, “We have started the work to construct the RRTS station at Anand Vihar which will be developed as a multimodal hub. The station will be connected to the railway station, the two metro stations and the interstate bus terminal to provide seamless connectivity to users.”Officials said the Anand Vihar RRTS station has been designed to seamlessly integrate with Delhi Metro corridors. “The construction of this station will be technologically complex as RRTS trains will pass underneath the DMRC’s line 4 (Blue Line). Anand Vihar RRTS station’s concourse level entry will be adjoining the Delhi Metro entry. Further, the RRTS station will have multimodal integration with Anand Vihar railway station, the Anand Vihar ISBT and the Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation’s Kaushambi bus adda,” said the official.Apart from Anand Vihar, NCRTC has also started construction of stations at Sarai Kale Khan and New Ashok Nagar, both part of the 82km corridor to Meerut.The agency is also constructing a 1.35km long bridge over the Yamuna in Delhi, which will be almost parallel to the existing Delhi-Noida-Direct Flyway. “That bridge will connect the Sarai Kale Khan and New Ashok Nagar RRTS stations,” the official said.The section over the river will be around 626 metres long. “The bridge will be constructed using box girders. It will have 32 piers and each span over these piers will be 44m long. The work on the well foundation, for the construction of piers, has started,” the official added.“All construction activities are being carried out following the prescribed guidelines to avoid any adverse impact on the floodplains. Various eco-friendly measures will also be taken during the construction. The muck and debris generated would be disposed of systematically and no dumping will be done on the floodplains,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/work-on-anand-vihar-rrts-station-begins-it-will-be-a-multimodal-hub-officials-101612811174378.html
09-02-2021||India||DDA, NHAI working to expedite work on Delhi’s third Ring Road||New Delhi: The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) are working to expedite construction work on the Urban Extension Road-II, also termed as the third Ring Road, which will connect four national highways ( NH-1, 10, 8 and 2) and provide seamless access between north, northwest Delhi and IGI airport and Gurugram, officials aware of the development said.The over ₹7,700 crore-project, which was conceived by DDA in 2016 but later handed over to NHAI in 2018, failed to take off due to financial issues. NHAI, which invited bids for the project in December 2019, asked the DDA to pay for the viability gap funding worth ₹4,000 crore, as the project was turning out to be costly. A senior DDA official said the solution to the financial viability has been worked out.A senior NHAI official said, “It is an expensive project. We are exploring possibilities to make it financially viable.” However, a senior DDA official said, “The financial viability issue has been resolved.”The NCT of Delhi is a massive metropolitan area where five national highways ( NH-1, 2, 38, 310 and 324) converge. Delhi has over 10 million registered vehicles and faces a major challenge to curb severe traffic congestion and rising air pollution.Of the total 75.71-kms, 43kms (approx) will be constructed in Delhi. The total cost of the project has been estimated at ₹7,715.6 crore. This includes the cost of constructing highways towards Sonipat and Bahadurgarh from UER-II.UER-II was proposed in the Master Plan of Delhi 2021. The DDA, which had planned the initial project, couldn’t implement it due to land acquisition-related issues mainly in Khanjhawla, Najafgarh and other rural villages.The road will start from NH-1 near Mukarba intersection, cross NH-10, Rohini, Dwarka, NH-8 near Rajokri and end on NH-2, as per DDA’s initial plan. Later, NHAI added two highways towards Sonipat and Bahadurgarh.The Sonipat road link will connect UER-II with Barwasni bypass (near Sonipat). An NHAI official said this road will help reduce traffic load on NH-1, as this will provide an alternative route between Delhi and Sonipat.The road towards Bahadurgarh bypass will be an additional road link connecting Delhi, Bahadurgarh and Rohtak. An NHAI official said, it will help in decongesting the NH 10 section between Outer Ring Road and Mundka. Currently, the only road link connecting west Delhi, Dwarka, Gurgaon, IGI Airport, Dhaula Kuan and South Delhi is NH 10 section between Peeragrahi (Outer Ring Road) and Bahadurgarh bypass.To decongest the city, especially the Ring Road and Outer Ring Road, experts say that it is important to develop road infrastructure in urban extensions so that traffic coming from north and northwest Delhi doesn’t have to take Ring Road to reach south Delhi or the Delhi airport.Transport expert S Velmurugan, the chief scientist at CSIR-Central Road Research Institute, said, “The Eastern and Western peripheral expressways act as a broad buffer, as Delhi-bound traffic doesn’t have to enter Delhi now. The third ring road will just add one more layer of buffer and ease traffic on Ring Road and Outer Ring road, as traffic from north and northwest Delhi need not come to Dhaula Kuan to go to IGI airport or Gurugram.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dda-nhai-working-to-expedite-work-on-delhi-s-third-ring-road-101612810232492.html
09-02-2021||India||Uttarakhand: Breach, avalanche? Cause of flood divides scientists||There was no consensus till Monday evening on what exactly may have triggered the disastrous flash flood in the Rishiganga valley on Sunday. At least 26 people have died and 171 were still missing till the time of going to print.US-based scientists who looked at satellite images suggested it was caused by a landslide onto a glacier which led to debris flooding the river, while Dan Shugar of the University of Calgary suggested a landslide triggered an ice avalanche.Not everyone agrees. Jimmy Kansal, deputy director, The Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation, said: “There was no landslide or avalanche. There could be a glacial lake which led to the breach, but we are still investigating that.”The glacial lake theory (which means the flooding was what is called a glacial lake outburst flood, or Glof) is supported by scientists at the Divecha Centre for Climate Change at Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, who say they have found clues to the origin of the flash floods. The team has concluded that release of water from an underground glacial lake led to flash floods and inundation in the valley.Glacial lakes are typically formed when a glacier retreats, with the water collecting in the area where the glacier used to be, and dammed by the moraine (or material such as rocks left behind by the glacier). There are also instances of glacial lakes being damned by ice. When the dam bursts, it causes a Glof, resulting in flooding downstream, which is exactly what happened in this case.The team at Divecha Centre used a tool to map the depression in the bedrock below the north Nanda Devi glacier and said the data suggests a depression of 25 ha upstream of the glacier terminus.This underground lake has a capacity to store 4.5 million cubic metres of water. The lower part of the ablation zone (zone of the glacier which has melted or calved and formed a lake), the scientists added, receives a significant amount of water from a tributary glacier located at the northern side of the Nanda Devi glacier. “If this depression filled with water develops appropriate hydrostatic pressure, it can accelerate the lower part of the ablation zone, possibly releasing water from the underground lake. It could be the potential reason for the flash flood,” a note prepared by the IISc team said.“This is a new tool developed in IISc by our team which can be very useful to study such disasters. The tool is based on Laminar flow equation and surface slope; known as Himalayan Glacier Thickness Mapper (Highthim). The tool was used successfully to map depressions below South Lhonak lake in Sikkim and further estimate the future expansion of the lake,” said Professor Anil Kulkarni, distinguished scientist, Divecha Center for Climate Change.Responding to the US-based scientists who said the floods may have been triggered by a landslide, Kulkarni said “It appears to me that they looked at the adjacent valley. Initial reports suggest that flash flood was caused due to breaking of Nanda Devi glacier. The observation was widely published by numerous news media and also supported by reconnaissance survey carried out by the Indian Air Force. We went deeper to see what happened under the surface.”But the landslide theory has other subscribers.Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said that scientists of Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) have revealed to him that the Chamoli tragedy was caused by a mix of snow and rock avalanche and that satellite images have shown no glacier breakage.A glacial break usually means a piece of the glacier breaking off as a large piece of ice (quite simply, an iceberg). That does not seem to have happened in this case.Rawat spoke to reporters on Monday after chairing a meeting of senior government functionaries, senior officers of Army, ITBP and ISRO scientists.Rawat said ISRO scientists told him that a few days back there was snowfall in the affected area. “And from one trigger point due to rockfall at the top, it all slid downwards. Due to all this, lakhs of tonnes of snow came gushing down which led to the tragedy. The ISRO scientists said the satellite imagery doesn’t show any glacier breakage and that this area is not avalanche-prone.”Pradeep Srivastava, scientist at Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology Dehradun said that preliminary data suggests the Chamoli tragedy was not caused by any glacial outburst, but due to sliding of the rock mass exposed on the top of the glacier and an avalanche.“Due to freezing and thawing, a rock mass broke away and slid down. Data suggests a 0.2km-long rock mass broke away and slid down, adding to the debris accumulated on the glacier. This created a melting layer near debris. An avalanche was evident from the huge clouds of dust that came down with the flowing muck and debris,” he said.Srivastava added that on February 6 there was snow in the area and on February 7, the average temperature was 5 to 6 degrees Celsius, enough to melt the snow.“Satellite imagery is showing snow on February 6 and no snow on the slopes on February 7. So it seems that it was mix of snow avalanche and rock avalanche which led to the disaster,” he concludedAs for the water, it can “can come from surface snow, from big cavities in glaciers or that trapped in cervices. Besides water also melts due to pressure from the base of the glacier”.Srivastava said a team from Wadia Institute is inspecting the area to find out “what exactly happened.”Interestingly, the breach of dams, especially moraine ones, has been known to be caused by rockslides, avalanches, rain, or a glacier break that causes a large piece of ice to fall into the glacial lake -- so it is possible that both theories hold in this case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-breach-avalanche-cause-of-flood-divides-scientists-101612810224493.html
09-02-2021||India||'Andolan gave India freedom': Farm leaders slam PM Modi’s speech in Rajya Sabha||Protesters camped at the Capital’s borders against three new farm laws reiterated their demand that Minimum Support Prices (MSP) be legally guaranteed, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in the Rajya Sabha sought to assure farmers that the procurement regime would continue to exist, and urged them to call off their agitation and continue discussions.Responding to the debate on the motion of thanks on the President’s address in the Rajya Sabha, Modi on Monday also spoke of people he termed “aandolanjeevis” (those who live off protests) and warned against the alleged influence of FDI (“foreign destructive ideology”)Farmer leaders condemned Modi’s statements, calling it an “insult of farmers”, and said they are ready for fresh talks, but with the condition that the “prime minister holds the meeting with the farmers”.“Farmers of this country respect the Constitution, the elected government and the PM’s rank and dignity. If the PM wants the next round of talks, we are ready for it. But we urge the PM that he should hold the meeting with us, understand the concerns of the farmers, and end this deadlock. Multiple rounds of meetings with the Union agriculture minister have yielded no results so far,” said Satnam Singh Sahni, general secretary of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Doaba group), at the Singhu border.Speaking in Rajya Sabha, Modi said the farm laws should be given a chance, while reiterating that MSP will continue and doubling down on the government’s commitment to modernise agricultural markets. “MSP was there. MSP is there. MSP will remain in the future,” the PM said.However, protesters and prominent farm leaders were unmoved by the assurances and demanded that the government ensure legal provisions to “protect farmers from businesspersons.”BKU (Tikait) faction national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait said, “There are no laws now, so businesspersons loot farmers. Authorities have tried to taint the movement by various means. The movement is not led by political leaders, but farmers who demand the repeal of these laws. There will be no business over hunger, and this is what we are fighting against,” said Tikait, who has been leading the farmers’ agitation at Ghazipur border.A farmer from Punjab’s Moga Sadhu Singh said, “Nobody knowingly consumes poison. When we know that the new farm laws are poisonous, why is Modi ji asking us to consume it. We (farmers) know what is good for us and we are fighting for our rights. We will leave only when the laws are repealed”On Monday evening, Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), the umbrella body of the 40 farmers’ unions, issued a press statement, condemning the Prime Minister’s “aandolanjeevi” remark.“SKM condemns the insulting of farmers by prime minister. Farmers would like to remind the PM that it is andolans that have liberated India from colonial rulers, which is why we are proud to be aandolanjeevi,” the statement read.“The PM’s FDI approach is dangerous too, even as we distance ourselves from any Foreign Destructive Ideology,” the statement continued.“SKM stands with constructive democratic processes, which uphold basic human rights anywhere in the world and expects similar reciprocation from all likeminded citizens all over the world because “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,” the farmer group said in their statement.Avtar Singh, another farmer leader from Uttarakhand camping at the Ghazipur border, said, “We had voted for this government for ‘acche din’ and jobs. But we got these laws in return. There was no need to pass these laws during the pandemic with no consultation and we will continue the agitation till the laws are repealed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andolan-gave-india-freedom-farm-leaders-slam-pm-modi-s-speech-in-rajya-sabha-101612808820570.html

Till 5 pm, I was stuck inside the tunnel with no hope of seeing the light of the day. But by evening, I was rescued by Indo-Tibetan Border Police personnel and rushed to the hospital.”Another survivor, Suraj Kumar, a resident from Dhak village in Chamoli district said, “Without ITBP personnel, I do not think I would have been alive after Sunday’s horror. We had lost all hope, but then the miracle happened and we were saved. I am overjoyed to be alive".Also read: Modi speaks to US Prez Biden, says committed to rules-based international orderDespite working for almost the whole day on Sunday, rescue workers in Uttarakhand are no short of energy to save lives but face the challenge of a huge amount of muck brought by the swollen Rishi Ganga river in the incident.The rescue workers include personnel from the state disaster response force (SDRF), the national disaster response force (NDRF), the armed forces and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP). Major rescue work is going on in a tunnel in the Dhauli Ganga dam at Tapovan which is about 900 metres long. More than 25 workers are feared trapped inside it.Satish Kumar from Mandi district in Himachal Pradesh, who was stranded inside a tunnel and was rescued on Sunday, also said he cannot thank ITBP personnel enough. “I thought it was the end. But God sent them to save us,” he said.Praveen Alok, spokesperson for the SDRF, which was the first to reach the spot for rescue work on Sunday along with the local police said, "The biggest challenge in the rescue work is the huge amount of muck.""The rescue workers are working very cautiously as they are unable to assess the level of muck inside," said Alok.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/had-lost-all-hope-survivors-recall-horror-tales-of-chamoli-disaster-101612809643507.html
09-02-2021||India||SC: Society must learn to accept intercaste, interfaith marriages||The Supreme Court on Monday underscored the right of the adults to choose their life partner, and added that it is time society learns to accept inter-caste and inter-faith marriages without hounding the couples. A Supreme Court bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy futher noted that it would “hardly be a desirable social exercise” for parents to shun their children only because they decided to marry outside their caste or community. The judges, in their order, also emphasised the need for specific guidelines and a training module for policemen to deal with such “socially sensitive cases”, so that couples can get due protection available to them under the law should the parents lodge criminal cases against them. It took note that “educated young boys and girls are increasingly choosing their life partner on their own”, which might be viewed as a deviation by the society and the parents, but the police authorities were duty bound to keep such couples out of harm’s way if there was no violation of the law.The apex court’s comments are significant because they come in the wake of controversial ordinances passed by Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh that can be misused to obstruct inter-faith marriages. The bench was hearing a case of an inter-caste marriage from Karnataka; the couple approached the top court, seeking protection from a criminal case lodged by the woman’s father. The woman, 28, is from Karnataka while the man, 26, is from Uttar Pradesh. They fell in love while being trained for their jobs as assistant professor and lecturer in a college, and decided to get married. The woman’s parents strongly opposed this alliance. Her father filed a missing persons complaint lodged; this was converted into an FIR at Belagavi in Karnataka. The couple rushed to the Supreme Court for protection, which stayed the first information report (FIR) by an order in December last year, and sought a response from the Karnataka government. On Monday, advocate Subhranshu Padhi, appearing for the state government, informed the bench that the woman was yet to record her statement before at the concerned police station in Belagavi about her consensual relationship with the man concerned, and hence the investigation into the father’s complaint was still underway. But the bench questioned Padhi as to why the investigating officer did not accept the woman’s request to record her statement at a place of her choice so that she could feel safe. Advocate Prabhat Kumar Rai, who represented the couple, referred to the woman’s letter to the investigating officer and various other senior police officials in Karnataka. These letters disclosed that the couple were married in October 2020; and she also sent a copy of her marriage certificate. “The woman feared for her safety if she were to go to Belagavi for recording her statement. The right to marry a person of (one’s) own choice is an integral part of Article 21 (right to life and liberty),” added Rai. Lamenting the attitude of the police officer, the court said the investigating officer should receive counselling and that the Karnataka government must consider conducting a training programme for all its police officers to sensitise them about such cases. The bench observed that it was desirable for all the police departments to lay down guidelines for handling such cases. It regretted that the parents of the woman opposed the choice of their daughter even though both the man and the woman were highly qualified, independent professionals and Hindus, but not of the same caste and not from the same state. Quashing the FIR, the bench stated that once two adults chose to be with each other and had a consensual relationship, they could not be made accused in a criminal case only on account of their parents’ refusal to accept their relationship. “We hope that the parents of the petitioner no.1 (woman) will have better sense and accept the marriage to re-establish social ties with their daughter and her husband. That, we think, is the only way forward,” recorded the court in its order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-society-must-learn-to-accept-intercaste-interfaith-marriages-101612809173318.html
09-02-2021||India||VK Singh’s remark on border ‘unwitting confession’: China||BeijingIndian minister VK Singh’s statement that India has transgressed the Line of Actual Control (LAC) more times than China is an “unwitting confession”, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Monday. Singh, who is the minister of state for transport and highways and a former four-star general, was quoted as saying on Sunday that both countries have crossed their perceptions of the undemarcated LAC many times.“…none of you come to know how many times we have transgressed as per our perception. Chinese media does not cover it,” Singh said, according to The Hindu newspaper.“Let me assure you, if China has transgressed 10 times, we must have done it at least 50 times,” he was quoted as saying.The Chinese foreign ministry was asked to comment on Singh’s statement after the regular press briefing was over.According to the statement published on the foreign ministry website, spokesperson Wang Wenbin was quick to latch on to it, and blame India for the ongoing border conflict along the LAC in eastern Ladakh.It is the root cause of the tension, he said.“This is an unwitting confession by the Indian side. For a long time, the Indian side has conducted frequent acts of trespass in the border area in an attempt to encroach on China’s territory and constantly created disputes and frictions, which is the root cause of the tensions at the China-India border,” Wang added.“We urge the Indian side to follow through on the consensus, agreements and treaties it reached with China, and uphold peace and stability in the border region with concrete actions,” he added.There was no immediate response from Indian officials to the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson’s comments. The Indian government has repeatedly said that China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) PLA troops were the first to provoke, transgress across the LAC and, subsequently, not ready to disengage.External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had earlier spelt out the Indian government’s position on the tension and the disengagement process, saying the LAC “must be strictly respected and observed as this is the basis for peace and tranquility in the border areas”.Several rounds of diplomatic and military have yielded no result as the standoff continues in eastern Ladakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vksinghs-remark-on-border-unwitting-confession-china-101612809053387.html

We discussed regional issues and our shared priorities. We also agreed to further our co-operation against climate change,” Modi said in a tweet.“President @JoeBiden and I are committed to a rules-based international order. We look forward to consolidating our strategic partnership to further peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond,” he added.According to a readout from the White House, Biden “underscored his desire to defend democratic institutions and norms around the world and noted that a shared commitment to democratic values is the bedrock for the US-India relationship”.The readout further said the two leaders committed that the US and India will work “closely together to win the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, renew their partnership on climate change, rebuild the global economy in a way that benefits the people of both countries, and stand together against the scourge of global terrorism”.The leaders agreed to continue close cooperation to promote a “free and open Indo-Pacific”, including support for freedom of navigation, territorial integrity and a “stronger regional architecture through the Quad”, the white House said.Modi and Biden “resolved that the rule of law and the democratic process must be upheld in Burma”, the White House said. The leaders also agreed to stay in close touch on a range of global challenges and “look forward to what the United States and India will achieve together for their people and for their nations”, it added.Modi had earlier congratulated Biden on his election on November 8. They also spoke on phone on November 17, when they exchanged views on working together on “shared priorities and global challenges”.External affairs minister S Jaishankar and his new US counterpart Antony Blinken had spoken on phone on January 29 and pledged to expand the strategic partnership between the two countries and to work for peace and security in the Indo-Pacific.Earlier, US defence secretary Lloyd Austin spoke to defence minister Rajnath Singh and US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan talked to his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval, with the two sides committing themselves to enhanced cooperation on defence and security issues and in the Indo-Pacific region.Jaishankar and Blinken had declared their commitment to consolidate and expand the multi-faceted strategic partnership between the two sides. They had also discussed the challenges of a post-Covid world and agreed to work together to address global issues, including safe and affordable vaccine supply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-speaks-to-us-prez-biden-says-committed-to-rules-based-international-order-101612807900279.html

Thousands of farmers have been protesting since late November at the Delhi borders, demanding a rollback of three farm laws.PM Modi had delivered his reply to the President's address in the Rajya Sabha on Monday where he appealed to the protesting farmers to withdraw their over two-month-long stir and give the new agriculture reform laws a chance.Also Read: India’s small farmer finds a champion, writes Jyotiraditya ScindiaHe also assured them of continuing with the purchase of crops at an administered price or MSP.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations.The Prime Minister hit out at some of the protesters, saying a new crop of agitators has emerged in India who cannot live without agitation and the country should be beware of them."There is a new crop of 'Andolan-jivi'. They live for protests. They look for ways to start a new movement.

Similarly, the UK and EU have some trade and investment-related issues with India that can be addressed quickly,” the second official said.The Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC) has sought an early solution to the issue of duty disadvantage, the trade body’s spokesperson said. “In a letter to the government, APEC chairman A Sakthivel said India’s apparel export is falling behind several competitors like Bangladesh, Cambodia and Pakistan due to duty disadvantage of 9.6% while exporting to the UK,” he said.Indian exporters have suggested the government could either initiate discussions for fast-track FTAs or urgently conclude comprehensive economic partnership agreements (CEPAs) with the two major economies, the second official said. Indian exporters are also at a disadvantage because of the continued Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) to 47 least developed countries (LDCs) even after Brexit.Both officials said that during the first high level virtual dialogue on the proposed India-EU bilateral trade and investment agreement on February 5, Goyal stressed the importance of an “early harvest deal” followed by a time-bound FTA that can serve the interests of both sides and help revive economies in the post-Covid era.“In a significant step forward, both sides agreed on a monthly progress review of discussions by senior officials and quarterly review by the ministers for providing guidance,” the second official said.On the European side, there is a keenness to move forward with at least the investment agreement by the time of the India-EU Summit in Portugal on May 8. The diplomats acknowledged that it may be difficult to conclude over-arching free trade agreements in the post-Covid scenario when many countries are focused on increasing self-reliance.“There should be some forward movement on investment protection and facilitation. It is important to have dialogue and move forward from the standstill we have witnessed since 2013,” a senior diplomat from a EU state said, referring to the breakdown of India-EU trade talks more than seven years ago.A second diplomat from an EU state expressed understanding for India’s moves to build up domestic manufacturing and other structures but said questions remained about the self-reliance drive. “To address concerns about whether this move is aimed at keeping foreigners out, India must keep engaging and show more pro-activeness,” the second diplomat said.The diplomats said an investment agreement would address concerns of European investors, who are upbeat on India but are reluctant to pump in funds due to the perceived lack of protection for investments.Dombrovskis told Goyal that EU-India relations are a top priority, the second official said, adding both leaders agreed to meet within the next three months before the India-EU Summit. “The meeting will serve as a final push for quick deliverables before the meeting of the leaders,” he said.“The objective is to take forward any of the possible deliverables in the summit, such as launching an investment facilitation mechanism, working on regulatory cooperation, removing trade barriers, deepening research and promoting innovation, addressing multilateral issues of mutual interest, continuing the IPR dialogue and sharing experience in building resilient value chains,” he said.At the meeting, Goyal also said the COVAX initiative, without a TRIPS waiver, wouldn’t help in ending the pandemic and EU’s support is essential in this crucial endeavour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/separate-trade-deals-with-uk-eu-in-india-plan-101612743386543.html
