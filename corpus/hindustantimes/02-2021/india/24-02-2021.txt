The bench, also comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat were of the view that magistrates should play a more “intrusive” role in investigation.“In some cases, a police team goes to the scene of crime and forgets to pick up crucial evidence. If a magistrate is associated with the investigation, there will be a greater sense of responsibility on the police,” the bench observed.Though the Court has not passed any order to this effect, the bench indicated that it may initiate another suo moto petition on these lines by issuing notice to all states. Without specifying about the contours of what they intend to do, the judges said, “The Magistrate may not participate in investigation…There may be an independent cadre of Magistrates for investigative purposes.”Two senior lawyers – R Basant and Sidharth Luthra, assisting the Court as amicus curiae had diverse views on this suggestion. Luthra pointed out that Section 156(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) envisaged a supervisory role for Magistrates in police investigations. But he had doubts over whether a Magistrate could be part of the investigation during evidence collection as that would make him a witness during trial.The bench replied that even under the existing system, Magistrates are made witnesses during trial as they record dying declaration and hold test identification parade.Basant strongly objected to the Court’s suggestion hinting at the inherent danger of making a Magistrate a part of the investigation process. He said, “The Magistrate is not supposed to meddle with the investigation till filing of the final report (by police). The CrPC envisages a separation between the adjudicator and investigator. With this suggestion the mantle of independent adjudicator will fall.”The bench assured that it will not do anything absurd as Magistrates who are hearing the case will not participate in the investigation. “We need to think of a system….a different independent cadre,” the bench added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-court-proposes-cadre-of-magistrates-to-fill-gaps-in-police-investigation-101614189763818.html

The incident occurred at Ravipadu village on the outskirts of the town.The accused, Vishnu Vardhan Reddy (21), who is senior to her in the college, surrendered to the police after committing the murder, the Narsaraopet (rural) police said.According to the police, both the victim and Reddy were in a relationship for a year, but of late she had been avoiding him. He suspected that she was interested in another man and nursed a grudge against her.On Wednesday afternoon, Reddy requested her to come with him for a personal talk and she obliged his request. He took her on his bike to the outskirts of the town, where he tried to convince her to marry him. She rejected his request which led to an argument.“In a fit of rage, he strangled her to death and threw her body into an adjacent Govindapuram irrigation canal, before surrendering in the police station,” said a police official who did not wish to be named.Later, the police rushed to the spot and retrieved the woman’s body from the canal and shifted it to the government hospital for autopsy.On coming to know about the incident, hundreds of students along with locals gathered in large numbers in front of the government hospital and staged a dharna, demanding stringent action against the accused. Later, they also blocked the main road near the bus stand for over two hours.Tension continues to prevail in the town and additional police forces have been rushed there. The local police authorities had a tough time in controlling the agitated students.Expressing anguish over the murder of the degree college student, Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy announced ex-gratia of ₹10 lakh to family of the deceased and assured that stern action would be taken against those responsible.He directed the officials to expedite the investigation and take action against the accused under Disha Act.Telugu Desam Party general secretary Nara Lokesh also condemned the ghastly murder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/college-student-in-andhra-pradesh-killed-for-rejecting-marriage-proposal-101614190098245.html
24-02-2021||India||Higher fares for short distance trains to discourage needless travel: Railways||The ministry of railways on Wednesday clarified it has charged “slightly high fares” to “discourage unnecessary travel” in short distance passenger trains since they had begun operation post-lockdown.The national carrier at present is operating only special passenger trains since the curbs on lockdown were eased. Regular passenger trains have been suspended since March 25, 2020.“As special provisions for Covid-19, the fares of these trains have been fixed at unreserved price of mail/express trains for the same distance,” a statement from the railway ministry said.The Railways which has now also begun local train services has come under criticism from daily commuters who are feeling the pinch of the rise in fares. For example, a ticket from Amritsar to Pathankot costs ₹55 now, earlier it was priced at ₹25. Similarly, the ticket fare of passenger DMU between Jalandhar city railway station and Ferozpur costs ₹60 now, while earlier it was ₹30.“Railways would like to inform that these slightly higher fares for passenger and other short distance trains had been introduced to discourage people from avoidable travels and those which are not most necessary. Covid-19 is still around and in fact worsening in some states. Visitors from many states are being subjected to screening in other areas and discouraged to travel. Little higher price is to be seen as a proactive measure of Railways to prevent crowding in trains and stop Covid-19 from spreading,” the ministry said in a statement.Currently, the Railways have operationalized almost 65 per cent of the Mail/Express trains and over 90 per cent of suburban services as compared to the pre lockdown times.A total 1250 Mail/Express, 5350 suburban services and more than 326 passenger trains are presently in operation on an average on a daily basis. The statement from the ministry said that short distance passenger trains running presently constitute less than 3 per cent of total trains.The Railways had to stop running of regular trains due to the Covid-19 related nationwide lockdown imposed on March 22, 2020 as a measure to counter the spread of Coronavirus.Railways is constantly increasing the number of passenger carrying trains in a graded manner. Full restoration of regular services of passenger trains, to pre-Covid times, is to be considered keeping in view a range of factors and operational circumstances.Keeping in view the prevailing Covid-19 situation, after introduction of Mail/Express trains, Railways is gradually operationalizing passenger trains taking all necessary precautions and making additional effort. Passenger operations have always been subsidized by Railways. Normally, Railways bears a loss on every journey by a passenger, the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/higher-fares-for-short-distance-trains-to-discourage-needless-travel-railways-101614188010995.html
24-02-2021||India||New Covid-19 strains not more infectious, need to aggressively monitor situation: AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria||With two new strains of Covid-19, one each from the UK and Brazil, confirmed in a number of states, AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria on Wednesday said that vaccines will be able to control the spread of coronavirus and lessen the mortality rate.Guleria also there was need to aggressively study the mutations of the Covid-19 virus."Currently we have vaccines with efficacy of 70 per cent , 80 per cent, 90 per cent so even if there is slight fall in efficacy they will still be effective in preventing the virus from further spreading," Guleria told in an interview to ANI.When asked about the new strains of the virus that have been found in several parts of the country he said authorities are closely monitoring the situation."It doesn't seem that the strains are more infectious or vaccine will not work but we need to study it more aggressively and look at it more closely. We should not miss out on strains which are more infectious," Guleria said."There are two things. One is the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing serious disease and death. I could say that the vaccine definitely will prevent serious disease and therefore decease mortality as far as new strain is concern. As far efficacy is a concern, one can argue that if you have a strain, the efficiency theoretically may come down a little bit but we do have a good buffer," he said.The Union Health Ministry on Tuesday revealed that two new strains of the Covid-19 virus - the N440K variant and the E484Q variant have been detected in Maharashtra and Kerala. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that these two newer virus strains are responsible for the surge in cases in some districts in these two states as well as from Telangana, Dr VK Paul, Member (Health) of the NITI Aayog had said during the weekly Covid-19 update yesterday."We need more data to show how infectious the strain is. Currently, the data we have does not suggest that this is more infectious but I would say more data required. Samples have been taken from all areas where a surge has been seen. After analysis, we will have the data," he said.Guleria said that there is a need to monitor the situation closely as vaccines will be changed in the view of new variants."As of now, we do not need to worry but we need to monitor the situation closely and look aggressively for all the variants and make sure that none of them is becoming totally new and our vaccine efficacy has fallen.He added: " Simultaneously have to keep changing the vaccine also to take into account the new variants that are emerging."The AIIMS director called for developing a strategy to keep the mortality rate down while lauding the Central government's decision to allow private centres to vaccinate people against Covid-19."I think this is a very good step because we have to move forward and vaccinate as many people as we can. We need to develop a strategy where we need to keep our death rate down. Therefore, vaccinating people above the age of 60 or those who are above the age of 45 with comorbidity will be a very good step in this direction, also opening it up for the private sector," he said."We have a huge target to achieve even in a phase one we have to vaccinate at least 30 crore individuals that is something we need to keep in mind," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-strains-not-more-infectious-need-to-aggressively-monitor-situation-guleria-101614189303540.html

Gujarat Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel said that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's name was never associated with the stadium in question."This stadium is owned by the Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) and it was always known as the Motera Stadium. So there is no question of renaming it now. It was Narendra Modi, who had first floated the idea to demolish the old stadium and build a new one when he was the GCA president," said Nitin Patel, according to a video posted by the Press Information Bureau (PIB).Also Read: Refurbished Motera stadium renamed after PM as Narendra Modi stadiumHe further said that Narendra Modi Stadium in Motera, inaugurated by President Ram Nath Kovind, is part of a larger complex, named 'Sardar Patel Sports Complex'.ALSO WATCH | Sardar Patel cricket stadium in Motera renamed Narendra Modi stadium﻿﻿After some leaders of the Congress and other opposition parties made the accusation, Union ministers Prakash Javadekar and Ravi Shankar Prasad too had said that only Motera Stadium has been named after PM Modi and the complex in which it is located is still called Sardar Patel Sports Enclave. Taking a dig at Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, Prasad, who was addressing the media after attending a cabinet meeting, said that the two leaders had never praised or visited Sardar Patel's statue, the world's tallest, in Gujarat's Kevadia, news agency PTI reported."I want to say this with full responsibility that a tourist place getting global praise has not been visited yet or praised by the two Congress leaders. What else is there to say?" he said.Also Read | President Ram Nath Kovind inaugurates world's largest Motera cricket stadium: All you need to knowJavadekar, in his clarification, said that the ones making a big deal out of the issue never respected Sardar Patel. "The name of the Sports Complex is Sardar Patel Sports Enclave. Only the name of the cricket stadium, within the complex, has been named after Narendra Modi. Ironically, 'The Family', which never respected Sardar Patel, even after his death, is now making hue and cry," he tweeted.Earlier, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor had tweeted, "Maybe they just realised the stadium was named for a Home Minister who had banned their parent organisation! Or maybe this is advance booking to ensure the next visiting Head of State is hosted here, like Trump? Or is this the beginning of a legacy-creation-thru-labelling spree (sic)?"Rajeev Satav, another Congress leader, said the renaming was "a clear sign of autocratic dictatorship". "Renaming Motera cricket stadium from Sardar Patel to Narendra Modi is an absolute disgrace. This shows how narcissistic our PM has become.

24-02-2021||India||India plans new social media controls after Twitter face-off||Chafing from a dispute with Twitter, India plans to oblige social media companies to erase contentious content fast and assist investigations, according to a draft regulation.New Delhi's planned "Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code" - a copy of which was seen by Reuters - come as various nations around the world try to assert tighter control over powerful Big Tech firms.Facebook faced a global backlash from publishers and politicians last week after blocking news feeds in Australia in a dispute with the government over revenue-sharing.In India, Twitter ignored orders to remove content over farmers' protests, fuelling the zeal of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government since 2018 to tighten regulation for content it deems disinformation or unlawful.The latest draft rules - which would be legally enforcable - say companies should remove content as early as possible, but not later than 36 hours, after a government or legal order.They must also assist in investigations or other cybersecurity-related incidents within 72 hours of a request. Further, if a post depicts an individual in any sexual act or conduct, then companies must disable or remove such content within a day of receiving a complaint, the rules added.Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Twitter, which did not take down all accounts the government alleged were spreading lies about the protests over agricultural reforms, declined to comment.RACIAL, RELIGIOUS CONTEXTThe draft proposal also requires companies to appoint a chief compliance officer, another executive for coordinating on law enforcement and a "grievance redressal officer".All must be resident Indian citizens.The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology did not immediately respond to a request for comment.It was unclear when the rules would be announced of if they may undergo further changes.Industry sources say new regulations could hit Big Tech firms' investment plans in India and increase compliance headaches. The rules would also apply across other digital and online media, the draft proposal said."A publisher shall take into consideration India's multi-racial and multi-religious context and exercise due caution and discretion when featuring the activities, beliefs, practices, or views of any racial or religious group," the draft rules said.Referring to films and other entertainment, including web-based serials, the draft rules called for a "classification rating" to describe content and advise discretion.Streaming platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime have faced complaints in India for obscenity.Police in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh questioned an Amazon executive for nearly four hours on Tuesday over allegations that a political drama, "Tandav", hurt religious sentiments and caused public anger.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-plans-new-social-media-controls-after-twitter-faceoff-101614187665679.html
24-02-2021||India||Differences in Meghalaya BJP intensifies, coalition govt comes under strain||The BJP which is a partner in the ruling alliance in Meghalaya has been rocked by dissent with one of the party's two legislators in the state rebelling against state unit chief Earnest Mawrie.BJP legislator from South Shillong, Sanbor Shullai who once raged against the Citizenship Amendment Act, even went on to say at a public meeting that the saffron party in Meghalaya is a “sinking ship.”The BJP state unit has also been at loggerheads with the ruling Meghalaya Democratic Alliance (MDA) dispensation with Mawrie accusing it of anomalies in governance and even levelling corruption charges against it that has put the alliance under strain.But with its own fissures out in the open, the leader of the BJP parliamentary party and health minister AL Hek acknowledged that there was a discussion with chief minister Conrad Sangma on the situation arising out of Mawrie’s repeated allegations against the National People’s Party-led state government. He also acknowledged that many people in the BJP have individually expressed that they want Mawrie to be ousted as the state BJP president.“People are not happy with the state president’s style of functioning but that is their individual opinion and therefore to remove him (Mawrie), we have to sit as a party and take a collective decision. The CM expressed that he is not happy with the style of functioning of the BJP state president and that he had also discussed this with the national leaders…I will not deny this,” Hek said.Hek felt it was wrong for the state president to keep on attacking the MDA government especially the CM and his family.Government officials who did not wish to be named said an unhappy chief minister Sangma had complained to the BJP central leadership earlier this month about Mawrie and his way of functioning while claiming that almost half of the BJP leaders in Meghalaya are in favour of ousting their boss.“I have spoken to both the MLAs (AL Hek and Sanbor Shullai) of the BJP and both of them have distanced themselves from the comments he (Mawrie) has made. Both the MLAs have told me that they are in favour of Ernest Mawrie being removed as president of the state BJP,” Sangma said.Mawrie retorted by saying that Sangma who heads the NPP should not interfere in the BJP’s internal matters.“I am very surprised. Since when has he (Conrad Sangma) become the spokesperson of our party? Because he is the national president of NPP and he is claiming that more than half of the party karyakartas have reported to him about my removal.”He insisted that he stood by his statement. “It seems that the CM was nervous because of the issues I am raising so if he says that he is clean, let him come with the proof,” he said.Sangma’ deputy Prestone Tynsong also joined the battle and dared the BJP to pull out of the alliance.“Let your (BJP) action speak louder than your words by withdrawing support instead of criticizing the government which you are also part and parcel of. Are these people not becoming a laughing stock? On one hand, you say MDA is corrupted and on the other hand, you say are a partner. Is it logical?” Tynsong said.Hek responded that it is for the party’s national leadership to decide on whether to withdraw support to the NPP-led government.“We have no issues if the national leadership of the BJP tells us (to pull out of the MDA government). Therefore, it is for the national leadership to take a call (on this issue) and not for us,” Hek emphasised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/differences-in-meghalaya-bjp-intensifies-coalition-govt-comes-under-strain-101614186935274.html

A few suspects have also been detained for questioning,” said the SP.“We are still working on the case and it will not be right to say anything at this point of time. Our teams are exploring all possibilities,” he added.The victim’s father had dropped her to the college on Monday around 11 am. She was found badly burnt around 6 pm, police said.The girl’s father told the police that he waited for his daughter outside the college. When she didn’t return after a few hours, he entered the college and began searching for her.Later at the hospital, the victim did not tell the police anything about the incident. “The girl was in a conscious state at the hospital. When asked about the incident, she said she has no recollection of the incident. We have requested the family members to encourage her to help us investigate the case so that those responsible for the attack could be arrested,” said the SP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-cops-hunt-for-clues-into-case-of-college-girl-found-with-burn-injuries-101614184086480.html

Due to this, the chances of lake burst or Chamoli-like tragedy happening again has been averted. Our team members are still camping there to try to widen the mouth further”, SDRF Commandant Navneet Bhullar said."The team is also trying to increase the depth of the widened channel by about one to one and a half feet near the opening which will further speed up the discharge of water."He also said that the special communication equipment - quick deployable antenna (QDA) - based on satellite communication has been set up at the site which is helping in communicating with the expert team in real time.The expert team, which left for the lake area on Friday and reached there on Saturday, had analysed the lake to find out ways to drain it so that it doesn’t breach in future and lead to a tragedy like the Chamoli flash flood of February 7.Meanwhile, the rescuers involved in the search and rescue operation in the Chamoli disaster recovered one more body on Wednesday taking the death toll to 71 with 133 still missing.SDRF spokesperson Praveen Alok, said, "The body was found from the Alaknanda river near the disaster site in Chamoli. Meanwhile, the rescue workers have cleared slush up to a distance of about 184 metres in the 1.7km long tunnel at the NTPC hydel power project in Tapovan."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/expert-team-widens-mouth-of-lake-formed-upstream-rishiganga-for-faster-drainage-101614182642560.html
24-02-2021||India||Amid Covid-19 fears, thousands throng Telangana’s Sammakka-Saralamma festival||The threat of Covid-19 notwithstanding, thousands of Adivasis from different parts of the country thronged to the tribal village of Medaram in the dense forests of Tadvai block in Telangana’s Mulug district to participate in the four-day Sammakka-Saralamma jatara (tribal fair) that began on Wednesday.Though this event, meant to worship two tribal women – Sammakka and her daughter Saralamma of the 13th century, in the form of deities, is actually a biennial ritual, the Koya tribes in large numbers make it a point to assemble at Medaram on “Magha Suddha Pournami” (the full-moon day of the month of Magha) every year to pay obeisance to the deities.The biennial festival is celebrated on a big scale with a footfall of over 15 million devotees, and the annual ritual is also attended in large numbers. “This year, we are expecting that around 1.5-2 million tribal devotees will attend this annual fair to be celebrated from February 24 to 27,” Mulugu collector Krishna Aditya said.The tribal fair draws devotees not only from Telangana, but also from other states like Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. “Even non-tribal devotees attend this fair in large numbers,” the collector said.The tribals believe that Sammakka and Saralamma had laid down their lives fighting the mighty emperors of the Kakatiya dynasty who had attacked their little tribal hamlet demanding royalty and sought to destroy their life and culture.According to the district authorities, permanent arrangements are already in place at Medaram village since it continues to attract visitors regularly. For the ongoing mini-jatara, the district administration has spent nearly ₹1.5 crore to make various arrangements.“We have made all the arrangements such as provision of drinking water facilities, sanitation, desilting of wells, installation of taps, erection of lighting facilities, construction of temporary compartments for dress-changing, barricading, levelling of pathways, food arrangements etc,” Aditya said.However, what is worrying for the authorities is the potential threat of the spread of Covid-19 in such a huge congregation. “It is virtually impossible to screen such a huge number of tribal devotees for Covid-19 or enforce restrictions on their gathering in such a small village,” Mulugu district medical and health officer Dr A Appaiah, admitted.He, however, said the authorities had been undertaking extensive campaigns among the devotees to wear masks, use hand sanitisers and maintain social distance as far as possible, using public address systems and distribution of pamphlets.“We have set up medical camps at different locations around the fair so that anybody found with any symptoms could be immediately attended to. If any positive cases surface in the area, arrangements have been made to shift them and those associated with them to Mulug district hospital for treatment,” he said.He admits that there is a possibility of the Covid-19 disease being carried through devotees from Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, where new cases were surfacing. “We thought of putting up testing centres at the inter-state borders, but we dropped the idea because of practical issues,” Appaiah said.The collectors, too, made an appeal to the tribal devotees to follow the Covid-19 protocols and avoid attending the fair, if they have any symptoms.State minister for tribal welfare Satyavathi Rathod, who prayed to the deity on the first day of the tribal fair, said all arrangements had been made to see that the devotees would not face any health problems at the fair.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-covid-19-fears-thousands-throng-telangana-s-sammakka-saralamma-festival-101614181593834.html

This is despite the use of a relatively low valuation of human life from the literature," study lead author, Sumeet Gulati from The University of British Columbia in Canada, told PTI.The researchers said compensation for human death ranges from ₹76,400 in Haryana, to ₹8,73,995 in Maharashtra.They said the average compensation paid for human death in the country is ₹1,91,437, and the average compensation paid for injury is ₹6,185.According to Gulati, these compensation values, known as value of a statistical life (VSL) are typically calculated from labour market comparisons."Controlling for how productive workers are across different industries, economists estimate how much of the compensation paid can be attributed to the risk of injury or death across occupations," Gulati explained."One obvious way to improve this estimate is to have more studies estimating the VSL using data from developing countries," he added.According to the researchers, better compensation for human fatalities can likely reduce animosity towards the species conservationists intend to preserve."More importantly, if governments invested in measures to reduce conflict based on an accurate understanding of the real value of the loss of human life, conflict would be reduced, and animosity would fall, making both those living near the forest and those who care about the beings in the forest better off," Gulati explained.According to the wildlife conservationist, the dominance of the costs of human casualties rationalises the innate fear and respect towards large species like elephants displayed by those living with wildlife in India.Based on the findings, the scientists said focusing on the cost of human casualties while estimating losses from wildlife conflict is necessary."Our research is one of the largest scientific assessments of human-wildlife conflict globally," said study co-author Krithi Karanth from the Centre for Wildlife Studies in Bengaluru."We find that farmers experiencing a negative interaction with an elephant over the last year incur damages on average that are 600 and 900 times those incurred by farmers with negative interactions with the next most costly herbivore -- the pig and the nilgai," Karanth said.Similarly, she said farmers experiencing a negative interaction with a tiger over the last year incur damage that is on average three times that inflicted by a leopard, and a 100 times from a wolf.Although a species is associated with a rare occurrence of human fatalities, the scientists said the expected cost of death from a negative interaction could be much higher than the expected cost of frequently occurring crop or livestock damage."Conservation managers have to prioritise human casualties and improve assistance provided to people," Karanth added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lives-lost-to-wildlife-human-conflict-inadequately-compensated-in-india-study-101614178923244.html

24-02-2021||India||India rejects Pakistan's criticism of human rights situation in Kashmir at UNHRC||India on Wednesday rejected Pakistan’s criticism of the human rights situation in Jammu and Kashmir at the UN Human Rights Council, saying the government in Islamabad should instead focus on credible action to end state-sponsored terrorism.New Delhi’s response to the criticism by Pakistani human rights minister Shireen Mazari in her address to the UN body in Geneva also described Pakistan as a country with “one of the world’s worst human rights records”, where “institutionalised discrimination and persecution” of minorities has continued unabated.India’s “right of reply” to the Pakistani minister’s speech was delivered by Seema Pujani, second secretary in the permanent mission to the UN. She described Pakistan’s continued misuse of various platforms for “baseless and malicious propaganda against India” as “not new”.Pujani pointed out Pakistan has been the “home and patron to the largest number of internationally proscribed terrorist entities and individuals”, and 126 individuals and 24 entities sanctioned by the UN Security Council are associated with the country.The Indian response called on the UN Human Rights Council to call on Pakistan to take “credible and irreversible steps” to end state-sponsored terrorism and dismantle terrorist infrastructure.“State-sponsored terrorism by Pakistan is a threat not only to India but to other countries in the region and beyond. The recent acquittal of Omar Saeed Sheikh, the al-Qaeda terrorist and murderer of the American journalist Daniel Pearl, by the Pakistani Supreme Court is a clear example of the Pakistani establishment’s nexus with such entities and, as the US secretary of state said, it is ‘an affront to terrorism victims everywhere’,” Pujani added.External affairs minister S Jaishankar, who addressed the UN agency before Mazari on Wednesday, had, without naming Pakistan, said terrorism remains one of the “gravest threats to humankind” and constitutes a severe challenge to the global human rights agenda.Referring to the 2019 decision to scrap the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, Pujani said: “We reiterate that the entire union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral and inalienable part of India. The steps taken by the government to ensure good governance and development in these union territories are our internal matters.”The Indian response pointed out that Pakistan, as a country with “one of the world’s worst human rights records”, would do well to “put its own house in order, before venturing to point a finger at India”.“The violence, institutionalised discrimination and persecution faced by Pakistan’s minorities, including Christians, Sikhs and Hindus, has continued unabated. There have been frequent attacks on the places of worship of minority communities, a grave violation of their right to freedom of religion and belief,” Pujani added.The condition of women from minorities, especially Hindus, Sikhs and Christians, is “deplorable”, and an estimated 1,000 women from minorities are “subjected to abduction followed by forced conversion and forced marriage in Pakistan every year”, according to a report from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan.Shias, Hazaras and Ahmadiyas too face persecution, state-condoned violence and discrimination, and Pakistan has been crushing dissent and engaging in political repression in Balochistan and other regions, the Indian response said.“Enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions and torture have been used as tools of coercion. Several Baloch human rights defenders have even met tragic death under mysterious circumstances, while in exile. Pashtuns and Sindhis have continued to struggle against the systemic oppression and discrimination,” the response added, pointing to rights activist Gulalai Ismail, who sought refuge in the US after being charged with sedition, terrorism and defamation.In her speech, Mazari had alleged that India was using the Covid-19 pandemic too increase the repression of people in Kashmir. She further alleged that the Indian government has “exploited the pandemic” to accelerate demographic changes in the region.India also used its right of reply to respond to remarks made by Turkey’s representative regarding the situation in Kashmir and the implementation of UN resolutions on the region. Describing the remarks as “completely unacceptable”, the Indian response said it was ironical for Turkey, “which has trampled upon its own civil society, to pass unjustified comments on other’s internal matters”.Punjani added: “As far as the subject of UN resolutions is concerned, we would advise Turkey to practise what it preaches by first implementing those UN resolutions that apply to it.”The Indian response also rejected the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation’s (OIC) “factually incorrect and unwarranted references” to India and said it was regrettable the OIC states “continue to allow Pakistan to misuse OIC platforms to indulge in anti-India propaganda”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-rejects-pakistan-s-criticism-of-human-rights-situation-in-kashmir-at-unhrc-101614177287547.html

The CID alleged that Panigrahy had collected money from people on behalf of Akash Pathak, son of suspended IFS officer Abhay Pathak, with the false promise of providing jobs in Tata Motors.However, the legislator will not be released from prison as three cases of fraud have been filed by people of Ganjam district at Golanthara police station.In December, the ruling BJD had sacked the 56-year-old Panigrahi from the party on charges of anti-people activities.Earlier this month, the Orissa High Court had quashed an order of the Lokayukta for a probe by the state vigilance department against Panigrahy noting that the complainant and investigating agency in a quasi-judicial process cannot be the same.Last December, the Lokayukta had issued the order on a complaint filed by Vigilance department on how Panigrahy amassed assets disproportionate to his known source of income.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-mla-arrested-in-job-scam-gets-bail-but-will-remain-in-jail-101614178689866.html

24-02-2021||India||PM Modi bats for privatisation, says money earned will be used for people's welfare||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday announced in a webinar on Privatisation and Asset Monetisation that the government will push ahead with plans to "monetise" and "modernise" the assets of the country. The Prime Minister said that public sector enterprises which do not occupy a position of strategic importance should not be kept functional. The only responsibility of the government, he said, is to support the country’s enterprises and businesses.“I can understand the need of any public sector enterprise if it is fulfilling the needs of any sector and of any strategic importance. It is the responsibility of the government to supply support country's enterprise and business but there is no need for the government to be in business,” said PM Modi.Reiterating his government’s stance on privatisation, the Prime Minister said, “We have made it clear in the new public sector enterprise policy that government will have limited role in only four strategic sectors and all other public sector units can be privatised.”PM Modi said in the seminar that most public sector enterprises incur losses and that burdens the economy, adding that there is no need to keep these enterprises functional just because they were started as someone’s “pet projects”. The Prime Minister insisted that the push behind privatisation would lead to less governmental interference in people’s lives, reinforcing his previous vision of "minimum government, maximum governance".“We want to stop unnecessary governmental interference in people’s private lives. There should not be a lack of governance or an effect of governance in people’s lives” the PM told the attendants at the webinar.The Prime Minister, while outlining the government’s policy of privatisation, said that 100 government owned under-utilised assets have been earmarked for the task."There are many government-owned under-utilised and unutilised assets. The government plans to monetise 100 government-owned assets. There is ₹2.5 trillion investment opportunity in these 100 assets which are up for monetisation. When government monetizes, that space is filled by the private sector of the country. The private sector brings investment and best global practices with them," PM Modi said.The Prime Minister assured that the money from the monetisation of assets will be put towards welfare policies for the development of the country.“We will increase efficiency of our economy. The money will be used for Jan Kalyan Yojana. The money from asset monetisation and privatisation makes poor people’s home, roads in rural villages, opens schools, and brings clean water for the poor. Even after so many years of freedom we have such lacks in our country,” he said at the webinar.The event was attended by the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), investors from North America, Europe, Middle East, Asia Pacific, and other top officials from government departments, including finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-bats-for-privatisation-says-money-earned-will-be-used-for-people-s-welfare-101614178024219.html

We are also coordinating with Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) for cancellation of their Aadhaar cards, 60 of which were issued in West Bengal. We are briefing district collectors and superintendents of police of various districts in West Bengal to trace these fake Aadhar card holders,” Cyberabad police commissioner V C Sajjannar said.The passport racket came to light on January 25 this year, when the Cyberabad police, acting on a complaint by the immigration authorities at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport, arrested three Bangladesh nationals – Nitai Das alias Sanjib Dutta, Mohammad Hasibur Rehman alias Ramu Das and Mohammad Rana Mia alias Mondal Sandip while they were trying to leave for Dubai.During the profiling of the three accused revealed that they stayed at Bodhan and they had obtained Indian passports fraudulently with the help of one agent Shahnaj Pail from West Bengal who arranged fake Aadhaar cards for them.Subsequently, the police arrested five others involved in the passport scam. They included Parimal Bain from Bangladesh, Shahnaj Patel from West Bengal, Mateen Ahmed Mirza from Bodhan, Peruka Mallesh Rao, sub-inspector of police, Bodhan and B Anil Kumar, assistant sub-inspector of police, Bodhan.“All the arrested have been remanded to judicial custody. Three others – Sameer and Manoj from West Bengal and Sadham Hussain from Mumbai are absconding,” the police commissioner said.The investigation also revealed that the racket was carried out with the help of the two police officials – Mallesh Rao and Anil Kumar, who were in charge of verifying passport applications.“An unusual number of 37 passports were issued on the same address and another 20 passports on another single address. In all, 72 passports were issued to the people belonging to seven addresses, all in Bodhan,” Sajjannar said.The probe also found ed that even the phone numbers mentioned by the applicants were similar. As many as 15 passports had the same phone number and another 13 passports also were issued on a similar phone number.Of these 72 people who had obtained passports through fraudulent means, 19 people had already left for different countries like Thailand, Bahrain, UAE, Qatar, Malaysia, South Africa and Spain.“Special teams have been formed to trace the remaining passport holders and the absconding accused,” the police commissioner said.A case had been booked under Section 429, 468 and 471 of Indian Penal code, besides Section 14 of Foreigners’ Act, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyberabad-cops-bust-racket-in-telangana-after-fraudulent-issue-of-72-passports-101614177378261.html

The shocking incident was captured on camera and the video of Kolikapudi Srinivasa Rao hurling his footwear towards Reddy after a heated argument ensued between them, became viral on social media.The debate on the state cabinet's decision to extend government guarantee for raising Rs3,000 crore from banks for taking up Amaravati projects was aired on Telugu news channel ABN Andhrajyothi. While Reddy was in agreement with the move, he criticised the erstwhile TDP government for borrowing loans. In response, Rao said Reddy was not sticking to the ‘serious issue’ at hand, to which Reddy responded with a comment that enraged the Joint Action Committee member. Reddy asked Rao if he too had to toe the line of the TDP like Rao, a remark which infuriated the latter. He removed his footwear and swung it towards Reddy.While the BJP condemned the attack and requested the television channel to lodge a formal complaint against Rao, party MP GVL Narasimha Rao accused the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) of being behind the incident. ఈరోజు ABN ఛానల్ లో @BJP4Andhra @SvisnuReddy గారిపై శ్రీనివాస్ చేసిన దాడిని తీవ్రంగా ఖండిస్తున్నాను. ఇది టీడీపీ ప్రాయోజిత చర్యగా స్పష్టంగా తెలుస్తోంది. శ్రీనివాస్ టీడీపీ సంబంధం తెలిసిందే. మాకు సంబంధం లేదని టీడీపీ అంటే ఖచ్చితంగా చంద్రబాబు నాయుడు గారు శ్రీనివాస్ చర్యను ఖండించవలసిందే https://t.co/XavZc01GYX“I strongly condemn the attack.

On court saying that the evidence against Ravi was "scant and sketchy", Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava talked about intent."There isn't anything called 'toolkit' as such, but if you use it for misinformation that causes violence, then it is not acceptable. That was the intent here," Srivastava said, explaining the reason behind the arrest of the 22-year-old activist.On curbing misuse of social media, the Delhi Police chief said, "Strict surveillance can be done (of the platform). Anything that spreads anarchy or causes harm, action should be taken against them."Shrivastava further said that police's investigation is still underway in the 'toolkit' matter.Ravi was arrested on the charges of sedition for allegedly sharing a 'toolkit' - a Google document - in favour of the ongoing farmers' protest. The court granted her bail stating that evidence on record was not sufficient to keep a 22-year-old "young lady" with absolutely no criminal antecedents in custody.Additional Sessions Judge Dharmender Rana opined that citizens are "conscience keepers" of government in any democratic nation and cannot be put behind the bars simply because they choose to disagree with the state policies.Ravi was released from Tihar jail on Tuesday night, hours after the judge pronounced the bail order. She was arrested by the Delhi Police's Cyber Cell from her Bengaluru home on February 13.The Cyber Cell had lodged an FIR against "pro-Khalistan" creators of the "toolkit" for waging a "social, cultural and economic war against the Government of India".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-court-rap-over-disha-s-arrest-delhi-police-chief-explains-intent-101614172116278.html
24-02-2021||India||Railways ministry clarifies on fare hike: 'Aim to prevent crowding during Covid'||The ministry of railways on Wednesday clarified that its move to slightly increase fares for short distance passenger trains has been taken to discourage people from travelling amid the coronavirus pandemic. Through the move, the ministry is aiming to prevent crowding in trains and therefore curb the spread of Covid-19. The ministry added that the step was only taken to minimise travelling for the passengers and limit it to only necessary travel.“Covid is still around and in fact worsening in some states. Visitors from many states are being subjected to screening in other areas and discouraged to travel,” ministry of railways said in their press release.The railways also said that they aim to constantly increase the number of passenger trains in a phased manner. Regular trains had been stopped on March 22 last year after the nationwide lockdown was imposed to counter the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.“Indian Railways is constantly increasing the number of passenger carrying trains in a graded manner. Full restoration of regular services of passenger trains, to pre-Covid times, is to be considered keeping in view a range of factors and operational circumstances,” it said.After the lockdown, the railways has operationalised almost 65 per cent of the mail/express trains and over 90 per cent of the suburban services as compared to the pre-lockdown times, according to the ministry, which added that a total of 1250 mail/express, 5350 suburban services and more than 326 passenger trains are presently in operation on a daily basis. Railways is also aiming to gradually operationalise passenger trains which have always been subsidised.The ministry also said that they are constantly monitoring the coronavirus pandemic situation in all states, ensuring that services are restored keeping in mind the coronavirus protocols.India's Covid-19 infection tally crossed the 11 million-mark on Wednesday with the death toll reaching 1,56,567. As many as 13,742 new infections were added to the overall tally in the latest update on the health ministry website on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-ministry-clarifies-on-fare-hike-aim-to-prevent-crowding-during-covid-101614175845687.html

It will definitely inspire the young girls of the state to choose defence as a career option without any hesitation. They have already been at the forefront in many fields especially in the hilly areas," Rawat said.The chief minister also spoke about imparting primary self-defence training to girls studying in schools and colleges."We will try to provide the training in the coming days as it has become important apart from education in society. The authorities will chalk out a plan for it after which we would provide it on a large scale across the state," he said.Uttarakhand’s director general of police Ashok Kumar underlined why a female commando unit was a necessity."The anti-national forces today are also recruiting female cadres for their ill intentions. To tackle them, a female commando unit was much-needed," he said."Women in Uttarakhand have been playing an active role in many fields and now a female commando unit is just another shot in their arm for empowerment," said Kumar.During the event, CM also launched 148 motorcycle patrol units named Cheetah for policing activities in Dehradun.The CM and other dignitaries at the event also paid their tributes to the two state police personnel who lost their lives in the Chamoli flash flood on February 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-becomes-fourth-state-with-women-s-police-commando-unit-101614175458828.html

Amazed that over a period of few days we have already collected over 1 lakh ‘gamosas’ with anti-CAA messages,” said state Congress president Ripun Bora.Lok Sabha MP and chairman of the party’s manifesto drafting committee Gaurav Gogoi took to Twitter to mention the campaign and thank the people of Assam for their gesture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-congress-collects-over-1-lakh-gamosas-with-anti-caa-message-101614173224895.html

Mohapatra.Anticipating the high number of beneficiaries to be inoculated in the second phase of Covid-19 vaccination programme, the state government has asked all healthcare institutions, from primary level ones like Community Health Centres and Primary Health Care centers to tertiary ones like Medical colleges and hospitals, to be prepared for vaccinating individuals five days a week, except Sundays, according to guidelines.Healthcare professionals employed as Auxiliary Nursing Midwifery (ANMs) have been relieved of vaccination duty so as to not burden and inconvenience regular healthcare services, the guidelines said. Alternate vaccinators and verifiers will be identified and trained for conducting the inoculation drive. 6 to 7 mobile vaccine units will also be deployed in each block or urban unit for conducting vaccination sessions, the state government's proposed strategy added.A session plan for vaccine and logistic supply and mobility support will be prepared for each and every block, it said, adding that technological support in the form of laptops and desktops will also be provided to teams on site for upgradation of vaccination data and issuance of vaccination certificates. The Union government has said that vaccination certificates will be available across government platforms such as Co-WIN and Digilocker.This announcement comes as the Centre is all set to start the second phase of Covid-19 vaccination from March 1, in which vaccines will be administered to people above 60 years of age and those above 45 possessing co-morbidities, Union minister Prakash Javadekar said during a media briefing on Wednesday. India hopes to inoculate 300 million citizens against Covid-19 by August of this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-centre-announces-phase-2-of-covid-19-vaccination-odisha-releases-operational-strategy-101614173457999.html

So the party has emerged as a major challenge for the Congress (and not for the BJP)," the chief minister said, replying to reporter's question at Bavla near here.The AAP has breached the Congress' citadel and become an alternative to the party in Gujarat, he said."Apart from Surat, the AAP did not win a single seat in other cities. And none of its candidates will win in the coming local body polls. As in the cities, the BJP's winning streak will continue in rural areas," Rupani said.On Tuesday, Gujarat BJP president C R Paatil, however, had said the AAP's entry into Gujarat was "very painful" and the BJP will try to find a way to "deal with" the new entrant.The AAP on Tuesday made inroads in Gujarat politics by winning 27 seats in the Surat Municipal Corporation even though the BJP retained power by winning 93 seats in the 120- seat civic body.The Congress, which had won 36 seats in the SMC in the last elections, drew a blank.The BJP managed comfortable victories in all six municipal corporations - Ahmedabad, Surat, Rajkot, Vadodara, Bhavnagar and Jamnagar.Elections to 81 municipalities, 31 district panchayats and 231 taluka (tehsil) panchayats are scheduled to be held on February 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aap-is-challenge-for-congress-in-gujarat-cm-vijay-rupani-101614172767955.html
24-02-2021||India||Ahead of polls, Assam declared ‘disturbed area’ under AFSPA by Governor||Before the assembly polls in the state due in April-May, Assam Governor Jagdish Mukhi on Wednesday declared the entire state as a ‘disturbed area’ for six months beginning February 27.“As per powers conferred under Section 3 of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958, the Governor of Assam has declared the entire state of Assam as ‘disturbed area’ up to six months beyond February 27, 2021, unless withdrawn earlier,” said a release issued by the state government.The fresh order is an extension of a similar move in August 28 last year when the state was declared a ‘disturbed area’ for six months. Attacks on security forces in the northeast and recovery of large amounts of arms and ammunition from several parts of Assam had been cited as a reason for the move.Though there is no official comment yet on the reason behind the extension, government sources said recovery of arms and ammunition in parts of the state could have prompted the Governor to extend AFSPA in Assam.Significantly, the decision was taken a day after 1040 militants belonging to five different rebel outfits from Karbi Anglong region of the state had laid down arms in the presence of chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal.Considered a draconian legislation by some, AFSPA allows security forces to conduct search operations and arrest anyone without any warrant. The provisions of AFSPA are applicable only to seven states in the northeast.At present, besides Assam, AFSPA is in force in Nagaland and parts of Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-polls-assam-declared-disturbed-area-for-6-months-by-governor-101614171661116.html
24-02-2021||India||On India-China LAC row, Army chief says 'nobody wants an unsettled border'||Army Chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane on Wednesday spoke about India's position on the standoff with China in Ladakh and said that the resolve of safeguarding the country's interest was shown.The Army chief also said that India's engagements with China should continue as they have in the past and said that nobody wants an unsettled border, reported news agency ANI."As two neighbours who would like to have peace and tranquility on their borders and who would like that all the other engagements which have been going on in the past should continue also in the future," General Naravane was quoted as saying by ANI.Nobody wants an unsettled border, the army chief further said.Talking about the efforts to normalise the situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh, he said, "Whatever we did as a government, as a nation, has shown that the resolve that we have in maintaining our interest foremost.""I think that with this 'Whole-of-Government Approach' our relations with China would develop along the path that we wish to develop," General Naravane said.The recent India-China disengagement at Pangong Tso, the army chief said, saw a good end result and termed it as a win-win situation.A border standoff between the Indian and Chinese militaries began in May last year, and a month later, resulted in a bloody clash in Galwan Valley in which 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese troops were killed.After nearly nine months, the armies withdrew their artillery and camps, marking the disengagement.In a joint statement on Sunday, India and China said that the disengagement of troops in Pangong Lake area in Eastern Ladakh is a significant step forward for resolution of other remaining issues along the LAC in the western sector.The two sides also agreed to follow the important consensus of their state leaders, continue their communication and dialogue, stabilise and control the situation on the ground and push for a mutually acceptable resolution of the remaining issues in a steady and orderly manner so as to jointly maintain peace and tranquility in the border areas.The statement came after the nearly 16-hour-long Corps Commander-level talks at the Moldo border point on the Chinese side of the LAC that began at around 10 AM on Saturday and ended at 2 AM on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-india-china-lac-row-army-chief-says-nobody-wants-an-unsettled-border-101614169227196.html
24-02-2021||India||Uttarakhand CM back from Delhi, buzz around cabinet expansion grows||Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat discussed the cabinet expansion during his Delhi visit and may undertake the exercise after the state budget session, said a senior BJP leader familiar with the developments. There is just a year’s time left for the next state polls."The CM has likely discussed some names for the expansion in cabinet which have been approved by the central leadership. The move will be likely taken by the CM after the upcoming budget session in Assembly from March 1-9," said the BJP leader quoted above who did not wish to be named.CM Rawat met home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, among other senior party leaders, during his Delhi visit.However, the BJP state leadership said that the move is yet to be discussed in the state.BJP state president, Bansidhar Bhagat, said, "The development is not in my knowledge as I haven't spoken to the CM after his return from Delhi."There are three vacancies in the cabinet. Other than the CM, there are six cabinet ministers: Satpal Maharaj, Subodh Uniyal, Madan Kaushik, Yashpal Arya, Harak Singh Rawat and Arvind Pandey while two ministers of state with independent charge, Rekha Arya and Dhan Singh Rawat.The Opposition Congress termed the exercise a “formality”, stressing it will have no bearing on governance with hardly 12 months left for the elections. Congress state general secretary Vijay Saraswat said that the cabinet expansion will be "of no meaning before the polls”.Political expert SMA Kazmi said, "Though expanding the cabinet just before the elections has got no logic but it is a tactic to pacify those MLAs who have been hoping to become ministers."He also said that it will have no political gains for the BJP but will result in resentment within the party."If the cabinet is expanded then the ministers will practically get a tenure of just 6-7 months as the polls will be held in February with the code of conduct in place in January. No work can be done in such a short period. It will only lead to resentment among those who will not make the cut," said Kazmi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-cm-back-from-delhi-buzz-around-cabinet-expansion-grows-101614172350939.html
24-02-2021||India||Karnataka puts on hold mandatory RT-PCR rule for commuters from Kerala||A week after making negative RT-PCR test reports mandatory for travellers from Kerala, the administration of Karnataka's border district Dakshina Kannada’s Deputy Commissioner announced temporary suspension of the order.“Students, emergency vehicles and those who are working on daily wages will be allowed to come to Karnataka without restrictions, Deputy Commissioner K Rajendra said.The district administration has set up mobile testing centres at the border checkpoints and more than 1,000 samples have been collected so far from these centres after a pike in Cvid-19 cases in Kerala. Similarly, health department officials have been sent to various colleges in Mangaluru to test students coming from the neighbouring state.While the protest from commuters and the difficulties in implementation led to the suspension of travel restrictions, the interdependence between Kerala’s Kasaragod and Dakshina Kannada’s district headquarters Mangaluru has fuelled resistance to such restrictions.For the residents of Kasaragod, Mangaluru city is a lifeline. Even though Mangaluru and Kasaragod are on either side of a map, they are closely knit, say local residents. “Mangaluru, which is referred to as Mangalapuram in Kerala, is the closest city to Kasaragod. From anywhere in Kasaragod, Mangaluru is just 10-50 km away. At the same, the closest city in Kerala, which is Kannur, is more than 100 km away,” Prakash Manjeshwar, a resident of Manjeshwaram in the northern tip of Kasargod.The residents in and around Kasaragod have been thronging Mangaluru for decades for treatment at the speciality hospitals and for education.“Kasaragod doesn't have many good hospitals, schools or colleges. Mangaluru is the only option for us. Because of this, people in and around Kasaragod had struggled a lot during the initial days of the lockdown when the Karnataka authorities restricted travel, especially for those with medical conditions,” said Krishna Kishore, who runs a business in Mangaluru and lives in Kasaragod.Even for Mangaluru, the visitors from Kasaragod are crucial for the local economy. “Most of the hospitals get their patients and colleges get their students from across the border. But most importantly, the workforce for the factories, commercial establishments and other offices come from Kasaragod. Putting any restrictions on travel, like they are doing in Bengaluru is not possible because of these reasons,” said an official of the district admiration, who did not want to be named.After Karnataka passed an order for all passengers from Kerala to produce a negative RT-PCR test taken not more than 72 hours before commencement of the journey to Karnataka, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, complaining that the restrictions on inter-state movement of people was contrary to the Centre’s instructions.In response, Health Minister K Sudhakar said that Karnataka had not prohibited inter-state travel between the two states and only demanded a negative RT-PCR test report not older than 72 hours.Krishnamurthy Niduvje, a resident of Kasaragod said that there were only three hospitals that conducted RT-PCR tests in his district and the closest place for him to get a test was in Mangaluru.“There are thousands of people who work in Mangaluru and live in Kasaragod. For all of them to get tested every fourth day, in just three hospitals in Kasaragod is not practical. The functioning of companies will be affected by such a decision,” he said.People in the district administration familiar with the development said they plan to resume the negative test certificate by the end of the week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-puts-on-hold-mandatory-rt-pcr-rule-for-commuters-from-kerala-101614172037370.html

What else is there to say?"Congress leader Shashi Tharoor tweeted, "Maybe they just realised the stadium was named for a Home Minister who had banned their parent organisation! Or maybe this is advance booking to ensure the next visiting Head of State is hosted here, like Trump? Or is this the beginning of a legacy-creation-thru-labelling spree (sic)?"His party colleague Rajeev Satav said, "Renaming Motera cricket stadium from Sardar Patel to Narendra Modi is an absolute disgrace. This shows how narcissistic our PM has become. This is outrageous and a clear sign of autocratic dictatorship."Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, without directly talking about the stadium, tweeted a Hindi quote of Sardar Patel, "There is something unique in this soil, which has always been the abode of great souls despite many obstacles."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-motera-stadium-renamed-after-pm-complex-continues-to-have-sardar-patel-name-govt-101614171320067.html

RBM includes sand, gravel and stones.Riverbed material includes sand, gravel and stones.In its affidavit the government said that since the rivers, especially when flooded, bring riverbed material with them on these private lands, it had decided to grant lease/pattas to private persons for extraction of riverbed material from the banks of rivers in the state.SRS Gill, counsel for the petitioner sought time from the high court to file a rejoinder.“We have sought two weeks’ time for filing a rejoinder (response) on the state government’s affidavit. The court has granted us time and the next hearing of the matter has been fixed on March 17”, he said.A division bench of chief justice RS Chauhan and justice Alok Verma heard the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by US Nagar-based social activist Ramesh Lal, who had had alleged last year that allowing mining on private lands adjacent to riverbeds will give rise to illegal mining, cutting and erosion of the banks, flooding and affect the overall ecology of the rivers in the Himalayan stateIn August last year, the HC had stayed till further order the state government’s May 5, 2020 notification which allowed mining of RBM on private lands adjacent to the riverbeds in the state.The petition had sought quashing of May 5 notification with a specific reference to Clause 1(ka) of Rule 23 of Uttarakhand Minor Mineral Concession Rules 2001 and urged the high court to direct authorities concerned not to grant any lease/pattas to private persons for extraction of riverbed material from the banks of rivers in the state.Gill said under its May 5, 2020 notification, the state government had made an amendment in rule 23 (1) of Uttarakhand Minor Mineral Concession Rules-2001, allowing allotment of mining leases on private land adjacent to riverbeds in the state.The HC in its interim order had stated that according to the counter affidavit filed by the state government, “no permission has been granted to any landowner to carry out mining activity in the riverbeds....on being questioned, the additional chief standing counsel ..submits that extraction from riverbanks is being permitted by the State government on private lands”.Questioning this, the HC in its order had said, “We asked a very specific question as to whether riverbanks form part of a private property. We find no convincing answer to the same. Prima facie, we are of the view that riverbeds and riverbanks are necessarily the property of the State Government. It cannot form part of a private property”.The HC had maintained that “permission for extraction, subject to provisions of law, may be granted in a private land, but there can never ever be extraction on riverbeds and riverbanks. However, the additional chief standing counsel for the State submits to the contrary. He states that permission is being granted by the State for extraction on riverbanks on private property”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-responds-to-pil-against-mining-riverbed-material-on-private-lands-101614169310010.html

Therefore, the lieutenant governor (L-G) has recommended suspending the 14th assembly. Now, our approval will be sent to the President. After his approval, the assembly will stand dissolved.”The Congress government was reduced to a minority after five of its MLAs and one from ally Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) resigned.

While Narayanasamy blamed the former L-G Kiran Bedi for colluding with the opposition to topple his government, the BJP blamed him for misrule and failing to administer the Union territory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-cabinet-approves-president-s-rule-in-puducherry-101614168106705.html

Besides, another team led by a Dy SP with five policemen is present in Lucknow's SPM Civil Hospital where she is undergoing treatment for 72 per cent burns.

"Everyone above the age of 60 and those over 45 and having other illnesses will be able to get Covid-19 vaccine from March 1 for free at government facilities and for a charge at many private hospitals," Javadekar said at a press conference.Javadekar also said that the proposal to this effect was approved at a meeting of the Union Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. "While the vaccine will be given for free at government centres, it will be available for a charge, to be decided later, at many private hospitals," he added.Cabinet approves President's Rule in PuducherryThe Union Cabinet has approved a proposal to impose President's Rule in Puducherry, days after a Congress-led government in the union territory lost power just before a trust vote.Announcing the Cabinet decision, Javadekar told reporters that the decision was taken as no party claimed to form a government in Puducherry following the resignation of the chief minister there.Subsequently, the Lieutenant General had recommended President's Rule in Puducherry and the Union Cabinet has approved the same, the minister said.After the President's assent, the assembly will get resolved, Javadekar said, adding that further necessary steps for administrative work in Puducherry would be taken soon.He also noted that the model code of conduct is expected to come into effect soon after the Election Commission announces the dates for elections there, along with four states.Govt clears PLI scheme to boost manufacturing of laptops, tablets, PCsThe cabinet also cleared a production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for laptops, tablets, all-in-one PCs and servers, as it looked to woo global players to tap India's manufacturing capabilities.The approval of the PLI scheme for these hi-tech IT hardware gadgets comes after the Cabinet last week cleared a ₹12,195 crore scheme for telecom equipment manufacturing.Briefing reporters after a meeting of the Cabinet, Communications and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the Cabinet cleared the about ₹7,350 crore PLI scheme for IT hardware that would cover laptops, tablets, all-in-one PCs and servers.Cabinet's nod to Production Linked Incentive scheme for pharmaceuticalsThe Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for financial year 2020-21 to 2028-29.The scheme will benefit domestic manufacturers, help in creating employment and is expected to contribute to the availability of a wider range of affordable medicines for consumers, a statement issued by the ministry of chemicals and fertilisers said.It added that the PLI scheme is expected to promote the production of high-value products in the country and increase the value addition in exports. "The total incremental sales of ₹2,94,000 crore and total incremental exports of ₹1,96,000 crore are estimated during six years from 2022-23 to 2027-28," the statement read.The scheme, the ministry said, is expected to generate employment for both skilled and unskilled personnel, estimated at 20,000 direct and 80,000 indirect jobs as a result of growth in the sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/presidents-rule-in-puducherry-to-vaccination-drive-key-highlights-of-cabinet-meet-101614163616004.html

24-02-2021||India||'125-year-old Congress defeated': Arvind Kejriwal on AAP's performance in Gujarat civic polls||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said he will visit Gujarat on February 26, after his party's stunning performance in civic polls. The AAP won 27 seats in Surat in its first outing. The BJP secured 93 out of the 120 seats in Surat, while Congress and other parties did not win any seats."AAP has performed very well in the local body polls in Gujarat. I thank the people of Gujarat and especially of Surat. 125 years-old Congress party has been defeated and a new party - the AAP is given responsibility as the main opposition party. Our every candidate will work with honesty," the Delhi chief minister said."I will be visiting Surat on February 26 to thank the people for helping Aam Aadmi Party emerge as the main opposition party in Gujarat local body polls and rejecting Congress," Kejriwal added.Also Read: Failure of Congress, not emergence of AAP, says BJPKejriwal said that a new type of politics has emerged from Gujarat - the politics of honesty. "It is based on work done. It is the politics of good schools, hospitals and cheap electricity. We will develop Gujarat along with developing the lives of people of the state," the AAP chief said.The Congress failed to open its account in Surat for the first time since 1995, prompting its city president Sagar Raika to quit. In the 2015 elections, the Congress won 36 seats out of a total of 116 in the SMC. The AAP, which did not win any seats in its first electoral foray in Gujarat in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, chose to fight the elections at the grassroots level this time before graduating to the 2022 state polls.Promising to be an alternative to the BJP and the Congress, the party contested without its national convener Kejriwal. But Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia conducted road shows that drew healthy crowds, especially in Surat.AAP registered victories in areas dominated by the Patidar community, and where the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS), of which Congress leader Hardik Patel was once the convener, held sway. The PAAS threw its lot behind the AAP this time.The BJP on Tuesday put up a spectacular performance in the Gujarat municipal corporation elections, improving its numbers over the 2016 polls and nearly decimating the Congress.The party is set to retain power in all municipal corporations, which went to the polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arvind-kejriwal-on-aap-s-performance-in-gujarat-civic-polls-125-year-old-congress-defeated-101614165162111.html

The injured chowkidar, identified as Lal Babu Paswan was first taken to the primary health center at Majorganj and later shifted to the sadar hospital at Sitamarhi town. Doctors said his condition is precarious.Eyewitness said the encounter took place at around 12.15 pm when the police team, led by the deceased sub-inspector Vinod Ram went to the house of a fugitive gangster and alleged liquor smuggler.“As soon as the police team reached the house, the criminals started firing on them. The SI died on the spot after a bullet hit him on the forehead,” said an eyewitness on condition of anonymity.Another villager Satish Prasad said that the body of another person was found on the road connecting Kuari village to Madhopur, hardly half a kilometer away from the site of the encounter. He also said that he saw another person drenched in blood fleeing towards Madhopur village.Sitamarhi’s superintendent of police Anil Kumar Singh said the body was that of the criminal that the police had gone to arrest.“The body was that of Ranjay Kumar Singh whom the police team wanted to arrest,” Singh said.Sitamarhi who had rushed for the spot denied there was an encounter with the liquor mafia but said the gun battle took place between police personnel and criminals.“The team was sent to the Kuari Madan village to arrest a wanted criminal, who along with his associates and family members attacked the police team. We have cordoned the entire area and a massive manhunt has started to nab the criminals. No one will be spared,” he said shortly after the encounter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-policeman-killed-in-encounter-with-criminals-in-sitamarhi-101614164196510.html

24-02-2021||India||BJP will get befitting reply for 'subverting' mandate in Puducherry: Moily||Accusing the BJP of using money power to make the Congress government fall in Puducherry, senior Congress leader M Veerappa Moily on Wednesday said the people will give a befitting reply to the saffron party in upcoming polls for "subverting" a popular mandate, and asserted that upholding democratic ideals will be the main issue in the elections.Moily, who is the Congress' senior observer for upcoming polls in the Union Territory, also said the party's alliance with Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) will continue, and together they will get a "thumping" majority in the elections.In an interview with PTI, Moily claimed the Puducherry polls will mark the "beginning of the fall of the BJP" in the country and the strengthening of democratic power through the Congress party.Lashing out at the BJP, the former Union minister said they never allowed the Congress government to function in Puducherry by fronting then Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi."Her only exclusive mission was that the Congress government does not function.From time to time, the issue was brought to the notice of Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) and Home Minister (Amit Shah), either through media or directly by the CM V Narayansamy, but they did not listen," Moily said.His attack on BJP comes two days after the Congress government in Puducherry fell after Chief Minister Narayanasamy resigned ahead of the confidence vote in the Assembly with the coalition ministry reduced to a minority due to a spate of resignations of party MLAs and a DMK legislator recently.Moily alleged the central government led by Modi and Shah "killed democracy" in Puducherry for the last four-five years as no development programme was allowed to prosper.He claimed that MLAs were also suffocated and were given the impression that even if the government was elected back, Bedi will not allow even the new dispensation to function."They (BJP) lured them with money and power. The MLAs were tempted as they were already frustrated with the government not being allowed to function," he said.Moily described the spate of resignations of MLAs and the fall of the government as an "open massacre of democracy directly abetted" by the Government of India through the Lieutenant Governor.However, he said the government fell not because of the spate of resignations but due to nominated MLAs being allowed to vote."Nominating three MLAs and giving them the power to vote was the most undemocratic thing that could be done. Even the judiciary also did not act very quickly," he said.Asked about Bedi's removal as LG recently, Moily claimed that the BJP thought that it would help them in the polls as the electorate would have run against it because she did not allow the government to function."So, they want to put everything on Kiran Bedi. Even though Kiran Bedi was only a puppet in their hands now they will put everything on her and say she has done it and we have no role to play. This is the game played against Congress," he alleged.On what would be the key poll plank in the upcoming elections, Moily said upholding democratic ideals will be the main issue."Supporting BJP in Puducherry would mean writing the epitaph of the Constitution, in other words, people will not vote for BJP because of the game played by it against the basic tenets of democracy," he said.Moily said the polls will be about the subversion of people's mandate by the BJP."This naked display of autocracy and throwing the principles of democracy to the wind will be given a befitting reply by the electorate," he said.Moily hailed Narayansamy for his work as the chief minister while dealing with natural calamities and in controlling COVID-19."The people will punish them (BJP). They have committed the gravest crime by obstructing benefits of development to reach people," he said.Moily said the people of Puducherry have seen through the BJP's game plan."The ugly demonstration of their money power, political power, and intolerance to other party's rule will have to come to an end in this country and Puducherry will be the real field to demonstrate that," he said.With the exit of the Congress government in Puducherry, Punjab, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh are the only three states in the country ruled by the party on its own.Elections for the 30 assembly seats in Puducherry are likely to take place in the next few months.Moily also asserted that the fall of the Congress governments in Madhya Pradesh last year and in Puducherry was completely different."In Puducherry, it is not about the elected MLAs, it was the nominated MLAs who led to the government's fall. If there was no voting power to the nominated MLAs, the government would not have fallen," he said. Congress will bounce back, Moily added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-will-get-befitting-reply-for-subverting-mandate-in-puducherry-moily-101614159029013.html

24-02-2021||India||Palghar lynching case: SC asks Maharashtra Police to place fresh charge sheet on record||The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked Maharashtra Police to place on record the second supplementary charge sheet filed in the case related to alleged lynching of three people, including two seers, in Palghar district in April last year.A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and R S Reddy was informed by the counsel for the Maharashtra government that a second supplementary charge sheet has been filed in the case. The bench said the fresh charge sheet shall be placed before it on record in two weeks and posted the matter for further hearing thereafter.On September 7 last year, Maharashtra Police had informed the top court that it has punished "delinquent" policemen for dereliction of duty in the case.The top court on August 6 last year had asked Maharashtra Police to apprise it of the inquiry and action taken against the errant police personnel in the case.Maharashtra Police had said as many as 18 delinquent police personnel have been awarded varying punishments and some of them have been dismissed from service and some of them have been compulsorily retired.Some delinquent cops have been punished with salary cuts also, it had said, adding that the state's criminal investigation department has so far filed two charge sheets in the alleged lynching case.On June 11 last year, the top court had sought a response from the state government on two petitions seeking separate probe by the CBI and the NIA into the alleged lynching.The bench was hearing petitions including the one filed by sadhus of 'Shri Panch Dashban Juna Akhara' and relatives of the deceased seers.Their plea alleged the investigation by the state police was being conducted in a biased manner.The other plea, seeking an NIA probe into the incident, has been filed by advocate Ghanshyam Upadhyay.Besides the Maharashtra government, one of the petitions has arrayed the Centre, CBI and the director general of police of Maharashtra as respondents in the matter.The three victims from Kandivali in Mumbai were travelling in a car to attend a funeral in Surat in Gujarat amid the Covid-19-induced nationwide lockdown when their vehicle was stopped and they were attacked and killed by a mob in Gadchinchile village on the night of April 16 last year in the presence of police.The victims were identified as Chikne Maharaj Kalpavrukshagiri, 70, Sushil Giri Maharaj, 35, and Nilesh Telgade, 30, who was driving the vehicle.While hearing a separate plea seeking a CBI probe in the case, the top court had on May 1 directed the Maharashtra government to submit a status report on the investigation in the matter.The plea filed by 'sadhus' of 'Shri Panch Dashban Juna Akhara' has sought transfer of the probe to the CBI, claiming that there is "reasonable apprehension of bias" if Maharashtra Police proceeds with the investigation."Several video clippings have emerged on social media and news reports which very clearly demonstrate the active involvement of the police present, who can be seen handing over the three persons to the unlawful assembly of persons gathered," the plea has claimed.The police have arrested over 100 people in connection with the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-asks-maharashtra-police-to-place-fresh-charge-sheet-on-record-in-palghar-case-101614157216230.html

24-02-2021||India||Disha Ravi gets bail in toolkit case: Key points of the order||A Delhi court on Tuesday granted bail to climate activist Disha Ravi days after the Delhi Police arrested her for allegedly editing a social media document, or toolkit, about the ongoing farmer protest against three central laws. Here are some key points from additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana’s bail order:1. Toolkit did not incite the tractor rally violence on January 26 in Delhi:According to the prosecution, Ravi and the other accused in the case allegedly edited and shared with Swedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg the toolkit with the intention of inciting seditious activities against India. But Rana found nothing illegal or unlawful about the document. He acknowledged the toolkit had segments on “Digital Strike” through hashtags, “Tweet Storm” and “Physical Action” related to the farmers’ march into Delhi. But Rana pointed out that “any call for any kind of violence is conspicuously absent.”About the alleged sharing of the toolkit with Thunberg, the court said every citizen has a “right to use the best means of imparting and receiving communication, as long as the same is permissible under the four corners of law and as such have access to [the] audience abroad.”Also Read | Toolkit case: ‘Justice has been done,’ says father after Disha Ravi’s bail2. Do not invoke sedition when it is legitimate dissent:Rana cited the distinction between sedition and dissent and questioned if Ravi and others were being targeted because they voiced opposition to the farm laws.Additional solicitor general SV Raju, who appeared for the police, contended the toolkit had embedded hyperlinks with an intent to defame India abroad. Rana found nothing objectionable about one of the two links. About the second link, he agreed it was “indeed objectionable” as it had certain negative imputations about India but held it was still “not seditious” because it did not have the tendency to foment violence.Rana underscored the significance of dissent in a democracy. “Citizens are conscience keepers of government in any democratic Nation. They cannot be put behind bars simply because they choose to disagree with the State policies. The offence of sedition cannot be invoked to minister to the wounded vanity of the governments.”3. No evidence against Ravi or Poetic Justice Foundation (PJF) of conspiracy with secessionist forces:The police sought Ravi’s custodial interrogation citing her alleged links with the pro-Khalistani secessionist group, PJF. They claimed she created the toolkit in association with the PJF members. Canada-based Mo Dhaliwal and Anita Lal were cited as the people behind PJF, who are allegedly known Khalistan supporters.The police conceded that neither was the PJF a banned organisation nor had they registered any criminal case against Dhaliwal and Lal.The court too held there is nothing on record to suggest that there was any call, incitement, instigation, or exhortation on the part of the accused and the organisations and their associates to foment violence on January 26 during the farmer tractor rally.Rana said that there was “not even an iota of evidence” to connect the perpetrators of the January 26 violence with the PJF or Ravi. He added that over 100 people allegedly involved in the violence had been arrested and interrogated “but no evidence connecting applicant [Ravi] with the actual perpetrators” has been brought forth.About Ravi’s links with Canada-based Kisaan Ekta Co, the court noted the police had not even alleged that it was an organisation engaged in seditious activities. Hence, her association would be meaningless for the purpose of this case, it added.The police also failed to establish any link between Ravi and Sikhs for Justice, a banned organisation. “There is absolutely no link established on record between the applicant and the said banned organisation,” Rana said. He added that “there is nothing on record to suggest that Ravi subscribed to any secessionist idea.”4. Creation of a WhatsApp group or editing a toolkit is not an offence:The prosecution alleged Ravi deleted a WhatsApp group called “Intl farmers strike” and also edited the toolkit after it was leaked by Thunberg. But the court said the creation of a WhatsApp group or being editor of an innocuous toolkit is not an offence. “Further, since the link with the said toolkit or PJF has not been found to be objectionable, mere deletion of the WhatsApp chat to destroy the evidence linking her with the toolkit and PJF also becomes meaningless,” said Rana. He called deleting chats “nothing more than an anxious effort to stay away from unnecessary controversies.”5. Cannot keep Ravi in jail to allow police to collect more evidence:The court told the police that it could not allow them to keep Ravi behind bars only to give the investigators more time to collect evidence or to make her sit with other accused.Former additional Solicitor General Sidharth Luthra said the points made in the bail order will be beneficial to the co-accused as well. “Although parity may not be a ground in a case of a regular bail and anticipatory bail which other co-accused have filed, the scrutiny of the evidence by the court will come into play when their cases are taken up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disha-ravi-gets-bail-in-toolkit-case-key-points-of-the-order-101614156286082.html

Expert committee meet todayThe court said, "All these notifications are contradictory and there is no clarity as to which are applicable. There is no clarity whether the January 29 SOP continues to be in operation in view of the stand of the central government."Since there is no clarity about the SOP and the petitioners (family) include two minor children below the age of 10 years, they shall remain in home quarantine instead of institutional quarantine. They shall strictly adhere to the quarantine norms."The court also directed the Delhi government to "give clear instructions to the IGI airport to display the current SOP prominently on its website, so that travellers are aware and there is no confusion."With the direction, the court disposed of the plea by the family challenging the action taken against them.Advocate Ganesh Chand Sharma, appearing for the family, had on Tuesday told the court that all the members were tested for Covid-19 when they arrived here from the UK on February 20 and despite testing negative they were "illegally and unlawfully" sent to institutional quarantine.Also read| Delhi to make negative RT-PCR test must for passengers from 5 statesHe had also told the court that according to the guidelines published on the Delhi airport website, institutional quarantine was not mandatory for all the passengers arriving from the UK and was applicable only to those who tested positive for Covid-19.The guidelines also exempted from institutional quarantine those travelling with minors below the age of 10 years, Sharma told the court.The petition had said that before starting from the UK, the family had undergone a Covid-19 test and they were issued a 'fit-to-fly' certificate.After arriving at Delhi, they were again tested and were found negative for Covid-19, despite which they were sent to institutional quarantine at their cost in a 5-star hotel instead of home quarantine as sought by the petitioners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-allows-home-quarantine-for-covid-19-negative-family-after-returning-from-uk-101614153804803.html

24-02-2021||India||Idea of climate action should not be to move climate ambition goal post to 2050: India at UNSC||India has said that the idea of climate action should not be to move the goal post to 2050 and countries must fulfil their pre-2020 commitments, calling on the global community to view climate change as a “wake-up call” to strengthen multilateralism and seek equitable solutions for a sustainable world.Minister for Environment, Forests and Climate Change Prakash Javadekar on Tuesday said the delivery on the commitment by developed countries to jointly mobilise USD 100 billion per year by 2020 in support of climate action in developing countries has been elusive.He was speaking at the UN Security Council’s open debate on ‘Maintenance of international peace and security: Addressing climate-related risks to international peace and security'.“The idea of climate action should not be to move the climate ambition goal post to 2050. It is important for countries to fulfil their pre-2020 commitments. Climate Action needs to go hand-in-hand with the framework for financial, technical and capacity-building support to countries that need it,” he said.The year 2050 is when nations have been called on to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions. Emissions must fall by half by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions no later than 2050 to reach the 1.5 Celsius goal of the Paris agreement.He said as nations prepare to meet for the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow in November, there is a “significant opportunity" for countries to integrate low-carbon development in their Covid-19 rescue and recovery measures and long-term mitigation strategies that are scheduled to be announced at the summit.The summit will bring parties together to accelerate action towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.“Let us then make the transition to a more climate-friendly lifestyle by adapting to a low carbon-development pathway based on our needs and not on our greed. Let us view climate change as a wake-up call and an opportunity to strengthen multilateralism and seek equitable and inclusive solutions to leave a greener, cleaner and a sustainable world for our future generations,” he said.In his speech, Javadekar emphasised that the global community has addressed the issue of climate change through the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, which together represent a “delicately balanced” global democratic effort to take climate action in a nationally determined manner based on the ‘Common but Differentiated Responsibility and Respective Capabilities’.“Therefore, before we start discussing the issue of securitisation of climate, we need to ensure that we are not building a parallel climate track where these mechanisms and principles are brushed aside or not duly considered,” he said.Noting that even the best science available claims that climate change only exacerbates conflict and is not a reason for conflict and does not threaten peace and security, he said that in a number of fragile contexts, where governments are struggling to provide basic services due to capacity and legitimacy issues, instances of chronic emergency conditions and famine risks are largely driven by continued political violence disrupting harvests and aid supplies rather than by climate factors alone.Javadekar also pointed out that countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) are largely about mitigation commitments and adaptation requirements that, collectively, determine whether countries will achieve the Paris goal of limiting the global average temperate increase to well below 2°C.While climate change does not directly or inherently cause violent conflict, its interaction with other social, political and economic factors can, nonetheless, exacerbate drivers of conflict and fragility and have negative impacts on peace, stability and security, he said.India suggested that in order to better integrate climate change adaptation and peacebuilding, there is a need to build robust governance structures at the local, national and regional levels to address climate and fragility-related risks.Javadekar also underscored that impacts of climate change and its associated security risks have important gender dimensions, and women and girls experience the interplay between climate change and peace and security in direct and profound ways.Highlighting the significant steps taken by India to fight climate change and deliver on its commitments, Javadekar said New Delhi’s mitigation strategies have emphasised on clean and efficient energy systems; safe, smart and sustainable green mass urban transportation network; planned afforestation; and integrating green thinking across all production and consumption sectors.He said India is the only country on track among the G20 nations to meet its climate change mitigation commitments and the country is not only meeting its Paris Agreement targets but will also exceed them. India, which currently has the fastest-growing solar energy programme in the world, has expanded access to clean cooking fuel to over 80 million households.India’s commitment of installing 450 gigawatt of renewable energy, elimination of single use plastic, 100 per cent railway electrification, and creation of an additional carbon sink by restoring 26 million hectares of degraded land among other measures have only added to its climate ambitions, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/idea-of-climate-action-should-not-be-to-move-climate-ambition-goal-post-to-2050-india-at-unsc-101614153985957.html

24-02-2021||India||Rahul Gandhi's 'spiteful, vile' politics based on lies: Smriti Irani||Slamming Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's statement on promising a fisheries ministry in the Centre, Union Minister for Textiles and Women and Child Development Smriti Irani on Wednesday said his 'spiteful, vile' politics is based on lies.Speaking to ANI, Irani said: "The fact that Rahul Gandhi sustains on lie was evident when he again promised the people in Kerala, a ministry for fisheries. The fact that he insults the people of Kerala by speaking a lie time and again is something that the citizens need to take note of. He was made available data with regard to the Ministry of Fisheries. What is astounding that this gentleman himself asks a question of the same ministry."Also Read | Rahul Gandhi reiterates claim about fisheries ministry, this time in KeralaThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) minister said Gandhi has established defeat for his party through his lies, further alleging that he disassociates himself from the truth and continuously propagates lies to insult the intelligence of citizens across the country."I think the spiteful, vile and vengeful politics of Rahul Gandhi, which insults not only the people and voters of Amethi, but which seeks to create a divide between north and south of India. It is to be condemned by every Indian citizen," she said."Before this, he made a statement from Assam with regards to the people in the state of Gujarat, and the result was such that the Congress was wiped out in the local body elections, as was visible in the election results from Gujarat yesterday. The question that begets the politics of Rahul Gandhi is for how long will he continue to lie to the people of our country, for how long will he divide the people of our country, for how long will he try to build hatred between communities," Irani further mentioned.Highlighting the second anniversary of Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi, the Union Minister further remarked that Gandhi refuses to acknowledge the fact that over 10 crore farmers have benefitted in this initiative and over ₹1 crore has gone directly into the accounts of the farmers, adding that his politics is based on lies.Days after wrongly claiming that there is no dedicated ministry to deal with the issues of fishermen, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday repeated his promise of forming a central ministry dedicated to fishermen of India.The comments of the Congress MP came at an interaction with the fishing community in Kollam's Thangassery."Just like our farmers farm the land, you farm the sea. Farmers have a Ministry in Delhi, you don't. No one speaks for you in Delhi. The first thing I would do is to have a ministry dedicated to the fishermen of India so that your issues can be defended and protected," said the Congress leader in Kollam. He made a similar gaffe in Puducherry earlier this month.Wednesday's repeat gaffe by Gandhi also came in for wide ridicule from several ministers and also on social media as memes and comments flooded various platforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-s-spiteful-vile-politics-based-on-lies-smriti-irani-101614153887344.html

Along with Annie Raja and Sipa Sinha, she leads the Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan, a city-based collective that works on food rights.In a statement announcing the recipients of the award, Blinken said that around the world corruption threatens security and stability, hinders economic growth, undermines democracy and human rights, destroys trust in public institutions, facilitates transnational crime, and siphons away public and private resources.“The Biden administration recognises that we will only be successful in combating these issues by working in concert with committed partners, including courageous individuals who champion anticorruption efforts and countries working to fulfil their commitments to international anticorruption standards,” he said.In line with this objective, Blinken announced the International Anticorruption Champions Award which recognises individuals “who have worked tirelessly, often in the face of adversity, to defend transparency, combat corruption, and ensure accountability in their own countries”.Besides Bhardwaj, the other recipients of the award are Ardian Dvorani of Albania, Diana Salazar of Ecuador, Sophia Pretrick of the Federated States of Micronesia, Juan Francisco Sandoval Alfaro of Guatemala, Ibrahima Kalil Gueye of Guinea, Dhuha A Mohammed of Iraq, Bolot Temirov of the Kyrgyz Republic, Mustafa Abdullah Sanalla of Libya, Victor Sotto of the Philippines, Francis Ben Kaifala of Sierra Leone, and Ruslan Ryaboshapka of Ukraine.“They inspire us and so many of their counterparts pursuing these ideals around the world,” Blinken said.“As President [Joe] Biden has emphasised, our commitment to truth, transparency, and accountability is a mission that we must live at home and exemplify abroad. I commend the dedication of these 12 brave individuals to these same ideals,” he added.Also Read: What led to Covid-19 rise?

24-02-2021||India||Gujarat municipal polls: Failure of Congress, not emergence of AAP, says BJP||Riding high on the outcome of the Gujarat civic election, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is confident that it has decimated the opposition and proved the accusations of not responding well to the challenges brought on by the pandemic false. The party seemed unfazed by the emergence of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) as an opposition and said the AAP’s gains should worry the Congress more. Senior party leaders said the AAP’s win in 27 seats in the Surat Municipal Corporation cannot be read as the emergence of the party in the BJP stronghold, leave alone the entire state. “It is a wake-up call for the Congress. They have been decimated in these elections. As for the AAP, they only benefitted from the non-BJP votes,” said a party functionary. While the BJP improved its tally from 389 seats that it won in 2015 to 489 seats, the Congress was reduced to 45 seats from its previously held 174 seats across the municipal corporations of Ahmedabad, Jamnagar, Bhavnagar, Surat, Rajkot and Vadodara. Also Read | ‘Honoured to serve Gujarat’: Modi after civic polls sweepIn Surat, the BJP won 93 seats, the AAP opened its account with 27 seats and the Congress won none in a 120-member civic body.The Congress had won 36 seats in Surat during the 2015 elections.A second party leader said the emergence of AAP in Surat, the hometown of the state unit president Chandrakant Patil, also a Lok Sabha MP from Navsari, does not indicate a dip in support for the BJP. “The BJP’s hold in Surat continues; there is no dent in the party’s support base. The AAP has moved into the space vacated by the Congress. The leadership crisis in the Congress is forcing it out as the principal opposition,” the second leader said. However, there are concerns that the AAP could stoke issues that have been weak spots for the BJP, such as the Patidar movement. Surat was the epicentre of the Patidar reservation movement that sought to bring the community under the ambit of the Other Backward Classes (OBC) quota. “The BJP has learnt to turn anti-incumbency into pro-incumbency based on its administration, however there is always scope for the opposition to change the narrative based on conflict-ridden issues. For instance, in Punjab, the farm agitation has been hijacked by vested interests,” said the second functionary. On Tuesday, AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj described the win as “breaching the citadel of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP”.“People of Gujarat have voted for politics of work as they were fed up by the politics of BJP and Congress. The people of Gujarat wanted an alternative and AAP has emerged as the key alternative to the present parties. Now the upcoming assembly election will be only between Aam Aadmi Party and BJP,” said Arvind Kejriwal, the national convener of the AAP, in a press statement issued on Tuesday.Hari Desai, a political commentator based in Gujarat, reiterated that the victory of AAP in Surat does not pose a challenge to the BJP. “The Aam Aadmi Party does not have the apparatus or the organisational network on the ground to emerge as a threat to the BJP. I feel they tend to benefit the BJP instead of being an opponent,” he said.On the Congress’ performance, he said the party has failed to prop up its leadership and has been pulled down by infighting.Former Gujarat state Congress chief Arjun Modhwadia said, “The election results of six municipalities are disheartening for Congress workers in Gujarat. We accept the people’s mandate but after every dark night there is a dawn. We will work hard to get the confidence of urban voters.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-municipal-polls-failure-of-congress-not-emergence-of-aap-says-bjp-101614153849305.html
24-02-2021||India||Kerala withdraws cases against Sabarimala and citizenship law protesters||The Kerala government on Wednesday decided to withdraw cases related to Sabarimala and Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests which are not of criminal nature. Earlier, the state government was against withdrawing cases.While the Congress lauded the decision, the BJP said the temple issue should not be conflated with the citizenship law protests.“We welcome the move. We have been demanding it quite some time,” said opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala.“It is wrong to club the temple issue with the CAA. We want all cases to be withdrawn. Other than police atrocities no other violence took place during the stir,” said BJP state president K Surendran who is facing more than 200 cases. He was jailed for a month during the agitation.Recently the Nair Service Society, a socio-cultural body of upper caste Nair community, had written a letter to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan asking him to withdraw cases against devotees who took part in hymn-chanting protests during the temple agitation in 2018.At the height of the agitation at least 50,000 cases were registered against devotees who protested the government decision to implement the Supreme Court verdict that allowed women of all ages to enter the hilltop temple.In 2018, the state had witnessed large-scale violence and five shutdowns after the Supreme Court ended a centuries-old ban on the entry of women of all ages at the Ayyappa temple. It was for the first time in the history of the state that over 50,000 people were booked in connection with Sabarimala protest.With assembly elections round the corner (April-May), the temple issue has again come to the centrestage.Last month, former Congress chief minister Oommen Chandy had written to CM Pinarayi Vijayan, asking him to withdraw the state government’s earlier affidavit that favoured the entry of women of all ages.In the letter, Chandy also said the government’s affidavit had created much confusion which ultimately led to the five-bench verdict in 2018.After protests in 2019, the Supreme Court had referred 60-odd review petitions questioning the verdict to a nine-member bench.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-withdraws-cases-against-sabarimala-and-citizenship-law-protesters-101614153666641.html

Further details are awaited.It may be recalled that on the evening of February 10, the police received a complaint on the toll-free number 100, from the pharmacy student’s parents that some miscreants had abducted their daughter.The police claimed it tracked signals from her mobile phone and rescued her from bushes at a secluded place near, where she was lying in a semi-undressed and “traumatic” state.The girl was first taken to a private hospital and later shifted to the government hospital in Secunderabad, where she underwent medical examination. The police initially booked a case of abduction and rape under sections of Indian Penal Code.However, during the investigation of the case over the next two days, the police concluded that the student was misleading her parents as well as the police.“She was neither abducted nor raped. We found it was a false case, after a thorough investigation and gathering of technical evidence,” Rachakonda police commissioner Mahesh Bhagawat told reporters on February 13.Also Read: 5 killed in two separate road accidents in Andhra Pradesh, TelanganaThe police said it examined the video footage obtained from 100 different closed-circuit television cameras located in the area and interrogated auto drivers, locals and her college mates and found no connection between her statement and the evidence gathered.After corroborating all the evidence, the police claimed they questioned the girl and she confessed to have misled the police. “Apparently, she wanted to leave her house for her own reasons and hence enacted the whole drama,” the commissioner said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderabad-pharmacy-student-who-mislead-police-dies-by-suicide-101614152611402.html

The 22-year-old Ravi was released from Tihar jail in Delhi on Tuesday evening."Justice has been done. My daughter had done nothing wrong. We believe in our country's judiciary," news agency ANI quoted her father Ravi Annappa as saying. "We are not connected with anybody. We are only asking this basic question about the climate. I am an Indian, we have to respect the nation's rules and regulations," he added.In a major setback to the Delhi Police, the sessions court at Patiala House Court granted bail to Ravi on grounds that evidence presented before the court is not sufficient to establish a link between the toolkit and the Delhi violence. Evidence on record was not sufficient to keep a 22-year-old "young lady" with absolutely no criminal antecedents in custody, said the judge as he ruled the verdict."The offence of sedition cannot be invoked to minister to the wounded vanity of the governments," additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana also said. He further noted that citizens are "conscience keepers" of government in any democratic nation and they cannot be put behind bars simply because they choose to disagree with the state policies.In an 18-page order, Judge Rana made some hard-hitting observations while terming the evidence produced by the police as “scanty and sketchy".On February 13, Ravi was arrested from her Bengaluru residence by Delhi police. The police had claimed that Ravi created the toolkit which aimed to spread misinformation about India. The police had also alleged that the toolkit, first publicised by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg on Twitter, also instigated the Republic Day violence during the farmers' tractor rally in Delhi. She was arrested under the sedition law.Following the court's verdict, her mother also said that it had reinforced her faith in the judicial system of the country. She also said that she is happy and relieved that her daughter is coming back home, as per the PTI report. "I am happy that she got bail. It has reinforced our faith in the system," Disha's mother Manjula had said in Bengaluru.Ravi used to volunteer for Fridays for Future (FFF), an organisation founded by Thunberg. She used to help with the organisation's event management work in Bengaluru.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/toolkit-case-justice-has-been-done-says-father-after-disha-ravi-s-bail-101614151690586.html

24-02-2021||India||What led to Covid-19 rise? Centre deputes teams to 10 states for probe||The Centre has deputed high-level, multi-disciplinary teams to Maharashtra, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Punjab, Karnakata, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and J&K to find out what led to the recent spike in the number of Covid-19 cases. These teams will work with the state/UT administration and ascertain the reasons for the recent surge in the number of cases, apart from coordinating with the authorities for requisite measures to break the chain of transmission, news agency ANI reported.Though India's active Covid-19 cases continue to remain below 1.50 lakh, several states, starting with Maharashtra, reported a sudden surge since the beginning of this month. According to the Union health ministry's data, 12 states, including Maharashtra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Punjab, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Telangana, Delhi and Haryana, have reported more than 100 average daily new cases. Among them, Kerala and Maharashtra both report more than 4,000 average daily new cases in the past one week.Mutations of Sars-Cov-2 found in Maharashtra, Kerala samples: OfficialsOn Tuesday, Maharashtra reported the highest daily infections with 6,218 Covid-19 infections, followed by Kerala (4,034), Tamil Nadu (442), Punjab (414), Karnataka (383) and Gujarat (348).Chhattisgarh on Tuesday reported 274 new infections while Madhya Pradesh reported a single-day tally of 248.West Bengal registered 189 new cases on Tuesday and Jammu and Kashmir logged 94 fresh cases.While an overall laxity in maintaining Covid-19 appropriate behaviour followed by a fall in the cases at the beginning of the year is being blamed for the surge in cases, the ministry is now looking to narrow down on specific reason, if any, behind the surge.The presence of mutant virus strain, detected in Maharashtra, Kerala and Telangana — has been dismissed as a contributing factor to the sudden spike. No link between the mutant strains and the sudden spike has been scientifically established as some of the strains were present in India since last year."Based on the information and as analyzed and understood by a very eminent scientific advisory group of Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG), we would like to underline the fact that we do not see attribution of mutant strains to the upsurge of the infection being seen in some districts. But this is a work in progress. We will continue to watch the situation with full responsibility," NITI Aayog Member (Health) V K Paul said on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-led-to-covid-19-rise-centre-deputes-teams-to-10-states-for-probe-101614148850813.html

24-02-2021||India||Five new job surveys to help gather data for national employment policy||Five new job surveys are being rolled out by the labour office to capture unaccounted segments or blind spots in the country’s labour markets. They will generate high-frequency, dependable data necessary for a planned national employment policy, officials have said.An expert committee appointed by the government has finalised the design of these all-India surveys, one each on domestic workers, migrant workers, professionals and the transport sector, apart from an “all-India Quarterly Establishment-based Employment Survey”.The surveys will begin in April and will take about six months to complete. They will offer a segmented view of the jobs’ economy, focusing on data that have largely been missing, rendering much of the country’s employment-unemployment data unreliable.Also Read | PM Modi pushes PPP model for ‘aatmanirbhar’ health sectorAccording to the International Labour Organization’s manual for nations, a national employment policy is a “comprehensive plan for achieving a country’s employment goals”. Countries need them because “employment challenges are getting more and more complex”, it states.India needs reliable employment data for decision-making because economic growth has not automatically led to more formal, decent jobs. Informal employment, which does not offer social and legal protections, is still widespread and wage inequality is rising.Official statisticians depend on the periodic labour force survey (PLFS), the latest available data on employment-unemployment, which covered the period July 2017-June 2018 and was released in June 2019. As a survey, it is an inadequate gauge of the sectors the new jobs surveys aim to cover.The new surveys will look at the large, lower tier of jobs in a fast-changing labour market, which has seen new categories emerge, such as gig workers. Lack of information from these unorganised employment sectors, about which there are little data and insights, have held back the creation of a proposed national employment policy.The key aim of the policy, a first, is to formalise large informal segments of the jobs economy. It will include so-called gig workers.A majority of the country’s workers, almost 90%, are employed in the informal unorganised sector.According to Rajesh Raj Natarajan, a labour economist of Sikkim University, moving to formal employment can push up individual incomes by 63.9%. His research was based on data from the India Human Development Survey of 2004–2005 and 2011–2012.“The surveys will give us industry-specific data. It will go on to be very helpful in formulating a national employment policy. We are currently engaged in field training of staff,” said DS Negi, director-general of the labour bureau.India’s large pool of migrant workers is probably the most crucial segment. As factories were shut during the pandemic-induced lockdown last year, thousands of migrant workers fled urban centres, facing hunger and distress.In September, the government told Parliament that it had no data on migrant workers. “This was the main reason why help could not reach them,” said Ravi Ratnoo of the staffing firm Ajeevan. The survey on migrants will collect information on migration patterns, job profiles, living and work conditions.A novel cohort-based migration metric, a statistical tool developed by former chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian, revealed an annual “inter-state migrant population of about 60 million and an inter-district migration as high as 80 million” between 2001 and 2011.The survey on professionals will capture self-employed professionals and employees hired by them. For instance, a doctor with a private practice and staff employed by him at his clinic.The transport sector survey will take into account gig workers employed with ride-hailing apps for the time. The quarterly establishment survey will track changes in general employment. The one on domestic workers will give the first estimate of domestic household workers, most of whom are women. They are currently out of any social security shield.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/five-new-job-surveys-to-help-gather-data-for-national-employment-policy-101614148005784.html
24-02-2021||India||Code of ethics: What OTT platforms, such as Netflix and Hotstar, may have to follow||The government is considering a code of ethics for over-the-top (OTT) platforms such as Netflix and digital media companies. The code is likely to mandate intermediaries and online curated content companies to exercise “due caution and discretion” while airing content that may impact India’s sovereignty and integrity, threaten or jeopardise the state’s security and be detrimental to the country’s foreign relations.HT on Wednesday reported social media companies and streaming service providers will be brought under a three-tier regulatory framework, according to proposed new rules. The rules will cover companies such as Facebook and OTT platforms. In a document running into 30 pages, reviewed by HT, the government has laid down the rules and the framework for regulating both sets of companies, which remain largely unregulated, although some provisions of the Information Technology Act apply to them. In the document, titled Information Technology (Guidelines for Intermediaries and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, the government cites powers provided to it under section 87 of the Information Technology Act, 2000. This section allows the government to make rules to carry out the provisions of the law by notification in the Official Gazette and in the Electronic Gazette.Also Read | Spell out regulatory regime, SC tells govt on OTT normsThe government is also deliberating extending existing legislation such as the Cable Table Television Networks Regulation Act, Press Council Act, and other relevant laws to govern online content. The laws have so far only been applicable to traditional media such as newspapers and television.Critics have expressed concerns over the regulations saying they may lead to censorship.The code is also expected to ask OTT platforms to improve the accessibility of content to the persons with disabilities. It is likely to mandate content classification for online curated content platforms, which so far has not been compulsory, including a universal rating (U), U/A seven plus, U/A thirteen plus, U/A sixteen plus and Adult, for people over 18. The officials said the classifications will have to be prominently displayed.The OTT platforms are also expected to enable access control mechanisms, including parental locks, for content for those over 13. The platforms may also need to have a reliable age mechanism regulation.The content also has to be classified according to context, theme, tone and impact, and target audience. The most challenging themes, which the government has considered, include drug misuse, violence, paedophilia, sex, racial or communal hatred.The platforms are also expected to take into account the potentially offensive impact of a film on matters of caste, race, gender, religion, disability, or sexuality. The ratings will also depend on how sensitively they portray the content. The glamorous portrayal of drug use, violence, alcohol, or tobacco is also likely to be judged more harshly. Nudity will not allowed to be portrayed for classification under U/A sixteen. There will also be fear, threat, and horror classification for younger audiences.The three-tier self-regulation system will be put in place to ensure compliance with the code. TV regulation also has a similar three-tier system, but it is not formally defined.The first tier, the self-regulating system, will ask the platforms to establish a grievance redressal mechanism. The details of the grievance redressal officer have to be prominently displayed.The second tier or the self-regulatory body will be headed by a retired judge of the Supreme Court or High Court. An appeal may be referred to this body if a person believes her complaint has not been appropriately addressed.The third tier, or the oversight mechanism by the government, will develop an inter-ministerial committee to ensure adherence to the code. The committee will be the apex of the regulatory framework and have representatives from the ministries of information technology, information and broadcasting, home, law, external affairs, defence, and women and child development.The committee can recommend the blocking of content in contravention of the Code. It can also take suo motu cognisance of an issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-mulls-code-of-ethics-what-ott-platforms-may-have-to-follow-101614147645811.html

The petitioners, some of whom were frontline workers during Covid-19, had exhausted their last attempt at the examination held last year amid the pandemic and moved the top court to spare them an extra chance.A bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar, Indu Malhotra and Ajay Rastogi announced that they have dismissed the petitions. A copy of the judgment will be uploaded on Supreme Court website later in the day. The bench reserved its order on February 9 after hearing the petitioners, the Centre and the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). The petitioners, numbering over 100, were barred by age or number of attempts and were ineligible to appear in the preliminary exam to be conducted this year. Although the Centre had initially opposed the petitions, towards the end of the proceedings, it decided to create a “one time” exception for those who lost out on another attempt at the civil services having exhausted their quota of attempts. Also Read | SC to hear plea seeking CBI probe in Palghar mob-lynching caseIn the general category, candidates get six attempts till the age of 32 years, nine attempts till the age of 35 years if they are in OBC category, and unlimited attempts till 37 years of age if they belong to SC/ST category. The court asked the Centre to extend a similar concession to age-barred candidates as well but the Centre refused to accede to that demand. The petitioners claimed that due to their busy work schedule during Covid-19, they could not prepare for the examination. The Centre informed the court that nearly 34,000 last attempt candidates had applied for the preliminary examination 2020. Once such a relaxation is granted, these candidates will be eligible to seek similar relief and it will unnecessarily block chances of the candidates appearing for the preliminary examination this year. “This will create an endless cycle…What should be the syllabus or age or number of attempts is a matter of policy. To grant any relaxation in this regard is left to the government and any interference by the court can happen only if the decision (of the Government) is arbitrary or capricious.” The preliminary examination was conducted on October 4 last year. The court, on February 9 this year, said that it was open for the petitioners to take the Centre’s offer as it would then be difficult for the court to discriminate between the age-barred and attempt-barred candidates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-dismisses-petitions-seeking-extra-chance-for-last-attempt-upsc-candidates-101614146625922.html

Expert committee meet today||The subject expert committee of the Central Drug Standards Control Organisation is scheduled to meet on Wednesday to deliberate on the application of Dr Reddy's Laboratories, seeking emergency use approval for the Russia-made Sputnik V vaccine against Covid-19. If the expert committee gives its nod, the application then will be forwarded to the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) for final approval. If DCGI gives its approval, then Sputnik V will be the third vaccine in India to get approval for emergency use approval.Sputnik V may become 3rd Covid vaccine approved in India. All you need to knowIn other possibilities, the subject expert committee may seek some additional data from Dr Reddy's if needed.Sputnik V, the two-dose vaccine, was developed by Russia's Gamaleya National Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology in August. In September, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) signed a pact with Dr Reddy's for local trial and distribution of the vaccine, if it gets a licence.Dr Reddy's conducted phase two trial on 100 subjects in India and said the vaccine candidate was found safe. Now, it is conducting a phase 2 and 3 bridging study. It also doesn't have its phase 3 trial data yet.The efficacy of this vaccine is said to be over 91 per cent, which is higher than the Covishield. Covaxin's efficacy data will be published in two weeks, Bharat Biotech has said.Dr Reddy's applied for the emergency-use authorisation last Friday. Since its phase 3 trial data is awaited, it will have to submit safety data from the phase 2 trial conducted in India and the interim data of the phase 3 trial. Russian authorities claimed that the vaccine has been registered in around 30 countries.If Sputnik gets approval, it will also be the first foreign vaccine to be approved in India. Before Sputnik, Pfizer had applied for emergency use authorisation but it conducted no trial in India and the storage temperature requirement of the vaccine candidate made it difficult to use in India. Sputnik V, on the other hand, can be stored at normal refrigerator temperature.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccine-expert-committee-meet-today-on-sputnik-v-emergency-approval-101614145906935.html

They were barred by age or number of attempts and were ineligible to appear in the preliminary exam to be conducted this year. The Centre had told the top that it was against granting one-time relaxation on age limit to UPSC civil service aspirants, including those who had exhausted their last attempt in the 2020 exam amid the Covid-19 pandemic and would get one more chance this year provided they are not age barred, as it would be discriminatory to other candidates. It informed the court that the candidates who gave their last attempt examination in October 2020 would get one more chance this year provided they are not age barred.“This is not the exam where you prepare at the last minute. People prepare for years together,” additional solicitor general S V Raju, representing the Centre, had told the bench, adding, “My first offer remains”.The Centre was initially not willing to concede to giving an extra chance but it was later done at the suggestion of the bench.

The ultimatum ended on Tuesday. The IPFT, however, said they were not given a deadline to decide on the alliance."We were supposed to join another meeting with the BJP on Tuesday, but we postponed it as we are busy in preparing for a mass gathering at Khumulwng, TTAADC headquarters on Wednesday. The meeting will be held in the next two or three days. But we were never given any ultimatum to decide on our alliance with TIPRA," said IPFT assistant general secretary Mangal Debbarma.The IPFT bagged eight seats in the 60-seated state Assembly to form the government in alliance with the BJP in 2018. The IPFT has two ministers in the chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb's nine-member cabinet. The BJP has 44 seats.The state government, earlier in January this year, informed the high court, in an affidavit that it would conduct the TTAADC polls before May 17.Also Read: Road made with non-recyclable plastic waste inaugurated in TripuraThe TTAADC has 30 seats of which 28 are elected and two are nominated.

Here is what prompted the moves:• The moves come as alarm grows over what looks like the beginning of India’s second wave of infections, underscoring the need to scale up the vaccination process.• Data shows that the seven-day average of new cases across India dropped to its lowest on February 11, when it touched 10,988, but it has shown a sustained increase of 18% since then to reach 12,971 on Monday.• The increase has been fuelled in particular by Maharashtra, Punjab and Madhya Pradesh, where cases have grown by 127%, 55% and 54% respectively.• The health ministry wrote to these states and two more, asking them to speed up vaccinations.Also Read | Covid vaccination: People over 60 likely to be allowed to self-register• Experts say it is now a race against time for India to begin a wave of vaccinations that will beat that of infections.• India may need to significantly review its approach, relaxing curbs to allow anyone who wants a dose to take it, let employers purchase in bulk to give to their staff, and allow more private involvement, including open market sales.• Over the last week, India has administered roughly 450,000 doses every day, roughly 52% of the target for each day based on the number of sessions held.• For each session, 100 people are expected to get shots.• On average, 8,630 sessions were held daily last week.• Officials have said that they expect to accelerate the drive to deliver 5 million doses a day.• But, according to the government’s protocol, only those above 50 or 60 will be the first to get doses to come next month when the first of the general public will be covered.• India began its vaccination campaign on January 16 at a time when the epidemic was receding in the country. This gave the country a unique headway to build up an immune capital and potentially avoid a second wave, which in other countries has wreaked havoc.• In the UK, for instance, the second wave began in early December and the country rolled out its vaccination programme around the same time.• But the campaign was not fast enough to get ahead of the outbreak, and the country went on to experience its most devastating wave, which peaked three weeks later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-tells-states-to-expedite-covid-vaccination-drive-what-prompted-the-action-101614141825184.html
24-02-2021||India||IMA's remark 'uncalled for': Patanjali backs Harsh Vardhan in Coronil row||As the Indian Medical Association has slammed Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan for apparently "endorsing" Patanjali's Divya Coronil tablets for the treatment of Covid-19, Patanjali Research Foundation Trust on Wednesday said IMA's remarks were uncalled for. The health minister was present at the press meet where Patanjali founder Baba Ramdev claimed that Coronil is part of Covid-19 treatment. Later, he claimed that the medicine has received certification from the World Health Organization, which the WHO dismissed."Our honourable health minister never undermined modern medicine. Rather his presence in the event showed his sincere efforts as a health minister to provide acceptability to other forms of medicinal systems," Patanjali said on Wednesday.Reiterating that Coronil has been awarded the CoPP (Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product) licence, Patanjali claimed that the certificate is compliant with WHO - Good Manufacturing Practices, and has been issued to Coronil by the Drug Controller General of India, as per the defined quality parameters."We have shared all our research data with the Ministry of Ayush, Government of India. The ministry has approved and categorically agreed for Coronil as medicine for Covid-19 management," Patanjali said."Coronil is an evidence-based medicine with integration of scientifically validated research evidences under pre-clinical and clinical expertise. The composition of this medicine has been disclosed to public at large, and had been thoroughly reviewed and scrutinised by the competent licensing authorities," it said adding that IMA is wrong in terming Coronil a secret medicine.After WHO South-East Asia clarified that it has not reviewed or certified the effectiveness of any traditional medicine for the treatment of Covid-19, Patanjali explained that the certificate was from the Ayush section of the Central drugs Standard Control Organisation, which was compliant with WHO certification scheme. It also said that WHO does not approve or disapprove any drug.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imas-remark-uncalled-for-patanjali-backs-harsh-vardhan-in-coronil-row-101614141666593.html

India and China this month began disengagement of troops that have been involved in a standoff for eight months in Ladakh.Also Read | Closely following reports of India, China troop disengagement: USIndian troops earlier in 2017 crossed over to Doklam, a disputed territory between Bhutan and China, to prevent the Chinese People’s Liberation Army from building a road in the area.The people cited above said the SSB has access to satellite-based GEOINT, which involves collecting information from analysis of images and data associated with a particular location. It uses imagery to survey and assess human activity and physical geography anywhere on earth.IMINT (image intelligence), which is a part of GEOINT, can provide evidence of an operation, a force’s location, the size, nature, and location of command centres. It can over time provide an indication of increases or decreases in operations or movement. “It can help in monitoring activity over a period of time, such as construction, fortification, and changes in deployment,” said an internal document of SSB, reviewed by HT.“The imagery and GIS data can help us do better profiling of the border. We would know if a new village has come up near the border at the Indo-Bhutan border; if China has moved any troops and to see if any of our border pillars are missing or displaced,” said an officer, requesting anonymity.The SSB is also in the process of implementing the Counter Insurgency Operation Planning System and Border Operation Planning System software in all its field units. “The two software are being implemented primarily to analyse the data of arrests, seizures made at the border so that we understand the patterns and have better decision making,” the officer said.The SSB has 700 border outposts along the 2,450-km long borders with Nepal and Bhutan from Uttarakhand to Arunachal Pradesh. It is the primary force for checking any illegal activity, trans-border crimes, smuggling, and unauthorised entry into India.Tarun Wig, the co-founder of Innefu, a data analytics and cyber-security company, said GIS can provide a unified view of the entire theatre including terrain details, Intelligence inputs on an area, current activities, key points of concern. “It can help the organisation plan better, predict vulnerable areas, optimise resources and get a complete assessment at a click of a button.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ssb-to-use-image-analysis-at-nepal-bhutan-borders-to-monitor-changes-troops-101614140685193.html

24-02-2021||India||White House nominates Indian-American as director of management and budget||The White House and the Indian-American community are solidly backing the nomination of Neera Tanden as the Director of Office of Management and Budget, describing her as the most appropriate candidate to hold the position."There's one candidate to lead the budget department, and her name is Neera Tanden," White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at her daily news conference on Tuesday as several Republican Senators are opposing her nomination, citing her past social media behaviour.If confirmed by the Senate, 50-year-old Tanden would become the first person of colour to head the federal agency that prepares the annual budget of the US government.Republican Senator Rob Portman from Ohio on Monday announced that he would vote against Tanden during the confirmation process. The two other senators who have already announced their opposition are Republicans Susan Collins and Mitt Romney. Democratic Senator Joe Manchin has already announced that he will vote against her.Democrats hold the Senate by a 50-50 margin, and Manchin's announcement last week was seen as devastating for Tanden's chances.Also read| Biden nominates Indian-American lawyer Kiran Ahuja to head Personnel ManagementPsaki said Tanden has had 44 meetings with senators of both parties. She's spoken with 15 senators from both parties since Friday. Some of those were repeats of people she had spoken with previously, the press secretary said.She said Tanden is committed to rolling up her sleeves, having those conversations, answering questions as they come up, reiterating her commitment to working with people across the aisle, and also sharing some of her own experience of working with people of different viewpoints."We’re going to push. We still think there’s a shot, a good shot,” Biden told reporters at the White House.The Senate Budget Committee has scheduled a vote on Tanden's nomination on Wednesday, while the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee is all set to take up the vote a day later on Thursday.The Republican senators have alleged that Tanden was sharply critical of their leadership in the past and she has now deleted more than thousands of such tweets.A delay in her confirmation process would have repercussions on the preparation and presentation of the annual budget.Also read| Mexico doing better than US on Covid-19, says Mexican PresidentComing out in support of Tanden, US Chamber of Commerce said she is well-qualified to lead OMB and brings an established track record of engagement with the business community.Indian Americans from across the country have joined “YesNeera” twitter campaign organised by South Asians for Biden.Tanden is highly qualified to be OMB director, tweeted Namrata Majumdar, a tech and economy policy expert.“She's a trailblazer for women in government policy despite the odds. We cannot let double standards derail the chance of the first WOC (women of colour) in this role,” she said.Neha Dewan, national director of South Asians for Biden said South Asians for Biden stands with Tanden and Surgeon General nominee Dr Vivek Murthy, and strongly urges swift confirmations of Biden's cabinet selections.“The Biden-Harris administration thoughtfully selected the most diverse cabinet and senior staff in American history to guide America through multiple converging crises. We are particularly heartened by the inclusion of outstanding South Asian public servants, including Ms Tanden and Dr Murthy, and we strongly urge the US Senate to confirm them,” she said.Also read| Top US Senate Democrat directs lawmakers to craft bill to counter ChinaTanden was a key architect of the Affordable Care Act, which expanded healthcare to millions of American families, and has served as a senior policy advisor to Democratic presidential campaigns and administrations.“Tanden’s longstanding commitment to advancing policies that improve American lives makes her an ideal choice to serve as President Biden’s top budget advisor,” Dewan said.On the Senate floor, Senator John Cornyn, who co-chairs the Senate Indian Caucus, urged Biden to withdraw the nomination of Tanden."My friendly advice to President Biden is to withdraw Neera Tanden's nomination and select someone, who at the very least, has not promoted wild conspiracy theories and openly bashed people on both sides of the aisle that she happens to disagree with," he said.Joining the “YesNeera” social media campaign, Olympian and five-time World Champion figure skater Michelle Kwan tweeted that Tanden is qualified to lead the OMB and if confirmed, will be the first woman of colour and Asian American Pacific Islanders to do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/white-house-nominates-indian-american-as-director-of-management-and-budget-101614128910253.html

24-02-2021||India||Biden nominates Indian-American lawyer Kiran Ahuja to head Office of Personnel Management||US President Joe Biden has nominated Indian-American lawyer and rights activist Kiran Ahuja to head the Office of Personnel Management, a federal agency that manages America’s more than two million civil servants.If confirmed by the Senate, 49-year-old Ahuja, nominated on Tuesday, would become the first Indian-American to serve this top position in the US government.Ahuja served as the Chief of Staff to Director of the US Office of Personnel Management from 2015 to 2017. She has more than two decades of public service and nonprofit/philanthropic sector leadership experience.Ahuja currently serves as Chief Executive Officer of Philanthropy Northwest, a regional network of philanthropic institutions.She began her career as a civil rights lawyer at the US Department of Justice, litigating school desegregation cases, and filing the department's first student racial harassment case.From 2003 to 2008, Ahuja served as the founding executive director of the National Asian Pacific American Women’s Forum, an advocacy and membership organisation.During the Obama-Biden administration, she spent six years as executive director of the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, leading efforts to increase access to federal services, resources and programmes for underserved Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs).Ahuja grew up in Savannah, Georgia, as a young Indian immigrant in the wake of the civil rights era, and earned a bachelor’s degree in political science from Spelman College and a law degree from the University of Georgia.The Washington Post said Ahuja would have a mandate to reverse course on former president Donald Trump’s policies on the civil service, which he and his top aides often derided as a “deep state” of Democratic bureaucrats.Many agencies lost experts in a range of fields during the Trump era, and Biden has pledged to revitalise the workforce, the daily reported.Congressman Gerry Connolly, Chairman of the House Government Operations subcommittee, welcomed the nomination of Ahuja.“Ahuja’s years of leadership experience and knowledge of OPM are much needed to rebuild an agency that was targeted for elimination in the last administration,” he said.“Ahuja is a well-known and expert leader who will instill stability and confidence in OPM as it recruits, hires, retains, and retires our 2.8 million federal employees. I look forward to her swift Senate confirmation, and then getting to the hard work of transforming OPM into the human resources and leadership training organization our nation needs it to be,” Connolly said.President Biden has made an excellent choice in his nomination of Ahuja to serve as OPM director, Congresswoman Judy Chu said.“With over two decades of experience serving in government, non-profit and philanthropic sectors, Kiran is uniquely qualified to lead OPM at this critical juncture as we work to build a federal workforce that reflects the full diversity of our country,” she said.“As the former chief of staff to the director of OPM and the former executive director of the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders under the Obama administration, she will bring a wealth of knowledge and expertise to OPM that will enable her to hit the ground running on day one,” Chu added.Max Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, said Ahuja is a civic-minded leader and an outstanding choice for this important job.Her exceptional qualifications include more than two decades of nonprofit leadership and public service, including at OPM and the White House, and a track record of solving human capital issues through innovation and collaboration, he noted.In a statement, American Federation of Government employees said Ahuja brings a wealth of experience in federal personnel matters and her record of advocacy on behalf of women of colour is reason to be optimistic that she will make it a priority to reverse the previous administration’s active undermining of diversity and inclusion efforts across the government.“Ahuja has the knowledge and experience that OPM needs to guide human resource policy for the federal workforce. And importantly, she is committed to protecting the non-partisan civil service and ensuring that it reflects the diversity of the United States,” said National Treasury Employee Union president Tony Reardon."During the Trump administration, the agency was constantly disrupted by outside efforts to break it up and dismantle it, to the detriment of the federal employees who rely on OPM for independence and management of important federal employee programmes.“We believe this appointment will result in steady, professional leadership at OPM that is committed to protecting its unique role in administering federal retirement programmes and other human resource management priorities,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/biden-nominates-indian-american-lawyer-kiran-ahuja-to-head-office-of-personnel-management-101614128173991.html

Neeraj Khatri, a scientist dealing with files related to terms of reference for environmental approvals in the ministry, was sentenced to five years in jail and fine of ₹4 lakh for accepting a bribe of up to ₹7 lakh, the court order said.An associate of Vaikundarajan, 65, Subbalakshmi, was also convicted for arranging the deal between Khatri and the businessman. A fine of ₹10 lakh was also imposed on Vaikundarajan’s company, VV Minerals, for trying to fraudulently get approval for the terms of reference, which are considered in-principle approval for a project. The three were convicted on Monday and their sentences were pronounced on Tuesday. VV Minerals, the country’s biggest sand mining company, had applied for environmental clearance for an SEZ in Tamil Nadu’s Tirunelveli in 2012.In its charge-sheet, the CBI said it found that Khatri, then a deputy director (Scientist-C) in the environment ministry, had accepted a demand draft of ₹4.13 lakh dated July 3, 2013 in favour of VIT University (Vellore) to get his son admitted in a B.Tech course there. The money was given at the behest of Vaikundarajan, the CBI said. The CBI also said the air tickets for Khatri and his son from Delhi to Chennai and back were bought by SubbalakshmiIn return, Khatri took charge of the file even though it should have been considered by another division in the environment ministry.“The matter of environment clearance is a sensitive subject matter…the purpose is to save and protect the environment in order to protect public health...the accused, by indulging in an act of receiving payment (by way of demand draft for admission of his son), allowed this very purpose to be compromised,” CBI special judge Nirja Bhatia said in her order on Tuesday.On Vaikundarajan, the court said,“He indulged in all sorts of manipulations, which he made in his records including personal records and that of the company of which he is the managing partner and as well outside by showing disregard in handing over the application directly to Neeraj Khatri, by his side-stepping the established procedure,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-mining-baron-jailed-for-bribing-official-101614122753341.html

Things have to be put back on track before we can talk of moving forward,” said the person cited above. The 10th round of talks between senior military commanders on February 20, held after the completion of disengagement at Pangong Lake, was unable to make a breakthrough on addressing the other friction points such as Gogra, Hot Springs and Depsang Plains.A joint statement issued after the meeting described the drawdown at Pangong Lake as “a significant step forward” and said the two sides would continue their dialogue and “push for a mutually acceptable resolution of the remaining issues in a steady and orderly manner”.However, the people cited above said there were no immediate indications as to when the next round of talks, either at the diplomatic or military level, would be held with the Chinese side. Experts cautioned that too much shouldn’t be read into the Chinese foreign ministry’s statement on Monday that supports India’s chairmanship of the Brics grouping for 2021. “China should know that after Galwan it can’t be business as usual,” said former ambassador Ashok Sajjanhar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-needs-to-do-more-to-restore-normalcy-officials-101614121158389.html

The ruling BJP won the remaining 93 seats in civic body polls.The BJP appeared headed to win all six municipal corporations-- Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Bhavnagar, Jamnagar, Rajkot and Surat.“For starting a new kind of politics, thanks from the bottom of the heart to the people of Gujarat,” tweeted AAP chief and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal soon after the results became clear.Also Read | ‘Honoured to serve Gujarat’: Modi after civic polls sweep“People of Gujarat have voted for politics of work as they were fed up by the politics of BJP and Congress.

In the 2015 elections, the Congress won 36 seats out of a total of 116 in the SMC. The AAP, which did not win any seats in its first electoral foray in Gujarat in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, chose to fight the elections at the grassroots level this time before graduating to the 2022 state polls.Promising to be an alternative to the BJP and the Congress, the party contested without its national convener Kejriwal. But Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia conducted road shows that drew healthy crowds, especially in Surat. AAP registered victories in areas dominated by the Patidar community, and where the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti, of which Congress leader Hardik Patel was once the convener, held sway.

The petition sought filling up of vacancies in the subordinate judiciary, in particular at courts handling criminal cases.As he addressed the bench as “Your Honour”, the CJI said, “You either have the US Supreme Court or the Magistrate court here in your mind when you call us ‘Your Honour’. We do not want you to address us as Your Honour.”Earlier, in August 2020, CJI Bobde expressed similar reservation to a petitioner on being addressed as “Your Honour”.BCI rules, which regulate uniform standards of etiquette to be followed by lawyers across the country, in 2006 amended the law, making it binding on lawyers to address judges of the high courts and the Supreme Court as “Your Honour” or “Your Lordship”.The September 2019 BCI resolution seeks to override the Gazette notification and revives the commonly adopted practice followed among lawyers of addressing judges as “My Lords” or “Your Lordship”. Interestingly, the 2006 amendment termed the words “My Lord” and “Your Lordship” as “relics of British colonial past”.The press release issued by BCI chairman Manan Kumar Mishra said, “The said resolution was taken by the Council in order to maintain graciousness and to uphold the majesty (i.e. impressive beauty) of the Courts.”Lawyer bodies of Kerala high court and Punjab & Haryana high court have issued resolutions in line with the BCI amendment shedding the practice of using “My Lord” and “Your Lordship”.On one hand, while the rules permit the use of “Your Honour”, the preference shown by the CJI in being addressed by anything other than “Your Honour” has put lawyers in a fix. In 2014, a petition was filed in the Supreme Court by a lawyer Shiv Sagar Tiwari seeking a uniform standard to be adopted across all courts in the country for addressing judges of the higher courts and subordinate judiciary.Citing the 2006 BCI Rules, Tiwari demanded that the practice of addressing Supreme Court and HC judges as “My Lord” and “Your Lordship” must end.The top court refused to pass any order. Leaving this choice to the lawyers instead, the bench added a caveat that any form of addressing the judges should be dignified and respectful.Senior advocate Gopal Shankaranaraynan said: “We have grown up seeing generations of lawyers addressing Supreme Court and high court judges as My Lords... There are senior advocates in the Supreme Court who address judges as ‘Sir’, judges do not mind.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/your-honour-suitable-for-us-magistrate-courts-says-cji-101614119691549.html

We must all work together towards a peaceful and prosperous Assam. The government would do all it can to ensure that you are rehabilitated well.”Songbijit, is the chief of Peoples’ Democratic Council of Karbi Longri (PDCK), a militant outfit from the Karbi Anglong region. He was earlier the commander-in-chief of the banned National Democratic Front of Bodoland.The other militants belonged to five militant outfits in the Karbi Anglong — PDCK, Karbi Longri North Cachar Hills Liberation Front (KLNLF), United Peoples Liberation Army (UPLA), Karbi Peoples’ Liberation Tiger (KPLT) and Karbi Liberation Front (KLF). The outfits, active in Karbi Anglong district of Assam, have been demanding a separate state for the people belonging to the Karbi tribe.The five outfits are expected to sign a formal ceasefire agreement in presence of Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday, a senior official said on condition of anonymity.The militants surrendered as many as 338 arms and over 11,000 rounds of ammunition, said Hiren Nath, IGP, special branch of Assam Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/militant-leader-gives-up-arms-in-guwahati-101614119486393.html
24-02-2021||India||Trust in country’s health sector increased during pandemic: PM||Like several other sectors, India is now preparing to be aatmanirbhar, or self-reliant, in the health sector with focus on the public private partnership model to deal with health emergencies in a better way and improve access to health care for all, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Tuesday.The prestige of India’s health sector and trust in it has increased manifold across the globe after it successfully overcame the “trial by fire” during the Covid-19 pandemic, he added, addressing a webinar on effective implementation of the Union Budget’s provisions in the health sector.“The amount allocated for the health sector in this year’s budget has been unprecedented, and is an attempt to provide better health care services to every citizen of this country. Last one year in a way has been an “agnipareeksha (trial by fire)” for the country and particularly for the health sector, but I am happy to announce that India managed to pass the test successfully...,” Modi said.Also Read | PM Modi pushes PPP model for ‘aatmanirbhar’ health sectorHe added that India “managed to save lives” and create a testing infrastructure in a few months, with currently 2,500 labs active for Covid-19 testing. Modi also said the successful handling of Covid-19 had been possible because of the collaboration between the government and the private sector.“Covid-19 has taught us that we don’t have to just fight this pandemic, but also have to be prepared to handle such epidemics in future too. We have to keep India ready for any eventuality, which is why it is equally important to strengthen the health sector,” he said.“From medical equipment to medicines, from ventilators to vaccines...from doctors to epidemiologists, we have to pay attention to all so that the country is better prepared for any health disaster in future,” he added.This is the inspiration behind the PM Aatmanirbhar Swasth Bharat Scheme, under which it has been decided that a modern ecosystem would be developed from research to testing and treatment in the country itself, Modi said.The government has proposed a budget outlay of ₹223,846 crore for health and well-being in 2021-2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trust-in-country-s-health-sector-increased-during-pandemic-pm-101614118803484.html
24-02-2021||India||Custody not a substitute for conviction: Top court||The state cannot use its might to put someone behind bars as a substitute for final conviction, the Supreme Court observed on Tuesday, expressing concern over what it termed a “growing trend”.The observation came in the course of an interesting hearing on a point of law — when does the 60-day window for filing a charge-sheet as laid down by the Code of Criminal Procedure start, on the day the accused are remanded to custody or the day after?A bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy was critical of the “new philosophy” applied by the police and the prosecution to try and keep people in jail at least for a few days as a form of punishment prior to proving their guilt.Also Read | SC panel to meet today to decide fate of trees that face axe in Metro expansion“Putting someone behind bars cannot be a substitute for final conviction. Ultimately, the philosophy now seems to have become, “let us keep someone behind bars at least for some days even if there is no conviction in the end”. The state cannot use its might like this,” observed the bench.It also commented on the independence of investigating agencies, regretting that those working in these agencies were not adequately assessing the kinds of cases that should really go to trial since they were also influenced by several other factors.“In true sense, an independent agency, which is supposed to take a call on what should go to trial and what not, is also influenced by several other things... some {officers} are more interested about what after retirement for them,” remarked the bench.It added: “If every case goes to a trial, the real time to examine most serious cases is reduced. Corruption cases and CBI {Central Bureau of Investigation} cases take the longest. And the person who is being convicted after 20 years, will tell us I am 70 now, don’t send me to jail. All this needs to be corrected.”The bench also wondered if the government carried out any “legislative impact assessment” before making bounced cheques and traffic violations crimes to be tried by the courts.“These are institutional issues that nobody thinks of. Our good old jurisprudence on criminal laws, bail etc have been thrown away,” rued the court.The comments by the apex court came when the court was hearing bail pleas of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) promoters Kapil Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhwan, who have been jailed in a money laundering case registered against them by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).According to CBI and ED, Yes Bank invested around ₹3,700 crore in short-term non-convertible debentures of DHFL between April and June 2018 as a quid pro quo between Yes Bank’s co-promoter Rana Kapoor and the Wadhawans. The Wadhawans have been in jail since March last year.Senior advocates Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Amit Desai appeared for the Wadhawans while additional solicitor general SV Raju represented ED in the case.In September 2020, SC stayed an order by the Bombay high court that granted bail to the Wadhawans on the grounds that ED failed to file a charge-sheet in the matter within the 60-day window as stipulated by the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).Raju, for ED, argued that there was no expiry of the time since the day on which an accused was remanded should be excluded while calculating the 60-day period. Raju showed a judgment of a three-judge bench of the SC to buttress his point.The counsel for Wadhawans also presented two other judgments of three-judge benches of the SC to contend that the 60-day period would start from the day on which accused are remanded to custody.Citing this “legal conundrum” arising out of contradictory judgments by the SC, the bench said: “We hear more SLPs (special leave petitions) than anything else. There is no time for laying down laws and to settle laws. If we, in the Supreme Court, are facing such a conundrum, think of high courts and magisterial courts. They will have more of a predicament and they can choose one out of many of our judgments on the same point.”The bench then decided to refer this case to the Chief Justice of India (CJI) for setting up a bench of at least three and preferably five judges for an authoritative ruling on the point of law.It also said the court order would request the CJI to have the Wadhawans’ plea for bail urgently listed before a three-judge bench.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/custody-not-a-substitute-for-conviction-top-court-101614118548758.html
24-02-2021||India||Rahul’s remark triggers ‘north-south’ row||Senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said he was used to a “different type of politics” in north India and coming to Kerala was “very refreshing” as people are interested in “issues”, triggering an attack from Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders.Gandhi, while speaking at the concluding rally of the ‘Aishwarya Yatra’, led by the leader of Opposition in the Kerala assembly, Ramesh Chennithala, said he learnt a lot from Kerala and understood a bit about the “wisdom of the people” here.“For the first 15 years, I was a member of Parliament in the north. So I had got used to a different type of politics. And for me, coming to Kerala was very refreshing. Because suddenly I found that people are interested in issues and not just superficially but going into detail in issues,” Gandhi said.Reacting to Gandhi’s remark, BJP president JP Nadda tweeted: “A few days back he was in the North-east, spewing venom against the western part of India. Today in the South he is spewing venom against the North. Divide and rule politics won’t work.”External affairs minister S Jaishankar in a tweet said that “India is one”.“I hail from the South. I am an MP from a Western state. I was born, educated and worked in the North. I represented all of India before the World. India is one.

24-02-2021||India||Modi calls for home-grown tech solutions||Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) should aim for the next level and transform into indigenous institutes of technology, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday, stressing the need for home-made innovations that are environment-friendly, durable, and disaster-resilient.Modi, who was addressing the 66th convocation of IIT-Kharagpur in West Bengal online, underscored that India can become a major player in the field of science and technology in the post-pandemic world, asked students of the premier institute to anticipate tomorrow’s problems and come up with the solutions today, and called for an improved ecosystem for start-ups, corporate and the administrative process alike.“The scenario has changed in India in the 21st century. The needs and aspirations of the nation have also changed. Not just Indian Institutes of Technology, IITs must take it to the next level to indigenous institutes of technology,” Modi told students of India’s oldest IIT.He asked students to be patient in their pursuit for research and innovation and asked them not to be demoralised by failures, which he said could “pave the way” for new successes. “The experiments which prove to be successful in this hugely populated country will not fail anywhere in the world. The more our IITs conduct research to overcome the challenges faced by India and come up with solutions, the more they would become mediums of global applications,” Modi said.He cited the February 7 Uttarakhand tragedy caused by a glacier break and urged IIT graduates to develop disaster-resilient infrastructure that can withstand such calamities. “Climate change is a major challenge as natural disasters destroy infrastructure. India drew the attention of the world to the issue of disaster management,” he said.Modi spoke of the need for making available safe, affordable and environment-friendly energy to people through initiatives such as the International Solar Alliance, which he pointed out India introduced to the world. Modi also referred to the global Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, which he announced at the UN Climate Action Summit in 2019.He hailed the role played by IITs in developing technologies to battle Covid-19, and stressed that the premier institutes should work fast on finding futuristic solutions to other health care problems.“I am not just talking about gadgets. I am taking about an ecosystem. We have to give solutions to the nation starting from prevention to cure,” he said. Modi appealed to students to focus on what he called “Self 3 — self- awareness, self-confidence and selflessness”.“You should recognise your potential and move forward, move ahead with full confidence, move ahead with selflessness,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-calls-for-home-grown-tech-solutions-101614113449155.html
24-02-2021||India||Draft govt policy seeks 3-tier checks for OTTs||Social media companies may need to appoint officers who will be responsible for complying with content moderation orders, and both they and streaming service providers will be brought under a three-tier regulatory framework, according to proposed new rules that will cover media companies such as Facebook and so-called over the top (OTT) platforms such as Netflix. In addition, shows on these platforms will have to carry ratings such as U (universal) or A (adult) — something they are not required to do currently.In a document running into 30 pages, reviewed by Hindustan Times, the central government has laid down the rules and the framework for regulating both sets of companies, which remain largely unregulated, although some provisions of the Information Technology Act apply to them. The rules, in the process of being finalised, will also apply to digital news media.Countries, including India, have felt the need to regulate social media companies, which, under current rules, are not responsible for content, unlike traditional media firms; there have also been demands to regulate content on OTT platforms, with some shows on these running into trouble for offending religious sentiments.In the document, titled Information Technology (Guidelines for Intermediaries and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, the government cites powers provided to it under section 87 of the Information Technology Act, 2000. This section allows the government to make rules to carry out the provisions of the law by notification in the Official Gazette and in the Electronic Gazette.The guidelines define social media companies, suggest a three-tier mechanism for regulation of all online media, define the process for tracing the first originator, and confer blocking powers to an inter-ministerial committee that forms the third tier and which will be headed by a joint secretary level officer from the ministry of information and broadcasting.In effect, in addition to the IT ministry, this committee can also recommend blocks or take downs.When asked about the impact of having two authorities to block content, Rahul Matthan, partner at Trilegal said: “Having two (separate) authorities to regulate and having powers to block are unlikely to bring them in conflict with each other. Section 69A has been drafted in specific terms. Essentially you can give 10 people the power to block content as long the reason is clear.”The first tier of the regulatory mechanism is grievance redressal by the company itself; and the second level involves a Press Council of India-like regulatory body that will be headed by a retired judge of a high court or the Supreme Court.The ministry of I&B and electronics and information technology have been working to come up with a comprehensive framework to regulate content and intermediaries. OTT platforms such as Amazon Prime have come under fire for airing content that some claimed “hurt religious sentiments”. Social media companies such as WhatsApp and Twitter, meanwhile, have sparred with the state over an update in usage policy in case of the former, and non-compliance with take down orders in the case of the latter.According to the rules, a significant social media intermediary may be defined on the basis of the number of users for which the government is yet to set a threshold. They also involve intermediaries appointing a chief compliance officer who will be responsible for ensuring compliance with the law and be held liable if the intermediary fails to observe due diligence while discharging its duties.Another provision in the rules is asking social media intermediaries, which operate primarily in the area of messaging, to enable the identification of the first originator — an important requirement in the effort to tackle fake news.The issue is a point of contention for social media companies, but according to Matthan they should be able to identify the first originator using meta-data related to the message. “That will technically not violate end-to-end encryption. Theoretically, it is possible. Telcos at present are obliged to do this for text messages. This essentially concerns traceability.”The rules also say that competent authorities, though an order, may demand pertinent information for the purposes of prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution or punishment of crimes. It, however, excludes the intermediary from having to disclose the content of the personal messages.The rules mandate the creation of a grievance redressal portal as the central repository for receiving and processing all grievances. They ask intermediaries to act on certain kinds of violations within 24 hours, and on all concerns of a complainant within 15 days.The inter-ministerial committee that is at the apex of the regulatory framework will have representatives from the ministries of IT, information and broadcasting, home, law, external affairs, defence, and women and child development.Matthan cautioned that the velocity and volume of complaints that the government may receive are likely to be much higher than expected.“Scale is going to be a challenge,” he said. “There are going to be thousands of complaints. Moreover, take for instance copyright violations; one also has to understand the nuances of the law. An oversight board is not a bad move. For example, whether to take down [former US President Donald] Trump’s tweet should not have been a decision left to Twitter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/draft-govt-policy-seeks-3-tier-checks-for-otts-101614112169445.html
24-02-2021||India||Mutations of Sars-Cov-2 found in Maharashtra, Kerala samples: Officials||Some mutations of the Sars-Cov-2 that have been worrying scientists globally have arisen in India, according to top officials who said on Tuesday that E484K and N440K changes have been seen in samples taken from some people in Maharashtra and Kerala.The numbers refer to changes in the pathogen’s proteins, which can tweak its structure. At least one of these changes, E484K has been established to reduce the efficacy of vaccines and make immunity from a previous infection ineffective.But officials added that it is yet to be established if these are behind the resurgence in the two states. “There is no direct relation between the recent surge in Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra and some other states where the mutations N440K and E484K [have occurred],” said Dr Balram Bhargava, director general, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), at the weekly media briefing on Covid-19 updates.“…These two virus strains have been detected in other countries too and are not specific to India. Moreover, they have been found earlier in some States in India,” said Bhargava, without giving more details about these strains.Mutations are not unusual and the Sars-Cov-2 was gathering roughly two per month until December when new variants with large number of mutations began to crop up. The South African variant (known as B.1.351) has nine mutations that change its structure, including E484K that occurs in the spike protein, the component of the virus that plays a role in entry into host cells.Also Read | Covid vaccination: People over 60 likely to be allowed to self-registerAccording to Niti Aayog member (health), Dr VK Paul, the two mutations were picked up during routine genomic surveillance of cases. The Indian Sars-Cov-2 Genomic Consortium (INSACOG) has been studying the genomes of a proportion of positive cases. In addition to these, the consortium has confirmed the presence of the UK-linked B.1.1.7 variant and the Brazil-linked P.1 variant.All of these cases have been detected in international travellers. But the ones that have arisen in India were also detected earlier, the officials said. INSACOG was established in December last year as a network of 10 government labs to perform genome sequencing of 5% Covid-19 samples.The effort has gathered pace, and the network of labs has sequenced 3,500 viruses so far among Covid-19 positive samples.Close to 200 (187) UK variants have been picked up, along with six South African variants and one Brazilian variant, Paul said.“When you are doing sequencing, you are not only looking for these variants, but also looking for any abnormal shift or change in the virus’ character. And we must say that effort was going on well before the UK variant entered the country as indigenous effort. These mutations keep occurring in viruses as it is in their nature,” he added.Paul also added that experts were constantly watching the behavior of mutations in the country, and not just the three variants that are now global variants of concerns.Experts agree that there is no cause for concern unless it is established that the mutation is either more transmissible or has the increased capacity to kill.“Mutations in respiratory viruses happen all the time but what is important is to track the behavior of mutated virus to see what it means clinically,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head, microbiology department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mutations-found-in-maha-kerala-samples-officials-101614111792759.html
24-02-2021||India||A race against time: Vaccine drive needs boost amid spike||The Union health ministry wrote to states on Tuesday, asking them to expedite the vaccination drive, and announced it has dispatched teams to states where Covid-19 cases are rising, as alarm grows over what looks like the beginning of India’s second wave of infections. The development now underscores more than ever the need to drastically scale up the vaccination process.Data shows that the seven-day average of new cases across India dropped to its lowest on February 11, when it touched 10,988, but it has shown a sustained increase since then to reach 12,971 on Monday – a rise of 18%. This increase is fuelled in particular by Maharashtra, Punjab and Madhya Pradesh, where cases have grown 127%, 55% and 54% respectively.The health ministry wrote to these states and two more, asking them to speed up vaccinations. Experts say it is now a race against time for India to begin a wave of vaccinations that will beat that of infections.To do this, it may need to significantly review its approach, relaxing curbs to allow anyone who wants a dose to take it, let employers purchase in bulk to give to their staff, and allow more private involvement, including open market sales.“R(t) for India again on an upward trajectory crossing unity (1). If India could scale up Covid-19 testing so incredibly well with public-private partnership, why not follow that model for vaccine distribution? Don’t let the virus and its variants outpace the vaccines,” Bhramar Mukherjee, chair of biostatistics at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, said on Tuesday.Also Read | PGIMER to administer second vaccine dose till March 24“In regions such as Maharashtra that are witnessing an increase in the number of cases and its neighbours, we should try to administer at least the first dose of the vaccine to all the people irrespective of age or profession. There is a need for faster immunisation in these areas as it will at least decrease the severity of the disease,” said Dr SK Sarin, director of the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, who headed the Delhi government’s first committee on controlling and managing Covid-19 infections.Over the last week, India has administered roughly 450,000 doses every day, roughly 52% of the target for each day based on the number of sessions held. For each session, 100 people are expected to get shots — on an average, 8,630 sessions were held daily last week.Officials have said that they expect to accelerate the drive to deliver 5 million doses a day. But, according to the government’s protocol, only those above the age of 50 or 60 will be the first to get doses come next month, when the first of the general public will be covered.“There are various options being explored to involve the private sector as the government is looking at expanding the vaccination drive to reach 27 crore (270 million) people next month. This would mean more private hospitals and nursing homes opening up vaccination centres,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.Guleria added that one of the options to consider could also be roping in major employers. “There is a lot of interest from industries with a large number of people working, they could also be involved provided the capacity to vaccinate exists in the organisation,” he added.India began its vaccination campaign on January 16 at a time when the epidemic was receding in the country. This gave the country a unique headway to build up an immune capital and potentially avoid a second wave, which in other countries has wreaked havoc.In the UK, for instance, the second wave began in early December and the country rolled out its vaccination programme around the same time. But the campaign was not fast enough to get ahead of the outbreak, and the country went on to experience its most devastating wave, which peaked three weeks later.Hospitalisations and deaths have now been falling in the country, with officials attributing the improvement to vaccines and a lockdown.In India, another expert said the country will still need to see how the process of vaccinating people in the general population pans out.“The pace has to be picked up obviously and it will depend on factors such as vaccines opening up for general population beyond the essential services; and how many more Indian vaccines get regulatory approvals so that more cost-effective options open up,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, founder, Public Health Foundation of India, while adding that the country may need to wait till April-May when there will be more vaccines approved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-race-against-time-vaccine-drive-needs-boost-amid-spike-101614111169431.html
24-02-2021||India||‘Honoured to serve Gujarat’: Modi after civic polls sweep||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday swept six key municipal corporations in Gujarat, decimating the Congress in civic body polls in the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah, shrugging aside perceived anti-incumbency.The BJP has bagged 489 seats from a total of 576, as many as 100 more than the 389 seats it won out of 572 in the 2015 elections to the municipal corporations of Ahmedabad, Jamnagar, Bhavnagar, Surat, Rajkot and Vadodara.The eclipse of the Congress in Gujarat that started in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections continued at the local level with the party winning an apologetic 45 seats vis-a-vis as many as 174 in the previous elections.Except in Ahmedabad, where it won 15 seats against 165 for the BJP out of a total of 192 seats with three results yet to come in, and Jamnagar where the party managed 11 seats to BJP’s 50 in a 65-member house, the Congress won seats only in single digits and scored a zero in Surat.The opposition party won eight in Bhavnagar vis-a-vis 44 for the BJP out of a total of 52, followed by seven in Vadodara against 69 for the BJP (out of a total of 76 seats) and four seats in Rajkot ,where the BJP won 68 seats (total 72).In Surat, the BJP won 93 seats, the AAP opened its account with 27 seats and the Congress won none in a 120-member civic body.The Congress had won 36 seats in Surat during the 2015 elections.Elated by the results, Prime Minister Modi tweeted: “Thank you Gujarat! Results of municipal elections across the state clearly show the unwavering faith people have towards politics of development and good governance. Grateful to the people of the state for trusting BJP yet again. Always an honour to serve Gujarat.”Chief minister Vijay Rupani, who is recovering from Covid-19, said: “The election results have demonstrated that anti-incumbency doesn’t apply to Gujarat.” The two-phase local body polls in the state are being considered a precursor to the 2022 assembly elections.The All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) of Asaduddin Owaisi, which also walked into Congress strongholds, managed to win seven seats in Ahmedabad city while the Bahujan Samaj Party sprang a surprise by winning three in Jamnagar.Reacting to the results, Gujarat Congress President Amit Chavda tweeted: “We may have lost the elections in terms of numbers, but our party workers would still go among the people with more energy. We thank the people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/honoured-to-serve-gujarat-modi-after-civic-polls-sweep-101614108852323.html
24-02-2021||India||‘Sketchy evidence’: Disha granted bail||A Delhi court on Tuesday granted bail to climate activist Disha Ravi, saying there was “scanty” and “sketchy” evidence to back charges of sedition against her and asserting that citizens couldn’t be jailed simply because they disagreed with government policies.Additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana released the 22-year-old activist on a personal bond of ₹1 lakh and two sureties of similar amounts, roughly 10 days after she was arrested by Delhi Police in Bengaluru for allegedly editing a social media document, or toolkit, about the ongoing farmer protest against three central laws.The judge held that Ravi had no connection with pro-Khalistani organisations, Poetic Justice Foundation (PJF) and Sikhs for Justice, and that there was not an “iota” of evidence linking her to the violence that rocked Delhi on Republic Day.Also Read | Tears and smiles as Ravi walks gets bail“Considering the scanty and sketchy evidence available on record, I do not find any palpable reasons to breach the general rule of bail against a 22 year old young lady, with absolutely blemish free criminal antecedents and having firms firm roots in the society, and send her to jail,” the judge said.The court also said the call for any kind of violence was conspicuously absent from the toolkit, and no evidence was on record to suggest Ravi subscribed to secessionist ideas. Activists have repeatedly said the toolkit is an innocuous document used by social media campaigns for strategy and planning.“In my considered opinion, citizens are conscience keepers of government in any democratic nation. They cannot be put behind the bars simply because they choose to disagree with the state policies. The offence of sedition cannot be invoked to minister to the wounded vanity of the government,” the court held in its 14-page order.The court said difference of opinion, disagreement, divergence, dissent, or for that matter, even disapprobation, are recognised legitimate tools to infuse objectivity in state policies. “An aware and assertive citizenry, in contradistinction with an indifferent or docile citizenry, is indisputably a sign of a healthy and vibrant democracy,” the order said.As the order was read out, a visibly elated Ravi had tears in her eyes. She shook hands with two relatives in court. She was released from Tihar jail late at night. In Bengaluru, her family and friends hailed the news. “I’m feeling a sense of relief, and I’m very happy. The trust I had in the judiciary of our country has increased,” said Manjula, her mother.Ravi, a part of the Indian wing of Fridays for Future, a global climate change movement founded by Swedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg, was arrested on February 13 and charged with sedition, criminal conspiracy and inciting to riot. Police said Ravi, along with two other activists, created the toolkit to spread misinformation and incite unrest as part of a global conspiracy. The arrest triggered widespread outrage.On Tuesday, the court rejected the police’s argument and said it couldn’t be presumed on “surmises or conjectures” that Ravi supported secessionist tendencies or violence, simply because she shared a platform with people who gathered to oppose the farm laws.“The right to dissent is firmly enshrined under Article 19 of the Constitution. In my considered opinion, the freedom of speech and expression includes the right to seek a global audience. There are no geographical barriers on communication. A citizen has the fundamental rights to use the best means of imparting and receiving communication, as long as the same is permissible under the four corners of law and as such have access to audience abroad,” the court said.The court directed Ravi to continue to cooperate with ongoing investigations, join the probe as and when summoned by the investigating officer and not leave the country without the permission of the court.The judge said the creation of a WhatsApp group or editing a toolkit was not an offence. “Further, since the link with the said toolkit or PJF has not been found to be objectionable, mere deletion of the WhatsApp chat to destroy the evidence linking her with the toolkit and PJF, also becomes meaningless,” the court said.The court held the January 26 tractor rally was permitted by Delhi Police and therefore there was nothing wrong in co-accused Shantanu Muluk, a Pune-based engineer, in reaching Delhi to attend the event. Muluk, and another accused, Mumbai-based lawyer Nikita Jacob, are out on pre-arrest bail.The court said Ravi was interrogated by Delhi Police’s Special Cell for five days and placing any further restraint on her liberty on the basis of general accusation would neither be logical nor legal. The judge also cited passages from the Rig Veda and said the Indian civilization was never averse to diverse ideas.“This 5,000-year-old civilisation of ours has never been averse to ideas from varied quarters. Even our founding father accorded due respect to the divergence of opinion by recognising the freedom of speech and expression as an inviolable fundamental right,” the court said.The court said except for a bare assertion, no evidence was brought on record to support the contention that any violence took place at any Indian embassy after the alleged “sinister designs” of the accused and co-accused.Talking about the toolkit, which the police said was part of a global conspiracy to defame India, the judge said he was shown two hyperlinks with links to two websites where he couldn’t find anything objectionable. He also rejected the public prosecutor’s argument that the material in the second website was “seditious” in nature.“The imputations maybe false, exaggerated or even with a mischievous intent but the same cannot be sitgmatised being seditious unless they have tendency to foment violence,” the judge said.He also said that the police are in the process of collecting more evidence and so they cannot be allowed to further “restrict the liberty of a citizen on the basis of propitious anticipations”.The court noted the submission of additional solicitor general SV Raju for the police that more than 100 persons allegedly involved in the violence were arrested and interrogated by Delhi Police but no evidence was found linking Ravi to the clashes.Activists called the order historic. “It is a historic and constitutional moment ...this is the way the judiciary is supposed to work,” environmental activist Leo Saldanha said.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sketchy-evidence-disha-granted-bail-101614108332990.html

This time, we will gherao the Parliament. We will announce it and then march towards Delhi. This time there will be 40 lakh tractors instead of four lakh tractors,” he said while addressing meetings of farmers in Churu and Sikar districts of Rajasthan.The Budget session of Parliament which began on January 29 is currently on recess till March 7. The session ends on April 8.Tikait alleged that corporates had prepared warehouses to store grains even before the farm laws were passed.“This indicates the connivance of big businessmen with the government. There is no mention of MPS in these laws. The big corporate will store the produce of farmers in warehouses and will sell them at higher prices,” Tikait said.The farmer leader said that Rajasthan is land of fighters. “This state has a history of fighters like the late Chaudhary Kumbharam Arya who had fought against anarchy in the past. The famers of the state have fought against discrimination and big agitations have taken place in this state,” Tikat said.He added, “Rajasthan has different caste equations but in order to succeed they have to give birth to a new caste that is farmers. During every farmers' meeting we should not talk about two things; one is politics and another is caste. All the farmers are one and united.”He said that the farm laws are equally dangerous for both farmers and consumers.“Not only farmers and the poor, but every person should become a part of this fight. Every youth should connect with us because this is a battle for our land which the government wants to give it to big corporations through contract farming and other modes. The market and mandis which were open for everybody will be closed because of the farm laws,” Tikait said.He said that the framers of the state will go to Gujarat, West Bengal, Jharkhand and every part of the country because farmers are suffering everywhere.“Farmers will continue to fight irrespective of the weather. We will fight in the cold and in extreme hot conditions. It will continue unless a new law on MSP is made and the three farm laws are rolled back.”Reacting to the allegation of Tikat, chief spokesperson of the BJP unit in Rajasthan, Ramlal Sharma said, “In a democracy everybody has the right to speak and register their protest. Tikait and other opposition parties are misguiding the farmers. They should speak the truth and they should be afraid of god. These farm laws are in the favour of farmers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rakesh-tikait-holds-out-threat-of-parliament-siege-if-farm-laws-are-not-repealed-101614104642444.html
24-02-2021||India||Tears and smiles as Ravi makes bail after 10 days||Eight days ago, 22-year-old climate activist Disha Ravi, arrested in connection with the Toolkit case, broke down when she was first produced by the Delhi police in the Patiala House Court. On Tuesday, when a Delhi court granted her bail, the sheer relief brought tears in her eyes.Elated at the court order, Ravi had tears in her eyes as her lawyers ran from one court to another to complete the formalities of her release. Soon after she was produced before Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (CMM) Pankaj Sharma, at the end of her one day police custody, she broke down while meeting one of her relatives.She also shook hands with one of her two relatives present in the court after being granted bail.The Bengaluru activist was arrested on February 13 for her alleged role in creating, editing and dissemination of the toolkit document, which the police claimed was aimed at inciting unrest during the ongoing protests by farmers against the three new farm laws passed in September last year.Dressed in a green top and grey shrug, and her face covered with a black mask with the colours of LGBT, Ravi looked calmer than the first two hearings.During her second production before Metropolitan Magistrate Akash Jain on February 19, Ravi looked anxious with heavy media presence and the crowd in the court premises.On Tuesday, soon after she was granted bail, she refused to say anything when asked her reaction. Two of her relatives, who were present in the court, also avoided questions.Ravi was brought to the court amid high security where the police, represented by Public Prosecutor (PP) Vikas Singh, sought four days custody to confront her with the two other co-accused Mumbai lawyer Nikita Jacob and Pune engineer Shantanu Muluk.However, as the police asked the custodial remand, Ravi’s counsel Abhinav Sekhri informed the judge that she has been granted bail by the sessions court.CMM Pankaj Sharma disposed of the police’s application noting that the bail has already been given by a superior court.Ravi remained in the court for some time after which was taken away by the jail police to complete the process of her release.She was released from Tihar on Tuesday night. “Disha was released after jail authorities completed all formalities regarding her release,” PTI quoted a jail official as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tears-and-smiles-as-ravi-walks-gets-bail-101614104202670.html
24-02-2021||India||Cong may focus on MSMEs before TN, Bengal polls||With assembly elections coming up in West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, the Congress’s campaign is likely to increasingly focusing on issues related to the micro, small and medium enterprises sector, which forms the backbone of India’s manufacturing industries, according to Congress leaders.In January and February, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s public engagements — both virtual and in the field —have been dominated by concerns for the MSME sector. He tweeted about MSMEs at least four times during this period, spoke about problems plaguing the sector on at least three occasions, interacted with people from the sector, and wrote letters to Union ministers over issues of the sector that contributed 30.3% of India’s GDP in 2018-19.Congress strategists argue that Gandhi’s pitch for faceless industrial units of MSME auger well with the party’s criticism of what it calls as “Hum Do, Hamare Ek” policies of the government. “We stand for millions of small industries, while the government seems to care about only the big industrialists,” a senior Congress strategist said on condition of anonymity. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had criticised the remark made by Gandhi in Parliament, saying he was becoming “doomsday man” for India.Also Read | Rahul’s remark triggers ‘north-south’ rowThe party sees the MSME sector as a key plank in at least two poll-bound states: Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. Tamil Nadu accounts for 15% of India’s MSME units with an investment of ₹32,000 crore. About one in five industries in the southern state are MSME. In West Bengal, the sector employs nearly 11 million people, according to official data.Gandhi has already visited Tiruppur, the textile hub of India and exclusively interacted with the workers. Mohan Kumaramangalam, working president of the Tamil Nadu unit of Congress, said: “Demonetisation and GST badly hit the sector. Our own estimates say that a large number of them are on the verge of shutting down or have already closed their units.”So, when Mohan asked Gandhi to take up the issue of steep increase of the price of yarn, Gandhi promptly wrote to textile minister Smriti Irani, appealing for “all possible support to our brothers and sisters in the apparel sector to help them compete effectively in the global markets”.Congress officials said MSME is set to be a key agenda in their poll campaign in this round of elections. “We may announce sops for the sector if we come to power and in our campaign, we will definitely talk about how the BJP government has not given any help to the MSMEs,” said a second senior leader involved in the poll strategies.A government report showed last year that 55% of MSMEs continued to face liquidity crunch at least till August 1, 2020 and only 26% of the MSMEs were utilising more than 50% of their production capacity due to reasons including lack of fresh orders and logistics issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-may-focus-on-msmes-before-tn-bengal-polls-101614102700560.html
24-02-2021||India||MoD clears defence buys worth ₹13,700 cr, including 118 Arjun Mk-1A tanks||The defence ministry on Tuesday cleared domestic military purchases worth ₹13,700 crore, including the army’s proposals to buy 118 Arjun Mk-1A main battle tanks and equipping armoured fighting vehicles (AFVs) with modern protection and countermeasure systems, officials familiar with the developments said.While the new tanks will cost ₹8,380 crore, the protection systems for the army’s fleet of more than 3,000 AFVs (tanks and infantry combat vehicles) will cost ₹5,300 crore, the officials said. The order for the tanks could be placed with the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) this year, with five tanks to be delivered within 30 months of the signing of the contract, Hindustan Times has learnt. This will be followed by 30 tanks being delivered every year.The Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) - India’s apex procurement body – on Tuesday accorded its acceptance of necessity (AoN) for buying the tanks and the AFV protection systems to provide a push to the government’s Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (self-reliant India campaign). Defence minister Rajnath Singh chaired the DAC meeting.“Three AoNs for an overall cost of ₹13,700 crore were accorded. All these AoNs are in the highest priority category of defence acquisition…These (systems) will be indigenously designed, developed and manufactured,” the ministry said in a statement, without naming the proposals approved.The proposals cleared by the DAC include 293 Nag anti-tank missiles developed by DRDO, 13 modified ICVs (called the Nag missile carrier or Namica), eight medium power radars called Arudra and practice ammunition for T-90 and T-72 tanks, officials said.The Arjun Mk-1A is an upgraded version of the Arjun Mk-1 currently in army service. The new tank will come with 71 upgrades over the existing variant including 14 major improvements, said one of the officials cited above. The upgrades significantly improve the tank’s lethality, mobility and survivability, he said.The improvements on the new tank include better firepower, auto target tracker, remote-controlled weapon system, explosive reactive armour, advanced laser warning and countermeasure systems, containerized ammunition bin, advanced land navigation systems and improved night vision capabilities.“The precise target tracking of the tank ensures accurate engagement during day and night in both static and dynamic conditions,” the official said.The Defence Research and Development Organisation’s Chennai-based Combat Vehicles Research and Development Establishment (CVRDE) has designed and developed the tank. The tanks will be manufactured at the OFB’s Heavy Vehicles Factory at Avadi, outside Chennai.Prime Minister Narendra Modi handed over a prototype of the Arjun Mk-1A tank to army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane in Chennai on February 14, in a clear indication that the order for the 118 tanks was in the pipeline. The prototype was tested for more than 6,000 km across the country’s western sector, followed by another 1,500 km of rigorous testing, HT has learnt.More than 200 companies will be involved in the project, which is expected to generate around 8,000 jobs, said a second official. The army’s existing tank fleet consists of T-90, T-72 and the Arjun Mk-1 tanks.Protection and countermeasure systems for its AFVs have been a long-standing demand of the army. The systems will enhance the survivability of AFVs by equipping them with the capability to overcome threats from missiles, rocket-propelled grenades and tank ammunition, said a third official.Experts said the new tanks and AFV upgrades would boost the fighting potential of the army.“It’s a big leap forward and has been pending for a long time. It will improve the strike capability of the army’s armoured formations. I also see it as a very potent step in the direction of achieving self-reliance in the defence sector,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd).But some experts flagged concerns about the bulky tank, saying its weight (68 tonnes) would limit the army’s deployment options.The defence ministry said that the DAC was of the view that capital acquisition contracts - other than design and development cases - should be concluded in two years. “The ministry, in consultation with the services and all stakeholders, will come up with a detailed plan of action for achieving the same,” the statement said.Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Monday said the ministry would try to conclude contracts in two years as against the current average period of up to four years.Meanwhile, Bharat Forge on Tuesday announced that it received a ₹178-crore order from the army for its M4 vehicles under the emergency procurement route. The highly mobile vehicles, which provide protection against mines and improvised explosive devices, underwent trails in the Ladakh sector recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mod-clears-defence-buys-worth-rs-13-700-cr-including-118-arjun-mk-1a-tanks-101614091988608.html
24-02-2021||India||India allows use of airspace by Pakistan PM Imran Khan's special aircraft||India allowed Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's special aircraft to use the country’s airspace while flying to Sri Lanka on Tuesday, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.Khan flew to Sri Lanka in a Pakistan Air Force jet for a two-day visit. This is Khan’s maiden visit to the island nation after becoming prime minister in 2018 and he was accompanied by foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi.After leaving Pakistani airspace, the jet flew along India’s coastline and over the Lakshadweep archipelago before landing in Colombo. Pakistan’s request for the special flight to use Indian airspace was made more than a week ago and the permission was granted on Monday, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.India’s decision to allow the special flight to use its airspace was in marked contrast to Pakistan’s actions in 2019, when Islamabad denied permission for the use of Pakistani airspace by three Indian VVIP flights. At the time, ties between the two sides were at a low following the standoff triggered by the Pulwama suicide attack and the scrapping of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status.In September 2019, Pakistan did not permit the use of its airspace by a special flight carrying President Ram Nath Kovind to Europe on an official visit, and another flight in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi travelled to the US to attend the UN General Assembly. Pakistani also did not allow the use of its airspace by another VVIP flight during Modi’s visit to Saudi Arabia in October 2019.India subsequently took up the issue with the International Civil Aviation Organization, the UN’s aviation body, which sought a clarification from Pakistan.Khan, the first head of government to visit Sri Lanka after the Covid-19 outbreak, is set to hold talks with his counterpart Mahinda Rajapaksa, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and foreign minister Dinesh Gunawardena and address a business and investment forum. The two countries are also expected to sign several agreements during the visit.However, the Sri Lankan side cancelled an address to the Parliament by Khan over concerns that he could raise the Kashmir issue. The Pakistani side had made a request for an address to the Parliament by Khan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-allows-use-of-airspace-by-pakistan-pm-imran-khan-s-special-aircraft-101614089417503.html
24-02-2021||India||Terrorism one of the gravest threats to humankind: Jaishankar||Terrorism remains one of the “gravest threats to humankind” and constitutes a severe challenge to the global human rights agenda, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Tuesday in the first-ever address to the UN Human Rights Council by an Indian foreign minister.In his virtual address to the high-level segment of the 46th session of the UN Human Rights Council, Jaishankar called for a coordinated global response to the challenges confronting the human rights agenda, including terrorism, global inequities and armed conflicts.The Covid-19 pandemic has complicated the situation in many regions and there is a need for countries to come together to overcome these challenges, he said. He also called for the reform of multilateral institutions and mechanisms so that they can effectively deal with these challenges.Also Read | UN chief voices appreciation for India’s leadership in fight against Covid-19“Terrorism continues to be one of the gravest threats to humankind. It is a crime against humanity and violates the most fundamental human right – namely, the right to life. As a long-standing victim, India has been in the forefront of the global action against terrorism,” Jaishankar said.“This is possible only when there is a clear realisation, including in bodies dealing with human rights, that terrorism can never be justified, nor its perpetrators ever equated with its victims,” he said.India, Jaishankar noted, had presented to the UN Security Council last month an eight-point action plan to deal with terrorism, and the country will continue to work with members of the Security Council and other states to ensure the implementation of this plan.India’s commitment to protecting basic human rights is also reflected in its strategy to deal with Covid-19 both at home and abroad, he said. “By giving direct food support to 800 million Indians and financial support to 400 million, many of them women, we ensured that basic needs were very effectively addressed even during the lockdown. And as we addressed the health front at home, we responded to the world in equal measure,” he said.Noting that India provided medicines and equipment to more than 150 countries amid the pandemic, Jaishankar said: “In the same spirit, India has pledged to use its vaccine manufacturing capacity to make vaccines accessible and affordable to all. From Bangladesh to Brazil and from Morocco to Fiji, the pharmacy of the world is today supplying millions of vaccine doses to more than 70 countries.”Jaishankar also referred to the Indian government’s steps aimed at economic and social development in line with the vision of “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas”, or “working together for inclusive development for all and securing the trust of all”.These initiatives include the largest financial inclusion scheme covering 417 million Indians, free health insurance coverage for 500 million, provision of 150 million homes to the underprivileged, loans at concessional rates to 140 million Indians to promote entrepreneurship, and 50 million free gas connections to women from rural households.India is committed to take all steps to ensure the “fullest enjoyment of basic human rights of our people, including inclusive and sustainable development”, he said. “India is building a better and fairer society at home; it is also contributing to a better and fairer world,” he added.In an apparent riposte to recent criticism of the government’s handling of the farmers’ protest and the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, Jaishankar said India believes “violation of and gaps in implementation of human rights should be addressed in a fair and just manner, with objectivity, non-selectivity, transparency and with due respect to the principles of non-interference in internal affairs and national sovereignty”.India’s approach to the UN Human Rights Council is guided by a spirit of engagement, dialogue and consultation and the country believes there should be equal emphasis on promotion and protection of human rights. “Both are best pursued through dialogue, consultation and cooperation amongst states as well as technical assistance and capacity building,” Jaishankar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/terrorism-one-of-the-gravest-threats-to-humankind-jaishankar-101614079117994.html
24-02-2021||India||Chhattisgarh: Peace panel formed for dialogue with Maoists and the state||Activists, journalists and social workers constituted a peace committee to initiate dialogue between Maoists and the government with the objective of attaining lasting peace in Maoist-affected regions of Chhattisgarh.The committee named Concerned Citizens' Committee of Chhattisgarh (4Cs), comprises 11 members who will lead the negotiations with the state and the Maoists, while bringing them on a common platform.Former Union minister Arvind Netam, former chairperson of the SC/ST Commission Nandkumar Sai, leader of Sarv Adivasi Samaj B S Rawte, Communist Party of India (CPI) leader in Bastar, Manish Kunjam, journalists Diwakar Muktibodh, Kamal Shukla, social worker Virendra Pandey, social worker Indu Netam, writer irish Pankaj, and state secretary CPI RDCP Rao are panel members.Peace activist Shubhranshu Chaudhary has been made the convenor of the committee, a per a press note issued on Tuesday.“We are copying the 3Cs (Concerned Citizens' Committee) model of Andhra which succeeded in bringing both sides to table but failed in getting any results. We are trying to learn from their mistakes. One of the major criticisms was that the panel had no representation from ‘adivasi’ community or from the affected communities,” said Chaudhary, adding that the committee will be a channel of communication between both the sides.The committee currently has less representation of women which we will be very keen to repair soon, he said.The committee will start meetings soon and will form district committees in each violence-affected district of the state.The committee decided to hold several mass programs seeking dialogue and peace from both sides in the months to come with Sarv Adivasi Samaj taking the lead.“Congress manifesto in 2018 said ‘a policy will be drafted to take on the menace of Naxalism and serious steps will be taken for talks’. I think the current state government needs to be reminded of this and the Maoist leaders must realise that a negotiated settlement demanding full implementation of pro Adivasi laws in Indian constitution is in the best interest of the community they claim to represent and the current phase of their movement,” said Chaudhary.In a press note issued by the committee after the meeting on Monday stated that the political violence in the southern part of Chhattisgarh was the focal point of the event.“One assessment of the participants indicated toward the changing dynamics in the Bastar region and within the Left Wing Extremism (LWE) congregations. It was observed that the leadership within the LWE congregation has been debilitating and deteriorating with time. For the moment, the situation could be conceived as a watershed in the Naxalite movement where a large chunk of the congregation wants to move out of the clutches of the exploitation by the Maoist organisation in general and leadership in particular,” the press release stated.“Such movements have to involve the state and its principles at various junctures and state must also reciprocate to such formations duly and in all sincerity,” Netam said about the panel’s chances of success.Also Read: Video of jail guard assaulting Chhattisgarh doctor goes viral, doctors on strikeA senior Chhattisgarh police officer, who did not wish to be named, said the formation of the peace committee was a welcome step.“In the recent years, the three pronged strategy of ‘Vishwas’ (trust), ‘Vikas’ (development), ‘Suraksha’ (security) by the security forces is yielding positive results in tackling the left wing extremism. The objective of the local police and the security forces is to bring down the violence and establish peace and order in the region. Any initiative from civil society in this direction would strengthen the resolve of security forces in this regard. The surrender and rehabilitation policy of the government also encourages the Maoist cadres to shun violence and join the national mainstream. But any formal decision with regard to holding talks with Maoists would be taken by senior functionaries of the government,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-peace-panel-formed-for-dialogue-with-maoists-and-the-state-101614075584924.html
24-02-2021||India||Covid vaccination: People over 60 likely to be allowed to self-register||People aged above 60 and those with comorbidities will be allowed to self-register and choose where they can be vaccinated for Covid-19 from March 1, an official familiar with the matter said as the government is working to speed up the second phase of the vaccination process.The upgraded mobile application designed for the vaccination drive will also allow the users, who are travelling, to pick a different centre if needed for the second dose.HT on Monday reported that the government is planning to take the rate of coronavirus vaccinations to 5 million a day in the next four to six weeks. This could include doubling the number of daily vaccinations at a particular location to 200. The move is meant to speed up the process when the next and the largest cohort of recipients — members of the general public who are at greater risk due to their age and existing illnesses — begin to be covered.Also Read | Covaxin phase 3 efficacy data likely out in two weeks: Bharat BiotechThe second phase of the vaccination will also include armed forces and police personnel. The government had earlier decided that people over 50 would be allowed to register. But it has since decided to prioritise those over 60 as they are at a greater risk.“The government wants to prioritise those at risk, so first those over 60 will be allowed to register,” said an official. “There is a pool of around 20 crore [200 million] individuals.”The official added the Aadhaar will not be mandatory for registration. “People can use any ID to register. They just have to make sure that they carry the same proof when they go for vaccination.”Vaccination certificates will be made available across government platforms such as Co-WIN and DigiLocker. The option to register on contact tracing app Aarogya Setu is also likely as the platforms will be integrated, according to an internal note circulated on Co-WIN.The official added that the application would soon start providing real-time updates, including the number of people vaccinated daily. “The government is also considering whether or not private hospitals offering the vaccination should be shown on the application...that way, the user will have more options,” the official said. “Users will also be able to choose the vaccination slot that they want.”The official added up to five members from one family can register on one account and get vaccinated together.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-vaccination-people-over-60-likely-to-be-allowed-to-selfregister-101614056735042.html

The judge had said that the petitioner had “cleverly” concealed the information from the court that he had filed the plea because his daughter had been unsuccessful in this selection process.The court also imposed a cost of ₹25,000 on the petitioner for hiding the facts while also noting that disclosing details of the appointed staff will be a complete invasion of their privacy.On Friday, the court issued a corrigendum and said, “There is an inadvertent omission in Para 12 of Jan 12 order.”"This Court is of the opinion that whenever personal information is sought under the RTI Act, disclosure of an interest in the said information sought would be necessary to establish the bonafides of the applicant. Non- disclosure of the same could result in injustice to several other affected persons, whose personal information is sought, " the court said.The plea by the man through his counsel had sought information from the President Secretariat about the candidates who had appeared, who successfully cleared the exam etc for the recruitment of multitasking staff.Advocate Anurag Ahluwalia, Central government’s standing counsel, had told the court that while five of the six information sought were provided to the man, the last one, with respect to the phone numbers, names and residential addresses of the successful candidates was not given because that would infringe with their privacy.(This report, first published on January 30, has been updated to accurately reflect the order of the High Court of Delhi)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disclosure-of-interest-in-info-sought-under-rti-not-necessary-but-important-101611995870133.html
