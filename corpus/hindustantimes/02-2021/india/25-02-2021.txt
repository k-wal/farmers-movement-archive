Bhubaneswar's all-time record for February is 42.7 degree on February 23, 1963.With the temperature rising in several parts of Odisha, Special Relief Commissioner PK Jena has asked the district collectors to take steps to identify water scarcity pockets and prepare an action plan for ensuring supply of drinking water through tankers. In case educational institutions remain open, the officials have to ensure availability of drinking water in all schools and colleges. Sufficient ORS will be kept in schools and colleges for students and staff. Anganwadi centres will remain open in the morning hours only.All public transport vehicles will have to carry sufficient drinking water and ORS packets for passengers and staff.

25-02-2021||India||'375 mn Indian children may suffer due to Covid-19 pandemic': CSE report||Around 375 million children (aged between 0-14 years) in India may suffer from the long-lasting impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, including malnutrition to loss of education and work productivity, said the Centre for Science and Environment in its annual State of Environment report released on Thursday.The report has derived this number based on different studies done on the impact of children due to Covid-19 across the world and India by organisations such as the World Bank, the United Nations Children‚Äôs Fund (UNICEF) and the Global Health Science.The UNICEF said that most of the children missed the subsidised food offered in government schools during the lockdown. The CSE estimated that about 90.4 million children missed the meals. The report said that half of 500 million children that were forced out of schools across the world were in India.‚ÄúThe target to reduce the stunting target to 2.5 per cent of the children in the age group of 0-5 by 2030 from 34.7 per cent in 2018 could be impacted because of Covid-19,‚Äù the report said.Also read: Pakistan stays in FATF ‚Äògrey list‚Äô, given June deadline to implement action planCSE‚Äôs director general Sunita Narian said Covid-19 had made the world‚Äôs poor poorer. ‚ÄúAdditionally, 115 million people may get pushed into extreme poverty by the pandemic and most of them live in South Asia,‚Äù she said.On the sustainable development goals (SDGs), the report said that India ranks 117 among 192 countries and is behind all South Asian countries, except Pakistan.The five best performing states on SDGs are Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Telangana, the report said, adding that the five worst states were Bihar, Jharkhand, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and Uttar Pradesh.On air pollution, the report pointed out that 1.67 million Indians died due to air pollution in 2019 and its economic cost was $36,000 million, equivalent to 1.36 per cent of India‚Äôs GDP.The report said that contrary to popular belief, India‚Äôs rivers did not see any significant improvement in their water quality during the lockdown. ‚ÄúOf India‚Äôs 19 major rivers, five ‚Äì including Ganga ‚Äì ran dirtier in the Covid-19 period,‚Äù the report said.Amid all the gloom, the report said there was one good news. And, it was that 34 per cent of Mahatama Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act funds since 2014-15 were used for water-related works, leading to the creation of almost 11 million water assets in half a million India villages.‚ÄúThe overall assessment is that our air and water quality is under stress; all trends show that pollution is increasing and this has massive impacts on our health,‚Äù she said.However, she pointed out that the good news was that India was adopting new sustainable technologies. ‚ÄúWe are adopting technologies that will be affordable to large numbers and so, sustainable,‚Äù she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/375-mn-indian-children-may-suffer-due-to-pandemic-cse-report-101614271751644.html

Any attack on Coronil suggests pettiness."The Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Monday demanded an explanation from Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan for promoting Patanjali's Coronil Ayurvedic medicine."Being a Health Minister of the country, how justified is it to release such falsely fabricated unscientific product to people of the whole country and how ethical is it to promote the product in unethical, wrong and false ways?"

Discussed the implementation of our Moscow Agreement and reviewed the status of disengagement,‚Äù Jaishankar tweeted, without giving details.There was no official word on the contact from the Chinese side.The ‚ÄúMoscow Agreement‚Äù that Jaishankar referred to was a five-point agreement that the two sides had concluded during the meeting of the foreign ministers in the Russian capital. A joint statement issued after that meeting had said the two sides would be guided by the consensus of the leaders of India and China, including not allowing differences to become disputes.Jaishankar and Wang had also agreed that border troops would ‚Äúcontinue their dialogue, quickly disengage, maintain proper distance and ease tensions‚Äù, and that the two sides would abide by all existing agreements and protocols on border management and ‚Äúavoid any action that could escalate matters‚Äù.The two sides further agreed to continue dialogue through the Special Representatives‚Äô mechanism and through meetings of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs. Once the situation eases, the two sides would work on new confidence-building measures for enhancing peace and tranquillity in border areas.Asked about the situation on the LAC at a regular news briefing, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said: ‚ÄúBoth sides view the smooth and successful completion of disengagement in the north and south bank [of Pangong Lake] as a significant first step as this forms a basis for resolution of remaining issues so as to achieve the eventual goal of complete disengagement in all friction areas.‚Äù‚ÄúThe two sides have agreed to work towards a mutually acceptable resolution of the remaining issues,‚Äù he said.Within 48 hours of the completion of the disengagement at Pangong Lake, the 10th round of talks between senior military commanders of the two sides was held on February 20. Srivastava said the two sides had ‚Äúcandid and in-depth exchange of views on the remaining issues along the LAC in the western sector‚Äù at this meeting.The meeting of the military commanders had focused on disengagement at other friction points such as Gogra, Hot Springs and Depsang Plains though there were no immediate signs of a breakthrough.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-talks-to-chinese-counterpart-wang-yi-reviews-disengagement-on-lac-101614269763302.html
25-02-2021||India||Tandav row: HC denies anticipatory bail to Amazon Prime Video's commercial head||The Allahabad High Court on Thursday rejected the anticipatory bail application of Amazon Prime Video's commercial head, Aparna Purohit, in the ongoing investigation against the web series 'Tandav'.Purohit was accused of the inappropriate depiction of Uttar Pradesh police personnel, Hindu deities and adverse portrayal of a character playing the prime minister in the web series.Justice Siddharth, while rejecting the application, said that though the applicant was earlier granted interim protection from arrest by another bench in a similar case, she was not cooperating with the investigation.Petitioner's plea was that the web series was a work of fiction. There was no intention of the applicant to outrage the religious sentiments of any community.The state government's counsel argued that a total of ten FIRs and four criminal complaints have been filed relating to the disputed web series across the country. It shows that merely one person is not affected by the conduct of the applicant rather several people across the country have felt that the web series is offensive and hence they lodged FIRs/complaints.File photo: Bharat Bandh - What services are likely to be affected, what not"It is not a stray case of some over-sensitive individual lodging the FIR against the applicant and other co-accused persons regarding objectionable character and content of the web series in dispute," added the counsel.The court, after hearing the concerned parties, observed, "The basic philosophy of the Constitution is to permit the people of all faith to practice, profess and propagate their religion freely without hurting or acting against the people who profess or practice different religious faith than theirs. Therefore, it is an onerous duty of every citizen to respect the feelings of the people of other faith even while making a fiction".Referring to certain scenes of the web-series, the court observed, "the scenes in dispute are likely to cause disturbance and threats to public order. The reference to Hindu Gods and Goddesses in the scenes in dispute in berating light cannot be justified."The court then observed, "Western filmmakers have refrained from ridiculing Lord Jesus or the Prophet but Hindi filmmakers have done this repeatedly and still doing this most unabashedly with the Hindu Gods and Goddesses."On the use of the names of Hindu deities, and disrespectfully showing them in Hindi movies, the court observed, "This tendency on the part of the Hindi film industry is growing and if not curbed in time, it may have disastrous consequences for the Indian social, religious and communal order. There appears to be a design behind such acts on the part of the people who just give a disclaimer in all the films and depict things in the movies which are really religiously, socially and communally offensive in nature. The young generation of the country, which is not much aware of the social and cultural heritage of this country, gradually starts believing what is shown in the movies by the people like the accused persons in the present movie in dispute and thereby, it destroys the basic concept of the survival of this country having tremendous diversity of all kinds as a united nation. The film industry in the south has not indulged in such acts like the Hindi film industry."The court went on to take judicial notice of the fact that whenever such crimes (like the one at hand) are committed by some citizens of the country, "the forces inimical to the interest of this country become active and they make it an issue and raise it before different national and international forums alleging that Indian citizens have become intolerant and 'India' has become an unsafe place to live."On January 19, an FIR was lodged on the complaint of one Balbir Azad of Raunija village under Rabupura police station of Greater Noida in Uttar Pradesh. In the complaint, Azad alleged that the series depicted Uttar Pradesh and its police in a bad light. The complaint further alleged that the series had deliberately denigrated Hindu deities.The FIR further alleged that the web series in question depicted the Prime Minister of India as going against democratic norms and deliberate comments were used to disturb caste and communal amity. The makers of the series wanted to disturb the peace and tranquillity with the aim of making money, the complainant alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tandav-row-hc-denies-anticipatory-bail-to-amazon-prime-video-s-commercial-head-101614268757538.html

'It's a dharam sankat', says Sitharaman||Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Thursday that she won't be able to answer when the prices of petrol and diesel will be reduced. Sitharaman said it's a "dharam sankat (dilemma)"."I won't be able to say 'when'.. it is a ‚Äòdharam sankat‚Äô (dilemma)," she said at an event in Ahmedabad."It's not just the cess. You have the excise duty of the Centre, then you have the VAT of the states. So there's is no hiding the fact that there is revenue there. It's not just me, you ask any state. There's revenue there," the finance minister further said.She reiterated that the only way to find a solution to this problem is that the Centre and states should hold a dialogue. "I concede that's where action has to be, let's see what we can do," said Sitharaman, adding that she agrees the end users should pay less for fuel.Earlier in the day, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das had said there is a need for coordinated action between the Centre and state governments to reduce taxes on petrol and diesel prices.‚ÄúThere is a need for coordinated action between the Centre and states because there are inherent taxes levied by both,‚Äù the Governor said adding that calibrated reduction of taxes was important.He, however, said both the Centre and the state governments have their revenue pressures and they are required to spend high sums of money to enable the country and the people to come out of the Covid-19 pandemic stress.Over a period of time, the prices of petrol and diesel have increased sharply in the country. In some cities, the price has reached ‚Çπ100 per litre.The opposition parties have been attacking the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government over the fuel price hike. On Thursday, in an unusual protest against the LPG price hike, a Congress spokesperson on Thursday conducted a press conference sitting on an empty cylinder as the party accused the Narendra Modi government of being "anti-people".There has been no hike in fuel prices on Thursday and the rates of petrol and diesel prices in Delhi remain ‚Çπ90.93 per litre and ‚Çπ81.32 per litre respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-petrol-price-hike-finance-minister-nirmala-sitharaman-says-it-s-a-dharam-sankat-101614268505517.html

25-02-2021||India||'Corrupt, liars!' PM Modi attacks DMK-Congress combine in TN, Puducherry||Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the BJP‚Äôs campaign in Puducherry and Tamil Nadu on Thursday. in a blistering attack against the Congress-DMK combine, the prime minister called them corrupt, liars and women troublers.PM Modi was in the two-poll bound neighbouring regions to launch a slew of infrastructure projects meant to give his regional allies a fillip ahead of the polls in April-May. He also switched-over to power-packed political speeches.Tamil NaduIn Coimbatore, Modi began his speech with the BJP‚Äôs war cry in the state ‚ÄòVetrivel Veeravel‚Äô (victorious spear, courageous spear) referring to their 'vetrivel yatra' (victorious spear march) launched in November 2020 in support of Tamil deity Lord Muruga's devotees. DMK and Congress began their first round of seat-sharing talks for Tamil Nadu on Thursday. Modi termed their meetings as "corruption hackathons". "Their leaders sit and brainstorm how to loot,‚Äù he said.The BJP, which has no MLA or MP from Tamil Nadu, will face the elections with the ruling AIADMK which has a strong hold over the western region comprising Coimbatore. Modi called the way the NDA functioned in the centre with the AIADMK as a "classic example of cooperative federalism."Also read: Indian Newspaper Society writes to Google to pay for newsHe then continued to attack their principal opposition, the DMK for ‚Äòpromoting a strong man culture' with anti-social elements in every district. ‚ÄúWho suffers most in such a culture? Women,‚Äù said Modi. ‚ÄúEntire Tamil Nadu knows how the DMK treated ‚ÄòAmma‚Äô Jayalalithaa ji. Leaders who troubled Jayalalithaa ji have been given posts,‚Äù he said referring to a 1989 incident when Jayalalithaa, as the leader of the opposition, was allegedly assaulted in the assembly when DMK was in power.Recalling the power-cuts during the DMK‚Äôs regime, Modi said that the Dravidian party has ‚Äúlost the right to be called an all-Tamil Nadu‚Äù party. "Last time they won a full majority on their own in the state was 25 years ago. The DMK and the Congress have tried to launch and re-launch their respective first families but got no success. There is a continuous family drama there," he added.PuducherryDays after the Congress government fell in Puducherry after being unable to prove a majority and blamed the BJP for toppling it, Modi hit back at former chief minister V Narayanasamy. ‚ÄúHe was more interested in lifting the slippers of his leader rather than ‚Äúlifting people out of poverty,‚Äù said Modi. ‚ÄúPeople of Puducherry are experiencing freedom from the Congress government.‚Äù Amidst Congress‚Äô charges that the centre colluded with former L-G Kiran Bedi to thwart their governance, Modi said that it was Congress that didn‚Äôt cooperate and 'didn‚Äôt utilise central funds‚ÄôModi also brought up the viral video clip of Narayanasamy wrongly translating a woman‚Äôs complaint against the CM into a compliment to Rahul Gandhi, during his meeting last week with fisherfolk. ‚ÄúHe lied to the people and his own leader. Can a party whose culture is based on lies ever serve people?‚Äù the prime minister questioned. ‚ÄúThe colonial rulers adopted the policy of divide and rule. Congress‚Äô policy is 'divide, lie and rule'. They are gold, silver and bronze medal winners in telling lies.‚ÄùReacting to Gandhi wondering why there was no fisheries ministry in Delhi during the above-said interaction, Modi said, ‚ÄúI was shocked. Current NDA formed the fisheries ministry in 2019 and the budget allocated for fisheries has grown more than 80 per cent in two years.‚Äù To this, Gandhi, who is campaigning in poll-bound Kerala, tweeted, ‚ÄúDear PM...Fisherfolk need an independent and dedicated ministry of fisheries, not just a department within a ministry.‚ÄùModi also blamed the Congress in the Union territory for not conducting panchayat polls when it could be held in Gujarat, Jammu and Kashmir, and Leh-Ladakh. He concluded that his election manifesto was for the NDA to make Puducherry the ‚ÄòBEST‚Äô' - as a hub for B- Business, E-education, S-spirituality, and T-Tourism.A few hours later, President‚Äôs rule was imposed in Puducherry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/corrupt-liars-pm-modi-attacks-dmk-congress-combine-in-tn-puducherry-101614266819225.html

25-02-2021||India||Wild boars resurface in Kashmir valley after almost 30 years||Wild boars, which are not native to Kashmir and had not been seen since the mid-1980s, have been sighted increasingly in the past few years in the valley causing concern among the local population and wildlife experts.Conservationists and officials conclude that the population of the wild boars has increased based on the increased sightings of the wild animal in central and north Kashmir since 2018.They say that the wild pigs have been sighted in many areas of north Kashmir, including Uri, Lachipora, Limber, Rafiabad, Rajwar and Balpur. The animal has also been found wandering in Dachigam National Park and its adjoining orchard and crop areas in summer capital Srinagar.‚ÄúThey were not sighted commonly in the field but now everybody is informing us about their presence. They are scavengers and are foraging in wild spaces,‚Äù said wildlife warden north Kashmir, Mohammad Maqbool Baba.Baba said that they have not yet conducted any census of the animal, which is a prolific breeder and is omnivorous. ‚ÄúThere would be a maximum of 100 such animals in north Kashmir,‚Äù he said.The increased presence of the animal has caused panic among people, particularly farmers. The animal is also not accepted culturally in the Muslim majority region.‚ÄúWe have very less staff and it is not possible to watch every place. Still our teams tried to scatter them. Government should think something over the issue,‚Äù said Baba.Wild boars are not native to Kashmir and are believed to be introduced by Maharaja Gulab Singh for game hunting.Intisar Suhail, wildlife warden of Shopian who has co authored a publication on wild boars, said that the species was introduced by the Maharaja some 100 years ago for his game.‚ÄúHistorically wild boars were found in Dachigam and the reserves around it. Since it was non-native its population slowly declined due to the cold weather. They had not been sighted for many years. It has revived recently,‚Äù he said.Suhail said that the reason for its revival may be multi-factor. ‚ÄúClimate change can be one of the factors. We have been witnessing warm temperatures for the past few years,‚Äù he said.In north Kashmir, he said that the reason may be owing to the increase in population of wild boars in Pakistan occupied Kashmir forests adjoining the Line of Control.‚ÄúResearchers from across the LoC say that in the past 10 years there has been an increase in its population. So it would have spilled over into north Kashmir also,‚Äù he said.The wildlife researchers said that the animal was last seen in Dachigam in the 1980s and they are now fearful of the negative impact of the animal‚Äôs recurrence on the local ecosystem.‚ÄúFrom 2007 to 2011 we did extensive camera trappings in Dachigam but did not sight the animal even once during the period. The sightings of the animal have been made in the past few years. We have not assessed their numbers but there is a population in Dachigam which comes out into orchards and there are also crop raidings,‚Äù said Dr Samina Amin Charoo, research officer wildlife department.‚ÄúIt is an invasive species and a prolific breeder. And universally it is a fact that when an invasive species comes it becomes dominant on the native species. It will obviously have a negative effect on the ecosystem,‚Äù she said.The wildlife department is formulating a management action plan for all protected areas. ‚ÄúWe will also look into the problem to know its population and its effects,‚Äù she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wild-boars-resurface-in-kashmir-valley-after-almost-30-years-101614264574797.html

Jagan, who called on the family of Ramakrishna Reddy in Owk in Kurnool district later, promised to make his son as the MLC.The Election Commission of India on Thursday issued notification for the elections to six MLC seats under the MLAs‚Äô quota in Andhra Pradesh. The elections, if necessary, would be held on March 15 and results would be declared the same day.The six seats in the legislative council have fallen vacant due to the completion of term of four MLCs ‚Äì Mohammad Iqbal, Tippe Swamy, Sandhya Rani and Veera Venkanna Chowdary; death of one MLC ‚Äì Challa Ramakrishna Reddy and the resignation of another sitting MLC Pilli Subhash Chandra Bose on his election to Rajya Sabha.For the remaining four MLC seats, the YSRCP announced the names of Mohammad Iqbal (for the second consecutive term) from Anantapur, Duvvada Srinivas from Tekkali in Srikakulam, former MP C Ramachandraiah from Kadapa and Kareemunnisa, a former woman corporator of Vijayawada Municipal Corporation.The YSR Congress party is expected to win all the six MLC seats as it has numbers in its favour ‚Äì 151 MLAs in the 175-member state assembly. The only opposition in the assembly ‚Äì Telugu Desam Party ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt have enough strength to win even a single seat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-andhra-mlc-polls-jagan-reddy-names-sons-of-lawmakers-who-died-of-covid-101614263420796.html

Shailaja had asked for more vaccines to be provided before the state starts inoculating the third priority group - those over 50 years of age and above.She had also asked for another opportunity to register healthcare workers who have missed the registration deadline, so they don‚Äôt miss out on their Covid-19 jabs.According to a press release by the ministry of health, Kerala has administered the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine to 85.09 per cent of the beneficiaries. The state has administered a total of 4,89,495 doses of the vaccine till February 24.Kerala on Thursday registered 3,677 new Covid-19 cases, marking a slight drop from the 4,106 cases registered on Wednesday. The total number of active cases also came down from 52,869 recorded the day before to 51,879 recorded on Thursday.The Centre had on Wednesday deputed multi-disciplinary teams to Kerala and nine other states with high Covid-19 caseloads, hoping to find out what led to the recent spike in the number of cases. An overall laxity in abiding by Covid-19 preventative norms is broadly believed to be the reason behind the sudden increase in daily tally of cases, but the central government team has been dispatched to help zero in on any specific reason, if any, behind the increase.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-cm-to-write-to-centre-requesting-more-covid-19-vaccines-101614262247506.html

Any appeal, if granted, will be heard at the Administrative Division of the High Court in London.It is also possible to appeal to the UK Supreme Court but this is only possible if the High Court certifies that the appeal involves a point of law of general public importance, and either the High Court or the Supreme Court gives leave for the appeal to be made.Modi's legal team did not immediately confirm if he intends to appeal against Thursday‚Äôs ruling in the High Court and he will remain behind bars at Wandsworth Prison on judicial remand until the next stage in the legal process.Meanwhile, Indian-origin minister Priti Patel has a number of matters related to Indian economic offenders adding up ‚Äì with Mallya‚Äôs case yet to be fully resolved and that of accused arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari set to begin its magistrates‚Äô court journey from April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nirav-modi-extradition-now-for-uk-minister-priti-patel-to-sign-off-101614260876549.html

A notification imposing the President's Rule in Puducherry was issued by the Union home ministry on Thursday. The union territory's Assembly has been kept under suspended animation.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which was blamed for the fall of the government by former chief minister V Narayanasamy, did not stake claim to form government.‚ÄúWe will not try and form a government at this stage.

Despite having been a former Supreme Court judge in India until his retirement in 2011 his evidence was in my assessment less than objective and reliable. His evidence in Court appeared tinged with resentment towards former senior judicial colleagues. It had hallmarks of an outspoken critic with his own personal agenda.‚ÄùThe Judge further said that he found Katju‚Äôs ‚Äúevidence and behaviour in engaging the media the day before giving evidence to be questionable for someone who served the Indian Judiciary at such a high level appointed to guard and protect the rule of law.‚ÄùIn his testimony, Katju had said in the court that India was in terrible economic collapse and the (ruling) BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) were trying to solve the problem but they did not know how to, so they found scapegoats and Nirav Modi is a scapegoat for causing financial crisis in India. Katju had also said during his testimony that the Indian Supreme Court had become subservient to the Indian government.Rejecting his contention, Judge Sam Goozee said in judgement‚Äì ‚ÄúDespite making commentary about the fairness of any trial process in India, he accepted on a number of occasions in cross-examination that he had not considered the evidence and it is evident from his report he certainly had not considered the full requests from the Government of India‚Äù.‚ÄúHe made bold assertions about corruption across the judiciary in India (including former Chief Justices) and that the Supreme Court had surrendered itself to the executive. Of note, despite being critical of a former Chief Justice passing a verdict in a Supreme Court case in exchange for a nomination to the Upper House of Parliament in India on his retirement on a quid pro quo basis, suggesting collusion and corruption, Justice Katju himself secured appointment by the Government to Chairman of the Press Council of India following his own retirement,‚Äù the Judge observed.The court further said - ‚ÄúDespite being highly critical of the ‚Äòtrial by media‚Äô and its impact on Nirav Modi‚Äôs case, he (Katju) took the astonishing decision to brief journalists in relation to the evidence he was giving in these proceedings, creating his own media storm and adding to the heightened media interest to date.‚Äù||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/personal-agenda-uk-court-on-markandey-katju-s-testimony-in-nirav-modi-trial-101614258078164.html

We will continue to support the recovery process through the provision of ample liquidity in the system, while maintaining financial stability," he said.¬†¬†¬†¬†Speaking on the topic 'Creating New Opportunities for Growth', the governor said the manufacturing sector is spearheading the growth recovery as many contact-intensive services sub-sectors are severely affected by the pandemic.¬†¬†¬†¬†He said the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) and the Credit Guarantee Scheme for Subordinate Debt (CGSSD), along with various monetary and regulatory measures by the RBI including rate cuts, moratorium and restructuring, will not only help in ameliorating stress in the MSME sector but also open new opportunities.¬†¬†Digital penetration in the country has scaled a new high, Das said, adding that time has come to leverage its applications while at the same time strengthen the digital infrastructure.He also urged corporate sector to invest more to create scale and skill in the health sector, which has tremendous opportunities.¬†¬†The governor said one of the policy areas which needs focus for providing a durable push to the country's exports and growth is Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with key strategically important economies."The potential FTAs need to take cognisance of not only domestic strengths and global opportunities but also the emerging geo-political landscape in the post-pandemic period," he said, adding that the post-Brexit scenario offers a greater scope for having separate trade agreements with the UK and the European Union.Das further said the country is on the cusp of a turnaround in fortunes."In contrast to the rest of the world, the caseload of Covid-19 in India has declined and it is crucial for us to consolidate this decline and capitalise on the success that has been hard-earned," he emphasised.He also said with the infection caseload in some parts of the country again creeping up, one needs to stay vigilant and steadfast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rbis-asset-purchases-did-not-dilute-its-balance-sheet-governor-das-101614258047722.html

Hakim was also had a similar placard hanging from his neck.Hitting out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Banerjee said, "There was demonetisation, and now fuel prices are rising. Modi government is selling everything in the country. From Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) to coal everything in the country is being sold.

This price rise and its shameless defence shall be appropriately answered by the people," Yechury said in a tweet.The Railways maintained that since the coronavirus-triggered lockdown was eased, it was running only special trains. It started with long-distance trains and now, even short-distance passenger trains are being run as special trains.As a special provision in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, the fares of these trains have been fixed at par with the price of unreserved tickets of mail and express trains for the same distance, a statement from the railway ministry said.For example, a ticket from Amritsar to Pathankot costs ‚Çπ55 now.

Similarly, a ticket of a passenger DMU between the Jalandhar City railway station and Ferozpur costs ‚Çπ60 now, while it used to cost ‚Çπ30 earlier."Railways would like to inform that these slightly higher fares for passenger and other short distance trains had been introduced to discourage people from avoidable travels and those which are not most necessary," the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sitaram-yechury-hits-out-at-government-over-rise-in-short-distance-train-fares-101614256301801.html

There is sufficient security, adequate food and Barrack 12 has more space than where he is lodged right now," the court said.The judge also junked Modi's contention about poor mental health and poor medical conditions in India.The judgement comes as a major success after Vijay Mallya's extradition. However, Nirav Modi can still approach the high court.The businessman was arrested on an extradition warrant on March 19, 2019, following which he has appeared from Wandsworth Prison for several court hearings in the case.Modi, who is accused of fraudulently obtaining letters of undertaking or loan agreements and laundering the proceeds of that fraud, has been denied bail at both Magistrate and High Court level in the UK.He is also accused of causing the disappearance of evidence and intimidating witnesses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-judge-clears-nirav-modi-s-extradition-says-no-evidence-to-suggest-he-will-not-receive-justice-in-india-101614247989135.html

However, when it came to power, the BJP forgot about the Sankalp Patra promised to the public.""BJP should give an answer to the people when will smart cities be built. They took the oath of 'Maa Ganga' to clean the river, but why is it still not clean. They had taken the 'Sankalp' of cleaning all the rivers in the country, but it is not happening," Yadav said.He further said, "The government is saying that it has to accumulate ‚Çπ2.5 lakh crore. The way prices of petrol and diesel have increased, ‚Çπ2.5 lakh crore must have been accumulated by the government a long time ago. Moreover, if things are sold to private enterprises then what will happen to the rights guaranteed by the Constitution (like jobs and reservation).""The BJP deliberately does not talk about the economy, jobs, inflation.

Various community groups and social workers have supported the plea, the Gulf News reported.India has since February 23 made it mandatory for passengers to produce the negative report of the RT-PCR tests taken within 72 hours before their departure to India.The passengers are also required to undergo self-paid confirmatory molecular test on arrival in India.The on-arrival test cost would be an additional burden for several Indian families flying home, Ashraf Thamarassery, a prominent social worker and winner of India‚Äôs Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Award for NRIs, said.‚ÄúThere are many people, who have lost jobs, flying back home. There are families with four or five members leaving the UAE. Also, how can people, who are leaving after staying without any documents and financial cases, pay this amount? Those who came on visit visa looking for jobs will also be affected,‚Äù Thamarassery was quoted as saying in the report.He said the Indian government should urgently address the issue and help fund the tests.He said that the people coming to the UAE are also tested on arrival but the government is bearing the cost of testing passengers of all nationalities.K V Shamsudheen, who runs Sharjah-based Pravasi Bandhu Welafre Trust, said he has written a letter to Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to stop the ‚Äúself-paid‚Äù test on arrival.Meanwhile, some expats are even delaying their journey to India hoping that the government would revise the rules, the news report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-expats-in-uae-seek-exemption-from-self-paid-covid-tests-on-arrival-in-india-101614249004800.html
25-02-2021||India||Months before Chamoli tragedy, satellite images showed crack in mountain ice||Months before the landslide, which triggered flash floods in Uttarakhand‚Äôs Chamoli on February 7, satellite images showed a crack opening on an ice-covered flank of 6,029 metre-high Ronti mountain, American space agency NASA‚Äôs Earth Observatory has said in a report. The report published on the observatory‚Äôs website added this became clear after comparing high-resolution satellite images of the area before and after the tragedy on January 20 and February 21. It cited a closeup of the images in the same area before and after the debris flow and pointed to a ‚Äúdark scar near the origin of the landslide and the trail of dust and debris that blanketed the valley walls downstream‚Äù. ‚ÄúOn February 7, 2021, a huge chunk of a steep slope broke off from the peak, bringing down part of a hanging glacier perched on the ridge. After freefalling for roughly two kilometres, the rock and ice shattered as it slammed into the ground, producing an enormous landslide and dust cloud.‚ÄùAlso Read | NASA releases panorama taken by Mars roverThe report added as the accelerating rock and ice raced through the Ronti and Rishiganga River valley, they picked up glacial sediments and melted snow. ‚ÄúAll the materials mixed into a fast-moving slurry that overwhelmed the river and churned wildly as it rushed through the river valley.‚ÄùThe observatory shares images, stories, and discoveries about the environment, and climate that emerge from NASA research.Scientists from Dehradun‚Äôs Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, who visited the disaster scene, have come up with similar findings, minus the crack being visible months before.Kalachand Sain, the institute‚Äôs director, said experts were scanning satellite imagery of Ronti mountain to establish when the crack or movement became visible. He added they overall know what happened, but more study was needed for the specific details and the sequence of events.‚ÄúOur team, after studying the site and comparing the ground observations with satellite imagery, found that crashing of the hanging rock mass/snow down the mountainside, took debris, rocks, snow with it, which led to the tragedy downstream the Rishiganga.‚Äù Sain said due to freezing, thawing, and temperature variation, the rock mass loosened and broke off due to the gravitational pull. He added it slid down with snow, debris, and boulders, and soil.Sain said the mass got into the Ronti Gad stream, which receives waters from glaciers in the area. ‚ÄúThe mass blocked the water of the stream damming it up to such an extent that it breached and the whole mass of water, boulders, and rock...‚Äù He said the mass came crashing down with force towards the Rishiganga Dam site and left 69 people dead and 135 missing.Sain said even now there is some remnant debris in the stream. He added if rains lash the area or snow melts, it could again lead to water accumulation. ‚ÄúWe, as well as authorities, are keeping a tab on all these developments so that timely measures can be taken.‚Äù||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/months-before-chamoli-tragedy-satellite-images-showed-crack-in-mountain-ice-101614249052642.html

25-02-2021||India||Would be compelled to take pre-emptive strike when confronted by imminent terror attack: India at UN||India told a UN meeting that a country would be compelled to undertake a ‚Äúpre-emptive strike‚Äù when confronted by an "imminent armed attack‚Äù from a non-state actor operating in a third state, as it highlighted several proxy cross-border terror attacks, including one in Pulwama, perpetrated against it from its neighbourhood, a clear reference to Pakistan.India‚Äôs Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador K Nagaraj Naidu said at an Arria Formula meeting organised by Mexico that non-state actors such as terrorist groups often attack states from remote locations within other host states, using the sovereignty of that host state as a ‚Äúsmokescreen‚Äù.On this, a growing number of states believe that the use of force in self-defence against a non-state actor operating in the territory of another host state can be undertaken if the ‚Äúnon-state actor has repeatedly undertaken armed attacks against the State; the host state is unwilling to address the threat posed by the non-state actor; the host state is actively supporting and sponsoring the attack by the non-state actor,‚Äù he said.‚ÄúIn other words, a state would be compelled to undertake a pre-emptive strike when it is confronted by an imminent armed attack from a non-state actor operating in a third state," he said on Wednesday."This state of affairs exonerates the affected state from the duty to respect, vis-a-vis the aggressor, the general obligation to refrain from the use of force,‚Äù Naidu said at the Arria Formula meeting.The Arria Formula meetings are informal meetings of the Security Council, on ‚ÄòUpholding the collective security system of the UN Charter: the use of force in international law, non-state actors and legitimate self-defence‚Äô.He noted that Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001) have formally endorsed the view that self-defence is available to avert terrorist attacks such as in the case of the 9/11 attacks.On February 26, 2019, less than two weeks after 40 police personnel were killed in Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir in a terror attack perpetrated by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed on February 14, India had conducted a pinpoint and swift airstrike in a pre-dawn operation, described as "non-military" and "preemptive", against the terror group‚Äôs biggest training camp in Pakistan‚Äôs Balakot.Then Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale had said at the time that ‚Äúcredible intelligence was received that JeM was attempting another suicide terror attack in various parts of the country, and the fidayeen jihadis were being trained for this purpose. In the face of imminent danger, a preemptive strike became absolutely necessary.‚ÄùNaidu told the informal meeting that India has been subject to cross-border terrorist attacks perpetrated by non-state actors with the active complicity of ‚Äúanother host state‚Äù, a clear reference to Pakistan.He stressed that exercising self-defence is a nation‚Äôs primary right when a situation demands ‚Äúimmediate and proportionate action‚Äù and applies also to attacks by non-state actors.‚ÄúSome states are resorting to proxy war by supporting non-state actors such as terrorist groups to evade international censure. Such support to non-state actors has ranged from providing and equipping the terrorist groups with training, financing, intelligence and weapons to logistics and recruitment facilitation,‚Äù he said.India for decades has been subject to such proxy cross-border and relentless state-supported terrorist attacks from its neighbourhood, he said."Whether it is was the 1993 Mumbai bombings, or the random and indiscriminate firings of 26/11 which witnessed the launch of the phenomenon of lone-wolves or more recently, the cowardly attacks in Pathankot and Pulwama, the world has been witness to the fact that India has repeatedly been targeted by such non-state actors with the active complicity of another host State,‚Äù Naidu said.Naidu told the meeting that exercising self-defence is a primary right of States to be exercised when the situation is imminent and ‚Äúdemands necessary, immediate, and proportionate action‚Äù and that customary international law has long recognised the principles governing the use of force in self-defence.He noted that Article 51 of the UN Charter is not confined to ‚Äúself-defence‚Äù in response to attacks by states only."The right of self-defence applies also to attacks by non-state actors. In fact, the source of the attack, whether a state or a non-state actor, is irrelevant to the existence of the right of self-defence.‚ÄùNaidu stressed that India believes that instances where states have exercised the right of self-defense to attack non-state actors located in other states must be consistent with Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.But ‚Äúpreemptive actions taken to fight the menace of terrorism, even without the consent of the state hosting the non-state actors, meets this criterion because such actions are not of reprisal since their prime motive is for protecting the affected states‚Äô national integrity and sovereignty,‚Äù he said.Article 2(4) of the UN Charter states that ‚Äúall Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.‚ÄùNoting that Article 2(4) of the UN Charter requires that states refrain from the use of force, he said the drafting history of Article 51 of the UN Charter and the relevant San Francisco Conference Report of June 1945 that considered Article 2(4) of the UN Charter mentions that ‚Äúthe use of arms in legitimate self-defence remains admitted and unimpaired.‚ÄùHe added that Article 51 also explicitly acknowledges the pre-existing customary right of self-defence, as recognised by the International Court of Justice and the UN Security Council by stating that ‚Äúnothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence.‚Äù||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/would-be-compelled-to-take-pre-emptive-strike-when-confronted-by-imminent-attack-from-non-state-actor-operating-in-third-state-india-at-un-101614245521430.html

The developed world is under pressure as on one hand, they talk about supporting each other in the multilateral fight against Covid but on other hand, they're looking at protecting the interest of few companies only in terms of innovation or R&D‚Äù the minister said, as quoted by ANI.Calling world leaders to join India‚Äôs proposal, the minister tweeted on Thursday, ‚ÄúWorld cannot continue to engage in endless discussions while millions of lives & livelihoods are lost.

25-02-2021||India||NSA Doval led secret back-channels talks with Pak for months before DGMO pact||The joint statement issued by India and Pakistan on the ceasefire agreement between their top military commanders comes months after National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and his counterpart in Islamabad initiated back-channel conversations to ensure peace along the borders, people aware of the matter said.NSA Doval and Moeed W Yusuf, Prime Minister Imran Khan's special assistant on National Security Division and Strategic Policy Planning, have been in touch directly and via interlocutors from the intelligence community, a person familiar with the negotiations said.Moeed Yusuf initially appeared to confirm that the two countries had been making efforts behind the scenes at a diplomatic level. Later in a tweet, he, however, insisted that this was being handled by the DGMO and not him. Watch: India-Pak ceasefire: The Ajit Doval factor & Islamabad‚Äôs reactionThe joint statement is the first outcome of these conversations that included at least one face-to-face meeting in a third country, the person cited above said. He added that only a small group of top government leaders including Union home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh and external affairs minister S Jaishankar were aware of the details of the talks.Thursday‚Äôs joint statement, issued in New Delhi by the defence ministry, said the director generals of military operations (DGMO) of the two armies had agreed to ‚Äústrict observance of all agreements, understandings and cease firing along the Line of Control‚Äù from Wednesday midnight.The two top commanders also ‚Äúagreed to address each other‚Äôs core issues and concerns which have a propensity to disturb the peace and lead to violence‚Äù.To be sure, this is not the first time that the two top army officers have agreed to hold peace along the border. They signed off on a similar pact in 2018 when they pledged to strictly adhere to the terms of the ceasefire understanding of 2003 in letter and spirit.Officials said Thursday‚Äôs joint statement could be the first of the many steps that the two countries may take over the next few months to normalise relations, one step at a time.National security planners said there were five developments over the last month or so that indicated a nuanced shift.The first sign that the back-channel conversations were on track came earlier this month. Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa, in sharp contrast to his strident pitch against India after the Balakot air strike in 2019, on February 2 spoke of Islamabad‚Äôs commitment to what he called the ideal of mutual respect and peaceful co-existence and said: ‚Äúit is time to extend a hand of peace in all directions‚Äù.The next was the toned-down statements that emerged from Islamabad three days later, on February 5 which is observed by the Pakistani establishment as Kashmir Solidarity Day. ‚ÄúI found it unusual,‚Äù said a counter-terror official who wasn‚Äôt in the loop on the secret talks.Simultaneously, the official said there was a decline in the ceasefire violations along the border in Jammu and Kashmir in recent weeks.A top government functionary said Gen Bajwa‚Äôs much-publicised peace proposal, a decline in ceasefire violations and Pakistan‚Äôs toned-down rhetoric were linked to the quiet conversations that had been taking place.The fourth sign of a possible thaw in the relations was Pakistan steering clear of the Kashmir issue at last week‚Äôs Saarc meeting convened by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the Covid-19 pandemic. Dr Faisal Sultan, Special Assistant to Prime Minister Imran Khan on Health, restricted himself to the issue at hand, a sharp contrast to Pakistan‚Äôs previous attempt to raise the Kashmir issue at the Saarc meeting held in March last year.The fifth indicator, an official said, was New Delhi‚Äôs gesture to allow Imran Khan‚Äôs special aircraft to use the Indian airspace en route to Sri Lanka on Tuesday. PM Khan‚Äôs Pakistan Air Force jet flew along India‚Äôs coastline and over the Lakshadweep archipelago before landing in Colombo.The decision to allow the special flight to use its airspace was in marked contrast to Pakistan‚Äôs action in 2019, when Islamabad denied permission for the use of Pakistani airspace by three Indian VVIP flights.In September 2019, Pakistan didn‚Äôt permit the use of its airspace by a special flight carrying President Ram Nath Kovind to Europe, and another flight in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi travelled to US to attend the UN General Assembly session. Pakistani also didn‚Äôt allow the use of its airspace by another VVIP flight during Modi‚Äôs visit to Saudi Arabia in October 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nsa-doval-led-secret-back-channels-talks-with-pak-for-months-before-dgmo-pact-101614243251747.html

The Centre's response was filed in the form of an affidavit.Opposing same sex marriages, the Centre said, "While a marriage may be between two private individuals having a profound impact on their private lives, it cannot be relegated to merely a concept within the domain of privacy of an individual.""Living together as partners & having sexual relationship by same sex individual is not comparable with Indian family unit concept of a husband, wife & children which necessarily presuppose a biological man as 'husband', a biological woman as 'wife' and children born out of union," it further said in a affidavit.The Centre said that registration of marriage of same sex persons also results in violation of existing personal as well as codified law provisions."It is submitted that the Parliament has designed and framed the marriage laws in the country, which are governed by the personal laws/codified laws relatable to customs of various religious communities, to recognise only the union of a man and a woman to be capable of religious sanction, and thereby claim legal and statutory sanction. It is submitted that any interference with the same would cause a complete havoc with the delicate balance of personal laws in the country," the Centre said in the affidavit.The government also said that in same-sex marriage, it is neither possible nor feasible to term one as husband and the other one as wife. "Resultantly the statutory scheme of many statutory enactments will become otiose," it said.The Centre's affidavit was filed in response to the high court notice on a petition seeking legal recognition of same-sex marriages.The plea has contended that the Hindu Marriage Act does not distinguish between heterosexual and homosexual marriages if one were to go by how it is worded. It added the Act very clearly states that marriage can be solemnised between ‚Äúany two Hindus‚Äù.The petition was filed by members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex community in September last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/living-together-as-partners-not-same-as-indian-family-unit-centre-opposes-same-sex-marriage-in-delhi-hc-101614243565759.html
25-02-2021||India||India's healthcare workers balk at taking homegrown Covid-19 vaccine||India is struggling to convince its health and front-line workers to take a homegrown Covid-19 vaccine controversially approved without late-stage efficacy data, government data showed on Thursday, days ahead of a wider roll-out.The country has the world's second-highest number of Covid-19 infections after the United States, with cases recently surging as mask wearing declines and states have eased social distancing measures. A lack of confidence in a homegrown vaccine country could prevent India from meeting its target of vaccinating 300 million of its 1.35 billion people by August.India has vaccinated more than 10.5 million health and front-line workers since beginning its immunisation campaign on Jan. 16.But only 1.2 million, or about 11%, of them have taken COVAXIN, the locally developed vaccine from Bharat Biotech, while the remaining 9.4 million have used the vaccine licensed from AstraZeneca, according to the government's Co-Win online platform used to track the vaccination drive.India's federal government has so far ordered 10 million doses of COVAXIN and 21 million doses of the Oxford University/AstraZeneca shot. The government says it has received at least 5.5 million COVAXIN doses."It's all because of the initial discussion about how (COVAXIN) was only an experimental vaccine, how it had not completed the Phase-3 trial," said Dr Subhash Salunkhe, who advises the Maharashtra state government on vaccine strategy."These things created doubts in the minds of people, resulting in lesser acceptance. The availability is not a concern at this juncture."However, India's Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Tuesday attributed the lower uptake of COVAXIN to Bharat Biotech's limited production capacity compared to that of the Serum Institute of India, the world's biggest vaccine producer, which is making the AstraZeneca shot for low- and medium-income countries."We have found that in proportion to the quantity of vaccine available with us, (COVAXIN's) off-take is fairly satisfactory," told a news conference.His ministry did not respond to a request seeking comment on the latest figures showing that only about 12% of the ordered doses had been administered.Earlier this month, Chhattisgarh, an opposition-ruled state of 32 million people, told the federal government it would not use COVAXIN until its efficacy could be proven in an ongoing late-stage trial. Epidemiologist and public health experts have also criticised the COVAXIN approval as rushed.Bharat Biotech has said efficacy data from the trial on nearly 26,000 volunteers will be out soon. The company, along with India's drug regulator, says the vaccine is safe and effective based on early and intermediate studies.Bharat Biotech did not immediately comment on the lower uptake of its vaccine.Cases RisingThe government is trying to expedite vaccinations as cases have surged, especially in Maharashtra in the west and the southern state of Kerala, possibly as they have reopened suburban trains and schools.Mask-wearing and social distancing has also largely vanished, with big events like international cricket matches being played in front of tens of thousands of spectators hardly following any Covid-19 rules.India reported 16,738 new coronavirus infections in the past 24 hours, the highest daily jump in a month, health ministry data showed on Thursday, raising the total to 11.05 million.More than half of the new cases were in Maharashtra, India's richest and home to its financial capital Mumbai, which reported a record high of 8,807 cases on Wednesday.Deaths across the country rose by 138, also the highest in a month, taking the total to 156,705.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-healthcare-workers-balk-at-taking-homegrown-covid-19-vaccine-101614242736582.html
25-02-2021||India||'Needed level playing field': Govt announces new online media rules||Union ministers Ravi Shankar Prasad and Prakash Javadekar on Thursday released the guidelines of new rules to regulate digital content on social media to curb the misuse of the platforms. "Social media is welcome to do business India," Prasad said as he began laying out the guidelines. The government welcomes criticism of the government and the right to dissent, but it is very important that the users must be given a forum to raise their grievance against the abuse and misuse of social media, he said."Concerns have been raised over the years about rampant abuse of social media... the ministry had widespread consultations and we prepared a draft in December 2018. There'll be two categories - intermediary which can be social media intermediary and significant social media intermediary," Prasad said during the briefing.As per the new guidelines, social media platforms are required to disclose the first originator of mischievous tweet or message if they are asked by the government, the information and technology minister announced. They are also required to submit a compliance report every month."This should be only in relation to sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the state, public order, relations with foreign states, or rape, sexually explicit content etc," he also said.The social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter are also ordered to have to have a grievance redressal mechanism under which they are required to name a grievance officer who shall register the grievance within 24 hours and disposal in 15 days.Social media platforms are also required to have provision for voluntary verification of users.The laws made for social media will come into effect in the next three months, Prasad also said. "The government has given three months of window to the social media companies to improve their mechanism," he added.For OTT platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Hotsar, the union minister announced that they will have to have a self-regulating body which "will be headed by a retired Supreme Court or high court judge or very eminent person in this category."An oversight mechanism will also be set up at the government level to deal with case that required immediate action.The new guidelines also mandates self-classification of content on all OTT platforms, Javadekar also said. The categories will be 13+, 16+ and A (Adult) categories. "There has to be a mechanism of parental lock and ensuring compliance that children don't see that," he also said during the briefing.Until now, the online news publishers, social media platforms and OTT streaming services were not regulated under the Information and Broadcasting ministry. It was brought under the its ambit last year after the government received several complaints regarding fake news and explicit shows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-releases-guidelines-to-regulate-digital-content-on-social-media-101614243250700.html

25-02-2021||India||Chhattisgarh: Allegations cloud alleged suicide of surrendered woman ‚ÄòMaoist‚Äô||Tribal activist Soni Sori and a group of villagers in Chhattisgarh‚Äôs Dantewada claimed that the 20-year old girl, who allegedly died by suicide on Tuesday a few days after her purported surrender, was not a Maoist and was forced to surrender, raising questions over the police‚Äôs claim in the matter. The police, however, dismissed the allegations as a campaign to discredit the special surrender drive launched in the Maoist-infested district.Sori further alleged that the sarpanch and others from the girl‚Äôs village said there were no ligature marks on Kawasi‚Äôs neck, suggesting they doubted the police's version that she died by hanging.‚ÄúKumari Jogi, a Maoist, was nabbed by the police from the village along with one another innocent woman. The duo were brought to the district headquarters and after interrogation, police forced them to surrender. Police claimed that the deceased was a member of CNM, which is not true‚Ä¶ Forceful surrender took place due to which she was not happy,‚Äù said Soni Sori.On Tuesday, Dantewada police claimed Kawasi was a Maoist cadre, who surrendered with five others on February 19 and died by suicide a few days later on February 23. She was a resident of Gudse village under Katekalyan police station in the district. As per the police, Kawasi was a member of Chetna Natya Mandli (CNM) - a cultural wing of the Maoists and had approached police on February 18 along with a senior woman Maoist cadre, Kumari Jogi (36), a member of Katekalyan area committee of the banned group, expressing their willingness to surrender.Sori further claimed that on Tuesday, village sarpanch and others came to meet Kawasi but the police did not let them.‚ÄúThe villagers came on Tuesday to meet the woman since they came to know that she was not happy. The police told them that interrogation was going on but she died by suicide. Some people, who saw the body on Tuesday, claimed there was no mark on her neck‚Ä¶ We believe that someone killed her. A probe should be ordered,‚Äù Sori continued.Dantewada superintendent of police (SP) Abhishek Pallava said the deceased surrendered in front of the media and her interrogation report as well as the statement of Jogi along with others she worked with clearly mentions that she was working as a CNM member for the past six months.‚ÄúWhen villagers came to meet her on February 21, she clearly said she did not want to go back to her village. She wanted to work with the police along with Jogi,‚Äù Pallava said, adding, as per the surrender policy, whoever accepts working as a Maoist during the interrogation, can surrender.As far as allegation of murder was concerned, a detailed post-mortem was being done by a team of doctors including a forensic expert and it was videographed, he said.‚ÄúStatements of surrendered cadres and the police personnel present lead to the conclusion of suicide. There is no motive for murder in the case. A magisterial inquiry has already been ordered by the collector of Dantewada. This campaign is being done on the behest of the Maoists to defame the ‚ÄòLon Varatu‚Äô campaign. As per initial probe, it seems the Maoists were holding meetings in Katekalyan area, forcing families and public representatives to go to Dantewada and bring surrendered cadres back to their fold,‚Äù said the SP.Also Read:2 security personnel killed in Chhattisgarh‚Äôs Narayanpur in Maoist attacksSoni, however, questioned the Lone Varatu campaign and alleged fake and forceful surrenders were taking place under the campaign.‚ÄúThe tribals of Dantewada are in fear because of the Lone Varratu because of forced surrenders. This should be stopped,‚Äù Soni alleged.‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need forced surrenders since 316 Maoists have laid down arms including 82 who had rewards on their heads. All surrendered cadres are presented before the media in a transparent manner. Surrender and rehabilitation is a much better option than being jailed for years together,‚Äù the SP said, responding to the allegations.Lon Varratu in local Gondi language means Return Home. Maoists in about 50 hypersensitive villages are being encouraged by Dantewada administration to surrender under this programme, police claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-allegations-cloud-alleged-suicide-of-surrendered-woman-maoist-101614240338633.html

A 14.2 kg LPG cylinder will now cost ‚Çπ794 in the national capital in contrast to the previous price of ‚Çπ769.This rise in the prices of the LPG gas cylinders comes for the third time this month. Earlier, the cost of the domestic gas cylinders was increased by ‚Çπ25 on February 4 and then by ‚Çπ50 on February 15.The new price of the LPG gas cylinders in Kolkata is now ‚Çπ820, increased from ‚Çπ795.

The Modi government has been immensely criticised for not reducing the high taxes levied on the fuel that is driving the retail cost to touch peaks as the global crude oil rates rebound.The government had increased the taxes on fuel when the global crude oil rates had plunged to a two-decade low due to the economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic in April last year.

25-02-2021||India||Covid-19 samples from 8 Maharashtra districts sent for testing of new mutations||As cases of Covid-19 surge in Maharashtra, samples from about eight districts have been sent to laboratories across the country, including the National Institute of Virology and National Center for Disease Control, to find out if any new variant is behind the increasing number of cases.Speaking to ANI, the advisor to the state for Covid control Dr Subhash Salunke said, "The ICMR has not been able to clearly come out whether is there any new mutant virus or not, that study is being done at NIV and NCDC and other few laboratories in the country, 8 districts of Maharashtra have already sent the required number of 100 samples per district. Results of these studies will be available to us maximum by the end of this week or maybe in another 8 to 10 days. After that, we will be able to confidently state whether the mutation has taken place, if the indigenous strain has mutated and if it is there then what type of mutation it is etc."The transmission of cases has increased rapidly in some districts of the Vidarbha region. Districts such as Amravati have been reporting over 20 per cent positivity rate in the last few days."Our finding shows that transmission rate has increased, in some cases the whole locality or a family is affected. Even last time when cases were at the peak we could not see such a trend even in Pune or Mumbai, but we could see this picture in Amravati or Yavatmal this time. The positivity rate in Amravati and surrounding areas has gone up to 20% to 25% hence one thing is clear that something is wrong with the virus because the behaviour of the people is the same everywhere in every district. This change is the clear indication that some changes in the virus are there but exact details of the changes will be clear once we get the scientific data after study." said Dr Salunke.Earlier samples tested at BJ Medical college laboratory in Pune have shown that the UK and Africa strain are not the reason behind the sudden surge of cases in parts of Maharashtra, however, scientists at multiple laboratories across the country are also working to find out if any indigenous variant of the virus is behind the spike.Dr Salunke also cautioned the authorities about the possible spread of this virus to other states if it is not controlled in time."It is also showing concentrated spur in some of the areas like Vidarbha region and now it is slowly getting transmitted to other districts such as Pune and even Mumbai. If we don't control it right now it may spread to other states because the potential is there," Dr Salunke said.However, he said that proper treatment is available to patients and added that the present treatment strategy is working well.He also added that clinicians across the country have treated lakhs of patients last year and are clear about the treatment for patients.Dr Subhash Salunkhe also chairs the Maharashtra Communicable Diseases Prevention and Control Technical Committee. He was the former director general of health services, Maharashtra and WHO chief of Indonesia.

Also Read | Facebook now says it‚Äôs not obligated to appear before Parliamentary panelsIndian Parliament secretariat has about 2,500 officials. They only buy cloth for their uniform from the secretariat as it matches the prescribed colour and style. The strict dress code of Lok Sabha officials has seen several changes over the years. Its biggest transformation took place in 2019, leading to better quality of uniforms this year. Earlier, Lok Sabha officials would buy cloth once in two years, which they would get stitched by any of the 4-5 Delhi tailors empanelled with the secretariat. Now, women officers get a uniform allowance of up to ‚Çπ17,000 and men get up to ‚Çπ16,000, depending on the nature of their jobs and ranks. Reporting branch, table office and security service officials, drivers and chamber attendants are eligible for this uniform allowance. ‚ÄúThese branches deal with MPs and other visitors. They are the face of the Parliament secretariat in public and so, they have a set uniform that adds to the dignity of Indian Parliament,‚Äù said a senior official. The benefit of this allowance system, several officers pointed out, is that officials can buy their new uniforms whenever they want, instead of getting it every two years. Also, they are free to buy clothes, which must adhere to the fixed colour patterns, of better quality. The women officers wear a fixed patterned saree, while men can wear a range of safari suits‚Äîblue, fawn, Prussian blue, charcoal‚Äîdepending on the section they work in. In winter, men and women have to wear blazers and buttoned up coats. While the table office handles the entire range of paperwork for the House, receiving notices for debates, introduction of Bills or sorting questions for the Question Hour, Parliament security is a special branch handling all security aspects of the estate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fashion-forward-parliament-staff-get-great-deals-on-clothes-accessories-101614236812308.html

Eight to nine state transport unions, including the Metropolitan Transport Corporation, have been observing the strike that has affected commuters in the state.Bus services in the southern state are running with a few employees. Around 50 per cent of the buses are operating with temporary drivers and Anna Trade Union drivers.The strike by the transport unions has been reported to involve over one lakh transport employees affecting over 80 per cent of the bus services. The state has around 21,000 government buses.The DMK has extended support to the strike.

It is the same situation in the Depsang bulge area and across the Daulet Beg Oldi sector even as the military commanders on both sides work towards a roadmap to restore status quo ante on East Ladakh LAC.However, the concern of the national security planners is the rapid infrastructure upgrades that the PLA is undertaking across Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh. There is evidence to show increased troop and equipment sheds and better road communication across Naku La in north Sikkim. The PLA simultaneously transgressed into the Naku La sector in May 2020 with both armies engaging in fisticuffs. The PLA created Naku La as a friction point around six years ago with the intention to convey that while Beijing recognises Sikkim as part of Indian territory, the border still is unresolved.The other area of concern is the rapid military-infra upgrade across the Upper Subansiri district in Arunachal Pradesh with the PLA constructing at least three new bridges, a new 66-kilometre road and troop sheds in the area.‚ÄúIt is a matter of concern as it shows that the PLA is focused on the LAC despite disengaging from Pangong Tso. It clearly shows that the Indian Army has to maintain vigil all along the unsettled border including the central sector across Uttarakhand,‚Äù said a senior official.Although New Delhi and Beijing have continued discreet conversations between top officials on both sides, Indian diplomats and security officials believe that India will have to prepare strategies to deal with both aggressive and friendly China and cannot afford to let the guard down. China continues to play behind scenes in Nepal, Myanmar and Bangladesh after virtually snaring Pakistan and Sri Lanka in its debt trap under the garb of benign connectivity, a security official said.The Chinese game plan goes beyond accessing Indian Ocean with security ramifications for Indian Navy by providing long sea legs to adversaries of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-india-china-work-on-ladakh-concerns-over-infra-push-across-sikkim-arunachal-101614228211456.html

Additional sessions judge Dharemendar Rana passed the order after the public prosecutor submitted that no coercive action will be taken against Pune-based Muluk, an engineer by profession.Also Read | Toolkit case: Shantanu Muluk‚Äôs bail plea hearing todayArguing for the Delhi Police, which is conducting an investigation into the case, public prosecutor Irfan Ahmed informed the bench that Muluk‚Äôs replies to it in connection with the case were inconsistent and full of contradictions. The public prosecutor further submitted in the court that the police would need seven days to file a detailed reply.Following this, judge Rana directed that no coercive action should be taken against Muluk, extending his interim protection till March 9. Earlier, on Wednesday, the court had sought the police‚Äôs response on the anticipatory bail plea filed by Muluk and posted arguments on it for Thursday.On February 16, the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay High Court had granted transit anticipatory bail to him for 10 days. Nikita Jacob, another accused in the case, too, has already been granted three-week transit anticipatory bail by the High Court. On Tuesday, Disha Ravi, the only accused to be arrested in this case thus far, was granted bail by Additional sessions judge Rana.Ravi was arrested on February 13 and sent to five-day police custody. She was then sent to three and one-day judicial custody respectively, before finally getting bail.The controversy dates back to earlier this month, when international climate activist Great Thunberg tweeted a 'toolkit' over the ongoing farmers‚Äô protest in India. The Delhi Police then filed an FIR against ‚Äòunknown‚Äô persons, later naming Ravi, Muluk and Jacob as the three main accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/toolkit-case-shantanu-muluk-gets-interim-protection-from-arrest-till-march-9-101614231740159.html

While no fuel price rise has been reported on Thursday, petrol price in Delhi is ‚Çπ90.93 per litre and diesel costs ‚Çπ81.32 per litre, as per goods returns.The increase in the prices of the fuel primarily depends on the crude oil prices in the international market as India is dependent on import 85 per cent of its crude oil needs.The last hike in the prices of petrol and diesel was on Tuesday when the fuels prices rose by ‚Çπ35 litre each.Fuel prices in the country had witnessed a rise consecutively for twelve days before a two-day pause on February 21 and 22.Here is how much petrol and diesel cost as of Thursday in different cities of India:In Kolkata, the price of petrol is ‚Çπ91.12, Mumbai ‚Çπ97.34, Chennai ‚Çπ92.97, Bengaluru ‚Çπ93.98, Bhubaneswar ‚Çπ91.50, Chandigarh ‚Çπ87.50, Hyderabad ‚Çπ94.54, Jaipur ‚Çπ97.96, Trivandrum ‚Çπ92.65.Diesel price in Kolkata is ‚Çπ84.20, Mumbai ‚Çπ88.44, Chennai ‚Çπ86.37, Bengaluru ‚Çπ86.21, Bhubaneswar ‚Çπ88.47, Chandigarh ‚Çπ81.02, Hyderabad ‚Çπ88.69, Jaipur ‚Çπ90.27, Trivandrum ‚Çπ87.22.Also Read | Tests on kids: Expert panel asks Bharat Biotech to submit Covaxin efficacy data firstThe prices of petrol and diesel per litre cost different in different cities across India due to the VAT (local taxes) and freight levied. Retail pump prices are thus different from state to state.The government had increased the taxes on petrol and diesel when the international oil rates had plummeted to a two-decade low last year, to benefit through the raised taxes and low oil price. However, the tax rates are still unchanged when the global rates have recovered taking the fuel prices to record highs.About 60 per cent of the retail selling price of petrol is central and state taxes, while for diesel these taxes make up for 54 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petrol-costs-rs-90-93-diesel-rs-81-32-in-delhi-check-fuel-prices-in-different-states-101614227620471.html

The train will ply from NJP on Thursdays and Fridays and from Dhaka on Fridays and Tuesdays.Once the passenger train service on the Haldibari-Chilahati route is resumed, many other trains between North Bengal and Kolkata could avoid detours, taking this route instead. Islam said the Bangladesh government wanted to run the train between Siliguri, North Bengal‚Äôs biggest town, and Dhaka. ‚ÄúBut Siliguri didn‚Äôt have the required infrastructure, so it had to be NJP instead,‚Äù he said. NJP has the biggest railway station in North Bengal and is just 6km away from Siliguri. Meanwhile, the development brings hope for tour operators.

Here is all you need to know about it:‚Ä¢The second phase of the world‚Äôs largest vaccination drive will start from Monday in which anybody above 60 and 45 plus with co-morbidities can be vaccinated at 10,000 government medical facilities and over 20,000 private hospitals.‚Ä¢ This comes as the country is on the brink of a second wave of infections.‚Ä¢ The doses at the government centres will be free. ‚Ä¢ Private hospitals will be allowed to charge for them, but the rate will be fixed and announced by the government. ‚Ä¢ This is the first time the private sector will be actively involved in administering vaccines, and doses will be available to eligible people who are willing to pay.Also Read | New Covid-19 variant, B.1.526, spotted in New York City‚Ä¢ Most of the details of the protocols are yet to be finalised.‚Ä¢ The sign-ups are initially expected to be allowed through the Aarogya Setu mobile application, which was launched last year as a digital contact tracing tool.‚Ä¢ Those eligible will be asked to download the Aarogya Setu app. There will be an option under the Co-WIN section where they can register and book an appointment for vaccination.‚Ä¢ Once registered, people may also be able to walk in to get their doses, as is the case at present for those eligible at the moment.‚Ä¢ For those with comorbidities, the government is expected to release a list of qualifying diseases.‚Ä¢ Gradually, there may also be helplines, an interactive voice response system option for those with basic phones, and also a web portal for registration.‚Ä¢ At vaccination sites, those seeking a dose will need to prove their identity by showing a government-issued identity card.‚Ä¢ India launched the vaccination campaign on January 16‚Ä¢ A little over 11 million people have since received at least one dose. ‚Ä¢ India has so far immunised 1% of the population, while Israel 85%, and the US 23%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-for-60-above-45-with-co-morbidities-from-march-1-key-points-101614223431004.html

Madhya Pradesh too has witnessed a small spike and is among those states that have been flagged by the Centre as worrying.Since the state shares border with Maharashtra and an influx of road travellers from Maharashtra is likely during Mahashivratri, the government has made the screening of these travellers mandatory at border points.But apart from these preventive measures, there will be no fresh lockdown, the chief minister has said.Upcoming fairs in Pachmarhi, Betul, Chhindwara, Barwani and the districts bordering Maharashtra have been postponed.On Wednesday, Madhya Pradesh reported 344 fresh Covid-19 cases, taking the total tally to 2,60,313. It is one of the states that have reported more than 100 average daily new cases in the past week.In 2020, Madhya Pradesh became one of the hotspots of the infection which was partially attributed to the political upheaval at that time in the state. As on Wednesday, Indore has 740 active cases and Bhopal has 496 active Covid-19 cases.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-lockdown-shivraj-singh-chouhan-assures-workers-amid-covid-19-spike-101614222534800.html

The state finance department said the tax rate for diesel has been reduced from ‚Çπ11.08 to ‚Çπ10.51 per liter or 17.50% to 16.50% per liter (whichever is higher) while the tax on petrol and other motor spirits has been reduced from ‚Çπ18.26 to ‚Çπ16.04 per liter or 29.80% to 25% per litre (whichever is higher). The reduction in fuel tax came into effect from February 22.The price of petrol which was retailing at around ‚Çπ93.48 and diesel at ‚Çπ84.35 on February 21 in the state capital Kohima, before the tax cut, is being retailed at ‚Çπ90.41 and ‚Çπ83.99 on Wednesday respectively.The prices of petrol and diesel have been on the rise for the last month due to increasing prices of crude oil in the international market on the back of rising demand and hope after the launch of coronavirus vaccines in several countries. Prices of petrol and diesel across the country are market-determined and attract uniform central excise duty, but their prices differ from state to state because of the wide variations in the local levies or value-added tax. The Central government levies ‚Çπ32.98 per litre of excise duty on petrol and ‚Çπ31.83 a litre on diesel. Central and state taxes make up for over 61% of the retail selling price of petrol and about 56% of diesel in most states.Also Read: 'Nagaland government wrongly used funds belonging to employees': CAG reportRising fuel prices have become a huge political issue in the country with the opposition targeting the government for not reducing Central taxes to bring relief to the common man. However, the Central government has termed the issue to be vexed given the need to generate revenues to meet budgetary targets after the slump due to coronavirus induced slowdown in the economy.In some states, the price of petrol crossed ‚Çπ100 a litre due the current streak of rise in prices. The decision of the Nagaland government to cut fuel rates follows similar reductions in neighbouring states- Assam and Meghalaya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagaland-cuts-taxes-on-petrol-and-diesel-fuel-prices-come-down-101614219207448.html
25-02-2021||NA||Highlights: Tikait had lauded farm laws, says Union minister Kailash Choudhary||The farmers‚Äô protest entered its third month on Thursday. The protest led by farmers‚Äô unions representatives began on November 25 after several farmers from across Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh began their march towards the Capital following the passage of the Farmers‚Äô Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 during the monsoon session in September.Farmers have camped across Delhi‚Äôs border since then demanding a total repeal of the three laws. After 12 rounds of discussions with the Centre, the deadlock still remains. The protests also took a violent turn during a planned rally on January 26 which led to injuries to more than 300 Delhi Police officials. One farmer also died during the tractor rally on that day. Miscreants had deviated from the agreed path of the protests leading to a scuffle with farmers. The protests were also marred after Deep Sidhu and gangster-turned-activist Lakha Sidhana gave provocative speeches and led to widespread destruction of public property at the Red Fort.Farmer leader Rakesh Tikait earlier on Wednesday said that the farmers‚Äô unions will take out a tractor rally demanding a total repeal of the laws. He said that 40 lakh tractors will join the protests.

The Cabinet cleared the decision on Wednesday and has allowed private entities to be part of this phase as the Centre is stepping up vaccination amid apprehension of a resurgence of Covid-19 cases across India.The government is yet to announce the price of the vaccine shots as people will have to pay for the vaccines if they get inoculated at private hospitals. What will be considered as co-morbidities will also be decided by the ministry and announced before March 1.How to register for 2nd phase vaccination> In the first phase, where healthcare workers and frontline workers have been vaccinated, the government sourced their data from authorities concerned. The government also has data of senior citizens based on electoral rolls. But there will be an option for self-registration.> The option for self-registration will not be limited to online channels as many may not be well-versed with using apps. Apart from Co-WIN, Aarogya Setu, there will be registration windows open in hospitals and Common Service Centres. There will be no charge for registration.Paid shots from March 1 as India expands Covid-19 vaccine drive> A new version of the Co-WIN app will be launched soon, where common people will be able to log in and register for vaccination. Now only vaccinators can log in and those who have been already vaccinated can download their certificates by giving reference ID.> A photo ID will be required to register for those above 60 years of age. For co-morbidity issues, a medical certificate will also be required.> The government may issue a form with co-morbidity details mentioned which a prospective beneficiary will have to fill and get signed by a doctor after an examination. These documents will have to be produced during vaccination.> Both booked and open slots will be there for this phase of vaccination.While the beneficiaries will be able to choose their vaccine site and time, there will be no choice between Covishield, Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine, developed in India by Pune's Serum Institute, and Bharat Biotech's Covaxin. Also, people above 50 years with no co-morbidity issues will have to wait for their vaccine shots as they are likely to be covered in the next phase.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccination-for-senior-citizens-and-45-with-co-morbidities-how-to-register-101614218093230.html

Two among those six injured are in serious condition.SDPI had taken out a rally on Wednesday in Alappuzha‚Äôs Wayalar, which was deemed provocative by the RSS workers and led to clashes between both groups leading to the death of a 22-year-old RSS worker, R Nandu. The RSS worker was stabbed to death during the clashes.Police have held six SDPI workers with connection to the murder. Police presence in Wayalar has been increased in the district in the wake of the violence. Following the death of the RSS worker, the group has called for a district-wide strike on Thursday. The RSS has also asked its workers to exercise maximum restraint and not give into provocation. The SDPI, youth wing of Popular Front of India (PFI), has been involved in several clashes in the past. The Popular Front of India has been involved in clashes and political murders since its inception. The outfit was formed in 2006 after three Muslim organizations floated after the Babri Masjid demolition in 1992 - the National Development Front of Kerala, Karnataka Forum for Dignity and Manitha Neethi Pasari of Tamil Nadu merged.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) and other intelligence agencies say that the group has seen a phenomenal rise, according to a HT report. The central agency after finding out the first Islamic State (IS) module in Kerala found that some of those arrested belonged to PFI. The group claims that it is a neo-social movement committed to empower people belonging to the minority communities, Dalits and other weaker sections of the society.(with inputs from Ramesh Babu)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rss-worker-stabbed-to-death-in-kerala-during-sdpi-rally-101614215499989.html
25-02-2021||India||‚ÄòDifferences will arise if laws are steamrolled‚Äô: Mallikarjun Kharge||The newly appointed Leader of Opposition (LoP) in the Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge of the Congress, brings nearly half a century of legislative experience to the post. He spoke to Vinod Sharma on a range of issues. Edited excerpts:You were only half-LoP in the Lok Sabha from 2014 to 2019 as the Congress lacked the numbers to be the recognised Opposition. By that measure, your LoP status in the Rajya Sabha seems a promotion.There‚Äôs nothing like half a leader. I led a national party which got over 10 crore votes in the general elections. The speaker could have suspended the rule requiring 10% of the House strength to be the recognised Opposition. She (Sumitra Mahajan) did not, nor did the government. Not having the logistical support that‚Äôs officially provided to the LoP was no handicap. My party and my leader Sonia Gandhi lent me that support.The foremost requirement in the role I played was to be a strong Opposition voice on matters that impacted the people, especially the poor, the farmers, and the working class. They (the treasury benches) would insult us by pointing to our numerical weakness. They forgot that they had just two MPs after the 1984 polls. At that time, the Congress did not insult a great leader like Atal Bihari Vajpayee. My party‚Äôs frugal strength never weighed me down. The Rajya Sabha position is no elevation. I‚Äôm only a recognised LoP. When Ghulam Nabi Azad took over, we had over 70 members. Today our army is reduced; we have to fight with a bench strength of 36 but there will be no let-up in our battle for the people‚Äôs welfare.The Congress‚Äôs Rajya Sabha construct is top-heavy. Its 36 MPs include several frontline leaders. Could there be problems bringing on the same page the likes of Manmohan Singh, AK Antony, P Chidambaram, Anand Sharma, Digvijaya Singh, Ambika Soni, Kapil Sibal, Abhishek Singhvi, Jairam Ramesh and KC Venugopal?They‚Äôre experienced, intelligent people constituting the cream of our party. I‚Äôve known them for long, as I joined the Congress after the 1969 split. I‚Äôll seek their advice. My worry is the allocation of time for important debates the ruling side tends to curtail.The Congress took divergent stands in the two Houses in the debate on the motion of thanks on the President‚Äôs address. The Rajya Sabha debated while there was a logjam in the other House, bringing forth the lack of coordination between the party‚Äôs legislative wings.Such decisions get driven by situations in the Houses. Divergence could be as much on account of government‚Äôs divergent approach in the Lok Sabha [where it has a big majority], and the Upper House where the numbers are relatively balanced. Our legislative wings were working together and will continue to do so.The late Ananth Kumar was the parliamentary affairs minister when you were in Lok Sabha. Even the incumbent, Pralhad Joshi, is from your state of Karnataka. Will the coincidence help?We might be from the same state but we‚Äôve ideological differences. We‚Äôll cooperate, but it‚Äôs the government‚Äôs responsibility to take all Opposition parties along ‚Äî convincingly and not through bulldozer tactics ‚Äî for the smooth conduct of Parliament.Your predecessor Ghulam Nabi Azad had cordial working relations with Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. How do you rate your personal equation with them?Naidu is from Andhra but has been a Rajya Sabha member from Karnataka. I‚Äôve known him well. Now he‚Äôs the vice-president and chairperson of our House. We respect the position he holds, and assure him of our support...we expect him to recognise the Opposition‚Äôs right to raise and debate issues. As for the PM, he‚Äôs de jure the leader of the Lok Sabha but de facto the leader of both houses. We respect the PM, but differences will arise if laws are steamrolled ‚Äî as was the case with labour reforms and the farm legislation. We won‚Äôt accept that the party that has the majority can do anything.What was your experience when you and the PM were members of committees that appointed chiefs of the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Central Vigilance Commission?The majority view prevailed. I gave dissenting notes (as was the case when an interim CBI director was appointed). They called me a dissenting leader. But reasoned dissent is the Opposition‚Äôs prerogative. The problem arose because the PM didn‚Äôt consider the other view. Democracy provides for differing perceptions without prejudice or vengeance.Certain legislation being brought as money bills could be a sticking point in the second half of the Budget session. Your colleagues have urged the Lok Sabha Speaker to ensure bicameral scrutiny of privatisation proposals....Our job is to scrutinise the bills passed by the Lower House. That ensures robust law-making and safeguards against judicial intervention. We‚Äôll discuss the matter in our party and take a stand. The government‚Äôs policy to dismantle and not repair public sector undertakings will impact the common man and the job quotas for the SCs/STs/OBCs. Even profitable PSUs are being shut. That will kill reserved employment, while the private sector which gets lakhs of crores of rupees written off as NPAs is loath to offer opportunities to the weaker sections. That‚Äôs why the Rajya Sabha must scrutinise such laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/differences-will-arise-if-laws-are-steamrolled-mallikarjun-kharge-101614215864486.html
25-02-2021||India||Citing poor infra, SC seeks legislative impact study on consumer law||Concerned over massive vacancies and severe deficiency in the infrastructure across consumer courts in the country, the Supreme Court has asked the Central government whether a ‚Äúlegislative impact study‚Äù was carried out before a new consumer protection law was notified in July 2020.An SC bench, headed by justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, directed the government to place the said study before the court to indicate if social, economic and institutional impacts were taken into account prior to replacing the 1986 consumer protection law with the 2019 law, which was brought into force in July 2020.The bench, which also included justice Hemant Gupta, underlined that the new law widened the meaning of ‚Äúconsumer‚Äù allowing them to file a complaint from his place of residence; brought e-commerce platforms within the fold of the law; provided for time-bound redressal; made celebrity-endorsers also liable and enhanced the monetary jurisdiction of the consumer courts at all levels.Under the 2019 law, a district forum can decide a consumer dispute up to ‚Çπ1 crore as against ‚Çπ20 lakh under the old law. Similarly, pecuniary jurisdiction of state commission has been enhanced from ‚Çπ1 crore to ‚Çπ10 crore, and a national commission can now decide disputes over and above ‚Çπ10 crore.Citing these radical changes, the bench said: ‚ÄúThe new act expands the jurisdiction of the consumer forums to many new areas and thus, logically a legislative impact study ought to have been completed, keeping in mind the litigation, which will shift in the subjects added to the jurisdiction of the consumer tribunals. There is also a shifting of pecuniary jurisdiction. This would also result in transfer of a large number of cases between forums. Thus, the legislative impact study ought to have taken this into consideration as to what are the cases which are likely to be shifted.‚ÄùNoting that more than 600 vacancies existed across the consumer courts, the court emphasised that these aspects should have formed a part of the ‚Äúlegislative impact study‚Äù to ascertain the volume of cases the consumer courts at different levels will be burdened with not only now but in the reasonable time in the future.‚ÄúThere should have been analysis, both at the state level and at the national level of the number of fora which are required to deal with the increase in the financial jurisdiction and the expanded legal area of jurisdiction,‚Äù maintained the bench, as it took up suo motu (on its own) case on the alleged ‚Äúinaction of the government‚Äù in appointing members of the consumer courts and providing adequate infrastructure.The bench heard senior counsel Gopal Shankarnarayan and advocate Aditya Narayan as amicus curiae, who assisted the court, and additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi, representing the government, when it regretted that even though the national consumer commission had six vacancies, the matter was with the Appointment Committee of Cabinet (ACC) since July 2020 without any decision on fresh appointments.Also Read: No extra chance for taking UPSC exam: Supreme Court‚ÄúThis is hardly expected at the apex level, as it creates a cascading effect down, which does not speak well of the institution. We expect due care to be taken in this behalf so that at least these vacancies are filled up by the time we take up these proceedings on the next date,‚Äù rued the court, fixing April 12 as the next date.The court also directed chief secretaries of all the state governments to send the latest vacancy positions to the national commission for uploading it on the website and also notify the new rules for appointments in the consumer courts, besides filing their reports on the existing infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/citing-poor-infra-sc-seeks-legislative-impact-study-on-consumer-law-101614215481701.html
25-02-2021||India||Assam declared ‚Äòdisturbed area‚Äô for six months||Ahead of the assembly elections, Assam governor Jagdish Mukhi declared the entire state as ‚ÄòDisturbed Area‚Äô for six months starting February 27.The state is scheduled to go to polls in April-May.‚ÄúAs per powers conferred under Section 3 of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958, the Governor of Assam has declared the entire state of Assam as ‚Äòdisturbed area‚Äô up to six months beyond February 27, 2021, unless withdrawn earlier,‚Äù a release issued by the state government stated.The fresh order is an extension of a similar move on August 28 last year, when the state was declared a ‚ÄòDisturbed Area‚Äô for six months. There is no official comment yet on the reason behind the extension.However, government officials familiar with the matter cited attacks on security forces in the northeast and recovery of large amounts of arms and ammunition from several parts of Assam as a reason for the move.On Tuesday, 1,040 militants belonging to five different rebel outfits from Karbi Anglong region of the state had laid down arms in front of chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-declared-disturbed-area-for-six-months-101614214576479.html
25-02-2021||India||Punjab ‚Äòshamelessly‚Äô backing Mukhtar Ansari: UP govt in Supreme Court||The Uttar Pradesh government accused the Punjab government in the Supreme Court on Wednesday of ‚Äúshamelessly‚Äù supporting criminal-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari after repeated requests to transfer him from Punjab‚Äôs Ropar Jail to Banda Jail in UP was turned down by jail authorities citing Ansari‚Äôs poor health.When the apex court took up the petition by the UP government seeking Ansari‚Äôs transfer out of Punjab, an adjournment request was made by senior advocate Dushyant Dave appearing for the Punjab government.The bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and RS Reddy posted the matter to Tuesday. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appearing for the UP government remarked, ‚ÄúThe state (Punjab) seems to be more concerned than the accused.‚Äù At this, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi who appeared for Ansari shared a light moment by saying, ‚ÄúI am just a small fly. Two states are fighting over me.‚ÄùMehta replied, ‚ÄúYou are such a powerful fly that one state is shamelessly coming to your support.‚Äù Rohatgi wittingly added, ‚ÄúIf that is so, why don‚Äôt you make me the chief minister‚Äù, at which Mehta quipped, ‚ÄúPossibly, that‚Äôs what the state is trying to do.‚ÄùThe banter between the lawyers did not engage the court‚Äôs attention. However, documents filed by UP before the court spelt out the bitterness between the two states over being denied the custody of Ansari, who is a sitting member of the UP Legislative Assembly and has 10 cases ranging from murder, extortion, cheating and fraud to those under the Gangster Act against him in the state.‚ÄúI am appalled (by their statement). May God forgive them for what they are saying! I will like to give reverence to pendency of the matter before a court of law and make no comment,‚Äù Punjab advocate general Atul Nanda said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-shamelessly-backing-mukhtar-ansari-up-govt-in-supreme-court-101614213574150.html
25-02-2021||India||Hyderabad teen who made ‚Äòfalse‚Äô rape bid claim dies by suicide: Police||A 19-year-old pharmacy student, who police allege faked an abduction and rape attempt about two weeks ago, died by suicide on Wednesday, officials in Telangana said.The young woman was found unconscious at her uncle‚Äôs residence on the outskirts of Hyderabad, police said.Around 10:45 am, the woman was rushed to a government hospital, where she was declared dead on arrival.‚ÄúAccording to family members, she was in a state of depression and consumed sleeping pills in excess,‚Äù Ghatkesar police inspector N Chandra Babu said.A case of suspicious death has been registered and an investigation is on. Family members told police that it was her second attempt to kill herself in the past 24 hours, according to a police official who did not want to be named.‚ÄúPrima facie, it appears to be a suspected suicide,‚Äù Babu said. ‚ÄúWe have got the post-mortem done and are sending the viscera sample to a forensic laboratory for examination. We will be able to disclose the exact cause of death only after forensic examination.‚ÄùThe woman was staying at her uncle‚Äôs house since the second week of February, after police said she faked her abduction and alleged a rape attempt.On February 10, the student‚Äôs parents called local police on a toll-free number, alleging that miscreants abducted their daughter. They said their daughter managed to make a quick call to alert them. Police rescued the woman from a nearby village.Later, police concluded she misled her parents and police. ‚ÄúShe was neither abducted, nor raped,‚Äù local police commissioner Mahesh Bhagawat told reporters on February 13.(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.)

25-02-2021||India||Long way to go for full LAC de-escalation: Army chief General Naravane||Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane on Wednesday said that the ongoing disengagement process with the Chinese People‚Äôs Liberation Army (PLA) along the Line of actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh was a ‚Äúwin-win situation‚Äù for both sides, but there was ‚Äústill a long way to go‚Äù before de-escalation of conflict in the theatre and eventual de-induction of rival soldiers can be achieved through talks.‚ÄúFor any agreement to last, both sides should feel they have achieved something. The talks have had a good outcome. Disengagement is a very good end result,‚Äù the army chief said, responding to a spate of questions on the border standoff after he delivered a talk on the Role of Indian Army in Dealing with National Security Challenges.Vivekananda International Foundation organised the talk.Naravane‚Äôs comments came four days after Indian and Chinese generals held talks in eastern Ladakh and agreed to resolve outstanding issues at friction points on the LAC in a ‚Äústeady and orderly‚Äù manner and were unanimous that last week‚Äôs Pangong Tso disengagement provided ‚Äúa good basis‚Äù for resolving pending problems.Naravane acknowledged that some issues, including Depsang, remained but strategies were in place to resolve those matters. ‚ÄúWe have leverage for negotiating favourable outcomes in future talks, but I would not like to mention those strategies.‚ÄùOutstanding problems with PLA at Depsang, Hot Springs and Gogra ‚Äî friction points on the LAC ‚Äî were discussed during the 10th round of talks between corps commander-ranked officers of the two sides on February 20.Naravane said the army was progressing cautiously because of the trust deficit with PLA. ‚ÄúUntil that trust deficit is removed, we will be wary about the developments there‚Ä¶But at the end of the day, we have achieved a lot,‚Äù he said.The army is right to be cautious keeping in view what happened last year along the LAC, in particular at Galwan, and the fact that problems remain at Gogra, Hot Springs, Demchok and Depsang, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd).‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to hear that there are strategies to resolve the remaining areas. But their success will depend on how far we are able to restore status quo ante. That should be the ultimate objective,‚Äù Hooda added.The army chief said China understood that its salami-slicing strategy won‚Äôt work with India. Salami slicing refers to a string of small, clandestine actions meant to achieve a larger goal that would be difficult to accomplish in one go.‚ÄúChina is in the habit of making small incremental moves to achieve its goals. Each such move may not be individually noticeable. It (China) has made use of the strategy to make gains in South China Sea without firing a shot or without loss of life. We have shown them this strategy will not work with us and every move will be met resolutely,‚Äù the army chief said.Asked what steps were being taken to ensure that PLA does not reoccupy strategic heights on the south bank of Pangong Tso, the army chief said systems were in place to make sure that there is no recapturing of heights and the disengagement process ‚Äì like previous border agreements ‚Äì are premised on the fact that the pacts will be observed in letter and spirit. ‚ÄúWe will trust but we will also verify.‚ÄùReferring to the political, diplomatic and military engagement with China to resolve the standoff, he said the ‚Äúwhole of government approach‚Äù worked well and helped India chalk out its response to the developments on the border. ‚ÄúWhatever has panned out is the result of this approach and what we have achieved so far is very good,‚Äù he said. Naravane said National Security Adviser Ajit Doval‚Äôs advice was very useful in chalking out response to developments in the Ladakh sector.The proposals discussed during the February 20 talks to normalise the border situation have been put up by both sides before their higher authorities in order to finalise the future course of disengagement. The talks took place after the completion of the first round of disengagement in the Pangong Tso sector.PLA‚Äôs deployments in Depsang have hindered access of Indian soldiers to Patrolling Points (PP) 10, 11, 11-A, 12 and 13, as previously reported by Hindustan Times. The Indian army‚Äôs patrolling activity has also been affected in Gogra and Hot Springs, where rival troops are forward-deployed and where skeletal disengagement took place last year, but the gains could not be consolidated.The border standoff began last May and saw both sides deploy 50,000 troops each in the Ladakh theatre.The Pangong disengagement took place on strategic heights on both banks of the lake, and saw the two armies pull back their front-line troops, tanks, infantry combat vehicles and artillery guns under an agreement reached earlier this month.The disengagement will be phased, coordinated and verified at all friction points. The first round of disengagement at Pangong Tso involved pulling back troops deployed eyeball-to-eyeball on the Finger 4 ridgeline as well as withdrawing soldiers holding positions on the Kailash range on the south bank. Under the agreement, neither side will patrol the contested areas between Fingers 4 and 8 until an agreement is reached through future talks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/long-way-to-go-for-full-lac-de-escalation-army-chief-general-naravane-101614212186351.html
25-02-2021||India||No extra chance for taking UPSC exam: Supreme Court||The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to provide an extra chance to appear for the Civil Services Examination in 2021 to candidates barred by age or number of attempts from taking it, after some of them approached the apex court citing difficulties in preparation that affected their performance in the October 2020 exam.The court did not see merit in the grounds on which the candidates were seeking an extra chance, and was also worried about this setting the wrong kind of precedent.In a February 5 hearing, the government offered candidates who have exhausted their chances an extra one, as a concession, but the court advised it against this, although it said the government is free to exercise its discretion in addressing the grievances of the petitioners.It wasn‚Äôt immediately clear whether the government will now go ahead with this offer.Dismissing the plea of nearly 150 candidates who approached the Supreme Court, a three-judge bench comprising justices AM Khanwilkar, Indu Malhotra and Ajay Rastogi said: ‚ÄúWhat is being claimed and prayed for under the guise of Covid-19 pandemic is nothing but a lame excuse in taking additional attempt to participate in the Civil Service Examination (CSE), 2021.‚ÄùIn its 40-page judgment, the court said the pattern of CSE has remained unchanged since 2015; the candidates got an additional five months to prepare considering that the examination was originally to be held in May 2020; and those petitioning the court chose not to exercise the option to withdraw from the examination despite the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), which conducts it, opening a second window for withdrawal between August 1-8, 2020, in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. The petitioners were mentally prepared to give the examination, the bench noted.Refusing to view the case of the petitioners in isolation, the court found merit in the argument of the Centre that any concession to this batch of petitioners will not be fair to the others. All of them, ‚Äúirrespective of the nature of attempt (first or second, etc) who appeared in the 2020 Examination must have faced the same consequences as being faced by the writ petitioners‚Ä¶ the reasoning would equally apply to those who have crossed the upper age barrier‚Äù, reasoned justice Rastogi, who authored the judgment.The court wondered whether a concession to the petitioners could create a similar right for those candidates who withdrew from the examination last year because of a lack of preparation or due to personal reasons.‚ÄúIf this court shows indulgence to [a] few who participated in the examination in 2020, it will set down a precedent and also have cascading effect on examinations in other streams, for which we are dissuaded to exercise plenary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution,‚Äù the judges held.UPSC also opposed the petition on the grounds that a favourable judgment could affect various examinations and recruitment tests conducted by it and state service commissions.The Centre initially opposed the petition, but on February 5 offered a ‚Äúone-time‚Äù concession to those candidates who exhausted their last attempt in the examination conducted last year. General category candidates are allowed six attempts. Candidates belonging to other backward classes (OBCs) are allowed nine and those from the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes (SCs and STs) can appear as many times as they want. The age bar for the three categories is 32, 35 and 37, respectively.According to government data, 486,952 candidates appeared for the 2020 Civil Service Examination. Of this, 3,863 were appearing for their last attempt, and 2,236 were at the age threshold.Commenting on the one-time concession offered by the Centre at the suggestion of the court, the bench said, ‚Äú‚Ä¶any relaxation which is not permissible either in attempt or age under the scheme of Rules (for competitive examinations) 2020 apart from being in contravention to the rules, it may be discriminatory, and it is advisable not to exercise discretion in implementing what is being proposed by Centre (respondent 1).‚ÄùHowever, the court left the door open by stating that the Centre will be free to exercise its discretion to mitigate the difficulties faced by the petitioners. It said: ‚ÄúWe make it clear that this decision would not restrict the Centre (Respondent 1) or the executive in exercising its discretion in meeting out the nature of difficulties as being projected to this court, if come across in future in dealing with the situation, if required.‚Äù||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-extra-chance-for-taking-upsc-exam-supreme-court-101614211757166.html
25-02-2021||India||Paid shots from March 1 as India expands Covid-19 vaccine drive||Anyone above the age of 60 or above 45 and with existing illnesses that make them more vulnerable to Covid-19 will be allowed to sign up to receive coronavirus vaccines at government as well as private hospitals from March 1, the Union Cabinet decided on Wednesday.The decision marks a significant opening up of the vaccination drive, with the roll-out for the general public being moved up from the previously estimated window of mid-March, and comes at a time when the country is on the brink of a second wave of infections.‚ÄúThe second phase of the world‚Äôs largest vaccination drive will start from Monday in which anybody above 60 years and 45 years plus with co-morbidities will be given vaccines in 10,000 government medical facilities and also over 20,000 private hospitals,‚Äù said information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar at the briefing on Cabinet decisions.The doses at the government centres will be free. Private hospitals will be allowed to charge for them, but the rate will be fixed and announced by the government at a later date. This is the first time the private sector will be actively involved in administering vaccines, and doses will be available to eligible people who are willing to pay.While most of the details of the protocols are yet to be finalised, an official said that the sign-ups will initially be allowed through the Aarogya Setu mobile application, which was launched last year as a digital contact tracing tool.‚ÄúTo begin with, the population that is eligible to take the vaccine will be asked to download the Aarogya Setu app. There will be an option under the Co-WIN section where they can register and book an appointment for vaccination,‚Äù said a senior government official, privy to the matter, asking not to be named.Once registered, people may also be able to walk in to get their doses, as is the case at present for those eligible at the moment, this person added.For those with comorbid conditions, the government is expected to release a list of qualifying diseases in the coming days.‚ÄúGradually, there may also be helplines, interactive voice response (IVR) system option for those with basic phones, and also a web portal for registration -- but the start will happen through the Aarogya Setu app,‚Äù the official said.At vaccination sites, those seeking a dose will need to prove their identity by showing a government-issued identity card.India launched the coronavirus vaccination campaign on January 16, and in the period since, a little over 11 million people have received at least one dose. Experts believe now is the time to rapidly ramp up the campaign, since India‚Äôs cases have begun to inch up and several states are showing a resurgence.‚ÄúSo far we have immunised only 1% of our population, while Israel has immunised 85%, and the US 23%. At the current pace, we will not be able to achieve the target even by the end of the year. We have to speed up the vaccination drive at least six to ten times,‚Äù said Dr SK Sarin, director of the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, who headed the Delhi government‚Äôs first committee on controlling and managing Covid-19 infections.At least one of the ways in which it can be done is by opening up the campaign to anyone willing to take shots, particularly since the turnout till now has been a little over 50% of the targeted vaccination per day.‚ÄúI think, if we need to achieve our target we need to have vaccination in more and more places, we have to open it up in a manner that those who are willing to take the vaccine are allowed to come rather than calling people and them not turning up,‚Äù said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences.Guleria added that people in high risk group residing in regions seeing a spurt in infections should be immunised quickly ‚Äúas it will help in decreasing the mortality and hospitalisations‚Äù.The situation is now a race against time for India to build up immunity among its population faster than the virus can spread. The discovery of mutated variants, announced by the government on Tuesday, further threatens the country‚Äôs grip on the epidemic, receded to its lowest levels less than a fortnight ago.According to the official quoted above, sign-ups will open in a few days and those who receive at least one dose can download a QR-code based certificate through the mobile app, as well as awareness material about vaccines and vaccine-related statistics from across the country.‚ÄúThis section is being further modified to allow beneficiaries to also book an appointment,‚Äù said a second official, who asked not to be named.‚ÄúWe are waiting to hear from the government to know what the guidelines are. Now that we have seen in past one month that CoWIN works well, we are confident that scaling up can happen in days. But we will totally abide by government instructions to know how many vaccinations they want us to do in a day, whether we will be allowed to procure directly from manufacturers or the government will provide us with the vaccine,‚Äù said Dr Anupam Sibal, group medical director, Apollo Hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/paid-shots-from-march-1-as-india-expands-covid-19-vaccine-drive-101614210407582.html
25-02-2021||India||Govt rules for online media to include takedown power||The Union government wants to treat online news media publishers at par with traditional media publishers, such as newspapers and news channels, and also bring them under the ambit of section 69(A) of the Information Technology Act that gives takedown powers to the government, according to new guidelines yet to be put in force.Digital media, as defined in a document that lays out the government‚Äôs framework to regulate online content, will cover digitised content that can be transmitted over the internet or computer networks. It includes intermediaries such as Twitter and Facebook, and publishers of news and current affairs content. It also includes so-called curators of such content.So far, online news media has not been unregulated, with the information & broadcasting ministry brining it under its ambit last year, but not yet formalising rules for it. Nor are intermediaries, especially social media companies that take refuge in their intermediary status when it comes to owing up responsibility for content. According to the guidelines titled Information Technology (Guidelines for intermediaries and digital media ethics code) Rules, 2021, digital news media publishers will need to follow rules that apply to print and electronic media.Publishers of news and current affairs content will cover online papers, news portals, news agencies, and news aggregators, but not include the e-paper of any newspaper (print media comes under the purview of the Press Council of India, anyway, and has to follow established guidelines). It also does not cover news operations that do not qualify as a ‚Äúsystematic business activity‚Äù ‚Äî effectively excluding blogs and non-profit publishers.Newspapers and TV news channels are governed under the Press Council of India Act, 1978, and Cable Television Networks Regulation Act, 1995, respectively. According to the proposed changes, these acts will also apply to online news and current affairs portals under the Code of Ethics. They are expected to follow the norms, with the government also planning to put in place a three-tier self-regulation system to ensure compliance with the Code.According to the document, reviewed by HT, a significant publisher of news would have to operate in the territory of India and will be classified as such as long as it has at least 500,000 subscribers or 5 million followers. HT learns that some of these provisions are still being evaluated and may change.Those qualifying under the significant publisher of news category will have to register with Broadcast Seva, a government run portal that operates under the ministry of information and technology.The three-tier framework includes self-regulation, an industry regulatory body headed by a former judge of the Supreme Court and high court with additional members from an I&B ministry approved panel, and an oversight mechanism that includes an interministerial committee with the authority to block access to content.The interministerial committee, which is proposed to form the apex of the regulation system, can act on a complaint, take suo motu cognisance of an issue, and any grievance flagged by the ministry.There are various steps that the government can take to act on non-compliance with the Code, with the most extreme step being blocking access for the public under section 69(A) that covers threat to public order.The extension of 69(A) to digital news publishers and OTT platforms in so much as it gives takedown powers to the government, is a contentious area, said experts.NS Nappinai, Supreme Court advocate and founder of Cyber Saathi, said that proposed rules have to be evaluated for sustainability under the parent Act, ie, the IT Act. ‚ÄúA rule can only be framed within the ambit of the parent provision,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIn case 69(A) is extended to cover online news agencies then the rule will have to be analysed in context of the law enacted by Parliament, which extend at present only to Intermediaries.‚Äù‚ÄúHence when Intermediaries disseminate news such as Facebook or Twitter, they can be made subject to orders under section 69(A) of IT Act,‚Äù she said.Section 69(A) became a point of contention earlier this month when Twitter, which is an intermediary, was asked to take down accounts of journalists and news media organisation. Twitter refused to comply with the government‚Äôs orders, stating that the content was newsworthy and constituted free speech. The action had prompted the government to threaten penal provisions.‚ÄúTwitter is bound to comply with a government order, but they can legally challenge the enforcement using due process,‚Äù Nappinai added.Internet Freedom Foundation trustee Apar Gupta agreed.‚ÄúThere is a very large question of the existence of legislative power for what these rules are intending to do and whether they are often going beyond the letter and spirit of the Information Technology Act,‚Äù Gupta said. ‚ÄúRegulation posed on basis of the Technology Act cannot extend to news providers and OTT platforms, as neither constitute intermediaries.‚ÄùGupta added that there has always been some form of regulation of news media, but it has either been done via a statutory provision or under the journalistic ethics enforced by Press Council of India.‚ÄúFor the IT Act to be used as content control mechanism, especially through exercise of powers aimed at intermediaries which do not originally publish content, seems to be an overreach of executive power.‚Äù||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-rules-for-online-media-to-include-takedown-power-101614208802005.html
25-02-2021||India||‚ÄòPatron of terror‚Äô: India hits out at Pakistan at United Nations||India on Wednesday rejected Pakistan‚Äôs criticism of the human rights situation in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) at the UN Human Rights Council, saying the government in Islamabad should instead focus on credible action to end state-sponsored terrorism.New Delhi‚Äôs response to the criticism by Pakistani human rights minister Shireen Mazari in her address to the UN body in Geneva also described Pakistan as a country with ‚Äúone of the world‚Äôs worst human rights records‚Äù, where ‚Äúinstitutionalised discrimination and persecution‚Äù of minorities has continued unabated.India‚Äôs ‚Äúright of reply‚Äù to the Pakistani minister‚Äôs speech was delivered by Seema Pujani, second secretary in the permanent mission to the UN. She described Pakistan‚Äôs continued misuse of various platforms for ‚Äúbaseless and malicious propaganda against India is not new‚Äù.Pujani pointed out Pakistan has been the ‚Äúhome and patron to the largest number of internationally proscribed terrorist entities and individuals‚Äù, and 126 individuals and 24 entities sanctioned by the UN Security Council are associated with the country. ‚ÄúState-sponsored terrorism by Pakistan is a threat not only to India but to other countries in the region and beyond. The recent acquittal of Omar Saeed Sheikh, the al-Qaeda terrorist and murderer of the American journalist Daniel Pearl, by the Pakistani Supreme Court is a clear example of the Pakistani establishment‚Äôs nexus with such entities and, as the US secretary of state said, it is ‚Äòan affront to terrorism victims everywhere‚Äô,‚Äù Pujani said.External affairs minister S Jaishankar, who addressed the UN agency before Mazari on Wednesday, had, without naming Pakistan, said terrorism remains one of the ‚Äúgravest threats to humankind‚Äù and constitutes a severe challenge to the global human rights agenda.Referring to the 2019 decision to scrap the special status of J&K, Pujani said: ‚ÄúWe reiterate that the entire union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral and inalienable part of India. The steps taken...to ensure good governance and development in these union territories are our internal matters.‚ÄùThe Indian response pointed out that Pakistan would do well to ‚Äúput its own house in order, before venturing to point a finger at India‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe violence, institutionalised discrimination and persecution faced by Pakistan‚Äôs minorities, including Christians, Sikhs and Hindus, has continued unabated. There have been frequent attacks on the places of worship of minority communities, a grave violation of their right to freedom of religion and belief,‚Äù Pujani said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/patron-of-terror-india-hits-out-at-pakistan-at-united-nations-101614208461533.html
25-02-2021||India||2020-21 likely to see record paddy procurement||The Centre is on course to buying a record quantity of kharif or summer-sown paddy during 2020-21, with a sharply higher share of Punjab‚Äôs crop, with procurement nationwide rising 16.5% from the quantity purchased in the previous year, data from the food ministry show.Paddy is the main summer staple that drives the incomes of millions of farmers. The ministry‚Äôs official figures show the government‚Äôs total procurement of summer paddy has touched 65.8 million tonnes until January 22 against the purchase of 56.5 million tonnes in the corresponding part of last year.About 9.5 million farmers have been paid minimum support price worth ‚Çπ1.24 lakh crore. The food ministry has projected that total procurement will likely touch 74.2 million tonnes, up from the total quantity of 62.7 million procured during 2019-20.Punjab‚Äôs share is 20.2 million tonne, which is 30.7% of the total quantity procured.Production of kharif or summer crops this year is likely to be a record 144.5 million tonne, slightly higher than the 143.4 million tonne produced during the kharif season of 2019-20.The ministry this year expanded its procurement operations, which refers to the government‚Äôs buying of farm produce at assured prices for summer-sown crops amid a massive farmers‚Äô protest against three agricultural laws approved last year to remove regulations in the farm sector.The government hopes to cover an estimated 10.5 million paddy growers this year, against last year‚Äôs 10.2 million. The government has also raised by 27% the number of paddy-purchase centres, which now stand at 39,122, up from 30,709 last year, official figures show.An official statement said paddy procurement is still under way in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu, Chandigarh, Jammu & Kashmir, Kerala, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, Jharkhand, Assam, Karnataka, West Bengal and Tripura.The Centre has fixed an MSP for the so-called common variety of paddy at ‚Çπ1,868 per quintal and for the A grade variety at ‚Çπ1,888 per quintal for the current year. The government had initially set a total rice procurement target of 49.5 million tonnes for the entire country in the 2020-21 kharif season.‚ÄúThe freeing up of storage space because of higher disbursal of subsidised grains during the pandemic has enabled the government to ramp up procurement,‚Äù said analyst Abhishek Agrawal of Comtrade, a commodities trading firm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/202021-likely-to-see-record-paddy-procurement-101614207631931.html
25-02-2021||India||BJP, Congress trade barbs over Motera stadium renaming||The Bharatiya Janata Party defended the renaming of the cricket stadium at Motera as the Narendra Modi stadium but pointed out that while the stadium is now named after the PM, the larger sports complex of which it is a part continues to be named after Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, India‚Äôs first home minister.At a cabinet briefing, union ministers Prakash Javadekar and Ravi Shankar Prasad also hit out at the Congress and wondered if the top Congress leaders such as Sonia or Rahul Gandhi have even bothered to visit the world‚Äôs tallest statue, that of Sardar Patel, at Kevadiya in Gujarat.While Javadekar said the two Congress leaders have not even visited the statue, Prasad said, ‚ÄúA tourist place getting global praise has not been visited yet or praised by the two Congress leaders. What else is there to say?‚ÄùOne BJP leader even flashed a list of 23 stadiums, one sports award and 17 tournaments named after members of the Nehru-Gandhi family.Earlier in the day, soon after the stadium was inaugurated by President Ram Nath Kovind, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted: ‚ÄúBeautiful how the truth reveals itself. Narendra Modi stadium Adani end. Reliance end. With Jay Shah presiding. #HumDoHumareDo.‚ÄùThe party spokesperson Pawan Khera alleged that Modi has insulted the two great sons of Gujarat and great international icons, Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel while renaming the stadium.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-congress-trade-barbs-over-motera-stadium-renaming-101614206918283.html
25-02-2021||India||Facebook now says it‚Äôs not obligated to appear before Parliamentary panels||Can social media company Facebook choose to not appear before parliamentary and state-assembly panels if it doesn‚Äôt want to? That question saw interesting exchanges in the Supreme Court on Wednesday with the court telling the company that this seeming lack of accountability is ‚Äúa very difficult proposition to accept‚Äù and the Centre, reacting to the company‚Äôs claim, nuancing its earlier position and saying the company would have to appear before Parliament or a state assembly if they have the ‚Äúlegislative competence‚Äù on the subject at hand.The exchange and Facebook‚Äôs contention that it could choose not to appear before any institution, as long as it follows the laws, is interesting because it comes at a time when the Union government is readying a framework to regulate social media and digital media companies.‚ÄúLogically, you are a platform for debate. So, the debates will occur. But you say that you do not want to participate in a debate or a discussion or an inquiry before any committee. But you still want to carry out business in India. You are saying that I am willing to do business in India; I will provide a platform for debate but I do not want to be accountable. That is a very difficult proposition to accept,‚Äù said a bench, headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul.This came after Facebook told the court that it is not obligated to appear before any committee of Parliament or the state assemblies ‚Äî a stand promptly opposed by the Central government.The social media company said it cannot be compelled by any committee of the parliament or the state assembly to participate in an inquiry and that its move to appear before a parliamentary panel on information technology last month was ‚Äúa business decision‚Äù.The Centre, countering Facebook‚Äôs submission, submitted before the bench, which also included justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy, said that the tech company is bound to appear and depose if a parliamentary panel summons it.The disagreement in the top court came across during the hearing of a petition by Ajit Mohan, head of Facebook India,who challenged the summons issued to him by peace and harmony committee of the Delhi assembly, asking him to appear and answer some queries on the role of the social networking portal in the Delhi riots in February 2020.As the hearing commenced, the bench asked whether Facebook‚Äôs position was that it had a right not to appear before any committee after it has already attended the summons from the parliamentary committee of information technology in January.Senior advocate Harish Salve, representing Facebook, answered in the affirmative: ‚ÄúI have the right to not appear irrespective of the institution. I am complying with all the laws. I am not breaching any law. But I can choose not to appear before any committee.‚ÄùSalve added that except for one contention that Parliament has the power to regulate the social media and intermediaries, which the Delhi government does not have, Facebook would raise the same arguments to not appear before the parliamentary panel too.He added that ‚Äúcompulsion on experts is abhorrent to the idea of free speech and liberty‚Äù while accusing the Delhi assembly of demonstrating ‚Äúconstitutional arrogance‚Äù in pressing for the appearance of the Facebook before its committee.The senior counsel then read out from a letter written by Union IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad to Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO of the company, in September 2020, raising ‚Äúserious concerns‚Äù over the ‚Äúconcerted effort‚Äù by the platform to ‚Äúreduce the reach of people supportive of right-of-centre ideology‚Äù.He further said Aam Aadmi Party MLA and chairman of the peace and harmony committee Raghav Chadha has, on the other hand accused Facebook of supporting the right-wing groups during the February 2020 riots.‚ÄúBoth sides are saying we took sides. What is going on here is a political battle. Their (Delhi government‚Äôs) face off is not with Facebook but with the Union. I have a right to not go and that is how I understand my right to silence. I don‚Äôt want to be in the middle of a divide,‚Äù emphasised Salve.At this, the bench retorted: ‚ÄúYou are a powerful platform and the argument is that you cannot be an unaccountable platform. You have no hesitation to go before the parliamentary committee. There you may face the same divide but you still went.‚ÄùSalve replied: ‚ÄúI went because of a commercial compulsion. It is my choice to agree where to appear. I may choose not to go to any committee. And I don‚Äôt want to give my reasons too because that may create more problems.‚ÄùSolicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, opposed this: ‚ÄúIf the assembly has the competence, Facebook cannot say no. My case is Facebook‚Äôs coming to parliament cannot be a voluntary act; they are bound to come. Likewise, if a state assembly has the legislative competence on the subject it is dealing with, Facebook should go there too.‚ÄùThis submission by Mehta is different from his previous statement made on February 17 when he had said that Facebook is accountable only to Parliament and not to any state assembly since only the Centre has the power to frame laws on social media and intermediaries.At this juncture, the bench told Salve: ‚ÄúLet us assume the IT Ministry wants to call you. You say I do not want to come but the ministry has power and there is a platform on which you operate. Can you say I am hands off? It has been troubling our minds.‚ÄùSenior advocate Salve reiterated that Facebook has a constitutional right and maintained that the company, while opting not to go before the peace and harmony committee, had placed its case on the jurisprudential principles that the Delhi assembly lacked the power as well as the legislative competence on the subject of law-and-order which is under the Union government in the Capital.The bench reserved its verdict on Mohan‚Äôs plea on the validity of the summons issued to him and Facebook.The Supreme Court has not indicted any date for delivering the judgment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facebook-now-says-it-s-not-obligated-to-appear-before-parliamentary-panels-101614205288491.html

25-02-2021||India||CBI names TMC youth leader in charge-sheet of cattle smuggling case||Trinamool Congress youth leader Vinay Mishra, who is now absconding, has been named in a supplementary charge-sheet filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation in the multi-crore cattle smuggling case.The Bharatiya Janata Party had earlier alleged that kickbacks from cattle smuggling used to reach Abhishek Banerjee, TMC MP and chief minister Mamata Banerjee‚Äôs nephew through Mishra.The TMC MP had, however, refuted the charges and publicly said that he would walk to the gallows if any corruption charges were proved against him.‚ÄúA supplementary charge-sheet was filed on Wednesday at the CBI‚Äôs special court in Asansol. TMC youth leader Vinay Mishra has been named,‚Äù said a CBI official.Earlier this month, CBI in the first charge-sheet in the case had named BSF Commandant Satish Kumar and Murshidabad-based businessman Enamul Haque along with five others for their alleged involvement in cattle smuggling across the India-Bangladesh border.Both Kumar and Haque have been arrested and are now in custody. CBI took over the case in September 2020.In two parallel investigations, the CBI is also probing a multi-crore coal smuggling scam. The central agency has already questioned Abhishek Banerjee‚Äôs wife Rujira Banerjee.‚ÄúSuch is their audacity that they are branding mothers and daughters as coal smugglers? They are entering our house and accusing a housewife aged only 22-23 years of being a coal smuggler,‚Äù Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee hit out on Wednesday.The Indo-Bangladesh border in West Bengal is the longest international border in any state across the country. Out of the 4096.7 km long Indo-Bangla border, West Bengal alone shares 2216 km with the neighbouring country. In south Bengal, the border is more than 900 km long out which nearly 60% is riverine.The Indo-Bangladesh border, particularly in West Bengal, is also one of the most porous borders. Data placed by the Union ministry of home affairs before the Parliament in March 2020 shows that in 2017, 2018 and 2019 security agencies arrested 1175, 1118 and 1351 people along the entire stretch of the Indo-Bangla border in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-names-tmc-youth-leader-in-charge-sheet-of-cattle-smuggling-case-101614191433898.html

25-02-2021||NA||Highlights: False narrative that farmers will lose land: Union minister||The farmers' protest against the Centre's three new farm laws is continuing at Delhi's border as the deadlock between the protesting farmer unions and the government continues over the repeal of the laws.Rakesh Tikait, leader and national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, said on Tuesday that the protesting farmers would gherao Parliament, if the Central government does not repeal the three laws, during his address to a Kisan Panchayat in Sikar, Rajasthan. Earlier on Tuesday, Swaraj India leader Yogendra Yadav, too, addressed a similar panchayat in Sikar.Meanwhile, the political battles in poll-bound states have been centred largely around the farm laws and the farmers' protests. Union minister Prahlad Joshi of the BJP attacked Congress leader and Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday saying that Gandhi is an "actor on tractor." The remarks came a day after Gandhi held a tractor rally in his constituency in Kerala supporting the protesting farmers. Gandhi too had been attacking the Centre in his political rallies, saying that the government wants to take away the agriculture business from farmers and "and give the entire business to two or three friends of PM Modi".In other developments around the issue, climate activist Disha Ravi had been released from the Tihar jail on Tuesday after a Delhi court granted bail to her on grounds of "scanty and sketchy" evidence. She was earlier arrested in connection with the 'toolkit' case. Also, Lakha Sidhana, one of the accused in the tractor rally clashes during the republic day, addressed a farmers' rally in Mehraj, Bathinda, calling for the protests to be intensified.Follow all the updates here:False narrative that farmers will lose land, won't get MSP: Union minister BalyanBJP leader and Union Minister Sanjeev Balyan on Wednesday said the the protest against Centre's three new farm laws has become "emotional" and acknowledged that his party and the government might not have been able to explain the benefits of the laws to farmers.
