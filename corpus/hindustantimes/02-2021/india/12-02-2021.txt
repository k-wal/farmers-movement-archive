We are happy that many are coming forward to share their issues with us,” said Singh.Talking to reporters, Bordoloi, who heads the party’s campaign committee, said that the aim of the ‘yatra’ is to reach every household in the state and seek the public’s support to save Assam from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition government.“The BJP has failed in its promise to protect community identity and honour of Assam. During the 15 years of Congress rule under Tarun Gogoi, we had worked hard to bring peace and stability to Assam. BJP wants to push Assam into turbulence with their divisive agenda,” said Ripun Bora.Assam goes to polls in April-May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-cong-sounds-poll-bugle-with-yatra-from-srimanta-sankardev-s-birthplace-101613150876998.html

The current government has, however, expressed a preference in engaging investors directly. I understand discussions are still underway,” he said.India responded to the latest developments in the ECT project by calling on Sri Lanka to abide by the trilateral agreement, while Japan described the Sri Lankan government’s unilateral decision as “regrettable”.Sri Lankan leaders and ministers have been quoted by the country’s media as saying that India and Japan will be allowed an opportunity to develop the West Container Terminal at Colombo port instead of ECT. Indian officials, however, say that no formal proposal has been received from Colombo in this regard.Indian envoy Gopal Baglay has held separate meetings with Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and foreign minister Dinesh Gunawerdene to convey India’s position that Colombo must abide by the agreement. The Japanese envoy too has met the Sri Lankan leadership to discuss the matter.India’s Adani Group and several Japanese investors were to form a joint venture to hold 49 per cent stake in the ECT, with the majority stake in the hands of SLPA. India has informed the Sri Lankan leadership that its decision could affect investor confidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/discussions-still-on-with-sri-lanka-on-colombo-port-project-mea-101613147592415.html
12-02-2021||India||PM Trudeau praised India's move to opt for dialogue with agitating farmers: MEA||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau commended the Indian government’s decision to opt for dialogue to address the farmers’ protest during a phone call with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the external affairs ministry said on Friday.During their phone call on Wednesday, the two leaders had discussed “Canada and India’s commitment to democratic principles, recent protests, and the importance of resolving issues through dialogue”, according to a readout from Trudeau’s office.The statement issued by the external affairs ministry on the conversation was silent on this issue. Asked about the matter at a news briefing on Friday, external affairs minister spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said: “On the farmers’ protests, Prime Minister Trudeau commended efforts of the government of India to choose the path of dialogue as befitting in democracy.”Srivastava added: “He also acknowledged the responsibility of his government in providing protection to Indian diplomatic premises and personnel in Canada.”This was a reference to recent protests outside India’s diplomatic missions in Canada, including the presence of pro-Khalistan elements among the demonstrators. India has repeatedly taken up this issue with the Canadian side.Ties between India and Canada took a hit in December when Trudeau extended support to Indian farmers protesting against three farm laws. India pushed back against his comments, describing the protest as an internal matter and saying such remarks had the potential to damage bilateral ties.The Canadian high commissioner was also summoned to the external affairs ministry in December and served a demarche or formal diplomatic representation over Trudeau’s comments.Wednesday’s phone call between Modi and Trudeau is being seen as an effort by both sides to mend fences. The readout from Trudeau’s office said the two leaders also discussed India’s efforts in “promoting vaccine production and supply” and working together on access to vaccines.The external affairs ministry said in a statement that Trudeau informed Modi about “Canada's requirements of Covid-19 vaccines from India”. Modi assured Trudeau that “India would do its best to support Canada's vaccination efforts, just as it had done for many other countries”.Canada is among the countries that is expected get made-in-India vaccines in the coming weeks, officials have said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-trudeau-praised-india-s-move-to-opt-for-dialogue-with-agitating-farmers-mea-101613146706798.html

The remaining 1,000 tonnes is expected to reach Syria on February 18.The UN humanitarian office estimates that 80% of Syria’s population of 17.5 million currently lives in poverty, and civilians face a range of dangers, from instability, arbitrary detention and abduction, to criminality and activities of terror groups.Earlier, India gifted 10 tonnes of medicines to Syria in July last year as part of Covid-19 assistance. More than 500 Syrian nationals benefited from a camp to fit the “Jaipur foot” artificial limbs that was organised by the external affairs ministry in partnership with Bhagwan Mahaveer Viklang Sahayata Samiti in Damascus during January 2020.During the academic years 2018-19 and 2019-20, a total of 1,000 scholarships were extended to Syrian students for pursuing bachelors, masters and post-doctoral programmes in Indian universities under the “Study in India” initiative.India is also establishing a “NextGen Centre for Information Technology” in Damascus, for which preparatory work has begun.“India and Syria have historically enjoyed close and friendly relations. The government of India has always stood in solidarity with the people of Syria, and our bilateral engagement has continued apace even during the years of internal conflict there through a number of development and capacity building projects,” the external affairs ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-provides-2000-tonnes-of-rice-to-war-torn-syria-as-humanitarian-aid-101613144563911.html
12-02-2021||India||On farmers’ protest, Trudeau commended India's efforts, says MEA||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who had ticked off India after he supported protesting farmers last year, has commended the government's efforts in handling the protest and for choosing "the path of dialogue as befitting a democracy”, the ministry of external affairs said on Friday. In early December, a few weeks into the agitation, Trudeau had backed the protests and said that Ottawa has conveyed its concerns about the protest by Indian farmers to New Delhi. Trudeau had said that Canada will always be there to defend the rights of peaceful protests and expressed concern over the situation. MEA was quick to dismiss his remarks as “unwarranted” as they pertained to the country’s internal affairs.Last week, minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan said Trudeau had made a comment on the issues related to the farmers and it was conveyed to Canada that such remarks pertaining to the internal affairs of India are "unwarranted" and "unacceptable"."On farmer protest, PM Trudeau commended efforts of the Government of India to choose the path of dialogue as befitting a democracy," MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said in a weekly press briefing.The Canadian prime minister also acknowledged the responsibility of his government in providing protection to Indian diplomatic personnel and premises in Canada, the MEA spokesperson said.The statement from MEA comes two days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trudeau held a telephonic conversation on Wednesday and covered a range of issues including the coronavirus crisis. A readout issued by Trudeau's office on the telephonic talks mentioned that the farmer protests figured in the discussions, though the Indian statement had not mentioned it. "The leaders discussed Canada and India's commitment to democratic principles, recent protests, and the importance of resolving issues through dialogue," the Canadian readout said. It mentioned several other issues discussed by the two prime ministers.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at three border points on the outskirts of Delhi demanding the repeal of the three contentious farm laws cleared by Parliament in September last year.The talks between the farmers and the government have largely been inconclusive and remain in a state of deadlock as the farmers insist on a complete repeal of the laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-farmers-protest-canada-s-trudeau-commended-india-s-efforts-says-mea-101613137835167.html
12-02-2021||India||India sends 22.9 mn doses of Covid-19 vaccines to 20 countries, more in pipeline||India has rolled out nearly 23 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines to 20 countries around the world, both as grants and commercial supplies, and more will be sent to countries in Africa and Latin America in the coming weeks.The supplies under the Vaccine Maitri initiative, which began on January 21, have earned India considerable goodwill, especially in small countries such as the Commonwealth of Dominica. Most leaders of countries that received vaccines as grants have noted that India was sending out supplies even as it undertakes the world’s largest inoculation drive.Out of the total supplies, 6.47 million doses were given as grants while 16.5 million doses were provided as commercial supplies. Countries in India’s immediate neighbourhood were among the biggest beneficiaries, in keeping with the government’s “Neighbourhood First” policy.The deliveries of Covishield, the AstraZeneca vaccine made by the Serum Institute of India, have helped India pull ahead of China in what is being referred to as “vaccine diplomacy”. Chinese vaccines have been approved by only a handful of countries in the region and China has so far offered vaccines only to Pakistan and Nepal.“We will continue to take forward the global vaccine supply initiative and cover more countries in a phased manner. In the coming weeks, vaccines will be supplied to more countries in Africa, Latin America, CARICOM and Pacific Island states,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a news briefing on Friday.Beyond India’s immediate neighbourhood, vaccines have been sent as grants to countries in the Indian Ocean region, West Asia and the Caribbean.These countries include Bangladesh (two million doses), Myanmar (1.7 million doses), Nepal (one million doses), Bhutan (150,000 doses), the Maldives (100,000 doses), Mauritius (100,000 doses), Seychelles (50,000 doses), Sri Lanka (500,000 doses), Bahrain (100,000 doses), Oman (100,000 doses), Afghanistan (500,000 doses), Barbados (100,000 doses) and Dominica (70,000 doses).The countries that received commercial supplies are Brazil (two million doses), Morocco (six million doses), Bangladesh (five million doses), Myanmar (two million doses), Egypt (50,000 doses), Algeria (50,000 doses), South Africa (one million doses), Kuwait (200,000 doses) and the United Arab Emirates (200,000 doses).Srivastava declined to go into specifics on whether India will also provide vaccines to Canada, whose Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had taken up the issue with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a phone call on Wednesday.“Decisions on these supplies will, of course, be calibrated as per domestic production and the requirements of the national vaccination programme,” Srivastava said.In the case of smaller countries such as the Commonwealth of Dominica, the Indian supplies will be adequate to inoculate almost half of the population of 72,000. The country is now planning its largest vaccination programme that will initially cover frontline workers, senior citizens, lawmakers and cabinet ministers.Dominican Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit said he hadn’t imagined that the prayers of his country would be answered so swiftly. “Being the leader of a small Caribbean island with a population of 72,000 people, I did not fancy my chances of getting such a swift, positive response to my request of India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” he said.“One would have thought and understood that in a global pandemic such as this, a nation’s size and might would have been the primary considerations but it is to the credit of Prime Minister Modi that our request was considered on merit and the equality of our people was recognised,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-sends-22-9-mn-doses-of-covid-19-vaccines-to-20-countries-more-in-pipeline-101613142400644.html

It is one of the main shrines of the protector God of Kathmandu Valley and is worshiped by both Hindus and Buddhists alike. The conservation and retrofitting of the temple will be carried out at a cost of NRs 626 million.Located inside Ratnakar Mahavihara, the Kumari Chhen is a historic house of the living goddess of Patan. The living goddess is central to culture and traditions of Newar Buddhist community and the Kumari Niwas has an important place in the rituals associated with the living goddess.

12-02-2021||India||Top court seeks Andhra's response on Odisha's contempt plea on border row||The Supreme Court on Friday sought a response from the Andhra Pradesh government on an allegation by Odisha that the former was holding local body elections in three villages falling under Odisha’s territory.The notification announcing Panchayat elections was issued by the Collector of Vizianagaram district in Andhra Pradesh on March 5, 2020.Senior advocate Vikas Singh appearing for the Odisha government told the top court that elections will be held in violation of a Supreme Court order of December 2, 1968 passed in a suit between the two states. The court had ordered status quo to be maintained by the parties over 21 villages in Koraput district of Odisha. The three villages going to polls were stated to be part of this batch.Moving a contempt petition against top officers of the Andhra Pradesh government and the State Election Commissioner (SEC), the Naveen Patnaik government claimed that the action of holding polls was clearly in contempt of the 1968 order. Although the suit was dismissed in 2006 on technical grounds, Odisha maintained that both states agreed to abide by the status quo order.For Andhra Pradesh, standing counsel Mahfooz Nazki denied the charges and raised preliminary objections against entertaining the contempt petition. Since Nazki did not have a copy of Odisha’s petition, the bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar and Aniruddha Bose said, “We are not passing any order. You (Andhra Pradesh) first go through the application and file your response including preliminary objections. We will decide next Friday.”Singh informed the Court that the elections will be held on Saturday. The bench observed, “Whatever consequences will flow from our order will follow.”The petition by Odisha claimed that the three villages falling in Koraput have been shown as part of Salur Panchayat mandal of Vizianagaram by changing their original names from Ganjaipader, Phattusenary, and Phagusenary to Ganjaibadra, Pattuchennuru and Phaguluchennuru, respectively.The state accused Andhra Pradesh of “invading” into its territory and named Vizianagaram Collector Mude Hari Jawaharlal as the first contemnor for issuing the election notification last year. “In the notification deliberately the contemnors roped in three villages from the ‘Kotia Group of villages’ falling under the territory of Koraput district of Odisha into Salur Mandal of Vizinagaram district (AP). Clandestinely the contemnors changed the name of the three villages of Kotia Gram Panchayat,” the Odisha government alleged.The petition further named Andhra Pradesh Chief Secretary Adityanath Das and SEC N Ramesh Kumar as co-contemnors. Administratively and otherwise, the state of Odisha has been in control of these villages throughout, the petition stated. The matter will be heard by the Supreme Court on February 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-court-seeks-andhra-s-response-on-odisha-s-contempt-plea-on-border-row-101613140900850.html

12-02-2021||India||Unknown bacterial disease kills 4 elephants in Odisha sanctuary in 12 days||At least four female elephants have succumbed to a likely bacterial disease in a wildlife sanctuary of Kalahandi district since February 1.The carcass of a female elephant, said forest and wildlife officials on Friday, was found near a drain at Jakma village under Karlapat wildlife sanctuary in Kalahandi district, taking the toll to four in the last 12 days.Between February 1 and 8, the carcasses of two elephants were found at the same spot which has puzzled forest department officials. On Wednesday, the carcass of a female elephant was found at Ghusurigudi village inside the wildlife sanctuary.Divisional Forest Officer, Kalahandi(south), T Ashok Kumar, said prima facie all the four elephants might have succumbed to haemorrhagic septicaemia, an acute and highly fatal form of bacterial infection marked by fever, hypersalivation, nasal discharge and difficult respiration.The DFO said the test result of the first two elephants at the laboratory in the veterinary college of OUAT came out negative for anthrax. "But the lab is testing it further as the symptoms are for haemorrhagic septicaemia. We suspect the infections likely happened from the elephants drinking the water contaminated by livestock in the nearby human settlements," he said. There are 4-5 villages around the area where the elephants died.Karlapat sanctuary had an estimated 17-20 elephants in the 2018 elephant census.Haemorrhagic septicaemia affects mainly water buffalo, cattle, and bison in tropical areas of southeast Asia, where water buffalo populations are high. Acute infection can persist up to 3 days, and less often 5 days, and is characterised by fever of 104°–106°F, restlessness and reluctance to move, hypersalivation and nasal discharge.The DFO said waterbodies in the area are being sanitised and cattle are also being vaccinated to avoid the spread of the disease.

The 118 tanks would be joining the fleet of the first batch of 124 Arjun tanks which have already been inducted into the Army and are deployed in the western desert along the Pakistan front.The 118 Arjun tanks would also form two regiments in the Armoured Corps of the Indian Army like the first 124 tanks.Officials said the Army has reduced the number of tanks required for the formation of a tank regiment and that is the why the present order has six lesser tanks than the previous order for two regiments.The DRDO has been developing the Arjun Mark 1A for quite some time now and the project was hastened by both Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat and DRDO chief Dr G Satheesh Reddy to increase the level of indigenous weapon systems in the armed forces.The Arjun has been designed by the DRDO's Combat Vehicles Research and Development Establishment (CVRDE) and DRDO Chairman Satheesh Reddy will hand the first Arjun Mark 1A to Prime Minister Modi.The tanks will be produced by the Ordnance Factory Board's (OFB) Heavy Vehicles Factory (HVF) Avadi and the first batch of five main battle tanks will be handed over to the army within two-and-a-half years of the signing of the contract.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-dedicate-arjun-tank-to-nation-on-sunday-army-to-get-118-latest-tanks-101613139854717.html

On Thursday, Congress’ leader P Chidambaram criticised the budget during his Rajya Sabha speech, calling it a “budget for the rich, of the rich and by the rich.” Congress MP Shashi Tharoor also had termed it as a ‘tepid budget’. “The contribution of this budget is ‘Na Jawan, Na Kisan’ (no soldiers, no farmers),” Tharoor had said.On Friday, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman defended the Union Budget 2021-22 in the Rajya Sabha. Sitharaman said that the opposition had made it a habit to accuse the government despite all the measures it has taken for the poor. She also hailed the budget would help in attaining the goal of Aatmanirbhar Bharat. “It's a budget which clearly draws on the experience, the administrative capacities and also exposure that the Prime Minister had during his long elected tenure, both as CM and as PM of this country,” she said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday defended his government’s implementation of the three farm laws in his reply to the motion of thanks on the President’s address.

12-02-2021||India||Andhra govt forms panel to look into abandoned buildings in Amaravati||The Andhra Pradesh government has formed a nine-member high-level committee to look into the fate of existing building infrastructure in Amaravati, the present state capital, in the wake of its decision to shift the executive capital to Visakhapatnam.The committee, headed by chief secretary Adityanath Das and comprising eight other senior officials representing various departments had its first meeting in the secretariat on Friday to discuss measures on what to do with various buildings and housing units that had been constructed in Amaravati during the previous Telugu Desam Party government as part of capital infrastructure.Hundreds of multi-storeyed residential quarters for All India Services officers, legislators, state government employees and Secretariat staff, besides villas and other residential bungalows for high court judges were constructed during the Naidu regime and many of them were almost nearing completion, when the construction was halted by the Jagan government soon after its formation in May 2019.The construction of twin towers for the Secretariat and other administrative complexes and the new high court complex also came to a halt, after Jagan came to power.Now that the Jagan government has decided to restrict Amaravati only as a legislative capital and shift the judicial capital to Kurnool and executive capital to Visakhapatnam, most of these buildings constructed at a high cost are likely to be abandoned.The high-level official committee has been entrusted with the task of examining the buildings and housing units in Amaravati which are essentially required for the legislative capital, which now falls under the Amaravati Metropolitan Region Development Authority (AMRDA), which replaced the earlier AP Capital Region Development Authority (APCRDA).With regard to other unfinished apartment units and bungalows, the committee has been asked to study as to what could be done with them – whether to fully execute the buildings or to explore means for reducing the burden on the exchequer.State principal secretary, municipal administration Y Srilakshmi, one of the members of the committee, said it would require another ₹2,112 crore to complete the unfinished building infrastructure, apart from ₹302 crore due to be paid to the contractors for the completed work.Besides, the government would have to complete the other infrastructure facilities like power, water supply, electricity and drainage works in the AMRDA area.The chief secretary suggested that priority be given to complete the buildings and residential quarters which had been completed up to 75 per cent. He asked the officials to talk to bankers and contractors about the matter.An official familiar with the development said the government might complete only those buildings and quarters required for the legislative capital and put up the remaining unfinished buildings for sale through “Mission Build AP,” a special purpose vehicle created by the state government to sell unused government properties to raise funds.“The government hopes to generate huge money through auctioning of these building units in Amaravati through Mission Build AP. The funds can be used for funding the welfare schemes of the government,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-govt-forms-panel-to-look-into-abandoned-buildings-in-amaravati-101613138468815.html
12-02-2021||India||Centre has spent ₹7.95 crore on campaign to bust myths about farm laws: Tomar||The Centre has spent over ₹7.95 crore in five months till January for a publicity campaign to bust myths about the new farm laws, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar informed Parliament on Friday.  Out of this, the Information and Broadcasting Ministry committed ₹7,25,57,246 for release of advertisements between September 2020 and January 2021 on behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, he said.   Tomar, in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha, further said the print advertisements have been published through the Bureau of Outreach and Communication (BOC) in Hindi, English and regional language newspapers for "clarifications related to farm laws including on myth and realities, etc" for creating awareness among the farmers and other stakeholders.   The Agriculture Ministry has incurred an expenditure of ₹67,99,750 on production of three promotional and two educational films on the farm laws for its wider publicity through electronic media, social media and webinars.  Besides, miscellaneous expenditure of ₹1,50,568 was incurred on development of creatives for print advertisement, the minister added.   On expenses incurred on overseas publicity campaign, the minister said there was "nil" expenditure as per the information received from the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).   However, the missions/posts, as part of regular diplomatic work shared the latest developments, the government's considered position and useful information on the farm laws, including frequently asked question (FAQs) etc on their social media accounts in their outreach to the diaspora, he said.  The related government departments have also created awareness through social media platforms, he added.   Responding to another query, Tomar said the government engaged itself actively and constantly with the agitating farmers' unions and 11 rounds of negotiations were held to resolve their issues.  During various rounds of negotiations, the government had been requesting the agitating farmers' unions "to discuss the farm laws clause by clause" in order to resolve their concerns on the clauses bothering them, he said.  "However, farmers' unions never agreed to discuss the farm laws except for the demand for their repeal," he noted.   The farmers' protest at Delhi borders has entered its third month. Thousands of farmers, especially from Punjab, Haryana and parts of Uttar Pradesh, are agitating seeking repeal of the new laws, introduced by the Centre last year, saying they are pro-corporate and could weaken the mandi system.   The 11 rounds of the talks between the Centre and 41 protesting farmer unions has so far remained deadlocked even though the former has offered concessions including suspension of the legislations for 18 months, which the unions have rejected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-has-spent-rs-7-95-crore-on-campaign-to-bust-myths-about-farm-laws-tomar-101613138360319.html

In October 2020, the Court issued a notice on a petition by two law students demanding profile verification of social media accounts to weed out illicit and graphic content uploaded on social media.Also read: 'Suffocated' - Trinamool's Dinesh Trivedi announces resignation from Rajya SabhaAppearing for Goenka, advocate Ashwini Dubey informed the Court that an urgent need had arisen for the Court to interfere as no law is in place to prevent the circulation of anti-national content and posts that spread hatred based on fake news.“In the absence of any law to deal with offensive and hate messages, platforms like Twitter are knowingly promoting the messages which are against the law of the land and therefore, the Respondent No.4 (Twitter) needs to explain for circulating and promoting the prohibited content,” the petitioner said.With notices been issued, responses have to be filed to the petition by Twitter and the two Central departments – Ministry of Law and Justice, and Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.At present, Twitter enjoys a considerable presence in India having close to 3.5 million accounts. According to the petition, 10 per cent of these handles are fake with some of them bearing names and profiles of top constitutional functionaries in the country that tends to mislead the common man.“Fake accounts are used to promote casteism, communalism, regionalism, linguism,” the petition stated, citing the recent trend of separatist organisations like Pakistan-based ISI, Indian Mujahideen using Twitter to create fake IDs and spread hatred among communities through seditious, hate-filled, and divisive content.In 2019, Twitter suspended the account of a pro-Khalistani activist Guru Patvant Singh Pannun after the Sikh community complained that he was radicalizing youth.“The aforesaid act shows that Respondent 4 (Twitter) is sympathetic to terrorist groups. There is no law/mechanism which prohibits Respondent 4 from doing aforesaid illegal acts, and Respondent 4 does not have its own mechanism,” Goenka stated in his petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-sends-notice-to-twitter-centre-on-regulating-fake-and-seditious-content-101613137139358.html
12-02-2021||India||Inter-caste marriages will possibly reduce caste and community tensions: SC||Inter-caste marriages will possibly reduce caste and community tensions, the Supreme Court has said while noting that the educated younger boys and girls are now a days choosing their life partners which is a departure from earlier societal norms. The top court said that youngsters face threats from the elders and the courts have been coming to the aid of these youngsters. It said the way forward to the police authorities is to counsel the Investigating Officers (IO) and lay down some guidelines and training programmes on how to handle such socially sensitive cases.The remarks came by a bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy which quashed an FIR lodged by the parents of the girl, who had married a boy of her choice against the wishes of elders, at Belgavai district of Karnataka.The top court in its recent verdict said that it hopes that the parents of the girl will have a better sense to accept the marriage and re-establish social interaction not only with her but even with her husband.“That, in our view, is the only way forward. Under the garb of caste and community to alienate the child and the son-in-law will hardly be a desirable social exercise,” the bench told the parents of the girl, who has sought quashing of the FIR lodged against her.The top court said, “Educated younger boys and girls are choosing their life partners which, in turn is a departure from the earlier norms of society where caste and community play a major role. Possibly, this is the way forward where caste and community tensions will reduce by such inter marriage but in the meantime these youngsters face threats from the elders and the Courts have been coming to the aid of these youngsters.”Referring to earlier verdicts of the top courts, the bench said it has been held that the consent of the family or the community or the clan is not necessary once the two adult individuals agree to enter into wedlock and that their consent has to be piously given primacy.The bench said it has been held in the 2017 verdict of the top court that the choice of an individual is an “inextricable part of dignity, for dignity cannot be thought of where there is erosion of choice”. “Intimacies of marriage lie within a core zone of privacy, which is inviolable and even matters of faith would have the least effect on them. The right to marry a person of choice was held to be integral to Article 21 of the Constitution of India,” the bench noted, while referring to Hadiya case verdict of 2018.Justice Kaul, who penned down the verdict on behalf of the bench, said that the intervention of this Court would really not have been required in the given facts of the case, if the investigating officer had conducted himself more responsibly in closing the complaint.“…if the investigating officer really wanted to record the statement of the petitioner No.1 (girl), should have informed that he would visit her and recorded the statement instead of putting her under threat of action against petitioner No.2 (boy) to come to the police station,” the bench said.The bench said that it does not reflect very well on the police authorities or the IO of the case as the marriage certificate having been received by him and the conversation already been held with the girl, where she clearly stated that she was married to the boy, and that she was feeling threatened and apprehensive of coming to the police station. “If the IO could have visited the residence of petitioner No.2 (boy), he could very well have recorded the statement of petitioner No.1(girl) at the place where the petitioners were residing rather than insisting and calling upon the petitioners to come to the local police station at Karnataka”, it said.The bench said that the IO undoubtedly sought to compel the girl to come and record the statement at police station on the threat of possibility of a false case being registered by her parents against the boy and the consequent action of the police which would result in his arrest.“We strongly deprecate the conduct of the IO in adopting these tactics and the officer must be sent for counselling as to how to manage such cases,” the bench said.It said that the way forward to the police authorities is to not only counsel the current IOs but devise a training programme to deal with such cases for the benefit of the police personnel."We expect the police authorities to take action on this behalf in the next eight weeks to lay down some guidelines and training programmes on how to handle such socially sensitive cases," the bench said.The bench noted that both the petitioners are well educated and the boy is an M.Tech from NIT, Tiruchirapalli and got a placement as an Assistant Professor in Jain College of Engineering, Belagavi, while his wife is an MA B.Ed and was a Lecturer in a College. It noted that there was resistance from the parents of the girl, though the parents of the boy were willing for the matrimony of both the well qualified petitioners who are majors and Hindu by religion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/intercaste-marriages-will-possibly-reduce-caste-and-community-tensions-sc-101613138024617.html

I stand with you and also offer my condolences,” Gogoi tweeted.“UR a fighter on and off the court.. ignore these racists..I stand with you and my condolences..keep smashing,” another Congress leader M Prithviraj Singh said in his reply to her tweet.Last year, Gutta had faced racial attacks since the Covid-19 outbreak but had said that chose to ignore them and move on. “I actually pity them. These people who are trolling me are the ones who will come asking for a selfie.

Gandhi, currently on a two-day visit to Rajasthan, also termed their protests as ‘agitation of India’ during his speech at Sri Ganganagar.“The day farm laws get implemented business of 40% people, of ₹40 lakh crore, of businessmen, vendors, farmers and workers, will go into hands of just two people. This isn't farmers' agitation but the agitation of India. Farmers have shown the light in the darkness,” news agency ANI quoted Gandhi as saying.Also read | Rahul Gandhi attacks PM Modi over China border pactThe Congress leader’s ‘just two people’ remark comes a day after he tweeted “A government of ‘Hum Do, Hamare Do (We two, ours two)’ !” on Thursday.Earlier in the day, the Congress MP made similar comments while addressing a Kisan Mahapanchayat in Rajasthan’s Pilibanga. “Forty per cent of India’s population runs this business in the country. These include farmers, labourers, small shopkeepers, businessmen and arthiyas. Congress has always tried to ensure that the business is never controlled by just one person,” Gandhi said.He also urged the Centre to take back the three farm laws and then talk to the farmers over the issue. “Modi Ji says that we want to speak with farmers, what do you want to talk about? Repeal the laws, farmers will speak with you. You (PM) are taking away their land, future and then you want to talk.

Tikait said that Singhu border, one of the protest sites on the outskirts of Delhi, would remain their office and that they will not go 'without removing metal spikes from Delhi.'"There will be 'Ghar Wapsi' only after farm laws are repealed. Our 'manch and panch' will be the same. Singhu border will remain our office. Whether the Centre wants to talk today, in 10 days or next year, we're ready. Won't go without removing metal spikes from Delhi," Tikait was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Tikait had earlier said that the farmers' protest would go on for an indefinite period of time since there was no planning regarding the duration yet in response to Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) leader Gurnam Singh Charni statement that the agitation would continue till October. "Farmers' protest will go on for an indefinite period as there is no plan currently. It might continue till October," Tikait told ANI.He also said that it was good that the issue of the farmers was being debated in Parliament and also agreed with Rahul Gandhi's remark of 'Hum Do, Humare Do', which the Congress leader said during a discussion on the Union Budget in the Lok Sabha on Thursday, accusing the government of ensuring the well being of a select few close to those in power. "This 'Hum Do, Humare Do' began with Notebandi. Then came GST. Then came Covid. Migrant workers pleaded for a bus or train ticket to return home, but were told to walk back," Gandhi said."The entire nation's farmers are on the streets protesting, there must be a reason for it. If the farm laws are not accepted by the farmers, then what is the compulsion of not repealing them?" Tikait asked.Farmers have been protesting on the different borders of the national capital since November 26 last year against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protests led up to a tractor rally, organised by the farmers on Republic Day, which ended in violence. The farmers and the Centre have been stuck in a stalemate despite several rounds of talks. The farmers have made it clear that they will not accept anything less than a complete rollback of the laws while the Centre has refused to withdraw them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-ghar-wapsi-only-after-laws-are-repealed-says-rakesh-tikait-101613128843671.html

"The glacial burst led to the rising of water levels in the river Rishiganga, which washed away the Rishiganga small hydro project of 13.2 MW,” the Union ministry of home affairs said.Also read | CM Rawat says lake formed near Raini village in Joshimath being monitoredDeath toll and damageOfficials have said 204 people went missing after the floods of which 36 bodies have been recovered and 168 people are still missing. Of the 36 bodies, 10 have been identified, according to officials. Also, around 30 people are feared to have been trapped inside a tunnel in a hydel power project site of the NTPC in Tapovan area of Chamoli district.Rescue effortsAgencies such as the Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), State Disaster Relief Force (SDRF), National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) along with the Indian army and the local police have been involved in the relief efforts.Rescue efforts continued in the Tapovan tunnel for the sixth consecutive day on Friday. “The rescue workers are putting in all efforts to clear the muck from the tunnel but are unable to make any progress because there is heavy muck inside. We have cleared about 100m of the tunnel,” Uttarakhand's chief of police Ashok Kumar said.Relief measures announcedUttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat had cancelled his plans for the day on Sunday and visited the flood-affected sites from February 8 to take stock of the situation.

It was due to millions of metric tonnes of snow sliding down abruptly from a trigger point on the top of a naked hill," CM Rawat had said on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dozens-dead-hundreds-missing-what-we-know-about-uttarakhand-floods-so-far-101613132225603.html

In addition, we received ₹182 crore recently for 2020-21 for Covid-19 management," he added.For the rollout of the first phase of the vaccination programme for the frontline workers, the Centre has provided a grant of ₹2.46 crore to Assam, Sarma said in his speech."In addition, we have also received funds amounting to ₹4.99 crore and ₹8.36 crore from the Development of North Eastern Region (DONER) Ministry and GIZ India for management of Covid-19," he said.During the pandemic, the public made a generous financial contribution of ₹116.89 crore to the Assam Aarogya Nidhi in a very short time span, but that amount has not been used as of now, the finance minister informed the assembly."I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all the donors who stood by us in this crisis... The entire fund has been kept intact and we will utilise it with utmost prudence to fight Covid-19 in the coming times," he said.Stating that managing the Covid-19 pandemic has been "probably one of greatest moments of satisfaction for me in my entire public life", Sarma thanked the doctors, paramedical and nursing staff, enforcement departments, district administrations and health department."While the role of doctors and nurses has been critical in saving lives, the services rendered by the other healthcare staff were no less important in ensuring the functioning of the facilities and they are the unsung heroes in the true sense," he added.As a result of a coordinated effort by all, the state has consistently maintained a high Covid-19 recovery rate of 98.73% and one of the lowest mortality rates at 0.5%, which has been nationally and globally acknowledged, claimed Sarma, who is also the state health minister.He further said that the vaccination drive to give the people a reasonable safety net is the next objective with a provision of 6.6 lakh vaccine doses."I am happy to inform this august House that more than 1.15 lakh doses inoculations have been conducted till date. In parallel, the fight to keep further waves of this virus from appearing in our state continues," he said.Sarma also said that during the course of the last year, the government set up 1,000 ICU beds and 4,500 regular hospital beds along with a provision of 1,408 ventilators and 4,541 oxygen cylinders for the fight against the pandemic.Besides, he acknowledged the services by the Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) workers during the Covid-19 pandemic and recognising their importance, the government decided to enhance the wages of 32,546 ASHA workers by ₹1,000 per month.Sarma said the Covid-19 pandemic not only threatened the lives and health of people, but also resulted in a never- witnessed-before lockdown across the globe, including India, which impacted the GDP."Assam too faced adverse growth figures, especially in the first two quarters of this financial year, and our revenue targets were affected. Our State, however, exhibited exemplary resilience and financial adroitness."I am justifiably proud of the fact that we did not make any deductions in the salaries of our government employees, as had been the case with some other states, and also ensured a timely disbursement of their pensions," the finance minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-gave-assam-rs-262-crore-for-covid-fight-state-finance-minister-101613131726653.html
12-02-2021||India||India has not conceded any territory to China along LAC, says defence ministry||Hours after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi accused the government of ceding Indian territory to the Chinese and raised questions over the agreement with China for disengagement of troops in Pangong lake areas in eastern Ladakh, the ministry of defence issued a strongly-worded statement on Friday.The defence ministry said India has not conceded any territory as a result of the agreement finalised with China and added that the effective safeguarding of country's national interest and territory in the eastern Ladakh sector has taken place because the government reposed full faith in the capabilities of the armed forces."India has not conceded any territory as a result of this agreement. On the contrary, it has enforced observance and respect for LAC (Line of Actual Control) and prevented any unilateral change in the status quo," the defence ministry said in a statement.Also read: India and China start pulling back tanks from southern bank of Pangong LakeThe ministry also asserted that India has persistently maintained the right to patrol up to Finger 8, including in the current understanding with China.Defence minister Rajnath Singh had informed Parliament on Thursday that India and China have reached an agreement on disengagement in the north and south bank of Pangong lake in eastern Ladakh that mandates both sides to cease forward deployment of troops in a "phased, coordinated and verifiable" manner.Singh had said that China will pull back its troops to the east of Finger 8 areas in the northern bank of Pangong lake and the Indian Army will be based at its permanent base at Dhan Singh Thapa Post near Finger 3 in the region.The ministry said on Friday that Indian territory is at Finger 8 and not Finger 4. "The territory of India is as depicted by the map of India and includes more than 43,000 sq km currently under illegal occupation of China since 1962," the defence ministry said.It added: "Even the Line of Actual Control (LAC), as per the Indian perception, is at Finger 8, not at Finger 4. That is why India has persistently maintained the right to patrol up to Finger 8, including in the current understanding with China."Referring to Singh's statement, the defence ministry stated that there are outstanding problems to be addressed, including at Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang.Also read: Use the Ladakh crisis as an opportunity | Opinion"The outstanding issues are to be taken up within 48 hrs of the completion of the Pangong Tso disengagement," it added.More than nine months after the clash in Galwan Valley, troops of India and China on Wednesday started pulling back armoured elements - tanks and infantry combat vehicles - from heights on the southern bank of Pangong Tso.The withdrawal of the armoured elements from one of the multiple friction points in the east Ladakh sector came nearly a fortnight after military commanders of the two armies agreed on January 24 to push for an early disengagement of their frontline troops.The Chinese defence ministry's website on Wednesday had issued a statement and said the frontline units of Chinese and Indian armed forces have begun to disengage at Pangong lake on February 10 in line with the consensus reached during the ninth round of military commander-level talks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-has-not-conceded-any-territory-to-china-along-lac-says-defence-ministry-101613126872751.html

Also Read | Jagan writes to PM Modi, requests him to drop plan to privatise Vizag Steel“I am serious and want all the MLAs [members of legislative assembly] and MPs [members of Parliament] of the state pressure on the Centre,” he said. He asked the state government to convene a special assembly session to pass a resolution against the privatisation.TDP leader Palla Srinivasa Rao launched a fast-unto-death at the local party office on Wednesday demanding the Centre withdraw its proposal. K Atchan Naidu, another leader of the party, accused chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy’s government of being hand in glove with the Centre in privatising the plant.Reddy has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting him to withdraw its plan to privatise the RINL and approve a revival package for it.State industries minister Mekapati Gautam Reddy asked the Centre to hand over the project to the state government.Ruling YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) parliamentarian, M V Satyanarayana, also undertook a 24-hour fast against the move. Minister Muthamsetti Srinivasa Rao took part in a sit-in at the steel plant workers against the proposed privatisation on Friday.Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Wednesday told Parliament that South Korean steel giant POSCO was keen on acquiring a majority stake in the plant. Pradhan said a non-binding MoU was signed in October 2019 between the RINL and POSCO. Subsequently, a Joint Working Group was formed for the exchange of information. As per the MoU, POSCO wishes to have at least 50% shareholding while the RINL share would be in the form of the land for setting up of the plant, the Union minister said.YSRCP general secretary V Vijay Sai Reddy, who is in charge of the party in Visakhapatnam, held a meeting of all political party leaders barring TDP on Thursday and called the privatisation a conspiracy. He said the YSRC lawmakers will meet Union home minister Amit Shah and submit a representation against the privatisation.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its alliance partner, Jana Sena, have also expressed concern over the privatisation. “We shall prevail upon the [central] government to drop plan the plan,” BJP leader D Purandeshwari said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vizag-steel-privatisation-plan-snowballs-into-political-issue-in-andhra-pradesh-101613131586653.html

Saugata Roy, a senior leader of the ruling party in the eastern state, said the party will send another 'grassroots’ worker to the Upper House.“We didn't know he would resign. However, it is not a shock. He was not a grassroots leader and had lost the Lok Sabha elections. Mamata Banerjee sent him to the Rajya Sabha. 'Trinamool' means grassroots. It will give chance to other grassroots workers to emerge,” Roy was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Also watch | Will Dinesh Trivedi join BJP ahead of polls? Kailash Vijayvargiya respondsTrivedi had met the Nationalist Congress Party’s (NCP’s) chief Sharad Pawar and expressed his dissatisfaction, Roy said. "I did not know he (Trivedi) would resign as he did not tell the party as well. He expressed dissatisfaction to Sharad Pawar but nobody encouraged him to resign and this decision came all of a sudden. I spoke to him four to five days back and he did not convey that he will take this extreme step," he was quoted as saying by ANI.Trivedi’s announcement about his resignation, citing his inability to do anything against the violence in his state, comes after a series of exits from Mamata Banerjee's party ahead of the West Bengal assembly elections in April-May. Several leaders of the Trinamool, including Suvendu Adhikari, state minister Rajib Banerjee and a few other Trinamool Congress MLAs, left West Bengal’s ruling party in January and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Several others have also followed suit."Many people have left the party but it does not have any impact on the TMC. The TMC is not a sinking ship,” Roy said, according to ANI.Soon after Trivedi said he will quit, the BJP’s national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya said he is welcome to join them. “Not just Dinesh Trivedi ji, whoever wants to do honest work, cannot stay in Trinamool Congress. If he wants to join the Bharatiya Janata Party, we will welcome him,” Vijayvargiya said, according to news agency ANI.The assembly elections for 294 seats in West Bengal are scheduled to be held in April-May year. However, the Election Commission of India is yet to declare the dates for the polls.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-a-shock-says-trinamool-after-dinesh-trivedi-announces-resignation-101613129261856.html
12-02-2021||India||Lalu bail: CBI says he’s four months short of serving half term, HC seeks proof||The Jharkhand high court on Friday asked the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to furnish documentary proof within a week in support of its claim that incarcerated Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad was four months short of serving half of the sentence awarded to him in a corruption case. Prasad will be eligible for bail once he completes half of the term (42 months).The bench of justice Aparesh Kumar Singh, which is hearing Prasad’s bail plea, posted the matter for hearing next on February 19 after the CBI argued he has so far served 37 months and six days in custody and not 42 months.Prasad has been in jail since December 2017 after his conviction in three cases. He has secured bail in two other cases after the completion of half of his sentence. Prasad filed a bail application in the third case in the high court last year. He submitted an affidavit last week saying he has completed half of the sentence in the third case while urging the high court to grant him bail. Prasad said he was airlifted to New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences last month after his condition deteriorated.CBI’s lawyer, Rajiv Sinha said, Prasad has submitted the lower court’s orders to show the time he has spent in jail starting from 1997. “But no document is annexed to show when he was actually taken into remand after production. We are going submit every detail along with lower court’s order sheets to prove that he is still to serve over four months in jail to complete half the sentence.”Prasad has been convicted in cases involving the fraudulent withdrawal of ₹3.76 crore from a treasury in the 1990s when he was the chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lalu-bail-cbi-says-he-s-four-months-short-of-serving-half-term-hc-seeks-proof-101613128286693.html

The development was confirmed by House chairperson and vice president M Venkaiah Naidu's office, which received a letter of nomination from the Congress party.The post of the Leader of Opposition in the Upper House will fall vacant after the retirement of Azad on February 15.Kharge, a Dalit politician from Karnataka, was the leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha from 2014 to 2019. Kharge will be the 17th Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha since December 1969.The grand old party could not get the post of the leader of opposition in the previous and the current Lok Sabha as its numbers were less than the mandated 10 per cent of the total number of seats in the Lower House.Azad was elected to the Rajya Sabha from Jammu and Kashmir in 2015. In his farewell speech on Tuesday, Azad said that he is proud to be an Indian Muslim. "I am among those fortunate people who never went to Pakistan. When I read about circumstances in Pakistan, I feel proud to be a Hindustani Muslim,” he said."If any Muslim should feel proud in the world, it should be the Indian Muslim. Over the years, we have seen how Muslims countries from Afghanistan to Iraq getting destroyed. There are no Hindus or Christians there - they are fighting amongst themselves," he added.An emotional Prime Minister Narendra Modi had bid adieu to Azad, recalling his contribution to the country, the House and also his party. PM Modi also said that the person who will replace Azad as Leader of Opposition "will have difficulty matching his work because he was not only concerned about his party but also about the country and the House".(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-picks-mallikarjun-kharge-as-next-leader-of-opposition-in-rajya-sabha-101613127991183.html
12-02-2021||India||'Scrap farm laws first': Rahul Gandhi to PM Modi's offer of talks to farmers||The Centre's three farm laws will render 40% of the people dependent on agriculture jobless and the control will slip into the hands of corporates, said former Congress president Rahul Gandhi joining a kisan mahapanchayat in Rajasthan as part of the party's support to the farmers' protest against the laws passed in September.The Congress leader urged the Centre to scrap the three agricultural laws before further talks with farmers - who have been camping at Delhi border points for two months seeking a statutory guarantee on minimum support prices, or MSP, and pushing for repeal of the new laws."PM Modi says in Parliament that he wants to talk to the farmers but what talks do you want with farmers? End these laws first and then farmers will talk to you."You are snatching away land and the future of the farmers and asking for talks with them, there is no need for talks. First cancel these farm laws and then talk to farmers," he said at Pilibanga in Hanumangarh district at krishi upaj mandi.Defending the farm laws in Parliament, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the new laws are not binding on the farmers and that they are free to sell their produce anywhere in the country. The PM again invited them for talks, underlining that reform in the agriculture sector was the need of the hour.The Congress will stand with farmers, poor and workers and will ensure these farm laws are withdrawn, stressed Rahul Gandhi, adding that the Modi government wants to give control of agriculture into the hands of some corporates."Agriculture protects food security of the country and India's 40% people are dependent on agriculture which means crores of people are part of it, including small traders, workers, commission agents and others. The Congress has always tried that this business should not go to a single entity and it should stay in the hands of 40% people", said the Congress leader."The first law says any big businessman can buy unlimited crops from any farmer in the country... If any person can buy all the crops then there will remain no need for any mandi so the first law means to kill mandi,” Gandhi said explaining the laws.Such a law would allow businessmen to hoard and control the prices of agricultural commodities, he said.“Hoarding is unlawful but when this second law will be enforced then unlimited hoarding will begin and India's biggest businessmen will do it,” alleged Gandhi.Gandhi stressed that the third law will limit farmers’ ability to seek justice when the right price for his crops is denied to him."The aim of these three farm laws is to give control of agriculture into the hands of two businessmen," alleged Gandhi without naming the businessmen.The first attack on farmers, workers and small traders was made through demonetisation, claimed Rahul Gandhi, adding that it robbed poor people of their money.The GST was the second assault on the small and medium size businesses as the government wants to clear way for its corporate friends, claimed Rahul."Small and middle size traders have still not understood GST as there are five different tax slabs and their business is ruined," said Gandhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scrap-farm-laws-first-rahul-gandhi-to-pm-modi-s-offer-of-talks-to-farmers-101613127779513.html
12-02-2021||India||China’s actions have led to confrontation, mutual distrust: Army chief||China’s rising footprint in India’s neighbourhood, coupled with that country’s attempts to unilaterally alter the status quo along disputed borders, has led to confrontation and mutual distrust, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said on Friday. His comments, at a seminar on evolving security challenges in the country’s North-east and the way forward, come at a time when disengagement between Indian and Chinese troops is underway in the Pangong Tso area of eastern Ladakh. Experts said China’s actions were aimed at curtailing India’s leadership role in the region. “China’s aggressive behaviour along the Line of Actual Control as part of its strategy of military coercion, and increased footprint and investments in India’s neighborhood aim at restricting India strategic space and leadership role,” said Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), a former director general of military operations. The army chief said the regional security environment was characterised by Chinese belligerence in the Indo-Pacific, Beijing’s hostility towards weaker nations and its relentless drive to create regional dependencies through steps such as the multi-billion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)– a state-backed global infrastructure development project covering scores of countries. Also Read | Need punch to offensive poise, says army chief amid ‘newer threats’Since it was unveiled in 2013 by President Xi Jinping, BRI has expanded to cover a vast swath of territory from South America to the Arctic, and includes plans to build a vast network of highways, ports, power plants, pipelines and other infrastructure. Both India and the United States oppose BRI because it favours Chinese firms and Beijing employs predatory lending practices. “The resultant Sino-US rivalry has created regional imbalances and instability,” Naravane said.  Regional and internal connectivity is acutely linked to security, and it is central to unleashing the potential of the North-east and balancing the influence of China, the army chief said. “Failure to deliver on promises has plagued our efforts at improving regional connectivity. The (India-backed) Kaladan multi-modal transport project (in Myanmar) and the trilateral highway (India-Myanmar-Thailand) have both seen cost and time overruns,” Naravane said.He said a renewed focus on the North-east was in order in the wake of the ongoing security dynamics across India’s borders and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. “Although endowed with natural resources, the North-east is a laggard in growth and development. Protracted insurgencies, legacy issues further accentuated after partition and inefficient integration with rest of India account for much of what the region faces today,” Naravane said. He said the security situation in the North-east had improved significantly and two army divisions had been pulled out of counter-insurgency and internal security duties, and were now solely focused on their operational role along the northern borders. “This has been a significant achievement. The operational responsibility of these areas has now been taken over by the Assam Rifles,” he said. The move will help the army focus on the borders and train for conventional operations. Several parliamentary panels have made recommendations in their reports to reduce the army’s exposure to counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism duties because it results in blunting the force’s focus on its main task - defending the country from external aggression.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinas-actions-have-led-to-confrontation-mutual-distrust-army-chief-101613126606372.html
12-02-2021||India||India, pharmacy of the world, falls behind on vaccinations at home||India has won plaudits for gifting and selling Covid-19 vaccines around the world, but it will have to crank up the pace of immunisations at home to meet its targets.Having reported the world's second-highest number of Covid-19 cases after the United States, India wants to innoculate 300 million people - a fifth of its population - against the virus by August.However, in four weeks health workers vaccinated only 7.5 million frontline workers on priority, a rate at which it would take India several years to reach its goal."Vaccination programmes usually start off slow and then ramp up as logistic and operational issues are sorted out," said Gagandeep Kang, Professor of Microbiology at the Christian Medical College in Vellore."In India, we are fortunate that supply of vaccines is not a rate-limiting step, but to meet the timelines set by the government, we will have to immunise somewhere between 4 and 5 times more people each day than we are doing today."The government says it is ready to step up vaccinations from next month, including by roping in more private hospitals, once identified groups from the general public are given the shots. A government online vaccine platform told Reuters it could handle 10 million inoculations a day.Also read| Ministry gets fake website charging ₹4K to ₹6K for Covid-19 vaccines blockedThe health ministry also says India is the fastest to reach the 7 million milestone, though immunisation relative to population has been much higher in many other countries.Several big Indian states, such as Tamil Nadu and Punjab, have covered fewer than 40% of their high-risk people such as nurses, doctors and hospital cleaning staff, worrying the federal government.New Delhi has urged states to accelerate vaccinations after a review found "substantial" room for improvement, though the government thinks involving too many private players in the campaign might be tricky."Administering vaccines needs a system because of the nature of the disease," said a senior government official involved in the process, declining to be named citing service rules."They have to take details of the person taking it, record and monitor it."'STOKING INHIBITIONS'India, which makes 60% of all vaccines in the world, has gifted or sold COVID-19 shots to 17 countries and has requests from five more. The government, however, told parliament this week it was coordinating with the manufacturers to ensure adequate supplies for its own campaign.Also read| PM Modi to inauguarate Nasscom's annual event on tech for 'better normal'It also says infrastructure such as cold storage and special vehicles are not an issue, while acknowledging vaccine hesitancy among some beneficiaries.India has deployed the COVAXIN shot developed by Bharat Biotech in partnership with the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research, as well as a vaccine licensed from AstraZeneca and Oxford University.Some doctors and the opposition-ruled state of Chhattisgarh, however, are worried about COVAXIN, which was approved last month for emergency use without any efficacy data from a late-stage trial.The health ministry has chastised Chhattisgarh for "stoking inhibitions" over vaccines during a pandemic. India recorded 9,309 daily new cases of Covid-19 on Friday, increasing the total number to 10.88 million cases since the pandemic began. Deaths rose by 87 to a total of 155,447."In such unprecedented times, you should help address any vaccine hesitancy and do what's in the best interest of people, not further vested interests!" Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Twitter in response to a letter from his Chhattisgarh counterpart.Bharat Biotech has said efficacy data from the late-stage clinical trial will be out by next month. The government has called the shot safe and effective.India is also expected to approve other shots in coming months, including Russia's Sputnik V and products from Cadila Healthcare, Novavax and Johnson & Johnson .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-pharmacy-of-the-world-falls-behind-on-vaccinations-at-home-101613123245585.html
12-02-2021||India||‘40% would be unemployed’: Rahul Gandhi jabs farm laws at ‘mahapanchayat'||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday once again took on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the central government over farmers’ issues as well as the disengagement plan by Indian and Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh amid a months-long border row between the two countries. Gandhi, who had on Thursday explained the ‘content’ and ‘intent’ of the three farm laws in the Lok Sabha, addressed a ‘Kisan Mahapanchayat’ in Rajasthan’s Pilibanga.“I gave a speech in Parliament yesterday on the three central agricultural laws brought by PM Modi and explained the content and intend behind them. Today, I’m going to once again tell you why these laws have been introduced,” Gandhi said, addressing his audience.Also Read | Congress' Rahul Gandhi slams ‘intent, content’ of farm lawsAgriculture is the largest ‘business’ in India, and globally, the Congress leader said, explaining that this is because it provides food to crores of people across the world.“Forty per cent of India’s population runs this business in the country. These include farmers, labourers, small shopkeepers, businessmen and arthiyas. Congress has always tried to ensure that the business is never controlled by just one person,” Gandhi said.He added that the media won’t explain this to them because it belongs to ‘those very same people who want to snatch agriculture from the 40% people.’ The first law will destroy the mandis, the former Congress president explained. The second law, he said, means that any wealthy person can hoard agricultural products for an unlimited duration of time and thus control their rates. “The third law says that the farmer cannot go to court if he asks for the right price for his produce,” Gandhi said, reiterating his allegation that the aim behind these laws is to ‘transfer agriculture into the hands of these two to three wealthy businessmen.’“This is an attack not on farmers but on 40% of India’s population. It is just that the farmer is aware and he has already realised this. He can see the future that if these laws are implemented, his land is gone,” the MP from Kerala’s Wayanad stressed.Recalling the coronavirus pandemic, he said that when labourers begged PM Modi for a ticket to return to their homes, he refused. “The first step was demonetisation, second GST, third was Covid-19 and the fourth was these three laws. The goal is to snatch employment from 40% people,” Gandhi said, once again vowing that the Congress will make sure that the legislations are repealed.After criticising the Prime Minister over the Ladakh disengagement plan earlier in the day, Gandhi once again accused the government of ceding Indian territory to China. “China entered India, snatched our territory and killed our soldiers. Yesterday, the defence minister said in Parliament and said that an agreement has been reached. The agreement is that Narendra Modi has handed over India’s sacred territory to China,” he said.Also Read | ‘This isn’t give and take’: Rahul Gandhi attacks PM Modi over China border pactDefence minister Rajnath Singh had briefed Parliament about the agreement between the Indian Army and China’s People’s Liberation Army that could end the months-long standoff.

12-02-2021||India||LJD MP Shreyams Kumar slams Centre for 'reduced' allocation of funds to MNREGA||Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD) MP MV Shreyams Kumar on Friday attacked the government in Rajya Sabha for "reducing" the allocation of funds to MNREGA saying the next budget could be the "last nail in the coffin" of the rural employment guarantee scheme.He also criticised the government for reduced funds for the healthcare sector and for women empowerment in the union budget. Participating in the debate on the budget, Kumar hit out at the government for privatisation of LIC and the lack of efforts on its part to bail out BSNL. He alleged government's apathy towards MNREGA scheme and said the lower allocation indicates that the next next budget could be the end of the scheme. "The budget has shown 'krodha' (anger), 'mada' (false pride or ego) and 'matsarya' (envy or jealousy) on the flagship programme of the UPA government and the world's largest rural employment guarantee programme - MNREGA with a reduced allocation of ₹38,500 crore i.e., a 34% reduction," he said in the Upper House. If this is any indication, the "next budget will be the last nail in the coffin of MNREGA", he added. Talking about budget outlay for the health sector, Kumar said the allocation is lower than the revised estimate of this fiscal year. "The finance minister claims that there is an increase of 137% in the budget outlay for health. This is nothing but a jugglery of figures," he charged. The budget estimate for health is ₹74,602 crore only, which actually is lower by ₹7,843 crore i.e., lower by 9.5% than the revised estimate, he added.Similarly, there is a 95% reduction for Women Empowerment Mission, Kumar said.Attacking the government, he said the proposal for privatising the largest and most trusted insurance company in India - LIC - and sale of central PSUs two public sector banks and one general insurance company militates against the establishment of a socialistic pattern of society envisaged by the country's founding fathers. "Article 39 (c) of the Constitution provides for regulating the economic system of the country so as to prevent concentration of wealth and resources in a few hands," he noted. Kumar said that no attempt has been made in the budget to strengthen or bailout a struggling giant like BSNL. "When the whole world is going digital, BSNL could play a vital role in improving connectivity especially in the rural areas of the country. The neglect shown by the Union Budget is the last straw on the camel's back as far as an ailing BSNL is concerned," he noted. Kumar said the Budget has no strategy for increasing revenues. "With a poor track record in generating non-tax revenues, the BJP government's budget makes several false and lofty promises for increased spending on infrastructure etc with hardly anything at hand to spend," he added. The MP also questioned the rationale of continued suspension of MPLADS."Kerala from which I am from, continues with the Special Development fund for MLAs. So, do other states like Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. We are approached by our constituents for small works in the local area. It is a paradox that what the MLAs in the states could do, the MPs cannot do," he said. Kumar said the finance minister has eyed on the ensuing elections in West Bengal, Kerala, Assam and Tamil Nadu and promised allocation for road infrastructure. "The people in these states cannot be swayed away by the 'moha' (delusion) created by the finance minister," he noted. Kumar said the government overlooked several demands of Kerala in the Budget."Even though ₹1,000 crore were allocated for the welfare of tea workers in Assam and West Bengal, Kerala is totally ignored. Kerala produces 60.76 million kilograms of tea every year and is ranked fourth in India," he said.Smilarly, Kerala's demand for Trivandrum-Kasaragode semi high speed rail project, setting up of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Sabari Rail project, which aims to put the hill shrine into the railway network have been totally ignored, Kumar said.Besides, the long pending demand for special railway zone for Kerala has also not been considered, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ljd-mp-shreyams-kumar-slams-centre-for-reduced-allocation-of-funds-to-mnrega-101613124500288.html
12-02-2021||India||Lake formation upstream of Rishiganga likely to drain in coming days: Geologists||Geologists have warned that a lake has formed upstream of Rishiganga valley which could flow out gradually, impacting rescue efforts downstream.“There is a place where Rontighat or Ronti river meets Rishiganga. The debris that fell with the glacier breach on February 7 has blocked the Rishiganga water there, creating a lake. A geologist, Naresh Rana, went to the place to physically inspect it with the help of villagers. Satellite images have also confirmed lake formation. The water will definitely spill as the lake is full now. We have been informed that authorities are trying to drain the water so that rescue work can resume after that,” said Navin Juyal, retired geologist from the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad.“The lake will not collapse but it will gradually drain, which can be dangerous for those engaged in rescue work,” Juyal added.“Day before yesterday, when we found out about the lake formation, we had informed the sub divisional magistrate, divisional magistrate and vice chancellor of Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University, where I am working. We were hoping that the Indo-Tibetan Border Police or other rescue agencies can give it way manually so that the water and debris come down gradually because if it topples, it can be very dangerous. The good thing is water has started draining from the dam. But the fear of toppling exists. The agencies have been informed,” said geologist and professor YP Sundriyal.Juyal explained that some boulders in the higher reaches are as big as a house. “It is understood from various satellite images and aerial surveys that rocks and boulders from Nanda Ghunti or Trishul, the two peaks here, have fallen on the glacier. There was no lake on the surface of the glacier but there may have been subsurface water bodies. The glacier surface along with ice, water, debris, fell on February 7. Because of the remoteness of the region, studying it manually is very difficult.”The India Meteorological Department , meanwhile, warned that a fresh feeble Western Disturbance is likely to impact the Western Himalayas from February 14 to 16. There is likely to be light rainfall (up to 1 cm) and snowfall (up to 10 cm) in the northern parts of Uttarakhand, including Chamoli district, during that period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lake-formation-upstream-of-rishiganga-likely-to-drain-in-coming-daysgeologists-101613124686405.html

We have been helping several countries with the corona vaccine which is in line with the philosophy of Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam," said the minister.The economic strength of a country depends on innovation and technology and the budget has also focussed on it, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-will-bring-investments-create-employment-petroleum-minister-101613124150119.html
12-02-2021||India||SC upholds NGT’s order asking Goa govt to notify private land as forest||The Supreme Court has dismissed an appeal filed by the Goa government challenging a decision of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) which had, back in 2018, ordered it to notify 46 square kilometres of land as a private forest. In a brief order, the bench of Justices Rohinton Fali Nariman and Aniruddha Bose said, “We find no ground to interfere with the impugned order passed by the Tribunal. The appeal is, accordingly, dismissed.”In 2018, the NGT ordered the Goa government to notify an area of 46.11 square kilometres of privately owned land as private forest, bringing to a close an over two-decade old saga in which various committees were set up seeking to include or exclude privately held land forests in Goa and give them statutory protection. Also Read | Supreme Court issues notice to Andhra Pradesh on Odisha contempt pleaThe NGT order came on a petition filed by Goa Foundation alleging that the state was dragging its feet on demarcating private forests. The organisation based its plea on a 1997 SC direction to the states to identify areas which are “forests”, irrespective of whether they are so notified, recognised or classified under any law, and irrespective of their ownership.Privately held lands spread across five hectares or more, contiguous with or near existing protected forests and with more than 75% of the trees of forest species are to be earmarked as private forests.However, the Goa government resisted doing so, claiming that such notification was prejudicial to the owners of these lands and had, instead, appointed revenue officer Anthony D’Souza to file a report. In his report, D’Souza recommended identification of land as private forest can be done only if the entire survey holding of the affected party is demarcated and taken up for tree count and had sought that no final notification be issued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-upholds-ngt-s-order-asking-goa-govt-to-notify-private-land-as-forest-101613123966479.html
12-02-2021||India||Lufthansa terminates services of 103 India-based flight attendants||Lufthansa has terminated the services of 103 India-based flight attendants after they allegedly sought "job assurance" from the management while the German airlines group had offered them leave without pay option for two years,sources close to the developments said.These employees had been working on a fixed-term contract with the airline and some of them were with the carrier for more than 15 years, the sources added.In a statement to PTI, a Lufthansa spokesperson said that severe financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic leaves it with no choice but to restructure the airline and as part of that "it will not be extending the fixed-term employment contracts of its Delhi-based flight attendants".However, Lufthansa did not provide details on the number of flight attendants who have been terminated.According to the spokesperson, Indian cabin crew with unlimited contracts remain unaffected from restructuring as it "was able to reach individual agreements with these flight attendants"."Lufthansa regrets to confirm that it will not be extending the fixed-term employment contracts of its Delhi-based flight attendants. The severe financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic leaves Lufthansa no choice but to restructure the airline. This includes personnel-related measures in Germany and Europe as well as in key international markets like India," the statement said.Given our current cash burn of several hundred million euros every month, Lufthansa – like all airlines worldwide – must take steps to secure its future, it said, adding that "since we must plan with 150 fewer aircraft in the long run (by 2025) it follows that required cabin staff in all our markets is also affected."Even now, the statement said that low demand for international air travel resulting particularly from government restrictions leaves cabin staff with little or no work left to do."We exhausted every possible option and had even already reached an agreement with the Indian union we were in close consultation at all times. It would have avoided compulsory redundancies for our cabin staff."We had signed an agreement with the Indian union providing for two years of unpaid leave, with Lufthansa continuing to provide the local health insurance – even for enrolled family members," the statement said.Further, Lufthansa said it was willing to "absorb" all associated premiums during this period but "unfortunately, consent to the agreement was revoked by the union on December 31.The sources, however, alleged that Lufthansa terminated the services of 103 Delhi-based flight attendants on fixed-term contracts overnight, without serving any prior notice to them, citing the coronavirus pandemic."These terminations happened overnight without giving any prior notice. Some of these terminated people had been employed for nearly 15 years... The management had wanted us to proceed on leave without pay for two years. We had agreed for it but wanted job assurance after the completion of the LWP period," as per the sources.According to Lufthansa's statement, not being able to reach an agreement for cabin crew with fixed-term employment contracts has forced it to take this step as part of an inevitable restructuring of Lufthansa Group."It should be noted that this restructuring is not limited to India but affects all our worldwide markets and to a great extent includes our home markets, especially Germany. However, there we were able to reach initial agreements with unions to help weather the crisis," the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lufthansa-terminates-services-of-103-india-based-flight-attendants-101613122918940.html

If he wants to join the Bharatiya Janata Party, we will welcome him,” Vijayvargiya, the BJP's national general secretary, was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Trivedi’s dramatic announcement came while he was participating in the debate on the Union Budget and said he feels suffocated in the House as he is unable to do anything about the ongoing violence in West Bengal. “If you sit here quietly and cannot do anything, then it is better that you resign from here and go to the land of Bengal and be with people," he said in the Upper House. "What I mean to say is the way violence is taking place in our state. Sitting here, I am feeling perplexed as to what should I do," he added.Also watch: TMC's Dinesh Trivedi announces resignation in Rajya SabhaThe Trinamool lawmaker said he is unable to bear the incidents that are happening in West Bengal.

My voice of conscience is saying what Swami Vivekananda used to say - 'Arise, awake and stop not till the goal is reached'," Trivedi said.However, the Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh said there is a due process for resigning from the House and asked Trivedi to submit his resignation in writing to the House chairperson.Trivedi’s announcement of resignation comes ahead of the assembly elections in West Bengal, which are expected to be April-May this year. It also comes after a clutch of leaders from the Trinamool, including Suvendu Adhikary, Rajib Banerjee and a few Trinamool MLAs, quit West Bengal’s ruling party and joined the BJP.The Trinamool party issued a statement after “Trivedi’s announcement. “Trinamool means grassroots.

12-02-2021||India||Twitter blocks 97% of accounts, posts flagged by IT Ministry||Twitter has blocked over 97% of the accounts and posts flagged by the IT Ministry for provocative content and misinformation around farmers' protest, sources said.This followed a meeting between Twitter representatives and the Information Technology Secretary on Wednesday evening where the US-based microblogging platform was issued a stern warning to comply with local laws or be prepared for action.The Ministry had questioned Twitter's delay in taking action on its order to block provocative content that could impact public law and order, whereas the American company had been quick to crack down when a similar instance occurred at US Capitol Hill.According to the sources, Twitter has now complied with the orders and over 97% of the accounts flagged have been blocked.Twitter did not respond to queries on the matter.On February 4, Twitter was asked to take down 1,178 accounts with links to Pakistan and Khalistan supporters that were spreading misinformation and provocative content related to farmers' protest.Prior to that, the government had sought blocking of 257 tweets and handles in connection with the agitation by farmers over the new agricultural laws. Twitter had complied with the orders only to restore the accounts hours later.Twitter on Wednesday morning had said it has suspended over 500 accounts and blocked access to several others within India, but maintained that it would not block accounts of "news media entities, journalists, activists and politicians" as doing so "would violate their fundamental right to free expression" guaranteed under the country's law.It, however, yielded to the orders later after the crucial meeting on Wednesday evening.In a statement after the meeting, IT Ministry had stated that the microblogging platform had been asked to take strong action against "well-coordinated" campaigns "designed to create disharmony and unrest" in the country.Monique Meche, Twitter Vice President Global Public Policy and Jim Baker, Deputy General Counsel and Vice President Legal, had affirmed Twitter's commitment towards following Indian laws and rules.The executives had also requested for better engagement between the Indian government and the company's global team. Sources said Twitter's latest move to block the flagged accounts is itself a validation that the government's orders were backed by sound reasoning and logic.The government had made it clear that it will not negotiate with the platforms while insisting on compliance with its orders as it believed that a private commercial entity in India cannot unilaterally decide on public law and order, ignoring the democratic values of the country.IT Ministry was of the view that Twitter, being an intermediary, was required to take immediate action after receiving the government's notice to block handles, but did not move with haste to take down "atrocious" hashtags and "incendiary" content even amid a volatile situation.IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had recently emphasised that the government is all for freedom of speech and expression and that it remains investor-friendly, but disrespecting democratic values is not acceptable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-blocks-97-of-accounts-posts-flagged-by-it-ministry-101613121276706.html

Adoption of digital technologies has accelerated at a rapid pace and technology is playing a critical role in how we live, work, and communicate in this new normal," she said.Gupta noted that this shift has also made organisations re-write the playbooks on aspects like trust and ethics, privacy, culture, future of work, and responsible use and build of tech."NTLF 2021's overarching theme is 'shaping the future towards a better normal'. It aims to achieve three key objectives – celebrating technology that has served as a backbone for businesses during the crisis, draw a roadmap for the way ahead towards building a hyper-digital future, and bring out the importance of trust and responsible tech in this hyper virtual world," she added.Gupta said the event will create a collaborative learning experience where industry leaders will discuss some of the pressing topics such as the role of leadership in the new normal; opportunities that lie ahead; embedding the values of organisational culture; and will discuss trends in emerging areas like healthcare, energy, cybersecurity, among others.The three-day event will have stalwarts from the Indian and global technology industry, C-level executives and expert academics, including Arvind Krishna (IBM Chairman and CEO), Chuck Robbins (Cisco Chairman and CEO), Eric S Yuan (Zoom founder and CEO), Julie Sweet (Accenture CEO) and Steve Brown (Futurist, Author and Motivational Speaker).Aiman Ezzat (Capgemini Group CEO), Anant Maheshwari (Microsoft India President), Salil Parekh (Infosys CEO and MD), Thierry Delaporte (Wipro CEO and MD), C Vijayakumar (HCL Technologies President and CEO), Keshav R Murugesh (WNS Group CEO) and Tiger Tyagarajan (Genpact CEO) and other renowned dignitaries will also attend the event.The virtual forum is expected to witness over 16,000 attendees across over 50 sessions and will host more than 65 practitioners, subject matter experts and leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-inauguarate-nasscom-s-annual-event-on-tech-for-better-normal-101613120726258.html

12-02-2021||India||Ahead of 2022 panchayat polls, BJD gets its electoral machinery moving||The Biju Janata Dal (BJD) has thrown its full organisational weight behind winning largely inconsequential by-polls to zilla and gram panchayats, and for panchayat samiti and ward member posts as it prepares to counter the Bharatiya Janata Party’s rise in the state ahead of the 2022 panchayat polls.On Thursday, Union home minister Amit Shah while addressing BJP's social media meet said a victory for the party in Bengal polls would pave the way for electoral victories in Odisha, Telangana and the rest of India. While the BJP election machinery has often steamrolled rivals in most states, beating the BJD is unlikely to be a cakewalk, its deployment in the by-polls suggests.On Thursday and Friday, by-polls in two zilla parishad zones in Mayurbhanj and Angul district, 17 sarpanch posts in as many gram panchayats were held along with for five posts of panchayat samitis and 92 ward members in 10 districts due to deaths and resignations of the existing representatives. Yet, the BJD has deputed its MPs, MLAs and ministers with the direction to ensure a 100% result.In the tribal-dominated Mayurbhanj district, the by-polls are being held in a zilla parishad zone in Saraskana assembly constituency, while in Angul district it is being held in Parjang assembly constituency. Though the BJP commands supreme majority after winning 50 of the 56 zilla parishads in 2017 panchayatiraj polls, the BJD has still mobilised its workers to win the lone zilla parishad post.In another sign of its intent, in Angul district, where the regional party commands a majority, having won 16 of the 28 zilla parishad zones, yet it has sent its Dhenkanal MP as well as local MLAs to campaign."In Mayurbhanj district, revenue minister Sudam Marandi as well as several senior party functionaries have been working towards winning the zilla parishad zone. For eight panchayats in the zilla parishad zone, eight party functionaries have been deputed. We know that the win would not change anything, but the party leadership wants to ensure that it leaves nothing to chance before next year's panchayat polls. In Angul too, we did not want to concede the seat to BJP and sent MP Mahesh Sahoo there. Organisational secretary Pranab Prakash Das has been checking on the progress of our campaign regularly through WhatsApp video calls," said a BJD leader on condition of anonymity.Mayurbhanj remains central to the BJD's game plan for next year's panchayat polls as the party is keen to reverse the setback it suffered in 2017 panchayat polls when the BJP surged in rural Odisha by winning 473 of the 853 zilla parishad seats that went to the polls. In 2016 panchayatiraj polls, BJP won 9 of the zilla parishads, most of them in western and tribal Odisha, helping the party win 8 of the 21 Lok Sabha seats and secure 38.37 % of the votes, a rise of 16.49 % from its 2014 figures.Aware that the BJP will focus on Odisha after the Bengal polls, the BJD leadership has been trying to strengthen the party's support base in western Odisha districts of Kalahandi, Bolangir, Sambalpur, Bargarh and tribal Odisha districts of Mayurbhanj, Koraput and Sundargarh. In 2019 Lok Sabha polls, BJD lost out to the BJP in almost the entire western Odisha belt and to the Congress and the BJP in tribal Odisha. Nabarangpur was the only saving grace.The BJD's game plan of countering the BJP's rise in western Odisha was visible in January this year when chief minister Naveen Patnaik deployed 69 of his MLAs and ministers in 38 gram panchayats of Kalahandi district to mobilise crowds for his visit. Though only 2,500 were present at the meeting place for Patnaik's address, the MLAs and ministers who had fanned out to the gram panchayats ensured thousands heard and saw Patnaik's address on giant LCD screens.The party would replicate the same formula for Patnaik's meeting in Sundargarh district next week by deputing over 50 MLAs there. In Sundargarh, the party lost out to BJP in Lok Sabha as well on three assembly seats.Also Read: DRDO photographer sentenced to life for espionage, likened to a terrorist"The kind of mobilisation that the BJD is doing even after ruling the state for 20 years shows its hunger to win everything that comes its way and not take its success for granted. Though opposition parties are known to win by-polls, in Odisha, the BJD has lost just one by-poll in the previous 20 years. It is surely using official machinery like most political parties in India do, but its success rate is very high," said Satya Prakash Dash, professor of political science of Sambalpur University.Dash pointed to the twin bypoll win in Balasore and Tirtol assembly constituencies in November last year. "In Balasore, BJP stood to gain from the sympathy wave generated by the death of the sitting MLA. Yet the party effectively campaigned, carpet bombing the constituency with dozens of MLAs and party leaders and won by a handsome margin. The win showed how electorally strong the regional party is," said Dash.BJP leader Sajjan Sharma said BJD's success in elections has not translated to better governance. "In the last 20 years, more than 20 lakh youth have registered themselves with different employment exchange offices in the entire state of Odisha. But unfortunately the employment exchange has failed to provide jobs to even less than 1% of the local youths enrolled with it. Just to win polls the party is encouraging criminals as was evident from the murder of a senior BJP leader in Cuttack district this year. Winning elections means nothing when the party is a big zero in governance," said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-2022-panchayat-polls-bjd-gets-its-electoral-machinery-moving-101613118577502.html

As reasons, he cited his limited role as a Rajya Sabha MP to bring any change in the present ground situation of West Bengal. He also mentioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad in his statement where he said he wants to work for West Bengal, against the violence the state is presently witnessing.Several heavyweight Trinamool leaders, including Suvendu Adhikari, have recently resigned from the party and moved to the BJP.ALSO WATCH | TMC’s Dinesh Trivedi announces resignation; says feeling ‘suffocated in party’﻿Trivedi's statement came abruptly in the middle of the proceeding as he urged Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh to allow him only five minutes as he was going to talk about a serious issue.5 rebel Trinamool leaders meet Amit Shah, join BJP"Every person has a moment in their life when his or her inner voice gives a message. Today, I encountered a similar moment as I was sitting here and wondering why we are in politics. Two days ago, PM Modi and Ghulam Nabi Azad spoke in the House. They represented two parties what united their speech was the country," Dinesh Trivedi said."A moment comes when a person has to decide whether the country is bigger than the party or whether the individual is the supreme," Trivedi said."The way violence is being unleased in my side, democracy is being attacked, I am feeling uneasy sitting here. I am feeling uneasy sitting here. I am from the land of Subhash Chandra Bose, Khudiram, Rabindranath Tagore...," he said.Quoting Swami Vivekananda's 'Arise, awake', the MP said, "My inner voice is telling me that if I can't do anything for my state sitting here, it's better I leave this chair.""There are limitations here. My party has sent me here so I am grateful. But now I can't take any more what is happening. I am feeling suffocated and that's why I want to resign from here and want to work for my Bengal," the MP said.Praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the former railway minister said, "The world was looking at India during the Covid-19 pandemic. India's fight against Covid-19 has been successful. PM Modi said the credit goes to 130 crore Indians, but the fight was helmed by him."Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh said there is a due process which he will have to follow.Reacting to Trivedi's resignation from, party spokesperson Sukehndu Sekhat Ray said, "Trinamool" means grassroots. This will give us an opportunity to send a grassroots worker of ours soon to the Rajya Sabha."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/feeling-suffocated-dinesh-trivedi-wants-to-quit-rs-over-bengal-violence-101613117870846.html

The NSCN (IM) has been holding peace talks with the government of India since 1997, while a conglomeration of seven different Naga national political groups (NNPGs) have also been engaged in separate talks with the Centre since 2017.The Naga tribal and civil society, along with the state government, have been reiterating that the armed groups must come together to facilitate “one solution” for the sake of the people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/naga-peace-talks-conclude-says-governor-rn-ravi-signals-final-solution-101613117444179.html

Will it also question its co-owner, the coward Rahul Gandhi for making baseless allegations against PM Modi?" Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) general secretary C T Ravi said in a tweet.Gandhi questioned the government on Friday over its agreement with China on troops disengagement in eastern Ladakh and alleged that Modi has "ceded" Indian territory to the Chinese.The former Congress chief's attack on the government came a day after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh assured Parliament that India has not conceded anything in the sustained talks with China and it will not allow even an inch of its territory to be taken away by anyone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-realises-nehru-s-blunder-of-gifting-land-to-china-bjp-general-secretary-101613117422705.html

The comments came a day after Union health minister Harsh Vardhan dispelled the Chhattisgarh government’s concerns over India’s indigenous Covid-19 vaccine saying it was produced after “due evaluation of pre-clinical and clinical trial data” and is “safe and immunogenic” for use.Singh Deo said that any decision, which breaks national and international trials and testing protocols, renders the process meaningless. He said it was for Covaxin manufacturer Bharat Biotech to complete the trials. Deo insisted it is a matter of principles and probity rather than cutting corners, which is best avoided.Also Read | Covid-19: 4 states/UTs recorded no new Covid-19 cases in last 24 hoursDeo wrote to the Centre on February 8 urging it not to halt the Covaxin supply to the state till the trials are completed and the results are made public. Deo said there is an inhibition/concern among the community in general regarding the use of Covaxin as clinical trials of Phase 3 of the vaccine are yet to be completed.Deo cited Vardhan’s response and said if decisions can be made on the strength of Phase 1 and 2 trials alone, why have phase the Phase 3 trials which only delay its use. “If they are mandated as necessary, then they must be followed in full. There is and cannot be any objections to use the vaccine after the Phase 3 trial results are presented.”Vardhan also denied the Chhattisgarh government’s claims that the packages of the vials were without expiry dates. He pointed out that Chhattisgarh has achieved 69.87% coverage of its health care workers by giving them the first dose of the vaccine. Vardhan added the state has been able to cover only 9.55% of its 2,09,512 frontline workers through the first dose of the vaccine. He underlined the coverage needs to improve significantly since an adequate quantity of the vaccines was available with the state.Deo said 71.60% of health and 14.5% frontline workers have been vaccinated in the state and there is no ground to question their commitment. “...this will only go up though there are concerns about logistics...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-must-not-be-party-to-continuing-covaxin-trials-chhattisgarh-minister-101613117547133.html
12-02-2021||India||Govt to launch seaplane services on various routes: Union minister Mandaviya||The government is looking to start seaplane services on several routes post the launch of the country's maiden seaplane service between the Statue of Unity near Kevadiya and Sabarmati Riverfront in Ahmedabad, Union Minister Mansukh Mandaviya said on Thursday.The proposed routes include Delhi-Jaipur, Delhi-Udaipur, Delhi-Jodhpur and Delhi-Badrinath among others, the ports, shipping and waterways minister told reporters here.The minister said the proposed services would also cover various islands of Andaman & Nicobar and Lakshadweep, Guwahati Riverfront and Umranso Reservoir in Assam, Yamuna Riverfront / Delhi (as hub) to Ayodhaya, Tehri, Srinagar (Uttrakhand), Chandigarh and many other tourist places.These will be developed through collaboration between the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways and the Ministry of Civil Aviation, he said.Sagarmala Development Company Limited (SDCL), a CPSE under the shipping ministry, has invited Expression of Interest (EoI) from airline operators for seaplane services.No separate budget has been provided as of now for this initiative, as per the ministry, and the objective of the EoI is to assess the interest of the airline operators for joint development and operation of the seaplane services with SDCL.Earlier, Mandaviya had said development of 14 more water aerodromes is being planned pan India under the RCS-UDAN (Regional Connectivity Scheme - Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik).The Airports Authority of India (AAI) and Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) had requested the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) to conduct a hydrographic survey and later on requested assistance in setting up jetties for facilitating the passenger movement.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had on October 31 inaugurated India's maiden seaplane service between the Statue of Unity near Kevadiya in Gujarat's Narmada district and the Sabarmati Riverfront.On the Chabahar port in Iran, Mandaviya said India has started operations there and it will reduce logistics cost in container transport to Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries, bypassing China and Europe.So far, CIS countries could be reached only via China or Europe, he said.Chabahar port, located in the Sistan-Balochistan province of energy-rich Iran's southern coast, lies outside the Persian Gulf and is easily accessed from India's western coast, bypassing Pakistan.CIS countries include Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and Uzbekistan.About seafarers, he said India plans to take their number to five lakh.Efforts during the past six years have taken the figure to 2.4 lakh from 1.1 lakh.Inland waterways are being strengthened with 4,000 kms already developed, he said, adding that India's 95 per cent cargo by volume and 75 per cent by value is handled through ports but the sector has remained neglected.Recalling India's glorious past in the maritime sector, he said efforts are on to boost the segment through initiatives like Sagarmala, which is an ambitious port-led development programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-launch-seaplane-services-on-various-routes-union-minister-mandaviya-101613116640107.html
12-02-2021||India||Supreme Court issues notice to Andhra Pradesh on Odisha contempt plea||The Supreme Court on Friday issued notice to Andhra Pradesh chief secretary, state election commissioner and district collector, Vizianagaram, on a contempt petition filed by the Odisha government accusing Andhra Pradesh of holding local body polls in three villages falling within its territory. In the contempt plea, Odisha informed the court that the three villages where elections are to be held this Saturday fall within Odisha . These villages form part of 21 villages in respect of which a suit was filed in 1968 by Odisha before Supreme Court. A status quo order passed by the court still binds the two states, Odisha said in its contempt petition and hence alleged that the recent action of AP was in violation of the status quo granted on December 2, 1968.A bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar and Aniruddha Bose issued notice on the petition. Senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for Odisha, informed the Court that elections are due tomorrow. Also Read | Supreme Court issues notice to Twitter, Centre over regulation of contentThe bench said, “Whatever consequences will flow from our order will flow.” For Andhra Pradesh government, advocate Mahfooz Nazki appeared and sought to raise objections on the filing of contempt petition by Odisha. The bench allowed AP to raise all objections in its response and listed the matter for hearing next Friday. The elections under challenge were notified by district collector, Vizianagaram, in March 2020. The Odisha government named Collector Muda Hari Jawaharlal along with chief secretary Adityanath Das and state election commissioner N Ramesh Kumar as contemnors. The petition said, “The said notification issued by contemnor 1 (Muda Hari Jawaharlal) in unison with contemnors 2 and 3 (chief secretary and SEC) is to invade into the territory of petitioner state at the cost of wilful violation of this Court’s order… Administratively and otherwise, the state of Odisha has been in control of these villages throughout. However, of late, clandestinely the contemnors have entered into the impugned act of contempt by which this court’s order has been violated,” the contempt petition said.Odisha government has said that the three villages falling in Koraput have been shown as part of Salur panchayat mandal of Vizianagaram by changing their original names from Ganjaipader, Phattusenary, and Phagusenary to Ganjaibadra, Pattuchennuru and Phaguluchennuru, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-issues-notice-to-andhra-pradesh-on-odisha-contempt-plea-101613116946561.html

It might continue till October," Tikait told ANI.He said this in response to the statement of Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) leader Gurnam Singh Charni that the farmers' protest will continue till October.Tikait had earlier warned the farmers' agitation will not conclude unless government repeals the three newly enacted agriculture laws and it may go on till October.On Friday he mentioned that the farmers do a protest every year on October 2 at the Ghazipur border."Tear shells and bullets were fired at the farmers on October 2, 2018, at the Ghazipur border. Every year we do a programme here at the Ghazipur border and will also do it this year," he said.Asked about the debates in the Parliament on the farmers' issues, Tikait said it is good that the issue is being raised and debated in the Parliament.He further said there must be a genuine reason that the country's farmers are protesting for so long."The entire nation's farmers are on streets protesting, there must be a reason to it. If the farm laws are not accepted by the farmers, then what is the compulsion of not repealing them?" Tikait asked.He agreed with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's remark of 'Hum do hamare do' as he believed that it truly seemed like only four people are running the country.Farmers have been protesting on the different borders of the national capital since November 26 against the three newly enacted farm laws: Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rakesh-tikait-warns-farmers-protest-will-go-on-for-indefinite-period-101613116200231.html

The manifesto was released on Wednesday and also pledges to set up women’s legal aid and counselling as well as and sports and self-defence training centres in every municipal ward.The party has separately released a report card on the issues its volunteers have raised since 2018 related to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-controlled municipal body’s performance. The report card has raised issues like overflowing gutter lines, unkempt roads, chemical pollution in the Sabarmati river, choked drainage lines, shrinking parking spaces.Former deputy municipal commissioner Ashutosh Vyas and Kishore Desai, who has headed AAP in Gujarat, were part of the committee that has prepared the manifesto.Also Read | AAP criticises Centre for giving land at throwaway price for Delhi BJP office“Our overarching key campaign theme is corruption at every level since this is central to all that ails Ahmedabad and explains the apathy of the BJP-ruled administration,” said Tuli Banerjee, the AAP’s Gujarat media coordinator. She added the manifesto addresses every citizen, who may ask what is in it for her.Banerjee said this is the first time that AAP, which rules Delhi and is the second-biggest party in the Punjab assembly, is contesting elections at all levels in Gujarat. “Earlier, [there were] some coordination issue as well... it was decided to come to Gujarat later, though it was never out of the scheme of things.”She said AAP leaders, including Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, Atishi, have campaigned in Gujarat and will continue to come. Banerjee said AAP’s Delhi Model has inspired their idea of the guarantee card for the Ahmedabad local polls. Banerjee said the AAP government in Delhi has drastically improved the municipal schools and launched mohalla clinics. “...the party opened 10 mohalla clinics in Ahmedabad on a trial basis for two days. ...we will have these clinics in every ward...”The AAP is preparing guarantee and report cards for Vadodara, Rajkot, Surat, Bhavnagar, and Jamnagar, where municipal polls are also going to be held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aap-releases-manifesto-for-ahmedabad-local-polls-promises-to-halve-property-tax-101613116167414.html

12-02-2021||India||Covid-19: Maharashtra’s weekly positivity rate continues to rise||The weekly positivity rate for Covid-19 in Maharashtra has been on the rise. The weekly positivity rate reached 5.48% on February 9, from 4.51% a week ago on February 2 and 4.37% two weeks ago on January 26. The rise is particularly noticeable in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), and it is being attributed to resumption in local train services, reopening of schools and laxity in Covid-appropriate behaviour. As per the state health department data, the positivity rate of districts in MMR increased significantly. In Mumbai, it was 3.60% on February 9,from 3.28% a week ago, Thane reported 6.09% from 5.65%, while in Raigad it increased to 3.26% from 2.18% a week ago. In Pune, Nashik, two other cities with high number of cases, the jump was to 9.05 and 15.67% from 6.83% and 7.82% respectively during this period.Positivity rate is the total number of cases tested positive for Covid-19 against the total tests done. State’s positivity rate had crossed 24% in September and October when the epidemic was at its peak in Maharashtra. In some of the rural districts also, like Amaravati (13.67% from 9.68%), Akola(12.30% from 9.66), Wardha (11.19% from 4.49), Yavatmal (10.92% 7.87), Nagpur (9.24% from 9.09), Buldhana (8.28% from 4.05) the positivity rate has witnessed a sudden jump over the week. This is being attributed to the weak health infrastructure and drop in the tracking, tracing and testing of contacts. As many as 14 of 36 districts recorded more than state average of weekly positivity rate and was the highest in Nashik at 15.67%. Also Read | Covid-19: 4 states/UTs recorded no new Covid-19 cases in last 24 hoursThe daily testing dropped to 44,151 on February 9 from 56,557 on January 31 and 60,464 on January 21. Maharashtra president of Indian Medical Associaton Dr Avinash Bhondve said there were a number of reasons for this rise in positivity rate. “It is because of multiple reasons, which include crowding of public places, opening of school, colleges, trains in MMR and lack of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. People have become complacent. The number of attendees at public functions has gone up,” he said. Additional municipal commissioner of Mumbai Suresh Kakani said the rise is also because of the increase in the number of domestic and international flights. “Generally, the spike is seen on the 6-7th day of opening up of any activity and in case of local trains, we did not see it on February 7 after allowing all to travel in trains from February 1...Thus, the rise cannot be fully attributed to the train travel. We will have to observe the situation for at least 10 more days to arrive at any conclusion,” he said.He said that the call about further relaxation in train travel will be taken by February 22.The state government, from February 1, allowed all to travel in trains in off-peak hours excluding 7am to 12 pm and 4pm to 9pm which are peak hours for suburban trains in MMR. This resulted in the jump in daily commuters to 30 lakh from 8 lakh before February 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19maharashtras-weekly-positivity-rate-continues-to-rise-101613115325771.html
12-02-2021||India||Supreme Court issues notice to Twitter, Centre over regulation of content||The Supreme Court on Friday issued notices to Central government and Twitter on a PIL filed by BJP leader Vinit Goenka seeking regulation of content on social media platforms.Goenka has asked for directions for devising a mechanism to check fake news and instigative messages circulated via social media, especially Twitter. The plea also seeks a crackdown on ‘anti-India messages’ and those attempting to trigger violence in the country by spreading ‘venomous’ messages.The court has tagged Goenka's matter with a bunch of similar petitions already pending before the apex court.The SC notices come amid a continuing face off between Twitter and the Central government over more than 1,300 social media accounts or posts in connection with the farmers’ protest and the violence on January 26 deemed ‘inflammatory’ by the government.Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Thursday warned social media platforms including Twitter of strict action for not cracking down on alleged inflammatory content, saying they have to fully comply with the country's law.He said differential treatment of incidents on Capitol Hill and the Red Fort was not justified. He added that while the government was committed to freedom of media and rights of individuals but it was equally concerned about safety, security, and law and order in the country."Please don't spread enmity, violence and misinformation. Please follow the Constitution of India and the law of the land," he said replying to a question in Rajya Sabha.On Wednesday, his ministry had expressed displeasure at Twitter for failing to remove all of the over 1,300 accounts and posts it had flagged. The government was riled after Twitter in a public blog post said it has taken down only half of the accounts and posts flagged by the government.The Constitution of India guarantees freedom of speech but Article 19 (2) also says that it is subject to reasonable restrictions because of the "sovereignty and integrity" of India.Prasad said that while social media platforms have their own self-regulatory mechanism to check and evaluate inflammatory content, that does not mean they will not follow the Indian rules.Asked about steps taken by the government to check the spread of misinformation on social media, he said "We have recently flagged Twitter" on the issue.His ministry officials are in talks with Twitter on the issue.Prasad also said that the government respected the good work and the foreign investment the social media giants bring into the country but the laws of the country had to be respected.On the protection of privacy of the individuals of the country on social media, he said the government is working on new guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-issues-notice-to-twitter-centre-over-regulation-of-content-101613113545544.html

Here is what has prompted the warning and the proposed rules:• Prasad’s comments follow days of tensions between the government and Twitter over taking down more than 1,300 accounts or posts in connection with the farmers’ protest and the violence on January 26. • The social media company only partially complied with the order, saying that the directions were not consistent with Indian law.Also Read | Experts flag privacy concerns as Koo records surge in downloads• Prasad said when a company becomes a platform, you make the rules to assess what is wrong and what is right. He said that does not mean that the laws of India will not apply to them.• The government told Rajya Sabha that the rules under the IT Act are in the process of being amended to make social media platforms more responsive and accountable to Indian laws. • The rules will also make digital media platforms adhere to a Code of Ethics.• As intermediaries, the companies are not liable to face action for posts made by users.• The current guidelines state that if the government asks the intermediary to take down posts, then they have to oblige.• The new guidelines are likely to strengthen the procedures so that companies cannot say they are an intermediary and escape responsibility. • The intermediary guidelines, initially floated in 2018, are expected to introduce a slew of changes.Also Read | SC notice to Twitter, Centre on plea seeking mechanism to check fake news• They are expected to allow the government to trace “unlawful content”, proactively identify and remove or disable public access to “unlawful information or content”.• The guidelines are likely to make it mandatory for any intermediary with more than five million users in India to mandatorily be a company incorporated in India.• Social media companies such as Twitter and Facebook function as media companies, essentially making money off ads, but do not take accountability for content. • Experts have said that the nature of the laws will give the government broad powers and there is little transparency around online content takedowns, which leaves room for various interpretation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-warns-twitter-here-s-why-rules-under-the-it-act-are-being-amended-101613111005730.html
12-02-2021||India||Supreme Court notices to Twitter, Centre on plea seeking mechanism to check fake news||The Supreme Court issued notices to the Centre and several social media platforms, including Twitter, on a plea seeking directions for devising a mechanism to check fake news and instigative messages being circulated via social media.The petition by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Vinit Goenka to regulate content on social media platforms has also sought a crackdown on “anti-India and venomous messages” sent through social media aimed at provoking violence in various parts of the country.The court has tagged Goenka's matter with a bunch of similar petitions already pending before the apex court.The new petition comes at a time when the government and Twitter are at odds over 1,300 accounts or posts that were spreading ‘misinformation’ in connection with the farmers’ protest and the violence on January 26. The government has asked the microblogging site to take these down. Twitter, however, did not take action on some of the accounts that consist of news media entities, journalists, activists, and politicians to keep with their “principles of defending protected speech and freedom of expression.”On Thursday, minister for electronics and information technology Ravi Shankar Prasad warned that social media companies will need to follow India’s laws or face strict action. He added that the government is working on new rules to make companies such as Twitter and Facebook more responsive to directions and accountable to Indian laws.On Twitter’s ‘freedom of expression’ explanation, Prasad said the government was in the favour of freedom of speech and expression but against the abuse of social media platforms for spreading fake news and posts that can spread violence.“We respect social media. We also respect criticism. But we will not tolerate the misuse of social media for fake news. Today, from here in Parliament, I politely remind the companies, whether it is Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn or WhatsApp or anyone, they are free to work in India, do business, but they need to respect the Indian Constitution, they need to respect the Indian law,” he told the Rajya Sabha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-notice-to-twitter-centre-on-plea-seeking-mechanism-to-check-fake-news-101613110198390.html

Also Read | The entire population of J&K concerned over changes to its status: Azad“We wanted to strengthen the organisation and not challenge it,” Azad said in an interview with HT. Azad said they have lost elections earlier too. He added but losing in 2019 and 2014 and getting just 52 and 44 seats in 543-member Lok Sabha and not even having a Leader of Opposition in Parliament’s Lower House was unacceptable. “Some people feel very bad that we have fallen from the sky to even below the ground,” said Azad days before he is due to retire from Rajya Sabha on Monday.Azad’s farewell ahead of his retirement grabbed the headlines as Prime Minister Narendra Modi broke down while talking about him on Tuesday. Modi heaped praise on Azad and called him a leader who cared for his party, country, and Parliament.Also Read | Very difficult for a young Muslim leader to aspire to be India’s Prime Minister: AzadAzad, who rejected speculation that he was likely to join the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, referred to the letter writers and said they have come from the organisation and that is why their accessibility to people is much more than others. “If people cannot meet someone, they come to us. They give us a list of things that were going wrong and needed to be corrected. Then we put it all together, and this is what we wanted the leadership to see.”Azad called it unfortunate that someone leaked the letter. “That was not our purpose… I would not call it a leak as it is not a state secret; it [letter] was [about] how to strengthen the organisation.” Also Read | ‘Will join BJP when we have black snow in Kashmir,’ says Ghulam Nabi AzadAzad said the Congress did not really have a president when the letter was written because Rahul Gandhi had resigned. “And the other president [Sonia Gandhi] had said [she will lead for] only one year and that year was going to end that month. That was the reason that we wanted a full-time president.”Azad said he supported Rahul Gandhi, but he resigned after the 2019 national election loss. He added they spent an hour convincing Rahul Gandhi, but he said no to leading the party again. “So, once he was out, who was there? We requested Mrs Gandhi; she said no.” He added then they all got together and told Sonia Gandhi that she has to be there. “Some said six months, some said four months… we all decided one year. We had no president, the elected one had resigned. And so, when we wrote the letter, there was no president, and we were talking of a third person.”Azad refused to comment when asked who his preferred candidate was as the process to choose a candidate to lead the Congress will start four months later. “Let the bridge come.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/party-didn-t-have-a-chief-when-congress-leaders-sent-letter-ghulam-nabi-azad-101613109805634.html

Good work #PIBFactcheck https://t.co/Ha4DZk3zfZThe ministry has time and again clarified that apart from Co-WIN and Aarogya Setu app, there is no other website or application for vaccine registration.This is not the first time that fraudulent activities surrounding the vaccination process came to the notice of the authorities. Before the Co-WIN app was launched, fraudulent apps with the same name cropped up to guile people. Such activities are likely to pick up pace as India starts to vaccinate people above 50 years as there is an option of self-registration in that phase.The vaccination drive in India began on January 16, starting with healthcare staff and now dovetailing into the phase where other frontline staff are being inoculated. All these beneficiaries have been pre-registered with the Co-WIN app based on the data provided by the state governments. For the next phase where people above 50 years of age will be vaccinated, data have been sourced from local authorities and electoral rolls. But one can also self-register and this leeway is likely to be exploited by fraudsters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccine-s-fake-website-blocked-ministry-asks-people-to-be-cautious-101613109088967.html

Rescue workers have so far recovered 35 bodies of which 10 have been identified. They are yet to find bodies of about 169 persons out of the total 204 missing in last Sunday’s disaster. State director general of police Ashok Kumar said, “The rescue workers are putting in all efforts to clear the muck from the tunnel but are unable to make any progress. We are failing to get beyond 100m as the heavy muck inside fills up the area as soon as we clear it. Rescue workers tried to get into the tunnel by drilling inside on Thursday, but to no avail.” Also Read | U’khand floods: Union home secy holds review meet, assures central help to stateOn Thursday, the rescue operation had to be stopped for about half an hour after the water level in the Dhauliganga river rose to about one and a half feet.

They will go again on Friday for a recce to know what has happened,” said Kumar. Earlier on Thursday, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat approved the plan of rehabilitating about 50 families from villages of disaster prone areas in four hill districts -- Tehri Garhwal, Chamoli, Uttarakashi and Bageshwar. He also sanctioned ₹15 lakh for installation of earthquake detecting sensors for the operation of earthquake warning system with the help of IIT Roorkee.

The minister said this in the Rajya Sabha in a reply to Trinamul MP Dinesh Trivedi's question on railways safety."Safety became a casualty of inadequate budget and misdirection of budget allocation. In the last six years, we have focussed more and more amount to safety. The last passenger death due to train accidents took place on March 22, 2019," the minister said.As members in the Rajya Sabha created an uproar claiming that train services have been curtailed owing to the pandemic, the minister said, "Some member don't remember that the trains were running before March in 2020 and then services were resumed from April and are now 70% of their pre-pandemic services. But some members in the House have a short memory."On being asked whether the ministry is thinking of deploying modern equipment to increase overall safety and especially the bridges, the minister said, "There are 34,665 bridged in India which are over 100 years old. But the ministry has a robust inspection system — before the monsoon season and after."On a question whether the railways is taking the help of drones to monitor these bridges, the minister said, "Drones will not be the right approach to monitor bridge condition. It should rather involve sensors, checking the tensile pressure etc. But I welcome the member's suggestion," Goyal said adding that for the first time Railway Board now has a post of director-general for safety.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-passenger-death-due-to-train-accident-in-last-22-months-railways-minister-101613105525387.html

Modi heaped praise on Azad and called him a leader who cared for his party, country, and Parliament.“I will join the BJP when we have black snow in Kashmir,” he said in an interview with HT days before he is due to retire from Rajya Sabha on Monday.Azad said he has known Modi since the 90s when they would participate in TV debates. He added they fought, and even shared a cup of tea. Azad maintained those who say he will join the BJP or spread these rumours do not know him. Also Read | The entire population of J&K concerned over changes to its status: AzadAzad also spoke about his cordial ties with another BJP leader, late former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. “When [BJP leader] Rajmata Scindia was the deputy leader of the Opposition, she stood up and said some allegation about me. I got up and I said that I take the allegation very seriously, and on behalf of the government, I would like to suggest a committee which would be chaired by [Atal Bihari] Vajpayee and would have her and [LK] Advani as members. I said that they should complete the report in 15 days, and whatever punishment they suggest, I will accept it. Vajpayeeji came in as I mentioned him and asked why. When I told him, he stood up and said ‘I offer my apologies to the House, and also to Ghulam Nabi Azad. Maybe Rajmata Scindia does not know him, but I do’.”Also Read | Very difficult for a young Muslim leader to aspire to be India’s Prime Minister: AzadAzad said Congress president Sonia Gandhi wrote a long letter to him appreciating his work all through as the party’s general secretary and the Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha. “She also said that we have to work together to strengthen the organisation, and after that, I met her.

12-02-2021||India||‘This isn’t give and take’: Rahul Gandhi attacks PM Modi over China border pact||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the Ladakh disengagement plan agreed with China, accusing the government of ceding Indian territory to China.“The Indian government’s position at the beginning of this (Ladakh standoff with China) was status quo ante starting April 2020, which is what they had been negotiating for. Now, the defence minister comes and makes a statement that Indian troops are going to be stationed at Finger 3,” Gandhi told a media briefing on Friday.Gandhi’s sharp attack on the government comes a day after defence minister Rajnath Singh briefed Parliament about the agreement between the Indian Army and China’s People’s Liberation Army that could end the months-long standoff.Under this agreement, Rajnath Singh said, the PLA will retreat to its base east of Finger 8 on the north bank of Pangong Tso and the Indian Army will move back to its permanent position near Finger 3. Neither side will patrol the contested areas in between until an agreement is reached through future talks.Gandhi said Finger 4 is India’s territory but the troops had been moved to Finger 3.The Bharatiya Janata Party and the government responded to the Congress leader, saying it was Jawaharlal Nehru who had ceded territory to the Chinese. "He must ask his grandfather (Jawaharlal Nehru) about who has given India's territory to China, he will get the answer... Who is a patriot and who is not, the public knows it all," junior home minister G Kishan Reddy said, according to news agency ANI.Gandhi claimed that the country’s armed forces were ready but the “Prime Minister is not ready to stand against the neighbouring nation.”“Why has Indian territory been given to the Chinese? This is the question that the Prime Minister and defence minister need to answer,” Gandhi said. The Congress leader also asked why the Chinese army hadn’t withdrawn from the Depsang Plains and Gogra-Hot Springs border.On a question suggesting that negotiations do involve 'give and take' by both parties, Gandhi shot back: "The give is clear that we gave Finger 4, they are sitting in Depsang, Gogra and Hot Spring. What is the take? There is no take, only give, and the reason is clear…. The PM couldn’t stand before China".“I am saying that it is the responsibility of the prime minister to protect the territory of this country. The prime minister has ceded Indian territory to the Chinese. It is his responsibility to solve that problem.How he doe it is his problem, not mine,” Gandhi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/forces-ready-but-pm-modi-not-ready-to-stand-against-china-says-rahul-gandhi-101613101796206.html

12-02-2021||India||The entire population of J&K concerned over changes to its status: Azad||Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad has said the entire population of Jammu & Kashmir is concerned not just because of the nullification of the Constitution’s Article 370 but also the division and downgrading of the state to a Union Territory (UT).“We have been reduced to ashes,” he said in an interview with HT days before he is due to retire from Rajya Sabha on Monday. “I have only seen up-gradation of UTs [Union Territories] into states, and my own state, which is among the largest and oldest states in the country, has been made a UT. Nobody can digest that.”Article 370 was nullified in August 2019 to strip Jammu & Kashmir of its semi-autonomous status. The state was also divided into two Union territories of Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir. A lockdown and communications blackout were imposed in the region and hundreds of people, including three former chief ministers, were detained to prevent protests against the changes to its constitutional status. The changes have triggered concerns about land rights and jobs in the region. The semi-autonomous status prevented non-residents from getting government jobs and buying land in Jammu & Kashmir.

As I said, the words he used were for me, but our emotion was in a different context.” Azad said they cried not because they knew each other, but the reason was that, in 2006, a Gujarati tourist bus was attacked in Kashmir. “...I broke down while speaking to him. The PM [Modi] was saying that here is a person who is retiring who is also a good human being.

He also expressed his dissatisfaction over Jammu and Kashmir’s status as a Union territory. “The entire population is so concerned, not just about Article 370. Downgrading the state to a Union territory, which was not a BJP agenda, and the division of the state, have hurt everybody; we’ve been reduced to ashes.

The judge likened the convict’s act to that of terrorism.41-year-old Ishwar Behera, worked as a contractual videographer at the CCTV station of DRDO's missile test range facility at Chandipur. He was convicted under Sections 121A (espionage) and 120B of the IPC and 3, 4 and 5 of the Official Secrets Act and sentenced to life by the court of additional sessions judge Girija Prasad Mohapatra."The terrorist groups collect information from people of India like the present convict by providing them money. A group of these people of India are regularly supplying information to the enemies. People like Behera, (who) are putting the safety and security of the Union of India in the hands of the terrorists, are also terrorists. They are the active participants against the sovereignty of India. Whoever goes against the sovereignty of India would put India and its citizens in dangerous situations. They are required to be punished with utmost severity," judge Mohapatra said in his order. He said terror attacks carried out by Pakistan-based militants could happen in India because people like Behera provided them with information.Also Read: Odisha says Andhra ‘invading’ its territory, seeks contempt actionDuring investigation it was found that Behera would go close to the missile testing sites, take videos, and later leave for Kolkata on the pretext of getting his camera repaired.

Maoists in about 50 hypersensitive villages are being encouraged to surrender under this programme. “The focus of Lon Varratu is to link surrendered cadres to some livelihood opportunities to help them earn a decent living and it has yielded very positive results. The district administration has provided them with tractors, agricultural equipment, construction work, benefits from veterinary and allied departments,” said a senior state official, who didn't wish to be named.Superintendent of Police, Dantewada, Abhishek Pallav three of the surrendered Maoists--Lakhma Midiyami, a Janmilitia commander, Bheema alias Kamlu Karma, president of the Maoist DKAMS (Dandakaranya Kisan Adivasi Mazdur Sangh) and Jogi Midiyami-- had rewards on their heads.Also Read: 2 CRPF jawans injured in gun-battle with Maoists in JharkhandDantewada police claimed that one Mangal Ram Sodhi, who was allegedly involved in an attack on the house of Congress leader Awdhesh Gautam also surrendered on Wednesday.However, tribal leaders have questioned the ‘Lon Varratu’ campaign in the past and claimed.“Who has given rights to the police to declare a person as a Maoist?

12-02-2021||India||India red-hot investment opportunity for its clean energy transition: John Kerry||India is actually a red-hot investment opportunity for its clean energy transition, top US official John Kerry said on Thursday as he praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his commitment to addressing the challenge posed by climate change which the Biden Administration believes poses an existential threat to humanity.Kerry, the Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, said he intends to work "very, very closely with" with Indian leadership including Prime Minister Modi and external minister S Jaishankar."We believe India can be one of the most critical transitional countries in this entire endeavour. I am confident that just as we have worked very closely on any number of issues in these last years, our two nations -- the world's two biggest democracies -- have a great deal to gain from joining hands in our global leadership and confronting the climate crisis to meet this moment," he said."India is actually a red-hot investment opportunity for its clean energy transition," Kerry, the first official on climate to be inside the US National Security Council, said in his address to the World Sustainable Development Summit 2021.Looking forward to visiting India soon, Kerry said that the prime minister has made a very important contribution to this dialogue. Needless to say, India is deeply committed to this challenge and it has been for a considerable number of years, he said."You are indisputably a world leader in the deployment of renewable energy and your leadership of the International Solar Alliance, which Minister Jaishankar referred to, is absolutely critical for not just India, but for other dynamic, growing economies in the world,” Kerry said.Prime Minister Modi's announcement of a target of 450 gigawatts of renewables by 2030 is a strong, terrific example of how to power a growing economy with clean energy, and it's going to be one of the most important contributions because India today is already the third largest emitter in the world behind the United States and China, he said.Referring to a latest report of the International Energy Agency, he said India's down payment on the clean energy transition puts it on pace to become the global market leader in solar and storage by 2040. "And thanks to your rapid scale-up, it's already cheaper to build solar in India than anywhere else in the world. That kind of urgency is exactly what we need in order to confront the crisis that we confront today," he said.After coming to power, the Biden Administration has quickly established contacts with the Indian leadership. The leadership of the two countries at the top level have known each other for long and have put the relationship on fast-track. In a recent interview, India's Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu, had identified climate change as one of the key pillars of collaboration between the two countries.It was one of the topics of discussion between Prime Minister Modi and President Joe Biden earlier this week and also when they spoke in November soon after the US election results were announced.In his speech, Kerry made it clear that India is a key partner of the US under the Biden Administration and would take it over from where the relationship was left by the previous Trump Administration.On climate change, Kerry said that he knows that Prime Minister Modi is “committed to this and seized by it”, and so are Indian businesses."I was also very heartened to see the recent government budget focussed heavily on clean energy and propose a very specific hydrogen energy mission,” he said.“By 2030, the International Energy Agency forecasts that if India drives even more aggressively towards this clean energy transition, it will create half a million additional jobs than business as usual would create. Indian industry is obviously already stepping up and showing leadership. I was very pleased to hear that dozens of India's biggest companies recently signed a declaration on climate change, pledging to go carbon neutral," Kerry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-red-hot-investment-opportunity-for-its-clean-energy-transition-john-kerry-101613093903999.html

12-02-2021||India||China surprises India with its speed, moves out 200+ tanks from Pangong Tso||Nine months since they first got into an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation in east Ladakh, armoured units of the Indian Army and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) started withdrawing from north and south banks of the frozen Pangong Tso on Wednesday morning, paving a way for peace and tranquillity to be restored all along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China.By Thursday, PLA had withdrawn more 200 main battle tanks from the south banks of Pangong Tso and had positioned no less than 100 heavy vehicles to ferry its troops from fingers on north banks to Srijap sector, east of Finger 8. The speed of Chinese withdrawal has actually surprised the Indian army brass and national security planners.Top government officials said on condition of anonymity that the disengagement at Pangong Tso began at 9 am on Wednesday after an agreement was reached between India and China after several rounds of back-channel negotiations handled by top ministers and officials, including external affairs minister S Jaishankar and National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval, with their counterparts in Beijing. The outcome was achieved after India stood firm on its position in east Ladakh and its aim of not conceding any territory.Also Read | India will not allow an inch of its territory to be taken by anyone: Rajnath“The speed of Chinese withdrawal since Wednesday also shows their capacity to deploy. It is a military art. The Indian side has also pulled back its armour but contingency plans are ready in case of a worst-case scenario,” said one of the officials, a senior member of the Narendra Modi government.The officials added that as of Thursday evening, the disengagement in east Ladakh was proceeding to the satisfaction of both parties with the objective of restoring status quo ante all along the 1,597km Line of Actual Control in Ladakh. That India has been able to convince China, which boasts the largest standing army in the world and a rising superpower, to go back to its permanent base camp is no mean achievement, the officials pointed out.According to the officials, both PLA and the Indian Army will withdraw their troops and positions from the agreed positions by Saturday. The agreement was that the disengagement would be completed in three days, they added.According to the officials cited above, once the withdrawal of armour and artillery and troops has been completed from Pangong Tso, the two sides will initiate negotiations on disengagement from patrolling point 15 (Gogra) and 17 (Hot Springs) area, north of Pangong Tso.Defence minister Rajnath Singh issued a statement on the “phased, coordinated and verifiable” pullback by the two armies in Rajya Sabha on Thursday. The ground positions were negotiated between the two corps commander and the framework through the diplomatic channel.The government officials said that the fundamental tenet behind the disengagement is that both armies will eventually go back to their permanent bases as existed in April 2020. This means that while PLA withdraws to the Srijap sector, east of Finger 8 mountainous spur on the north bank, the Indian Army withdraws to its permanent base on finger three named after legendary 1962 war PVC winner Lt Colonel Dhan Singh Thapa. The same rule has been applied to the south bank with both armies returning to their permanent bases in Chushul (Indian Army) and Moldo (PLA).“The Galwan model has been replicated on both the banks. After the Galwan June 15, 2020 clash, both sides have withdrawn to permanent bases with no patrolling from side till such time patrolling protocols have been framed. After the withdrawal is completed and confidence-building measures initiated by both armies, the two sides can decide on coordinated, joint or staggered patrolling,” said a senior official familiar with the details of the entire exercise.India’s negotiating position received a boost after Indian Army troopers took over the heights of Rezang La Rechin La alignment on Kailash Range on August 29 and 30, 2020, despite valid fears of the move escalating into a full-blown India-China conflict. Just as the Chinese PLA tried to enforce the 1959 LAC line by aggression on Finger 4, the Indian side countered by achieving its military objective of holding up the Kailash Range line as per the Indian perception of LAC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-surprises-india-with-pace-of-withdrawal-pulls-out-200-tanks-in-2-days-101613088444899.html

And to this end, the state set the ball rolling (by enacting the law) and this is the figure (23) that has come forth in a month in MP, the minister said, justifying the controversial law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/23-cases-filed-under-mp-s-new-anti-conversion-law-in-january-101613091578987.html

Stone pelting is not an ordinary violation of law and order that is why it requires an extraordinary law. The draft is in its final stage and the law is being made," Chouhan told reporters when asked about his reported remark for bringing a strict law to curb stone-pelting.Reportedly, the new Madhya Pradesh law will have a provision for auctioning the assets of stone pelters to repay for any damage caused to public property or an individual.The law is being formulated in the wake of a recent incident of stone-pelting, after which more than 24 people were arrested in Gautampura area of Indore on December 29, 2020.A public awareness rally was reportedly organised from Dharmat to Chandkhedi, Kanwasa, Sunala back to Rudrakhya via Khadotya in connection with the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya where an incident of stone-pelting occurred after some people opposed the rally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drafting-of-law-to-curb-stone-pelting-in-final-stages-mp-cm-shivraj-chouhan-101613090439064.html

Of these 3.18 lakh people of Amethi got free ration, she added.Irani said that Amethi lacked basic facilities like good hospitals, roads and official buildings, and the Congress government did nothing for years. Many of these projects have been undertaken by the Modi government, she said.On the accusation of the Congress that farmers will lose their land because of the three farm laws, she said that it was a Congress-backed trust which took away the land belonging to farmers in Amethi.Speaking during the discussion, RLP member Hanuman Beniwal urged the government to withdraw the three farm laws and provide legal guarantee to the minimum support price (MSP).Farmers have a lot of hope from the Modi government and it should respond positively to the demands of farmers who are agitating on the borders of Delhi, he added.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh demanding the rollback of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/smriti-irani-hits-out-at-rahul-gandhi-in-lok-sabha-says-he-is-spreading-lies-101613087118384.html
12-02-2021||India||India fastest country to vaccinate over 7million against Covid-19: Govt data||India has vaccinated more than 7 million people against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19, covering at least 50% of targeted health-care workers in 26 days of the launch of the world’s largest immunisation campaign, making it fastest to reach the landmark, the government data show.Fifty percent of accredited social health activists (ASHA), who are community health workers and part of the National Health Mission (NHM), has also been vaccinated against the viral disease as of Wednesday, February 10.The 26 days in which India crossed 7 million vaccinations made the country the fasted to reach the mark. The United States was the closest second, having taken 27 days to vaccinate 7 million of its citizens, according to the Union ministry of health and family welfare.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverage“The idea to start Covid-19 vaccination with health care workers made sense for the precise reason that if there were any glitches, those would be addressed before the drive is scaled up. It is picking up and states are vaccinating more numbers on a daily basis. This is a positive step,” said Dr MC Misra, former director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.India started the Covid-19 immunisation drive on January 16 with two locally manufactured vaccines, Covishield developed by Oxford University-AstraZeneca and made by Serum Institute of India (SII), Pune, and Covaxin, developed and produced by Bharat Biotech International. It immediately started administering the jabs to health-care workers in the first phase. The government estimates that close to 10 million health-care workers are registered to receive the vaccine against Covid-19.“India has become the fastest country in the world to achieve over 70 lakh vaccinations against Covid-19. India accomplished this feat in only 26 days, while it took 27 days for the United States (US) and 48 days for the United Kingdom (UK) to reach the same figures. India has also been the fastest to touch the 6 million mark a few days back,” the Union health ministry said in a statement on Thursday.As of the morning of Thursday (February 11), 7,017,114 beneficiaries had received the first shot under the countrywide Covid-19 vaccination exercise.The cumulative vaccination coverage of includes 5,705,228 health-care workers (HCWs) and 1,311,886 front-line workers (FLWs), who include municipal workers, police and civil defence personnel. All these individuals have received the shot in 143,056 sessions that have been conducted so far across the country.Uttar Pradesh has vaccinated 673,542 individuals, followed by Gujarat with 6 14, 530 vaccinations . In Maharashtra, 573,681 health-care workers have received their first dose of Covid-19 vaccination.“4,05,349 beneficiaries (HCWs- 94,890 and FLWs- 3,10,459) were vaccinated on Day-26 (10th Feb 2021) across 8,308 sessions. The number of beneficiaries being vaccinated every day has shown a progressive increase. 13 States/UTs have vaccinated over 65% of the registered healthcare workers (HCWs). Bihar leads with over 79.4% of the registered HCWs vaccinated,” the health ministry statement said.After Bihar, other states that have provided shots to the maximum number of HCWs so far are Tripura (77.8%), Madhya Pradesh (76%), Odisha (73.9%), Uttarkhand (73.7%), Himachal Pradesh (72.5%), Lakshadweep (70.7%), Kerala (70.5%) and Mizoram (70.4%), among others.However, there are at least seven states that have still reported only either 40% coverage or below, and have been specifically directed by the Centre to improve their performance.The Union territory of Puducherry has vaccinated only 17.5% of targeted beneficiaries , the lowest proportion immunised against the disease in any state or Ut.“States have been given a deadline for both health-care workers and frontl-ine workers, to schedule at least one dose by then and even conduct mop-up rounds to accommodate the registered beneficiaries through the Co-WIN app, falling which the remaining beneficiaries will be rolled over in the age-appropriate category as we cannot keep scheduling and re-scheduling sessions indefinitely. There is a large number of beneficiaries that still needs to be covered,” said Rajesh Bhushan, secretary, ministry of health and family welfare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-fastest-country-to-vaccinate-over-7million-against-covid-19-govt-data-101613084121019.html
12-02-2021||India||Centre seeks action over violence against minorities in Pakistan||India has taken up instances of violence against minorities in neighbouring countries, including Pakistan, both bilaterally and at international forums and sought action to bring the perpetrators of such incidents to justice, the government informed Parliament on Thursday.Responding to questions in Rajya Sabha, minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan said reports of violence and harassment of members of minority communities in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan are a “matter of concern to the government” that are “raised with the respective countries at bilateral levels”.“Upon occurrence of incidents of sporadic violence against minorities and their places of worship in Afghanistan and Bangladesh, these issues are raised formally as well as informally with the respective interlocutors,” he said in his reply to a question from MP Kirodi Lal Meena.The governments of Afghanistan and Bangladesh have assured India that “they take all possible steps to protect their citizens, including religious minorities”, Muraleedharan said.“In Pakistan, incidents of killing, persecution, intimidation, abduction, forced conversions, desecration and vandalisation of places of worship of minorities and attacks on their business establishments are regularly reported in the media. The issue of the continued mistreatment of minority communities in Pakistan is highlighted by India through bilateral diplomatic channels and at international fora, including at the United Nations,” he added.Replying to a separate question, Muraleedharan said there have been reports of “atrocities and acts of vandalism of places of religious worship” belonging to minorities in Pakistan.The government has raised such cases with the Pakistan government and called on it to “take steps to protect and promote the safety, security and well-being of its minority communities and their places of religious worship”. He added: “Pakistan has also been asked to take immediate measures to expeditiously bring the perpetrators of such despicable and heinous acts to justice.”In his response to yet another question, Muraleedharan said Pakistan has acknowledged that 270 fishermen, who are Indian or believed to be Indian, are in the country’s jails.Under the agreement on consular access signed 2008, lists of civilian prisoners and fishermen of each country held in jails of the other are exchanged on January 1 and July 1 every year.As a result of the government’s efforts, a total of 2,100 Indian fishermen and 57 fishing boats have been repatriated from Pakistan since 2014, he said. The government attaches the highest priority to the welfare and security of Indian fishermen and all possible assistance, including legal aid, is provided to the fishermen for their early release and repatriation, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-seeks-action-over-violence-against-minorities-in-pakistan-101613083954740.html
12-02-2021||India||Congress' Rahul Gandhi slams ‘intent, content’ of farm laws||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday used his turn in the discussion on the Union budget to lash out at three contentious farm laws enacted by the Narendra Modi government, and laid out what he described as problematic “content” and dubious “intent” behind the three pieces of legislation.Gandhi also tweaked India’s once-ubiquitous family planning slogan to tell an obstreperous Lok Sabha: “This government is for ‘Hum do hamare do’.” He did not name anyone, but kept implying through the speech that the country was being run by, and for, four people.“Earlier the family planning slogan was ‘Hum do hamare do’. Just like corona, this slogan has come in a different form. Today, the country is run by four people. This government is for ‘Hum do hamare do,” he said amid protests and taunts from the treasury benches.The BJP hit back through junior finance minister Anurag Thakur, who, in a detailed rebuttal, said: “Hum do hamare Do” refers to “Didi, brother-in-law, and family.” He did not take any names either.Though Gandhi participated in the debate on the general budget, he spoke only on farmers’ issues. He ignored the demands of BJP ministers and the Speaker’s request to stick to the topic — first saying he would get to it, then saying he was “laying the foundation”, and finally that will not say anything on the budget since a separate discussion on farm issues was not allowed by the government despite demands by the Opposition. He also led several Opposition MPs into observing a short silence to honour the farmers who died during the ongoing protest on the entry points to the Capital since November 26.Thakur later attacked Gandhi for not speaking about the budget. “This was quite surprising since the Opposition wanted Parliament to convene to discuss the economic situation arising due to Covid-19, and the measures adopted by the government in its budget.” He also quipped, “I can understand that the member may not have prepared his budget speech. He wasn’t here for other speeches.”On Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said that the Opposition did not speak about the “intent” and “content” of the three farm bills during the debate on the President’s speech.Gandhi, by way of response , said on Thursday that he will “make the PM happy” by doing so. Gandhi said that the first law’s content “is that anyone can buy unlimited amount of foodgrain anywhere, so that it will finish the mandis”; the second law’s content “is to end Essential Commodities Act to allow unlimited hoarding in the country”; and the and the third law’s content is that “if a farmer does not get the price of his produce from a big industrialist, he cannot go to court”.Gandhi, who alleged that crony capitalism exists in the National Democratic Alliance regime, said the intent of the first legislation is “one of the two biggest friends” will be given “the right to sell India’s entire food grain, vegetables and fruits” and it will result in “losses for street hawkers, small traders and millions who work in mandis”.The intent of the second law, he said, was to “help the second friend to create monopoly in food grain, fruits and vegetables storage” who already “keeps 40% of India’s food grain in his storage”.Gandhi also satirically said the PM’s assurance that the new farm laws were “optional” was right. “He has given three options: hunger, unemployment, suicide.”To be sure, even in the run up to both 2014 and 2019 national elections, Gandhi alleged that the NDA works for a few friendly industrialists. Recently, the Wayanad MP alleged that the PM is trying to turn India into monopolies run by a handful of people.Gandhi also linked the farm laws with demonetisation and GST (he described it as “Gabbar Singh Tax”) and alleged the government’s idea was to “take money from poor people, farmers and workers” to put them in the pockets of some people.Lending support to farm protests, Gandhi said: “What the country is witnessing is not a farmers’ movement, it is a national movement. The country will rise against ‘Hum do hamare do’. You think you can buy farmers, workers and small traders. You take it from me in writing,farmers will not budge an inch. Farmers traders, workers will remove you. You have to take back the law.”Thakur, when he spoke, hit back by saying that the Congress party had merely done sloganeering for the poor for 70 years, without giving them anything. “Some raised slogans of Garibi Hatao (remove poverty); five generations ruled the country, but poverty did not go. But the son of a poor man (Modi) lifted many out of poverty. Some people only make electoral promises and do not deliver,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-rahul-gandhi-slams-intent-content-of-farm-laws-101613083118324.html
12-02-2021||India||‘Nothing conceded’: Centre on LAC troop pullback deal||The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) will retreat to its base east of Finger 8 on the north bank of Pangong Tso, the Indian Army will move back to its permanent position near Finger 3 and neither side will patrol the contested areas in between until an agreement is reached through future talks, defence minister Rajnath Singh told Parliament on Thursday, explaining the nuances of a disengagement plan hammered out by the two armies to reduce military tensions in eastern Ladakh.Until now, rival soldiers have been deployed eyeball-to-eyeball on the Finger 4 ridgeline at heights of almost 18,000 feet.The Chinese defence ministry announced the disengagement on Wednesday; New Delhi did not react immediately because Parliament was in session, and a day later, Singh briefed the House on the breakthrough in a months-long impasse.In a detailed statement on the situation in eastern Ladakh, Singh told Rajya Sabha and later Lok Sabha that the next meeting between senior military commanders of the two armies to discuss other issues will take place 48 hours after “complete disengagement” in the Pangong Lake area — both north and south banks.Singh told both Houses that India did not “concede anything” during the military talks, and added that there were still some “outstanding issues regarding deployment and patrolling” at some other points along the LAC, and these will be the focus of further discussions with the Chinese side.He did not name the other friction points where disengagement is expected to take place in phases after it is completed in the Pangong Tso area. These flashpoints include Gogra, Hot Springs and Kongka La — areas that were traditionally not disputed as both sides had a somewhat common perception of the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The minister’s statement came on the back of a limited withdrawal of front-line troops by the Indian and Chinese armies from the Pangong Tso area on the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC). India and China on Wednesday pulled back tanks and infantry combat vehicles from heights on the south bank of Pangong Tso a fortnight after military commanders agreed on January 24 to push for an early disengagement of their front-line troops.The Indian Army on Thursday released visuals of rival tanks disengaging from the heights on the south bank. The tanks were deployed barely 50 metres away from each other. In Lok Sabha, Singh said disengagement was progressing smoothly and the vehicles (armoured elements) that were to retreat (from heights on the south bank) had gone back to their respective sides.“The agreement that we have been able to reach with the Chinese side for disengagement in the Pangong lake area envisages that both sides will cease their forward deployments in a phased, coordinated and verified manner. The Chinese side will keep its troop presence in the north bank area to the east of Finger 8. Reciprocally, the Indian troops will be based at their permanent base at Dhan Singh Thapa post near Finger 3,” Singh said in his highly anticipated statement on the Ladakh standoff.Similar actions will be taken on the south bank by both armies, Singh said, without elaborating on the areas to which rival soldiers will fall back.The Finger Area, a set of eight cliffs jutting out of the Sirijap range overlooking the Pangong lake, is one of the many friction points in the eastern Ladakh theatre, where India and China have together deployed almost 100,000 soldiers and advanced weaponry in their forward and depth areas.Describing the disengagement measures as “mutual and reciprocal,” Singh said structures built by both sides after April 2020 at heights on both banks of the lake will be removed. Patrolling will be a strict no-no in the north bank areas to pre-empt the possibility of more face-offs.India and China agreed to have a “temporary moratorium on military activities” by both sides on the north bank, including a freeze on patrolling to traditional areas.“Patrolling will be resumed only when both sides reach an agreement in diplomatic and military talks that would be held subsequently. The implementation of this agreement has started yesterday in the north and south bank of the Pangong Lake. It will substantially restore the situation to that existing prior to commencement of the standoff last year,” the minister said.Some thinning out of rival troops on both banks of Pangong Tso took place on Thursday , people familiar with the development said. “We expect complete disengagement in the Pangong Tso area in about two weeks,” one of the people said on condition of anonymity.Experts welcomed the disengagement process but urged India to proceed with caution to avoid being surprised.“The disengagement process is in line with what India had been demanding - a restoration of status quo ante. The Pangong Tso area has been the main point of contention and resolving this could provide an impetus for other areas where some issues remain,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd).The temporary moratorium on patrolling will ensure that incidents like patrol clashes are avoided as these could vitiate the atmosphere, Hooda added.This is the first significant movement in negotiations to ease tensions in eight months — disengagement in Galwan valley took place in early July 2020 but it did not progress in other areas. The development has turned the spotlight on how the broader disengagement plan will unfold in other flashpoints where rival soldiers are deployed eyeball-to-eyeball and where previous attempts to reduce military tensions have failed.PLA’s aggressive forward deployments in eastern Ladakh have hindered the Indian Army’s patrolling patterns in several areas including Depsang, Finger Area on the northern bank of Pangong Tso, Gogra and Kongka La. Regaining access to several areas that are now difficult to reach due to actions by the Chinese army along LAC is critical.“We have agreed that both sides should achieve complete disengagement at the earliest and abide fully by the bilateral agreements and protocols. By now, the Chinese side is also fully aware of our resolve. It is, therefore, our expectation that the Chinese side will work with us to resolve these remaining issues,” Singh said.PLA’s deployments in Depsang have hindered access of Indian soldiers to routes including the ones leading to Patrolling Points (PP) 10, 11, 11-A, 12 and 13. In 2013, PLA set up positions 19km into the Indian side of the LAC in the Depsang sector and triggered a face-off that took three weeks to resolve. The situation at Depsang predates the current round of border tensions and it is likely to be taken up separately with the Chinese, the people cited above said.The Indian Army’s patrolling activity has also been affected in Gogra, Hot Springs and Kongka La where rival troops are forward deployed and where skeletal disengagement took place last year, but the gains could not be consolidated.In a statement in Parliament last September, Singh said no force in the world can stop the Indian Army from patrolling its borders.“Since last September, both sides have maintained communication with each other through military and diplomatic channels. Our objective was to effect disengagement and maintain status quo along the LAC so as to restore peace and tranquillity,” Singh said on Thursday.He said the actions by the Chinese side since last year seriously disturbed peace and tranquillity, and impacted the overall bilateral relationship. “In our various high-level interactions with the Chinese side…we have made it clear that the foremost need was to ensure disengagement in all the friction points along the LAC in the western sector,” the minister said.He said the Indian military responded firmly to the challenges posed by the unilateral Chinese action and showed valour and courage on both banks of Pangong Tso.“Many strategically important points were identified and our troops positioned themselves at those hilltops and at locations which were very important from our point of view. It is because of this great bravery of our armed forces in the face of harsh adverse climatic conditions that we maintained the edge,” Singh said.The Indian Army occupied a series of key heights to prevent the PLA from grabbing Indian territory on the south bank of Pangong Tso in a stealthy midnight move on August 29, 2020. The taking of these strategic heights allowed the Indian Army to negotiate with the Chinese side from a position of strength.“To ensure disengagement in friction points along the LAC, it was our view that troops of both sides, who are now in close proximity, should vacate the forward deployments made in 2020 and return to the permanent and accepted bases,” Singh added.In a show of strength, India carried out a raft of missile tests when the border row with China was at its peak last year. New Delhi also spent an extra ₹20,776 crore on the emergency purchase of weapons and systems to beef up its military capabilities to deal security challenges posed by China.Steps were also taken on the economic front to put pressure on China after the June 15 Galwan Valley clash that left 20 Indian and an unspecified number of PLA soldiers dead.India’s first direct economic reaction was the announcement of a ban on scores of Chinese mobile applications, including Tik-Tok, UC Browser and WeChat, on June 29, 2020. The following month India barred the award of any project to contractors from countries sharing land borders with India without prior registration with a competent authority and security clearances from the ministry of external affairs and ministry of home affairs. India has also imposed anti-dumping duties on several Chinese products.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nothing-conceded-centre-on-lac-troop-pullback-deal-101613082660208.html
12-02-2021||India||Number Theory: The data India needs to diagnose the economy||India imposed one of the world’s most stringent lockdowns -- it went on for 68 days -- starting on March 25 to curb the spread of Covid-19 infections. It was this lockdown which triggered a record contraction of 24% in India’s gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter of fiscal 2020-21. The economic shock led to projections of a sharp fall in GDP in 2020-21. With the removal of lockdown restrictions, and more importantly, no second wave of infections, the economy is expected to do better than had been expected.Most forecasters, institutional and private, have revised their GDP estimates for both 2020-21 and 2021-22. Many, including the government, claim that the economy is on course to a V-shaped recovery, and the lockdown has not left any significant scars on the economy. Others, including some reputed economists, do not agree with this assessment. They argue that a large section of the economy has suffered badly because of the disruption caused by the lockdown and this will continue to generate headwinds for growth. Which of these sides is closer to the truth? Unfortunately, we do not have enough empirical evidence to clinch this debate either way at the moment. Here are four data points, which we do not have, but could have helped in settling this debate.Consumption levels and inequality in IndiaIndia does not have official statistics on income. The closest proxy for these is the Consumption Expenditure Survey (CES) which used to be conducted every five years by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO). The latest results for CES go back to 2011-12. While a CES was conducted in 2017-18, its findings were junked by the government. Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE), which accounts for more than half of India’s GDP, is the single largest determinant of growth. Headline PFCE growth fell sharply from 7.6% in 2018-19 to 5.6% in 2019-20 and further to a 9.4% contraction in 2020-21. However, we still do not know the nature of this slowdown and contraction. Is it the poor who have been consuming less or has there been a deceleration across classes? This information is crucial in making any policies to boost consumer spending. India conducts a large Periodic Labour Force Survey every year for employment statistics. There is no reason why the same cannot be done for consumption expenditure.Inflation numbers can vary depending on the average consumption basketIndia’s benchmark inflation rate, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), stayed above the upper limit of the Reserve Bank of India’s tolerance range between April and November 2020. The moderation in inflation in December was largely on account of a sharp fall in vegetable prices. Inflation going out of control can hurt real incomes and, therefore, demand.The headline inflation index is a weighted average of different items in what is deemed to be the average consumption basket of a household. This is decided on the basis of CES data. Because India does not have CES data after 2011-12, CPI has not been updated for possible changes in the consumption basket. The weight of food items in subsequent CES has been coming down in India. This would suggest that inflation numbers could be lower -- food has been a major driver of inflation -- if the CPI basket were to be updated. The 2020-21 Economic Survey hinted at this when it called for greater focus on core (non-food, non-fuel inflation) rather than the headline inflation number. What has also been happening to households’ food budgets is a shift from cereals to fruits and vegetables. This could make the headline inflation number far more volatile going forward.Intra-country remittances dataThe biggest disruption the lockdown inflicted was on incomes of migrant workers, millions of whom were forced to return to their homes in the countryside. A disruption to the migrant-worker economy entails a double whammy for the economy, because their incomes are crucial drivers of consumption in both their place of work as well as their villages and home towns. The latter is on account of remittances. It is an important determinant of consumption in states that send a lot of migrant workers out. For example, a 2018 World Bank paper by Gaurav Nayyar and Kyoung Yang Kim found that migrant remittances had a share of 35% in Bihar’s gross state domestic product (GSDP) and positively affected consumption at the household level. Thanks to what can be termed a digital revolution in the financial sector, many blue-collar workers use formal channels to send money back home. Suitable filters can be applied to build some sort of a database to capture this movement. This can help a lot in connecting the dots between the economic fortunes of urban clusters and migrant exporting regions.A more frequent debt and investment surveyThe pandemic is expected to have a mixed effect on household finances. Experts have pointed out that many households could have increased their savings due to two reasons. First is what is referred to as a precautionary motive, with non-essential spending being deferred in the expectation of a health or income shock. Secondly, the lockdown is expected to have disrupted many consumption activities such as travelling and eating out and added to the savings pool. On the other hand, there have also been anecdotal accounts of households having to deplete their savings to cope with the pandemic’s economic shock. Reports of withdrawals from provident fund accounts and a proliferation of predatory online lending platforms, which charge very high interest rates, are some such examples. Going forward, these are expected to have opposite effects on aggregate demand. While forced savings could be deployed aggressively in the future, households with depleted savings or accumulated debt are likely to cut back on consumption. It would help if we had a clear idea of what the net effect has been across different households.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/number-theory-the-data-india-needs-to-diagnose-the-economy-101613079758451.html

12-02-2021||India||Odisha files contempt against Andhra officials for “invading” its territory; SC to hear petition today||The Odisha government has approached the Supreme Court seeking contempt action against officials of the Andhra Pradesh government for notifying Panchayat polls in three villages controlled by it and allegedly violating a status quo ordered by the SC in 1968 on three villages claimed as their territory by the two states.The Naveen Patnaik government moved the Supreme Court on Wednesday, accusing Andhra Pradesh of “invading” into its territory.The elections were notified by the collector of Andhra Pradesh’s Vizianagaram Mude Hari Jawaharlal on March 5, 2020.“In the notification deliberately the contemnors roped in three villages from the ‘Kotia Group of villages’ falling under the territory of Koraput district of Odisha into Salur Mandal of Vizinagaram district (AP). Clandestinely the contemnors changed the name of the three villages of Kotia Gram Panchayat,” the Odisha government has alleged.“Tactfully the contemnors converted these three villages of one Gram Panchayat falling under territory of Odisha to three different Gram Panchayats. The three Gram Panchayat created by the contemnor were made part of Salur Mandal,” it said.The dispute over the territorial jurisdiction of 21 districts, popularly known as Kotia Group of villages, first reached the Supreme Court in 1968, when the Odisha government accused the Andhra Pradesh government of trespassing its territory.The Odisha government relied on three past notifications which were treated as “instruments” while filing the suit. During the pendency of suit filed by Odisha, the top court had on December 2, 1968 directed both the states to maintain status quo till the disposal of suit and said, “there shall be no further ingress or egress on the territories in dispute, on the part of either party”. The suit filed by Odisha under Article 131 of the Constitution was finally dismissed on technical ground by the top court on March 30, 2006, and with the consent of both the states it directed that status quo be maintained till the dispute is resolved.On Thursday, senior advocate Vikas Singh appearing for Odisha told before an SC bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, “There is a huge constitutional crisis as the state of Andhra Pradesh is acting in violation of the Supreme Court order by conducting an election in our territory. We are requesting for listing of the contempt petition.”“The said notification issued by contemnor 1 (Muda Hari Jawaharlal) in unison with contemnors 2 and 3 (Chief Secretary and SEC) is to invade into the territory of petitioner state at the cost of willful violation of this Court’s order… Administratively and otherwise, the state of Odisha has been in control of these villages throughout. However, of late, clandestinely the contemnors have entered into the impugned act of contempt by which this Court’s order has been violated,” the contempt petition said.Odisha government has said that the three villages falling in Koraput have been shown as part of Salur Panchayat mandal of Vizianagaram by changing their original names from Ganjaipader, Phattusenary, and Phagusenary to Ganjaibadra, Pattuchennuru and Phaguluchennuru, respectively.The bench has listed the matter before a bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-says-andhra-invading-its-territory-seeks-contempt-action-101613075601403.html
12-02-2021||India||‘I will join the BJP when we have black snow in Kashmir’: Ghulam Nabi Azad||Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, who will be ending his Rajya Sabha stint on Monday after a four-decade-long career in Parliament, spoke to Sunetra Choudhury and Saubhadra Chatterji about his farewell by the Prime Minister, speculation that he may join the BJP, about being a ‘Hindustani Muslim’, and the thinking behind the letter written by the ‘Group of 23’, among other issues.Edited excerpts:Your farewell grabbed the headlines. Can you tell us about your relationship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi?We know each other since the ’90s. We were both general secretaries, and we used to come on TV debates representing different views; we used to fight also in the debates. But, if we reached early, we used to share a cup of tea also and chit-chat. Later we knew each other as chief ministers, meeting at the Prime Minister’s meetings, home minister’s meetings. Then he was CM and I was health minister, and we would speak every 10-15 days on different issues.ALSO WATCH | 'Will join BJP when there's black snow in Kashmir': Congress' Ghulam Nabi Azad﻿Why we were both crying was not because we knew each other, but the reason was that, in 2006, a Gujarati tourist bus was attacked [in Kashmir], and I broke down while speaking to him. The PM was saying that here is a person who’s retiring who is also a good human being. He couldn’t complete the story because he broke down, and when I wanted to complete the story, I couldn’t because I felt I was back in that moment 14 years ago when the attack took place.Do you think this gesture of the Prime Minister will resonate with a wider audience of Jammu & Kashmir?I think this will not affect the issues of Jammu & Kashmir. The entire population is so concerned, not just about Article 370. Downgrading the state to a Union territory, which was not a BJP agenda, and the division of the state, have hurt everybody; we’ve been reduced to ashes. I’ve only seen upgradation of UTs into states, and my own state, which is among the largest and oldest states in the country, has been made a UT. Nobody can digest that.Shashi Tharoor described the PM’s crying that as an ‘artfully crafted performance’.I don’t know in which sense, and most of the people didn’t know the background. A lot of people thought the PM was doing it artificially, because why should he bother that a Congressman is going. As I said, the words he used were for me, but our emotion was in a different context.What do you make of the speculation that you may now join the BJP?I will join the BJP when we have black snow in Kashmir. Why BJP -- that’s the day I’ll join any other party. Those who say this or spread these rumours, they don’t know me. When Rajmata Scindia was the deputy leader of the Opposition, she stood up and said some allegation about me. I got up and I said that I take the allegation very seriously, and on behalf of the government, I would like to suggest a committee which would be chaired by [Atal Bihari] Vajpayee, and would have her and [LK] Advani as members. I said that they should complete the report in 15 days, and whatever punishment they suggest, I’ll accept it. Vajpayeeji came in as I mentioned him, and asked why. When I told him, he stood up and said -- I offer my apologies to the House, and also to Ghulam Nabi Azad. Maybe Rajmata Scindia doesn’t know him, but I do.What did your own party people say about the term ending?The party president had written a long letter appreciating my work all through, as general secretary, as LoP. She also said that we have to work together to strengthen the organisation, and after that I met her. She said we have to prepare for elections.Did you also meet Rahul?We met, we met. Once, twice.In the speech, you talked about being a ‘Hindustani Muslim’. Why did you bring this up -- recently you said that the number of invites that you get to campaign have reduced.I had said in AMU that the atmosphere in the country is so vitiated that contrary to the past where 99% of Hindu candidates would invite me to campaign for them to get the Muslim vote, the number of invitations has gone down to 40%. My message was also to the alumni who had gathered there, that it’s their job to be ambassadors, and to bring that India back -- the India where I contested in 1979 in the Lok Sabha from Maharashtra, where 95% where Hindus. There was a Janata Party Hindu candidate against me, but I still won.Do you think this is the same India? Could a young Muslim leader aspire to be PM?It’s very difficult. I don’t foresee it in near future, maybe a few decades.The PM referred to the conflicting strategies in the Congress -- joined the debate in Rajya Sabha but not in Lok Sabha. How do you look at it?I think the honourable Prime Minister was not fair by taking the Congress’s name. It was all political parties; they were all unanimous in having the discussion in RS. He should have used the word ‘Opposition’ and not Congress. There has to be a difference between LS and RS. The bills, if not referred to Standing Committee, can always be referred to Select Committee. Lok Sabha members have their constituency on their mind and may take hasty decisions; that’s why the House of Elders will coolly apply its mind, and do what’s good for their country.Can you share with us now how the ‘Group of 23’ started and came to write the letter to Sonia Gandhi?We have lost elections earlier -- we got only 153 seats in 1977; we lost again in Rajiv Gandhi’s time, getting only 197 seats, in Narasimha Rao’s time we got 140 seats. But losing twice and getting 44 or 52 seats and not even having a Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha was unacceptable to us. Some people feel very bad that we’ve fallen from the sky to even below the ground.We have come from the organisation, so our accessibility to people is much more than anybody. If people can’t meet someone, they come to us. They gave us a list of things that were going wrong, and needed to be corrected. Then we put it all together, and this is what we wanted the leadership to see. It was unfortunate that someone leaked it. That was not our purpose -- and I wouldn’t call it a leak as it’s not a state secret; it was how to strengthen the organisation.There’s a big para on Nehru, big para on Rajiv Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi. We didn’t have really a president at the time because the elected president had resigned. And the other president had said only one year and that year was going to end that month itself. That was the reason that we wanted a full-time president, we wanted elected bodies at each level, so that we could rise from the ashes. We wanted to strengthen the organisation and not challenge it.But critics point out that in Talkatora session you empowered the Congress president to nominate members to CWC and not elect?I supported Rahul Gandhi, but he resigned. We spent one hour convincing him, but he said no. So once he’s out, who’s there? We requested Mrs Gandhi, she said no. Then there was a break for one hour. Then we all got together and told her that you have to be there. Some said six months, some said four months -- we all decided one year. We had no president, the elected one had resigned. And so when we wrote the letter, there was no president and we were talking of a third person.Four months later, the process for AICC to choose candidate will start. Who is your preferred candidate?Let the bridge come.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-will-join-the-bjp-when-we-have-black-snow-in-kashmir-ghulam-nabi-azad-101613073669629.html

Every party will have its own ideology. No one needs to fear that they will be affected because of our alliances. We will require your support for our governance to continue,” he said without taking BJP's name.AIADMK and BJP formalised their alliance for the assembly elections slated for April-May in Tamil Nadu. They joined hands ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. The ruling AIADMK government has supported the Centre’s legislations such as the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the abolition of Triple Talaq.Earlier, in January in Coimbatore, Palaniswami was seen in a skull cap addressing Muslims at an event. “We will never allow differences on religious lines,” he had said then. “There is some fear over the Centre's laws but minorities need not be afraid. Our government will protect you. We will not compromise on your rights under any circumstances. No one can intimidate anyone, born on this soil. Everyone has a right to live,” Palaniswami said. Throughout his campaign Palaniswami has repeated that minorities will be protected under his government.As part of the government’s outreach towards minorities when Palaniswami inspected flood-affected areas after Cyclone Nivar and Buveri in Cuddalore, Nagapattinam and Thiruvarur districts, he offered prayers at the Nagore Dargah and Vailankanni Church. The state in December increased the grant given to Christians for their pilgrimage to Jerusalem from the present ₹20,000 to ₹37,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/alliances-may-change-but-ideology-will-not-eps-assures-muslim-voters-in-tn-101613073224932.html
12-02-2021||India||Odisha moves SC, seeks contempt proceedings against Andhra over border row||Two days before the Andhra Pradesh government holds its panchayat polls in three bordering villages of Odisha's Koraput district, the Naveen Patnaik government has filed a contempt of court petition in the Supreme Court seeking action against the neighbouring state over its violation of the apex court order in 1968 and 2006.The Andhra Pradesh government which is conducting panchayat polls in three-phases is reported to have renamed three villages of Kotia gram panchayat in Koraput district of Odisha and included their names in the state's panchayat poll notification. Andhra is reported to have renamed Ganjaipadar into Ganjaibadra, Phattusenary into Pattuchennuru and Phagusenary into Phaguluchennuru, the three villages of Kotia in their notification for the panchayat polls scheduled to be held on November 13.Even as chief minister Naveen Patnaik last week announced developmental schemes worth ₹18 crore for the villages of Kotia gram panchayat, the state government moved the top court accusing the Andhra Pradesh government of committing contempt of court.In the contempt of court petition, the Odisha government said that the Supreme Court in 1968 had first ordered maintenance of status quo in the disputed area and in 2006 the apex court passed a permanent injunction on the disputed area. The matter was mentioned on Thursday by senior counsel Vikas Singh on behalf of Odisha, seeking urgent listing. The SC agreed and listed the matter for hearing on Friday.Citing Article 131 of the Constitution of India, the SC in 2006 said disputes over state boundaries were not within its jurisdiction and can only be resolved by the Parliament.In its contempt of court case, the Odisha government said those villages have been under the control of the Koraput district over the years. “The state has taken many development initiatives in the three villages and has built infrastructures like schools, police stations, roads, bridges etc. for the people of these villages.The villagers there have been getting benefits of social schemes under the National Food Security Act and State Food Security Act, MGNREGA, Old Age Pension and houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. The Odisha government in its petition also said the 2011 census was conducted in villages of the Kotia panchayat including the three villages.The state government alleged that the Andhra government in March 2020 included those villages in a notification and kept it secret so that local officials of Koraput would not get to know about it. The petition filed through its advocate Sibo Sankar Mishra said the Andhra Pradesh government's move to hold elections in the 3 village areas will amount to contempt of court as it violated the status quo undertaking given to the Court.Odisha and Andhra Pradesh are locked in a territorial dispute over the Kotia gram panchayat since 1960. Though Kotia Gram Panchayat has 28 revenue villages, Odisha mistakenly did not survey 21 villages during its formation in 1936. At the time of creation of Andhra Pradesh in the year 1955, those 21 villages were also not surveyed by Andhra resulting in perpetual dispute over those bordering villages.On Monday, Andhra Pradesh Legislative Council chairman Mohammed Ahmed Shariff during his visit to Bhubaneswar had said the issue could be resolved through discussion between the two governments.“In India, any dispute between two states can be amicably settled through discussion. I will apprise the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister on the concern expressed by the Odisha government,” Shariff told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-moves-sc-seeks-contempt-proceedings-against-andhra-over-border-row-101613071430611.html
12-02-2021||India||Hathras case: Kerala scribe, PFI members charged under PMLA||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) said on Thursday it has charged office-bearers of the Popular Front of India (PFI) and its students’ wing -- Campus Front of India (CFI) -- for allegedly conspiring to incite violence and disturb harmony in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras, where a Dalit woman was allegedly gang-raped by four upper caste men last September. The 19-year-old died at a hospital in New Delhi.The charge sheet under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), filed against Atikur Rahman (national treasurer of CFI), Masud Ahmed (Delhi general secretary of CFI), Siddique Kappan (a Kerala-based journalist allegedly associated with PFI), Mohammad Alam (a CFI/PFI member) and KA Rauf Sherif (the national general secretary of CFI and a member of PFI), has been accepted by a special court in Lucknow. It is the first charge sheet under money laundering charges in connection with the case.ED, which probes financial crimes, said in a statement: “…probe has revealed that more than ₹100 crore have been deposited in the accounts of PFI over the years and a very large part of this money has been deposited in cash.”The statement added that illegal activities of PFI/CFI included funding protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), fomenting trouble that led to Delhi riots in February 2020, and attempts to disturb harmony in Hathras. The agency said it is trying to ascertain the source of ₹100 crore deposited in the accounts of PFI over the years.Rahman, Ahmed, Kappan, and Alam were arrested at Mathura by the Uttar Pradesh Police on October 5 while they were on their way to Hathras, ED said.Probe revealed that they were visiting Hathras on the instructions of KA Rauf Sherif, who also provided funds to incite violence, according to the agency. Sherif was arrested on December 12 from Thiruvananthapuram airport when he was allegedly trying to flee from India.ED has been separately investigating PFI for the Delhi riots that occurred after months of protests against CAA, which fast-tracks Indian citizenship for non-Muslims from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh.PFI has been collecting huge amounts from abroad through members/activists and these funds have been remitted to India through hawala/underground channels, ED said.PFI rejected what it called ED’s “false claims”. “Members/office bearers of other organizations are portrayed as Popular Front office bearers. This is not an innocent mistake at all. Instead of proving its case through transparent investigations, ED continues to drag the name of Popular Front into fabricated and politically motivated case like the imaginary instigation of caste violence at Hathras…,” Anis Ahmed, PFI general secretary, said in a statement.He alleged that ED “has zero credibility” and “has been pressurised by the BJP-led central government to defame” PFI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hathras-case-kerala-scribe-pfi-members-charged-under-pmla-101613069793558.html
12-02-2021||India||'Have to follow Indian law': Govt’s warning to Twitter||Social media companies will need to follow India’s laws or face strict action, minister for electronics and information technology Ravi Shankar Prasad said in Parliament on Thursday, while adding that the government is working on new rules to make companies such as Twitter and Facebook more responsive to directions and accountable to Indian laws.Prasad said the government was in the favour of freedom of speech and expression but warned that the abuse of social media platforms for harms such as fake news and election manipulation will not be tolerated.“We respect social media. We also respect criticism. But we will not tolerate the misuse of social media for fake news. Today, from here in Parliament, I politely remind the companies, whether it is Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn or WhatsApp or anyone, they are free to work in India, do business, but they need to respect the Indian Constitution, they need to respect the Indian law,” he said.The minister also drew a comparison between the January 6 attack on the US Capitol and the January 26 violence at Red Fort, saying that “certain microblogging platforms” took action in the first case but dragged their feet during the incident in India. “This double standard will not work here,” he warned.The minister’s comments follow days of tensions between the government and Twitter over taking down more than 1,300 accounts or posts in connection with the farmers’ protest and the violence that occurred on January 26. The social media company only partially complied with the order, saying that the directions were not consistent with Indian law.“When a company becomes a platform, you make the rules to assess what is wrong and what is right. But that doesn’t mean that the laws of India will not apply to them,” Prasad said, after telling Parliament that his ministry and the information and broadcasting ministry were working on new guidelines.The government in reply to an unstarred question in Rajya Sabha also asserted that the rules under the IT Act, 2000, are in the process of being amended. “These Rules are being amended to make social media platforms more responsive and accountable to Indian laws. These Rules will also make digital media platforms to adhere to Code of Ethics.”According to officials familiar with the matter, the guidelines are likely to be finalised soon to ensure that social media platforms “take responsibility” and be held accountable for the content shared on them. As intermediaries, the companies are not liable to face action for posts made by users.“The current guidelines state that if the government asks the intermediary to take down posts, then they have to oblige,” said an official familiar with the matter, asking not to be named.“The new guidelines are likely to strengthen the procedures so companies can’t say they are an intermediary and escape responsibility,” the official added. “They can’t use the excuse that their permissions have to come from a centre in some other part of the world. Such delays aren’t acceptable.”The official added that ministry continuously works to update the rules and keep them in consonance with the times.Legal experts said the row between Twitter and the government is more a question of rule of law than a free speech issue. “We have a Constitutional right to free speech but there are also restrictions that can be laid down under Article 19(2). Section 69(A) of the IT Act gives the government the right to block such content and rules have been formed. Whether that is for right or wrong is a different matter but the government has the legal power to do it,” said NS Nappinai, advocate, Supreme Court, and founder of Cyber Saathi.“There is no option for a company, either under the law or under the rules, to not comply with the order. In this case, Twitter had to either comply or contest the directions in a court of law,” she said, adding that the company’s actions opens it up to criminal prosecution.The intermediary guidelines, initially floated in 2018, is expected to introduce a slew of changes, including allowing government to trace unlawful content, proactively identifying and removing or disabling public access to unlawful information or content, and making it mandatory for any intermediary with more than five million users in India to be an entity to mandatorily be a company incorporated in India.“Rule 3(2) prohibits intermediaries from knowingly hosting or publishing information which amongst other things may be ‘grossly harmful, harassing, blasphemous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, paedophilic, libellous, invasive of another’s privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically objectionable, disparaging, relating or encouraging money laundering or gambling, or otherwise unlawful in any manner whatever’,” the draft guidelines hosted on Meity’s website state.Social media companies such as Twitter and Facebook function as media companies, essentially making money off ads, but refusing to take accountability for content. But legal experts have said that the nature of the laws give the government broad powers and there is little transparency around online content take downs, which leaves room for various interpretation.Apar Gupta, Internet Freedom Foundation trustee, said that the government held public consultations on the draft guidelines. “The changes, if any have been made, are not known,” Gupta said. “This also comes on the heels of a case pending before the Supreme Court.

12-02-2021||India||Present dangers cannot be ignored, says Army chief||Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane on Thursday said that while the Indian Army is preparing for future conflicts, the “real and present dangers” on the country’s borders cannot be ignored. His comments came on the day defence minister Rajnath Singh told Parliament that the Indian and Chinese armies were implementing a disengagement plan on the north and south banks of Pangong Tso to reduce military tensions in eastern Ladakh.“Ongoing developments along our northern borders should cause us to ponder over …the nature of our unsettled borders and consequent challenges with regard to the preservation of our territorial integrity and sovereignty. Without doubt there are newer threats on the horizon, but the hard reality is that the legacy challenges have not quite gone away,” Naravane said in his inaugural address at a seminar on Multi-Domain Operations: Future of Conflicts, organised by the Centre for Land Warfare Studies.Naravane said the challenges have only grown in scale and intensity.Talking about multi-domain operations, the army chief said India needed to address the challenges posed by adversaries in stand-off deterrence. “We need to develop capacities to strengthen our own anti-access prowess as also develop proficiencies to overcome the anti-access capacities of the adversary to strengthen our defensive framework as also to add punch to our offensive poise.”While stand-off deterrence refers to the capability to strike the enemy from far-off ranges, anti-access capacities are aimed at hindering the movement of the adversary in a theatre of operations.He said platforms such as tanks, fighter jets and surface combatants, which were once the mainstay of 20th century battlefield, were rendered relatively less significant in the face of emerging battlefield challenges in newer domains.“We have seen how the very imaginative and offensive use of drones in Idlib and then in Armenia-Azerbaijan challenged the traditional prima donnas: the tanks, the artillery and the dug-in infantry,” the army chief said. In Syria’s Idlib, Turkish forces had successfully used drones to carry out attacks against Syrian tanks, air defence systems and other assets. Also, Azerbaijan made extensive use of Kamikaze drones to target and inflict losses on Armenian forces in a conflict last year. “We have also seen how disruptive technologies are now driving doctrinal cycles like never before. It may not be inaccurate to infer that technology itself is steadily emerging as a core combat capability,” the army chief said.The concept these days is minimising direct contact warfare, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd).“But you cannot dispense with infantry in a ground-holding capturing role. Also, artillery with its inherent capability of switching the arc of engagement with precision is going to assume importance. As far as armoured thrust goes, it is likely to suffer prohibitive casualties in multi-domain operations,” Jaswal added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/present-dangers-cannot-be-ignored-says-army-chief-101613067439290.html
12-02-2021||India||Experts flag privacy concerns as Koo records surge in downloads||Social media website Koo recorded a massive surge in user base, but cyber security researchers flagged potential privacy risks for users, triggering a war of words with its developers.The controversy began when a French cyber security research, who uses the nom de guerre of Elliot Alderson, tweeted redacted screenshots showing it was possible to access users’ e-mail, date of birth, name, marital status and gender – set of data that is known as personally identifiable information (PII).“I spent 30 min on this new Koo app. The app is leaking of the personal data of users: email, dob, name, marital status, gender...” Alderson said in a tweet. To this, Aprameya R, co-founder and CEO, said: “The data visible is something that the user has voluntarily shown on their profile of Koo. It cannot be termed a data leak. If you visit a user profile you can see it anyway”.Alderson denied this was the case and attached profile screenshots that did not appear to publicly show the information the Koo executive alluded to.“We’re attempting to do something for our country, India. All help is appreciated. If you want to help out in this journey of ours please write to me on ar@kooapp.com and we can take a look at all the feedback you have. Thanks!”, Aprameya responded.Privacy experts say PII data can be used in crimes such as identity theft and using it to bypass banking security verification processes to carry out financial fraud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-flag-privacy-concerns-as-koo-records-surge-in-downloads-101613067198885.html
12-02-2021||India||BJP govt honours critics too, says PM||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) does not believe in political untouchability , stressing that his government has honoured even its critics for their role in nation-building.He also underlined the need for consensus in polity and said the country is run on consensus even as numbers are needed to form government. “Politics for us is the means to achieve a national policy. As I said before, the government may run with majority but nations are run with consensus,” he said.Addressing BJP MPs on the occasion of 53rd death anniversary of party ideologue Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, the PM said: “The idea of political untouchability is not in our culture. The country has rejected this idea. In our party, importance is given to the worker even as we reject dynasty.”He said even critics of the BJP (such as former President and Congressman Pranab Mukherjee, former Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi and former Nagaland chief minister SC Jamir) were honoured by the government for their contribution to nation-building.While Mukherjee was honoured with the Bharat Ratna (India’s the highest civilian award), Gogoi and Jamir received the Padma Bhushan (the third highest civilian) in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) rule.“They were neither part of the BJP nor even allies of the party. But it was our duty to honour their contributions,” he said.Addressing the MPs, the Prime Minister said differences with political opponents should not come in the way of extending courtesy and respect for each other.Earlier this week, the PM gave an emotional farewell speech in the Rajya Sabha, bidding farewell to the leader of the opposition, Ghulam Nabi Azad.He said the BJP has imbibed the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi that teach lessons of love and compassion.BJP president JP Nadda said the empowerment of the women, economically weaker sections and farmers are at the core of governments’ policies. He said the new health policy and the new education policy were aimed at ensuring the development of every community in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-govt-honours-critics-too-says-pm-101613067139200.html
12-02-2021||India||To tackle low participation, House panel attendance bar may be lowered||With Parliamentary standing committee meetings frequently plagued by low attendance, the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha authorities are set to reduce the quorum, or the bar for minimum attendance in these meetings.From the current requirement of a minimum attendance of one-third members, the committees will be allowed to function with just one-fourth members in attendance, two senior MPs said on condition of anonymity.The General Purpose Committee (GPC) of the Lok Sabha met on Thursday to discuss issues before the House panels. “We deliberated on many options. One leader even suggested that if the chairman alone is present, the meeting of the panel can continue. But finally, the Lok Sabha Speaker and others favoured that the bar for quorum will be reduced to one-fourth strength of the panel,” said an Opposition MP on condition of anonymity.Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, who chaired the meeting, observed that while ministry officials come in large numbers and fully prepared to depose before a House, often meetings get deferred due to want of quorum. Many other GPC members shared the same view. “It’s a colossal waste of time,” said another Opposition MP.Many MPs have stayed away from coming to Delhi to attend House panel meetings after the Covid-19 pandemic. Some Opposition MPs had demanded online meetings of the standing committees but both Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla are yet to accept the proposals.While MPs can claim daily allowance for attending the committee meetings, there is some restrictions imposed in air fare reimbursements they can claim.Parliament has 24 department related standing panels, out of which 16 belong to the Lok Sabha and the remaining come under the purview of the Upper House.During the performance review of the panels for the fiscal year 2019-20, Birla had sought a report on the attendance of MPs in panel meetings. According to an official, Birla is also open to shifting MPs with low attendance to other panels to maximise their contribution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-tackle-low-participation-house-panel-attendance-bar-may-be-lowered-101613067138689.html
12-02-2021||India||CAA to be enforced after vaccination drive: Amit Shah||The Centre will enforce the Citizenship Amendment Act, or CAA, after the drive for vaccination against the coronavirus disease gets over in the country, Union home minister Amit Shah said in West Bengal on Thursday, reaching out to an influential refugee community that is credited with helping his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) put up an impressive showing in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.On a daylong visit to the state, which is headed for assembly elections this summer, Shah sharpened his attack on chief minister Mamata Banerjee, said she would start chanting the “Jai Shri Ram” slogan by the time polls were over, accused her of misleading people on CAA, dismissed criticism that the legislation was meant to target Muslims, and assured the Dalit Matua community of his government’s commitment to implementing the law that fast-tracks citizenship of Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Christians and Parsis who have arrived in India from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh before 2015.“We promised in 2019 that we will amend the citizenship law and asked the Matua community to support us in the Lok Sabha polls. They did not fail us. We kept our word and passed the law (in December 2019), but the country was hit by the pandemic. Mamata Banerjee campaigned that we were making false promises. She said she will stop the law from being enforced in Bengal. Today, I promise that the law will be enforced once vaccination is done and corona is gone,” Shah said at a rally at Thakurnagar in North 24-Parganas district.Thakurnagar is part of the Bongaon Lok Sabha seat that the BJP won in 2019 by fielding Matua leader Shantanu Thakur against his aunt and then incumbent Mamata Bala Thakur, who was a candidate of the state’s ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC). In all, the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 seats. Now, it aims to overthrow the TMC government by winning over 200 of the state’s 294 assembly seats in the elections due in April-May.Originally from East Pakistan, Matuas, who are Hindus, came to India during the Partition and after the creation of Bangladesh in 1971. Analysts say the Dalit Namasudra community, with an estimated population of three million, can influence poll results in around 80 assembly seats. The Matuas are a part of this community. Shah’s message on CAA is seen an attempt to address an unease that has set in among a section of Matuas due to the delay in the implementation of the legislation.Shah said CM Banerjee will not be in a position to oppose CAA in future as she will lose her post after the polls. Critics of the law, including Banerjee, argue that CAA is discriminatory against Muslims and links citizenship to religion in a secular country.“I want to assure our Muslim brothers that they will not lose citizenship because of this law. The law does not take away citizenship rights. Not a single Muslim will be affected. The law has no such provision,” Shah said. “Once in power, we will free Bengal of all infiltrators in five years,” he added in the same breath.Banerjee hit back. Addressing a large number of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and social welfare organisations in Kolkata, she said she will not allow CAA as well as the National Register of Citizens, an exercise against illegal citizens.“My backward class friends include not just the Matuas but people from all groups and sub-castes. I seek your support in this election. Please save Bengal. I do not make promises like the Centre. I deliver. Commitments are my credential. The BJP has stopped the funds of many NGOs that do not follow its policies. I promise to help you implement your programmes,” Banerjee said.Referring to Shah’s visit, she said: “All are welcome in Bengal. But things he said, the vulgar words he used…do not suit the home minister of a country. You can insult me but you cannot ignore me.”As sparks flew thick and fast and the political temperature soared, Shah, earlier in the day, branded Banerjee a “failed administrator”, stressing that the upcoming elections will be a contest between Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “development model” and Banerjee’s “destruction model”.In the north Bengal town of Cooch Behar, Shah targeted Banerjee for objecting to the chanting of the “Jai Sri Ram” slogan at a January 23 government programme on freedom fighter Subhas Chandra Bose’s birth anniversary. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was present at the event in Kolkata.“Where else can you raise the Jai Sri Ram slogan? Will you do it in Pakistan? Mamata didi has problems with the slogan because she has to appease a particular community. I can assure you that by the time the polls are over, she will start chanting Jai Shri Ram,” said Shah, referring to Banerjee as didi, or elder sister.Flagging off the fourth of the five “Parivartan Yatras (Rally for Change)” planned by the BJP, he said the campaign was not for changing a CM, MLA or a minister, but “for ending infiltration…ending violence and building a Sonar Bangla (Golden Bengal)”.’And in Kolkata in the evening, Shah reiterated that the “war” was not just to remove Banerjee from power but to turn the state into “Sonar Bangla”.“We will not rest before forming the government in West Bengal with a two-thirds majority,” he said, addressing the “social media warriors” of the BJP.Shah touched upon the issue of poll-related violence in the politically charged state, where the BJP says 130 of its workers have been killed in recent months. “I guarantee you that nobody will be able to touch a single voter on the day of the election…Our cyber warriors have to spread the word. Only enthusiasm cannot win elections. You have to use intelligence,” he said.Kolkata-based political science professor and election analyst Udayan Bandopadhyay said Shah’s remarks on CAA clearly indicated that the Centre cannot enforce the law in immediate future.“Even if we talk of vaccinating half of India’s population, it will take years and nobody knows when the pandemic will end. Shah made it clear that the Centre is not in a position to enforce the law. Framing of rules is not as easy it may sound…,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/caa-to-be-enforced-after-vaccination-drive-shah-101613067078726.html
12-02-2021||India||Health minister dispels concerns after Chhattisgarh seeks to halt Covaxin supply||Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on Thursday dispelled concerns over Covaxin, India’s indigenous Covid-19 vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech and Indian Council of Medical Research, saying it was produced after “due evaluation of pre-clinical and clinical trial data” and is “safe and immunogenic” for use.The minister’s remarks came in response to a letter by the Chhattisgarh government who had asked the Centre to halt the supply of the vaccine to the state till its efficacy was proven. In his letter to Vardhan, Chhattisgarh health minister T S Singh Deo had also expressed concerns over the absence of expiry dates on the packages of the vials.“... this is to inform you that we have been supplied Covishield vaccine doses, numbering 588000 doses, using which we have initiated the vaccination in our state. It has been brought to my notice that covaxin too is getting delivered to our state shortly. As far as Covaxin vaccine is concerned there is an inhibition/concern among the community in general regarding the use of Covaxin,” the letter to the minister read.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverage“This concern arises from the fact that clinical trials of phase 3 is yet to be completed, and which brings forth a sense of hesitation regarding its use. Further, the vial of Covaxin does not display the expiry date. I would therefore request you, to kindly reconsider the decision to supply Covaxin to the state.... and only do so after the results of clinical trial, phase 3, is over and result is made available...,” it added.Responding to the state government’s claims, Vardhan wrote: “…as per new drugs and clinical trials rules…, and in light of urgent need due to Covid pandemic in the country… the National Regulator has granted permission to manufacture two Covid-19 vaccines based on the prescribed procedure and after due evaluation of pre-clinical and clinical trial data. Only those Covid-19 vaccines that have been granted permission for restricted use in emergency… Covishield and Covaxin are being used for Covid-19 vaccination drive… both these vaccines being supplied to the States/UTs are safe and immunogenic…”The response letter also denied the Chhattisgarh government’s claims that the package of the vials were without any expiry date. “…as the same is mentioned on the label of vaccine vials… While I note that Chhattisgarh has achieved 69.87% coverage of its health care workers by giving them the first dose of the vaccine, the state has been able to cover only 9.55% of its 2,09,512 frontline workers through the first dose of the vaccine. You would appreciate that this coverage needs to improve significantly since adequate quantity of both the vaccines are available with the state…,” the minister wrote.Besides Covaxin, Covishield produced by the Serum Institute of India and Oxford-AstraZeneca is also being used in the vaccination drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-minister-dispels-concerns-after-chhattisgarh-seeks-to-halt-covaxin-supply-101613066658481.html
12-02-2021||India||Protector can’t adopt brutality: Supreme Court on custodial torture||Beating a person in a police station causes a sense of fear in society, is a matter of great public concern and such brutality on the part of the police cannot be condoned, the Supreme Court said on Thursday.The court was dealing with appeals filed by two retired policemen from Odisha who were convicted of torturing a man in custody, leading to his death. The offence was committed on May 4, 1985 and the Orissa high court on November 9, 2020 reduced the eight-year and five-year jail sentences awarded to the two to one year of simple imprisonment for the crime of causing hurt under section 324 of the Indian Penal Code.The policemen, Pravat Chandra Mohanty and Pratap Kumar Choudhury, now over 75 years of age, made an abortive last-ditch attempt in the Supreme Court to erase the criminal taint on them and instead offered to pay an additional compensation of ₹3.5 lakh each to the family of the person they were convicted of killing.The policement had deposited ₹3 lakh each in compensation for the person’s family on a direction passed by the high court. But this amount was found to be inadequate by the top court.A bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and Ajay Rastogi said: “The people look forward to the police to protect their life and property. People go to the police station with the hope that their person and property will be protected by the police and injustice and offence committed on them shall be redressed and the guilty be punished. When the protector of people and society himself instead of protecting the people adopts brutality and inhumanly beat the person who comes to the police station, it is a matter of great public concern.”The officers in question were the station in-charge and senior Inspector at Purighat police station. The bench noted that the beating of a person in the police station was a matter of concern and causes a “sense of fear in the entire society.“ Such offences, in the court’s view, should not be compounded on payment of compensation.“The present is a case where the accused who were police officers, one of them being in-charge of Station and other Senior Inspector have themselves brutally beaten the deceased, who died the same night. Their offences cannot be compounded by the Court in exercise of Section 320(2) read with subsection (5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. We, thus, reject the prayer of the appellants to compound the offence.”The court accepted the offer of additional compensation offered by the convicted and directed the money to be distributed equally among their victim’s four sons or their legal heirs. Considering their old age, the bench reduced their punishment from one year’s imprisonment to six months.The two policemen were initially charged for graver offences of culpable homicide not amounting to murder (IPC Section 304) and wrongful confinement (IPC Section 342), among others. The trial court found them guilty on all charges and sentenced them to eight years and five years of imprisonment in August 1988. The high court took a lenient view and set aside their conviction under culpable homicide.Glancing through the prosecution records describing the crime committed by the accused policemen, the apex court said, “The custodial violence on the deceased which led to the death is abhorrent and not acceptable in the civilized society. The offence committed by the accused is crime not against the deceased alone but was against humanity and clear violations of rights guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.”The compensation deposited by the accused before the top court was directed to be remitted to the trial court to be paid to the legal heirs of the deceased.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protector-can-t-adopt-brutality-top-court-on-custodial-torture-101613066659027.html
12-02-2021||India||Election officials in Kashmir targeted by hackers: Experts||Election officials in Kashmir were hacked by a group that has also typically targeted people linked to India’s adversaries such as Pakistan, cyber security researchers said in a recent analysis after discovering malware and the data that was purportedly stolen from victims’ phones.The discovery was made by San Francisco-based Lookout, which found the evidence of the campaign sitting in unsecured “command and control” servers with 18GB of data. They have identified the hacking group with the codename Confucius and found two malware – Hornbill and SunBird – which was used to hack into the targets, who were lured into installing fake apps made to resemble real ones.“The titles, icons and functionality appear to be harmless or useful to a potential target, but in reality the applications are surveillanceware and send the target’s personal data to a malicious site that the attacker controls,” said by Apurva Kumar, security intelligence engineer at Lookout, in an exchange over email with HT.The purpose of the hacks was not clear. The researchers said data such as calls logs, SMS messages and WhatsApp conversations were stolen. The findings were made in an analysis published on Thursday and first reported by Bloomberg. The malware was delivered as fake apps disguised as security tools and popular regional chat and dating applications.The identities of the attackers were not known but based on digital clues, the researchers determined that the developers are possibly based in India. “In particular, links between the Hornbill developers indicate they all appear to have worked together at a number of Android and iOS app development companies registered and operating in or near Chandigarh, Punjab,” Kumar added.The targets of the group also included people associated with the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission and individuals with numerous contacts in the Pakistan Air Force, but the researchers also found evidence that Indian election officials were hacked.“Evidence in the exfiltrated data shows one particular device located in the Pulwama district of Kashmir. In the list of publicly accessible exfiltrated SMS messages, the device received instructions via SMS on logistics for duties of a Booth Level Officer (BLO) in that district. This device also had information on call logs and contact details,” Kumar said.The spying on the election officials was carried out at least from late 2018 till early 2019, the data from the targets found on the servers suggested.Kumar described the sophistication of the group’s technical strategies as “medium”. “One characteristic of Hornbill and SunBird that stands out is their intense focus on exfiltrating a target’s communications via WhatsApp,” she said, adding that malware could also record calls made through WhatsApp and execute specified commands on an infected device.HT reached out to the Election Commission and the Ministry of Home Affairs but there was no immediate response on the report.The use of fake applications with names and icons similar to legitimate ones has been of concern. Indian security officials last year warned of similar attempts using fake Aarogya Setu versions. Experts at the time recommended that people should only install apps they know and download from the Google Play Store or Apple’s App Store.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/election-officials-in-kashmir-targeted-by-hackers-experts-101613066598479.html
12-02-2021||India||Uttarakhand disaster: Chamoli rescue ops briefly halted as water level rises||Rescue and search operations were briefly halted at NTPC’s Tapovan hydel project on Thursday afternoon after police in Uttarakhand issued an alert over rising water levels in the Alaknanda river and its tributary Dhauliganga, officials said.The operations resumed around 3pm, some 30 minutes later, but officials admitted that there was not much progress in clearing muck from a tunnel in the Tapovan project, where “25-35 workers” were feared trapped after Sunday’s deadly floods.“The water level in Dhauliganga increased by about one to one-and-a-half feet. The rescue operation was halted for over half an hour. It was resumed soon after the water revel receded,” Uttarakhand director general of police (DGP) Ashok Kumar said.Rescuers have retrieved 35 bodies since tragedy struck Chamoli district on Sunday morning, when a glacier breach sent a torrent of water and sludge hurtling down a valley into the Rishiganga river (it becomes Alaknanda in Chamoli city). At least 169 people have been missing since the subsequent flooding that hit villages on the way, damaged two power plants (the Tapovan project and the Rishiganga hydel project), and prompted a section of experts to link the event to climate change.On Thursday morning, rescue agencies used underwater sonar system to locate what they feared could be bodies in the muddy waters downstream, especially in Srinagar dam, which is around 60km from the Rishiganga dam site, officials said. Rescuers believe several bodies have been washed away downstream and could have reached as far as the Srinagar dam.Rescuers also drilled a hole vertically on the floor of a tunnel in the Tapovan dam project, about 6km downstream from the Rishiganga plant, to send a camera down in order to know the status of another underground tunnel, which is nearly 11 metres below, officials said. Authorities fear “25-35 workers” are trapped there.“We have been trying to put a camera into that tunnel through a hole since Thursday morning. But it is taking time,” a senior official involved in the rescue operation, who did not want to be named, said.DGP Kumar said officials were able to clear muck till 100 metres inside the main tunnel, which is about 1.7 kilometres long. “…beyond that, the heavy muck covers the area again as a soon as we remove some from it,” he said.State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) commandant Navneet Bhullar said heavy boulders and muck brought by the torrent were making the rescue work difficult. “We are using many tactics, such as drones for laser scanning of the tunnel to know the amount of muck inside and trace the location of the workers. We are also taking the help of the dog squad even as the digging work progresses,” he said.“SDRF has two drones, which are being used for geo-mapping of the Tapovan dam tunnel. NDRF (National Disaster Response Force) has also brought some high-endurance drones, which are also being used. We are using all possible means: drones, dog squad, binoculars in the search operation,” he said.About a 100 SDRF personnel, 178 NDRF personnel, 425 Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), a team of the Seema Suraksha Bal, 124 army personnel, 16 firemen, 20 revenue officials, and six medical teams are carrying out the rescue and relief operations in the affected areas of Chamoli.SDRF spokesperson Praveen Alok said one more body was recovered downstream (at Galnav near Karanprayag) on Thursday, taking the death toll in the tragedy to 35. “Ten bodies have been identified so far, while efforts are on to identify the rest of the 25 bodies,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chamoli-rescue-ops-briefly-halted-as-water-level-rises-101613066478538.html
