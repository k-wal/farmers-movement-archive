Assured him that India would do its best to facilitate supplies of COVID vaccines sought by Canada,” Modi tweeted late on Wednesday night.“We also agreed to continue collaborating on other important issues like Climate Change and the global economic recovery,” he said, without giving details.There was no official word from the Canadian side on the phone conversation, which came close on the heels of a viral video of a Canadian opposition lawmaker questioning minister of public services and procurement Anita Anand on whether she or Trudeau had reached out to Modi for vaccines.Canada’s inoculation drive started with the emergency authorisation of the Pfizer-BionTech vaccine in December, though the number of doses received from that company and Moderna has been far below expectations. The Trudeau government has faced criticism from the opposition and the media over its failure to procure sufficient quantities to inoculate Canadians.However, Anand has told the Canadian media she is confident the situation will soon be remedied. She told CBC News she has “solid confirmation” that Canada will receive six million doses, as announced earlier by Trudeau, by the end of March.Trudeau said in a set of tweets on Tuesday that starting next week, Canada is “expecting hundreds of thousands [of] vaccine doses each week - and that’s just from Pfizer. With these shipments, we remain on track to receive 20 million doses from Pfizer and Moderna this spring.”Three other companies – AstraZeneca, Janssen and Novavax – have submitted their vaccines for review by Canadian authorities, he said. “That is all good news, and those are all reasons to be hopeful, but we can’t let our guards down yet,” he added.Ties between India and Canada took a hit recently when Trudeau extended support to Indian farmers protesting against three farm laws. India pushed back against his comments, describing the protest as an internal matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-will-do-its-best-to-facilitate-vaccine-supplies-pm-modi-to-justin-trudeau-101612981428571.html

The RT-PCR sample collection should have been done within 72 hours prior to the scheduled time of landing at airports in the state,” said Anoop Kumar, secretary relief and rehabilitation (additional charge).Those without RT-PCR test reports shall have to compulsorily undergo RT-PCR test at the airports concerned at their own cost. They will be allowed to go home only after undertaking the tests. Those who test positive will have to be treated as per the existing protocol, he said.Kumar further said, “The passengers travelling in trains will also have to produce the RT-PCR negative test report but collection of samples should have been done within 96 hours before the scheduled arrival. Those not having negative reports will be screened for symptoms and body temperature at the railway stations, and those having symptoms shall have to undergo antigen tests.”Those coming by roads will have to undergo screening at border check posts. People with symptoms will have to undergo antigen tests. If found positive a traveller will be admitted to a Covid centre and will have to bear the cost of the treatment, he said.“Kerala has highest per day growth of Covid-19 cases and a traveller from the state has potential of spreading the virus in Maharashtra. Considering this, we have decided to bring in travel restrictions for Kerala as a precautionary measure,” the relief and rehabilitation secretary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-extends-travel-restrictions-for-kerala-after-rise-in-covid-cases-101612980613497.html

10-02-2021||India||SC stays HC verdict asking schools to provide gadgets, internet to poor students||The Supreme Court Wednesday stayed the Delhi High Court verdict which directed private unaided as well as government schools like 'Kendriya Vidyalayas' to provide gadgets and internet packages to students from economically weaker section (EWS) or disadvantaged group so that they have access to online classes.A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde agreed to hear the plea filed by the Delhi government challenging the high court judgement of September 18 last year.“Issue notice. In the meantime, there shall be stay of operation of the impugned order of the high court,” the bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said in its order.A division bench of the high court had directed that cost of gadgets and internet package are not a part of tuition fee and have to be provided free of cost to these students by the schools, subject to the right of private unaided schools to claim reimbursement from the state in accordance with provision of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009.While staying the verdict, the apex court also issued notices to NGO ‘Justice for All’, on whose petition the high court had delivered the judgement, and others on Delhi government’s plea.Senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for Delhi government, told the bench that additional burden has been put on the state by the high court verdict.“We are already spending a lot on the education front,” Singh told the bench.The bench, while observing that the apex court had earlier delivered a verdict on a similar issue in a case arising out of Himachal Pradesh, asked Singh to place that judgement before it.The high court had delivered the judgement on a plea filed by the NGO seeking directions to the Centre and the Delhi government to provide free laptops, tablets or mobile phones to poor students so that they can access classes online during the Covid-19 lockdown.The high court had said that to separate such students from others in the same class due to non-availability of a gadget or a device would generate "a feeling of inferiority" that may "affect their hearts and minds unlikely ever to be undone".It had said if a school decides to voluntarily provide synchronous face-to-face real time online education as a method of teaching, "they will have to ensure that the students belonging to economically weaker section (EWS) or disadvantaged group (DG) category also have access and are able to avail the same".The court had said that, "Segregation in education is a denial of equal protection of the laws under Article 14 of the Constitution and in particular the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009."The high court had said that section 12(1)(c) of RTE Act requires private unaided schools to provide free and compulsory elementary education to 25 per cent EWS/DG students and that means "education sans financial barrier"."Consequently, intra-class discrimination, especially inter-se 75 per cent fee paying students viz-a-viz 25 per cent EWS/DG students upsets the level playing field and amounts to discrimination as well as creates a vertical division, digital divide or digital gap or digital apartheid in addition to segregation in a classroom which is violative of RTE Act, 2009 and Articles 14, 20 and 21 of the Constitution," it had said.The high court had also directed constitution of a three-member committee, comprising education secretary from the Centre or his nominee, Delhi government's education secretary or his nominee and a representative of the private schools, to expedite and streamline the process of identifying and supplying the gadgets to poor and disadvantaged students.It had said the committee shall also frame standard operating procedures (SOPs) for identifying the standard of the equipment and internet package to be supplied to the poor and disadvantaged students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-stays-hc-verdict-asking-schools-to-provide-gadgets-internet-to-poor-students-101612975693337.html

However, officials haven’t confirmed those figures.According to Assam officials, the incident took place at Kachurtal area of Jhalnacherra in Hailakandi district over a dispute related to construction of a road on the Assam side of the border.“There was a quarrel on the construction of a road on the Assam-Mizoram border on our side. Some Mizoram residents obstructed construction of the road and it led to a fight between residents of both states and several people got injured,” said Dilip Kumar Dey, DIG (Southern Range), Assam Police.“Three persons on our side were injured. When our personnel reached the spot they dispersed the mob. But while returning to Mizoram, the miscreants burnt down at least 18 houses on the Assam side,” he added.Security personnel from the state police and central paramilitary forces have been deployed in the area and the situation there is stated to be tense but under control. On Wednesday senior district and police officials visited the site.“The situation is under control. Most villagers who had fled from their homes fearing more attacks have gone back. Nearly 15 families are taking shelter in relief camp. We are in constant touch with officials of Kolasib district in Mizoram to monitor the situation,” Hailakandi deputy commissioner Megh Nidhi Dahal said.Hailakandi superintendent of police Pabindra Kumar Nath said that three persons from Mizoram also sustained minor injuries in the clash.“Though construction was taking place in Assam, Mizoram claims the territory to be disputed. The injuries sustained by the six persons are not very serious. Of the three from Assam, one was discharged after first-aid while the two others were taken to Hailakandi civil hospital,” Nath said.Apprehending further breach of peace and tranquility in the border areas following Tuesday’s incident additional district magistrate RK Dam promulgated Section 144 with immediate effect.Tuesday’s incident took place less than a week after a school located near the Assam-Mizoram border in Hailakandi district was damaged due to two bomb blasts by unidentified miscreants in the early hours of February 3.Assam and Mizoram share a 164-km boundary and there have been territorial disputes between the two states for many years.In October last year, several persons from both states were injured in violence along the Assam-Mizoram border after some residents of Vairengte in Kolasib district of Mizoram set on fire temporary huts made by residents of Lailapur in Cachar district of Assam on a stretch of disputed land.Mizoram said the huts were built on ‘no man’s land’ while Assam claimed the area as theirs.Following the incident, residents on the Assam side blocked the highway going to Mizoram for several days and hundreds of trucks on the way to the neighbouring state were stranded.The blockade was lifted in November after several rounds of talks between both states and following intervention of the Union home ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prohibitory-orders-in-assam-district-after-clash-and-arson-on-mizoram-border-101612975901780.html

And it engages in note bank politics outside the budget,” the Congress leader said.Road projects worth ₹25,000 crore have been announced for West Bengal. ₹65,000 crore has been allocated for road and highways project in Kerala, while ₹3,400 crore has been marked for Assam. In Tamil Nadu, ₹1.03 lakh crore has been earmarked for national highway projects. All these states are set to go to polls in the next few months.Sibal said while everyone supported the self-reliant India movement, it was for the government to answer if India’s farmers, Dalits, minorities, small traders and micro, small and medium enterprises were also ‘Atmanirbhar.’“86% of farmers own less than five acres of land. Are they Atmanirbhar? Is that why they are protesting peacefully at Delhi’s borders? You have to answer,” Sibal said.The Congress leader said several factors indicated that the country’s economy was in a poor shape even before the Covid pandemic erupted. He said the government managed the economy badly during the last six years and alleged that the country’s assets were owned by “4-5 big boys and one very big boy is everywhere”.“In 2018, 1% of people owned 58% of the country’s assets. And in 2019, 1% people owned 73% of the assets. This is a classic case of crony capitalism,” he said.He accused the government of indulging in jugglery of data and establishing “an oligarchic economic order”.“You have been in power for six years. No more excuses. Your report card will be looked into,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/big-projects-for-poll-bound-states-in-budget-kapil-sibal-alleges-bias-101612975873052.html
10-02-2021||India||Telangana CM announces ₹1,000 crore scheme for Dalit empowerment||Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Wednesday announced the launch of an exclusive scheme for the uplift of Dalits in the state with a budgetary allocation of ₹1,000 crore.Addressing a huge rally at Halia town in Nalgonda district, KCR said the “CM Dalit Empowerment Scheme” would be rolled out in the forthcoming budget.“I will be directly monitoring the implementation of the scheme, under which various projects would be initiated for Dalits. Initially, we shall allocate ₹1,000 crore for the scheme in the coming budget and in the subsequent years, the allocation would be increased manifold,” said the CM.He said though his government had been implementing a sub-plan for Scheduled Castes and taking up certain schemes, he was not totally satisfied with it. “That is why we are coming out with this new scheme,” he said.Though the public meeting was organised as part of the chief minister’s visit to Nalgonda district to lay foundation stone for 13 various lift irrigation schemes on Krishna river at a cost of nearly ₹3,000 crore, he used the occasion to kickstart the campaign of the Telangana Rashtra Samithi for the ensuing by-election to Nagarjunasagar assembly seat.The by-election, necessitated due to the death of sitting TRS legislator Nomula Narasimhaiah due to post-Covid-19 complications in December, has become a matter of prestige for the TRS, which faced a debacle in the by-elections to Dubbak assembly seat, followed by Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation elections.The TRS chief called upon the people of Nagarjunasagar constituency not to get carried away by the propaganda of the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party but support the party which had been addressing the needs of every section of the society.“If you think what I am saying is true, see that the opposition parties lose their deposits,” he said.The chief minister pointed out that it was the TRS government which had driven away fluorosis from the villages of Nalgonda by providing safe drinking water through Mission Bhagiratha scheme. “The Congress governments in the past had never thought of implementing a scheme like Rythu Bandhu that provides ₹10,000 per acre per year to each farmer. Yet, the Congress leaders are shamelessly criticising the TRS government,” he said.The TRS chief also promised to complete all the lift irrigation schemes within a year. “If we can’t fulfil our promise, we won’t ask for votes from you in the next elections. We have that credibility of not going back on what we promised in the past,” he said.He also warned the opposition parties against creating hurdles in the meetings of the TRS. “The Congress and the BJP, which were responsible for the suicides of farmers in the past, have no moral right to disturb our meetings. Ours is a democratically elected people’s government, not the one nominated by Delhi,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-cm-announces-rs-1-000-crore-scheme-for-dalit-empowerment-101612975498817.html

10-02-2021||India||SC notice to Centre on plea seeking repeal of provisions criminalising begging||The Supreme Court Wednesday asked the Centre and some states to respond to a plea which has sought direction to repeal the provisions criminalising begging saying it leaves people with "unreasonable choice" of committing crime or starving.A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and R S Reddy issued notices and sought replies from the Centre as also Maharashtra, Gujarat, Punjab, Haryana and Bihar on the plea which claimed that sections of the statutes criminalising begging is violative of Constitutional rights.“Issue notice returnable in six weeks,” the bench said, while hearing the petition filed by Meerut resident Vishal Pathak.The plea, filed through advocate H K Chaturvedi, has referred to the August 2018 verdict of the Delhi High Court which had decriminalised begging in the national capital and said that provisions of the Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959 which treats begging as an offence cannot sustain constitutional scrutiny.“The provisions of the statutes criminalising the act of begging puts people in a situation to make an unreasonable choice between committing a crime or not committing one and starving, which goes against the very spirit of the Constitution and violates Article 21 i.e. Right to Life,” the plea filed in the top court said.Referring to the Census 2011, the plea said the total number of beggars in India is 4,13,670 and the number has increased from the last Census.It said that government has the mandate to provide social security for everyone and ensure that all have basic facilities as embedded in Directives Principles of State Policy in the Constitution.“However, the presence of beggars is evidence that the states have failed to provide these basic facilities to all its citizens, thus instead of working on its failure and examining what made people beg, criminalising the act of beggary is irrational and against the approach of a socialist nation as embedded in preamble of our Constitution,” the plea said.It said that a person, who is compelled to beg, cannot be faulted for his actions in such compelling circumstances.“Furthermore, by enforcing such legislations, state is simply failing in its duty to provide a decent life to its citizens and adds insult to injury by arresting, detaining and if necessary, imprisoning such persons who beg in search for essentials of bare survival which is even below sustenance,” it said.The plea claimed that ‘The Abolition of Begging and Rehabilitation of Beggars Bill 2018’ was introduced in the Lok Sabha but “till date this bill is not passed and is wedged in length parliamentary procedures which has resulted in thousands of poor face more hardships because of present arbitrary statutes”.The petition has sought directions to declare as “illegal and void” all provisions, except some sections, of the Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959, Punjab Prevention of Beggary Act, 1971, Haryana Prevention of Begging Act, 1971 and Bihar Prevention of Begging Act 1951.It has also sought to declare all other similar Acts prevailing in any part of the country as illegal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-notice-to-centre-on-plea-seeking-repeal-of-provisions-criminalising-begging-101612975167238.html

10-02-2021||India||Farm Laws: PM cites 'Churchill Cigar Assistant' anecdote to underline need for change||Defending the farm laws as much needed reforms, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday underlined that change is essential and cited the case of CCA, a British era post in Tamil Nadu for supplying cigars to then UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill that was not abolished till several decades after independence.Speaking in Lok Sabha on the motion of thanks to the President for his address, Modi said change and reforms are essential for the progress of every modern society.He also mentioned social reformers like Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, Jyotiba Phule and B R Ambedkar who had the courage to push for reforms in society against the prevailing norms.Stressing that still water leads to diseases while moving water instills new energy, Modi said he opposes the mindset of "status quo" and asserted that the young generation wouldn't wait long for change."One should take responsibility and decide according to the needs of the country. This mindset of 'status quo' has also played havoc in stopping the country's progress. Till when will we continue with this status quo," Modi said.To buttress his point for change, Modi cited a story of CCA, Churchill Cigar Assistant, in the office of Chief Secretary of Tamil Nadu. The post was specifically created for ensuring the supply of cigar to Churchill from Tiruchirappalli in the state.Despite Churchill losing in 1945 and India becoming independent in 1947, the post continued till several decades later and the fact came to light when the state government set up a commission for raising the salaries of government employees.The CCA wrote to the Commission seeking a raise but no one was even aware that such a post existed.This incident is the biggest example of a need for change in governance for the progress of the society, Modi suggested.He said a country cannot be run by just "cutting ribbons" and photo-ops. "We should make every attempt to bring changes. There may be mistakes, but if the intention is fair, there will be good results," he said.Not acting due to fear of failure does not benefit anyone, the prime minister said.He also took potshots at those asking why the laws were introduced when farmers didn't ask for them, saying that India is a democratic country and not a feudal set up where people should seek something from those who are in power.The government should be sensitive towards the people and take decisions that are good for the country, Modi said, while noting that people did not demand Ayushaman Bharat, Jan Dhan Accounts and Swachh Bharat, but still the Centre initiated these welfare programmes.He said laws against dowry, triple talaq and child marriage were also not demanded, still, the governments brought these laws as they were required for the overall well-being of the nation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-pm-cites-churchill-cigar-assistant-anecdote-to-underline-need-for-change-101612974688764.html
10-02-2021||India||FASTags to become mandatory from February 15: All you need to know||Electronic toll collection system FASTag will become mandatory for all vehicles from February 15, 2021. The ministry of road transport and highways had earlier given an order in this regard. The FASTag will be necessary while travelling across the country and will also be required while crossing any toll plazas throughout the country’s national highways.The government had initially set the deadline for the mandatory fitment of FASTag for all vehicles in the country from January 1, 2021 but the implementation was delayed and toll plazas continued collecting money manually too.Several banks like HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, Kotak Bank, Paytm Payments Bank and IDFC First Bank are issuing FASTags.The FASTag sticker is attached to the windshield of a car and uses the Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. The sticker is pasted on the inside of the windshield of the car and resembles a bar code. RFID developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) enables the driver of the car to pass through the FASTag readers installed overhead at toll plazas. As the vehicle passes beneath the detector, the RFID code gets detected and the necessary toll amount is deducted from the minimum pre-paid balance.The National Highways Authority of India said on February 10 that it is not required to maintain a minimum amount in FASTag wallet.FASTags help in seamless collection of toll tax without the need of stopping at toll plazas. The use of RFID technology helps in collecting taxes without the need of handling cash by toll booth employees and negates waiting time in toll booths. It also stops unnecessary queuing at the toll booths.FASTags can be purchased across the country’s toll booths. One can buy FASTags from Amazon.in and also purchase FASTags from Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, State Bank of India, Kotak Bank and PayTM Payments Bank. Most of them offer discounts or exclusive offers through their respective mobile apps and also offer cashback on purchase of FASTags. Carrying your identification as well as the vehicle registration documents is mandatory for purchase of FASTags. The cost of buying FASTags depends upon two factors - class of vehicle (car, jeep, van, bus, truck, light commercial vehicles, construction machines) and bank from where the FASTag is being purchased from. Different banks may have different pricing policies regarding issuance fees and security deposits. Currently, purchasing FASTag on PayTM will cost ₹500 - out of which ₹250 is the refundable security deposit.FASTags issued by banks can be recharged on Paytm and PhonePe. UPI, Credit Cards and Debit Cards can be used for recharging FASTags.A FASTag is valid for 5 years from the date of issuance. Recharging of FASTag does not extend its validity beyond the initial date of issuance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fastags-to-become-mandatory-from-february-15-all-you-need-to-know-101612972629390.html
10-02-2021||India||Tamil Nadu parties united in call for single phase state elections||Ruling and opposition political parties in Tamil Nadu have urged the Election Commission to make it a single phase assembly election in the state. An election commission delegation, led by chief election commissioner Sunil Arora, arrived in Chennai on Wednesday on a two-day visit to assess poll preparedness in Tamil Nadu.In complaints to the poll body, the DMK alleged deletion of voters’ name, spotlighted AIADMK’s spending on advertisements in newspapers, among others.“Previously, we have submitted six representations to the EC for clarifications in the voters’ list but they did not answer,” said DMK’s organising secretary RS Bharathi.“We have also asked the commission to investigate two complaints and reply within three days of booths being illegally shifted in Coimbatore and a strong room in Chennai’s Madhavaram not being safe as EVMs for 16 constituencies are stored here with broken doors. We have submitted photographs,” he added.The ruling AIADMK has called for elections to be conducted in April due to the scorching heat in May. “We have asked for polls in the fourth week of April,” AIADMK leader Pollachi V Jayaraman told reporters after the meeting.The BJP, AIADMK ally, urged for election dates to be after Tamil New year which falls in the month of April. “We have asked for the elections not to be too close to the Tamil New Year because it is celebrated widely by people,” BJP’s state general secretary KT Raghavan told reporters. “We have urged them to be careful about facilities provided for senior citizens as some parties could indulge in malpractices.”The Congress wanted the interval between election day and counting to be shortCPI (M) leader TK Rangarajan told reporters that they raised the issue of not receiving EPIC cards and highlighted election malpractices. “They arrest wrongdoers during elections but they have never been punished in case. They are let off after polls. There are pictures of money distribution but there is no information about what happened to the accused or the money.”Though the state has always had single-phase elections, all parties made this request following the three-phase voting in Bihar last year amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

By an order of November 3, 2020 the high court refused to intervene in the matter after the ministry of defence refused to issue a no objection certificate.At an auction held in July last year, the government sold the warship to Shree Ram Group of Industries, a ship-breaking firm based in Alang, Gujarat, for converting it into scrap at a price of ₹38.54 crore.INS Viraat, India’s first aircraft carrier inducted into the Indian Navy in 1987, was decommissioned in 2017. It was previously part of the British Royal Navy before it was acquired from the United Kingdom.Envitech Marine Consultants was represented before the apex court by its managing director Rupali Sharma. The firm had evinced interest in purchasing the ship by offering a premium. But the ship’s new owner had demanded a sum of ₹100 crore.On Wednesday, the bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian asked Sharma to indicate how much the petitioner firm was willing to pay to acquire INS Viraat. Sharma stated that the ship-breaking company had demanded ₹100 crore. The Court asked Sharma, “What is the condition of the ship? Has it been dismantled?”The petitioner informed the bench that 25 per cent of dismantling was over. However, the hull is still intact, Sharma added. Before the Bombay High Court, the Ministry had stated that the new owner of the ship was not willing to sell.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ins-viraat-s-dismantling-to-be-kept-on-hold-says-supreme-court-to-owner-101612971678821.html

He was also associated with former prime minister VP Singh’s Janata Dal. In 1988, the thespian floated a party Tamilzhaga Munnetra Munnani which failed.Tamil Nadu Congress’ art wing chairman K Chandrasekhar expressed disappointment with the son’s move to the BJP. “Ramkumar's decision to join the BJP will bring disrepute to Sivaji's fame,” Chandrasekhar said. “Though everyone has the right to join any party, there is a difference in Ramakumar going to the BJP...I was Sivaji Ganesan’s office in-charge when he started the party. So I know that he always wanted to work with secular forces. He always believed that the people of India are Indians first and all religions are equal. I joined the Congress after his demise.”The BJP, which has a minor presence in the state, has been on a recruiting spree.Former Congress leader ‘Karate’ Thiagarajan is also likely to join the BJP Thursday in the presence of state leaders.Congress’ former spokesperson actor-turned-politician S Khushboo joined the BJP in October.

10-02-2021||India||FATF meets Thursday to assess Pakistan's actions on countering terror financing||The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) will begin a series of meetings on Thursday that will review Pakistan’s actions to counter terror financing amid signs that Islamabad is yet to completely implement the multilateral watchdog’s action plan.There will be eight meetings of FATF’s working groups between February 11 and 19 before the crucial plenary meeting during February 22-25 that will take a final call on Pakistan’s case. All the meetings are being held virtually because of the Covid-19 pandemic.Pakistan has taken some steps in recent months, such as the prosecution of Lashkar-e-Taiba founder Hafiz Saeed and his aides in terror financing cases, though people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity these actions still did not completely fulfill the 27 points in FATF's action plan.“Some of these actions are the type of things Pakistan does whenever it faces pressure from the West to crack down on terror. They aren’t irreversible steps to completely stop activities of terror groups,” said one of the people cited above.At the conclusion of its last plenary in October, the FATF had given Pakistan time till February this year to address what it described as “very serious deficiencies” in efforts to counter terror financing. The watchdog also retained Pakistan in the “grey list”, in which it was placed in June 2018.FATF president Marcus Pleyer last year cautioned Pakistan that it would not be given a chance “forever” to address outstanding issues and that repeated failure to deliver on the action plan would result in a country being put in the “black list”. Pleyer also said Pakistan had fully complied with 21 of 27 points in the action plan.The people cited above said Pakistan had fallen short in acting against fund raising by UN-designated terror groups, the conviction of UN-listed individuals, and curbing terror financing through narcotics and smuggling of precious gems.The people said it was widely anticipated Pakistan would remain in the grey list and no further action could be taken, in view of the country’s current role in the Afghan peace process. Most Western countries with troops in Afghanistan are keen on a drawdown, which can only be carried out if Pakistan pushes the Taliban to stick to the peace process.However, ahead of the FATF meetings, Pakistan’s civilian and military leadership has launched a concerted campaign to blame India for fomenting unrest and allegedly backing terror groups based in Afghanistan.The leaders, including foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, have latched on to news anchor Arnab Goswami’s purported WhatsApp chat transcripts, a report from EU DisinfoLab and a UN report about the renewed activities of the Pakistani Taliban in Afghanistan to push a narrative about India’s so-called role in attempts to destabilise Pakistan. India has dismissed these accusations.Sameer Patil, research fellow of international security studies at Gateway House, said Pakistan’s latest actions were an attempt to distract attention from its failure to act against banned terror groups in line with FATF’s recommendations.“Even if these accusations are taken at face value, Pakistan has been given opportunities in the past to bring credible evidence to the table to back up their allegations, which they have failed to do. This is nothing but an attempt to obfuscate the main issue, which is that the terror groups remain active even if they don’t currently operate,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fatf-meets-thursday-to-assess-pakistan-s-actions-on-countering-terror-financing-101612971166834.html

This was announced by the defence minister’s office on Wednesday.“Raksha Mantri Shri @rajnathsingh will make a statement in Rajya Sabha tomorrow regarding ‘Present Situation in Eastern Ladakh,” Singh's office tweeted.The announcement came after a demand was made by Congress and other opposition parties.Speaking in the Lok Sabha, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury had highlighted the recent statement made by Union minister VK Singh on the LAC standoff. He had said that Singh's statement will give China a chance to tarnish India's image at global level."Union minister VK Singh has made a statement which has been widely published in the newspapers about LAC transgressions. And China has picked that up; it will give our neighbour a chance to tarnish our image," Chowdhury said."I request the defence minister to throw some light on the latest situation on the LAC and on the minister's statement," he added.I am more aware of the LAC and the borders. Suggest do not fall prey to the Chinese propaganda.Here is my statement on the subject.#GenerallySaying pic.twitter.com/uQOYLMp4fnSingh was addressing a function in Tamil Nadu's Madurai where he said that the LAC has not been clearly defined and both India and China have crossed their perceptions of the undemarcated LAC many times.“Let me assure you, if China has transgressed 10 times, we must have done it at least 50 times,” he had said.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had on Tuesday demanded that Singh, the minister of state for transport and highways, should be sacked. Congress MP Manish Tewari moved an adjournment motion notice in Lok Sabha and said that Singh’s statement on the standoff had been picked up by the Chinese foreign ministry, as an “unwitting confession by the Indian side.”Meanwhile, the former army chief said in a statement that his comments were "distorted" and they had nothing to do with what he had actually said on Sunday. “I have simply stated the established fact that the borders along the LAC have not been demarcated and until that is done there will always be differing perceptions,” he said in the statement.Meanwhile, the Chinese defence ministry said on Wednesday that the frontline troops of both the countries in Eastern Ladakh had begun a synchronised and organised disengagement today, as per a statement issued by spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of National Defence, Senior Colonel Wu Qian.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-singh-to-make-a-statement-in-rajya-sabha-on-ladakh-situation-tomorrow-101612970669473.html

Dog squads have also been deployed inside the tunnel.Out of the total 204 missing people, about 190 are workers working in the two damaged dam projects-- Rishi Ganga and the NTPC's Tapovan project."Till Wednesday evening 34 bodies were recovered out of which 10 have been identified while 24 are yet to be identified. Now out of the total 204 missing, 170 are yet to be found," Uttarakhand’s director general of police, Ashok Kumar said.Among the dead, two were police personnel identified as assistant sub-inspector Manoj Choudhary and constable Balbir Singh. Choudhary was deployed as a security guard at the NTPC project in Tapovan while Singh was at the Rishi Ganga project. Their bodies were found on Tuesday."The two personnel were cremated with full state honours on Wednesday in Chamoli. As members of the state police, we are fully behind their family members in this hour of need," said Kumar.Meanwhile, the state forensic laboratory under Uttarakhand police are collecting DNA samples of the recovered bodies for their identification.Many of the bodies found were in mutilated condition making them unrecognisable.Nilesh Bharne, deputy inspector general (law and order) said, "The forensic people are collecting the DNA samples of the recovered bodies kept in the mortuaries based in Karnprayag, Joshimath and Gopeshwar near the disaster site. The samples would be used for their identification by matching them with that of their family members."Bharne also said that on Tuesday, a WhatsApp group at police headquarters level has also been created with family members of the missing to help identify the bodies."We are sharing the photographs and videos of jewellery, tattoos and other identity marks of the bodies on the group to enable their identification," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/death-toll-in-uttarakhand-flash-flood-rises-to-34-170-still-missing-101612969797305.html

Responding to a query, he told the Assembly that a total of 659 health workers including 86 medical officers, 309 staff nurse and 264 multi-tasking staff were recruited on contractual basis to assist regular staff deputed to Covid care, quarantine and testing centres.He said initially they were engaged for only three months but their engagement period was extended to another three months due to the requirement to fight the contagion.The government acknowledges the contribution made by the Covid-19 warriors, but in view of the current situation and fund constraint government cannot afford further engagement of the health workers, he added.The chief minister's statement came amidst protest by Covid-19 contractual healthworkers demanding extension of their service. Agitating workers had in a failed attempt even tried to storm the chief minister's bungalow earlier this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manipur-afford-further-engagement-of-contractual-covid-healthworkers-cm-101612969682908.html
10-02-2021||India||Contribution of this budget is 'Na Jawan na Kisan': Shashi Tharoor||Congress Member of Parliament Shashi Tharoor on Wednesday targeted the Central government over this year's Union budget allocations in the areas of health, agriculture, defence, and fiscal stimulus. Invoking Lal Bahadur Shastri’s words the Congress MP said the budget is neither meant for the Jawan nor for the Kisan.“The government has come out with a budget which deceives people with respect to the allocation in defence and health sectors. Lal Bahadur Shastri had said 'Jai Jawan Jai Kisan'. The contribution of this budget is 'Na Jawan na Kisan',” Tharoor said in Parliament.Tharoor delivered the critique of this year’s Union budget on behalf of his party, right after the Prime Minister had concluded his reply to the motion of thanks on the President's address.“The budget has delivered a blow to our hopes of expanding and developing the healthcare ecosystem of the country,” said Tharoor.He attacked the healthcare allocations in this year’s budget citing that a major chunk has been allocated to a one-time expense of carrying out the Covid-19 vaccination drive and to the department of health and family welfare.“Out of all these claimed allocations 35,000 crore is just a one time expenditure for the ongoing Covid-19 vaccination programme. Another 60,000 crore for the department of drinking water and sanitation. So as a result of this the actual allocation to the department of health and family welfare was only 71.269 crores, which marked not a 137% increase but a decline of nearly 7,000 crores or 10.84%” Tharoor told the Parliament.Tharoor accused the government of going back on their promise of expanding healthcare allocation and in the process betraying the frontline workers who have been at the forefront of the nation’s fight against Covid-19.“Together not only are these paltry allocations a reversal of the government’s own promise to the nation of increasing healthcare expenditure to 2.5% of our GDP by 2025, but they constitute an unconscionable betrayal of the countless sacrifices of our healthcare and frontline workers at the height of a pandemic.” remarked the former diplomat.Commenting on Nirmala Sitharaman invoking India’s historic win at Gabba, Tharoor said that the budget did not espouse the heroics witnessed at Brisbane.“Instead of the Brisbane heroics we got a Chennai collapse” said Tharoor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/contribution-of-this-budget-is-na-jawan-na-kisan-shashi-tharoor-101612968707306.html

She added that it was the need of the hour to listen to the farmers’ demands.“It is unfortunate that he said nothing for the 150 people who died (during farmers’ agitation). Where would the ministers have gone in Punjab when they couldn’t go to the borders of Delhi in the last 75 days?” Badal was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Badal, who was earlier the Union food minister in the Modi cabinet, had tendered her resignation last year in protest against the ‘anti-farmer ordinances and legislation’.I think the need of the hr is to listen to what farmer wants.

I wish he'd tell which farmer was spoken to because as far as I recall, the only minister who went to Punjab called farmers hooligans: Hasimrat Kaur Badal, SAD pic.twitter.com/IQtWcF8v7DBadal had said on Tuesday that the Centre was favouring capitalist cronies, alleging that in termed the protesters as bicholiya, naxals and khalistanis.

10-02-2021||India||Bangladeshi terrorist gets 29-yr jail term for Khagragarh bomb blast in Bengal||A National Investigation Agency (NIA) court in Kolkata on Wednesday sentenced Kausar, a Bangladeshi national and an operative of the banned Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) to 29 years in jail for his role in the 2014 bomb blast in a rented house at Khagragarh in Bengal’s East Burdwan district.Kausar was convicted under Sections 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 125 of the IPC (waging or attempt to wage war against the government of any Asiatic power in alliance or at peace with the government of India).He was arrested from a guest house in Bengaluru in August 2018 in a joint operation by the NIA and local police. As many as 31 people were named in the charge-sheet. Most of them have been convicted.Kausar, 31, is an accused in the 2018 Bodhgaya blast as well. He is also named in a case being investigated by the Special Task Force (STF) of the Kolkata Police, officials said.Kausar had formed a third faction of the JMB that operated out of West Bengal, a senior state intelligence officer told HT on condition of anonymity. The faction is often referred to as the New JMB."Kausar sneaked in and out India several times. He was close to Salahuddin who ran the second faction of the JMB. Kausar’s plans to carry out big terror attacks suffered a setback after the IED blew up in Khagragarh, killing two of their own operatives. It is the third faction of the JMB that allegedly masterminded the Holey Artisan Bakery attack in Dhaka in 2016. It is suspected that the faction has links with the Islamic State. Kausar was part of the modules that carried out more than 70 terror attacks in Bangladesh," the IB officer said.On October 2, 2014, when Bengal was celebrating Durga Puja, an improvised explosive device (IED) explosion killed two suspected terrorists and injured a third person while they were making bombs and explosive devices at a rented house in Khagragarh locality of Burdwan town. The blast exposed a network of Bangladeshi terrorists in the state.The NIA took over the probe later that year and submitted the first charge sheet in March 2015. “The rented house was occupied by the members of JMB, ostensibly for burkha-stitching, though in reality it was being used for the nefarious activity of bomb-making,” the NIA had said in a statement that year.In the chargesheet in the Khagragarh case, the NIA mentioned a conspiracy to overthrow the Sheikh Hasina government in Bangladesh.A large number of IEDs, explosives, hand grenades and training videos were seized during the investigation which also pointed at sleeper cells in the districts of Bengal.In August 2019, a special NIA court in Kolkata convicted 19 people, including four Bangladeshis, in the Khagragarh blast case.The accused persons were convicted under the Indian Penal Code, Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, Explosive Substances Act and Arms Act. All of them were charged with waging or attempting to wage war against the state.The Union home ministry banned JMB and its factions in May 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bangladeshi-terrorist-gets-29-yr-jail-term-for-bomb-blast-in-bengal-s-khagragarh-101612964333228.html
10-02-2021||India||Explained: How will new wage code impact take-home pay||Most of those working in private companies are likely to see a cut in the their take-home salary from April after the new wage rules under the Code of Wages comes into effect. The Code of Wages was passed in December 2019.The wage code will lead to increase in gratuity payments and employers’ contribution to their retirement corpus, which could lead to restructuring of salary structures.According to the draft rules, wages for the purpose of calculation of gratuity and provident fund contributions will have to be at least 50 per cent of employees' total pay. To comply with this rule, employers will have to increase the basic pay component of salaries, leading to a proportional increase in gratuity payments and employees’ contribution to the provident fund.Many private companies prefer to keep the allowances component higher and the basic salary lower. This will not be allowed under the new rules.Though the Code of Wages was passed in December 2019, the government had held back its implementation since it wanted to implement it together with other three codes - on Industrial Relations, Social Security and Occupational Health Safety & Working Conditions.All four codes will be implemented from April this year.The codes will play an important role in the year after the coronavirus pandemic which battered the economy last year. With the implementation of these four codes, the government wants to create a conducive environment for investors as well as to provide better social security to workers and protect their rights.The labour codes would not only provide social security to organised sector employees but also to informal sector workers like gig and platform workers. This means that the entire workforce of over 50 crore in the country would get social security coverage under the new legal framework from April onwards.Gig and platform workers are those who are not on the rolls of an organisation and they are not entitled to get various social security benefits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explained-how-will-new-wage-code-impact-take-home-pay-101612967037762.html
10-02-2021||India||Unfortunate that Aadhaar Act was challenged in court: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi used the Aadhaar scheme to target the opposition parties while replying to motion of thanks on the President's address in Lok Sabha on Wednesday. PM Modi said that schemes like Jan Dhan accounts and Aadhaar were very useful for the poor during Covid-19 but the opposition moved court against such programmes.He said, “Our Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile trinity made a positive difference in people's lives. It helped the poor and the marginalised. Unfortunately, people went to court against Aadhaar.” The Prime Minister was talking about how through Aadhaar, the government was able to send essential items and transfer cash over the past few years.The Aadhaar scheme was first challenged in court in 2012 on grounds that it invaded privacy and lacked statutory backing. Later in 2018, the apex court upheld the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies, Benefits and Services Act, 2016 (Aadhaar Act) and the 12-digit unique identity scheme.The court had then said that Aadhaar would be needed for accessing social welfare schemes but citizens cannot be forced to present Aadhaar while opening bank accounts and for getting mobile and internet connections.The government in 2016 introduced the Aadhaar Act in Parliament. The validity of the act was challenged once more in the Supreme Court on grounds that it was passed as a money bill and it had circumvented the Rajya Sabha.The Article 110 of the Constitution says that a money bill is a bill which includes provisions relating to taxation, borrowing of money by the government, appropriation of money out of the Consolidated Fund of India and expenditure from or to the Consolidated Fund of India. A money bill originates in Lok Sabha and once passed by the house with a simple majority in the Lok Sabha, it is then sent to the Rajya Sabha for its recommendations. The recommendations of the Rajya Sabha are not binding on the Lok Sabha.In 2018, former Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra declared privacy a fundamental right while upholding the validity of Aadhaar saying it involved “parting with minimal information” to fulfil the “larger public interest” of the marginalised and the poor, who can use it to obtain government benefits and subsidies, an argument which was strongly put forward by the central government in defence of the 12-digit unique identity number.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unfortunate-that-aadhaar-act-was-challenged-in-court-pm-modi-101612964727094.html

He insisted that the farmers protest is sacred but has been hijacked by the ‘andolanjivis’ who are now demonstrating with pictures of those jailed for terrorism.“Kisan Andolan is sacred, but when 'andolanjeevis' hijack it and show pictures of those jailed for terrorism what purpose does it serve?”The Prime Minister also said that the country needs to learn to differentiate between ‘andolanjeevis’ and ‘andolankaris’.The Prime Minister had on Monday vigorously defended the new farm laws in Rajya Sabha where he had made the ‘andolanjeevi’ remark.“We are familiar with shramjivi (those who labour), and buddhijivis (intellectuals). But I see that a new group has emerged in this country. If there is a lawyers movement, a students movement, a workers movement, they will be there — either in the front or behind the scenes. They cannot live without andolans (movements). They get to all places, give an ideological stand, mislead and show new ways. The country must be saved from these ‘andolanjeevis’,” the Prime Minister had said.The comment has received considerable backlash with politicians like P Chidambaram and Akhilesh Yadav citing examples of Mahatma Gandhi as the nation’s biggest ‘andolanjeevi’.“I’m a proud andolan jeevi. The quintessential andolan jeevi was Mahatma Gandhi,” Chidambaram had tweeted.Opposition parties like the Congress and Trinamool Congress staged a walkout during the Prime Minister’s response in the Parliament. He also faced vocal opposition and his speech was interrupted by sloganeering. He concluded his speech by requesting protesting farmers to resume talks with the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-is-important-to-differentiate-between-andolanjeevis-and-andolankaris-pm-modi-101612963259106.html

After 100m, they are facing a huge amount of slush brought in by the flash floods.Deputy director general, SDRF, Riddhim Aggarwal, who issued the permission for using drones and dog squads, said, "The drones are being used for thermal and laser scanning of the tunnel to get traces of the trapped workers."Apart from this, the helicopters are also being used for remote sensing so as to enable geographical mapping of the tunnel. This will not only clear the situation to much extent but also tell us about the amount of slush inside."The rescue workers are facing the challenge of removing boulders and heavy slush brought in by the flash floods while trying to reach the trapped workers.Navneet Bhullar, commandant SDRF, said, "There is very little progress in clearing the slush inside the tunnel as there are boulders.”"It is almost impossible to clear them manually but only by the heavy excavation machines which are doing so. But there are limitations in the exercise, " said Bhullar, adding, "we are hopeful of reaching the trapped workers with our constant efforts."After visiting the dam site on Tuesday evening, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said that the rescue workers are now planning to get inside the tunnel using an alternate route."They are planning to drill the tunnel and get inside with the help of ropes because they are facing difficulty to clear the slush even after using heavy machinery," said Rawat.Till Wednesday evening, the rescue workers recovered 34 bodies with about 170 missing. Out of the recovered bodies, 10 were identified. The number of missing people was also revised from 206 to 204 after two workers in the Rishi Ganga project were found safe at their respective homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drones-dog-squads-used-as-rescuers-face-slush-debris-at-uttarakhand-tunnel-101612962978704.html

Modi further said that the doctors, nurses, Covid warriors, sanitation workers and other such people had strengthened India’s fight against the pandemic. Replying to the Motion of Thanks on the President’s address in the Lok Sabha, he said, “Manish Tewari said that we stayed protected from Corona by God’s grace. I’d like to say something. This indeed is God’s grace that the entire world shook but we remained safe. It was because doctors & nurses came as God, because they couldn’t return to their homes for 15 days.”Further lauding the country’s achievements, the Prime Minister said that the way India handled and helped itself and the world during the Covid crisis was a turning point. He added that the post coronavirus world was turning out to be very different and that India would have to emerge as a strong player.“The post-Covid world is turning out to be very different. In such times, remaining isolated from global trends will be counter-productive. We’ll have to emerge as a strong player. That is why, India is working towards building an Aatmanirbhar Bharat,” the PM said in the Lower House.Meanwhile, Tewari- who has criticised the Centre’s handling of the pandemic on multiple occasions- hit out at the nationwide vaccination drive which started from January 16. Tewari had said that the vaccines were being permitted to be used without the compulsory phase three trials and questioned why didn’t government functionary had taken the shot.“If the vaccine is so safe and reliable and efficacy of the vaccine is beyond question then how is it that not a single functionary of the government has stepped forward to get themselves vaccinated as it has happened in other countries around the world?” he had said, according to news agency ANI.Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan responded to these allegations and said that Tewari and the Congress party were only passionate about spreading distrust and rumors. “Open your eyes, sharing photos of eminent Doctors and government functionaries getting inoculated,” the minister had tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indeed-it-s-god-s-grace-that-world-shook-due-to-covid-but-we-were-safepmmodi-101612961834131.html

This is seen as the first move towards resolving the nine-month military standoff that started in May last year.Also Read: Use the Ladakh crisis as an opportunity | OpinionThe 9th round of China-India Corps Commander Level meeting was held on the Chinese side of the Moldo-Chushul border meeting point on January 24.At the meeting, according to a joint release issued the following day, the two sides had “…agreed to push for an early disengagement of the frontline troops. They also agreed to follow the important consensus of their state leaders, maintain the good momentum of dialogue and negotiation, and hold the 10th round of the Corps Commander Level Meeting at an early date to jointly advance de-escalation.”“The two sides agreed to continue their effective efforts in ensuring the restraint of the frontline troops, stabilise and control the situation along the LAC in the Western Sector of the China-India border, and jointly maintain peace and tranquillity”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-start-limited-withdrawal-of-tanks-from-southern-bank-of-pangong-tso-101612961371915.html

He will leave for Chirang on Thursday on a private visit and return to Delhi later in the day. We have no other information beyond that,” said Assam BJP spokesperson Rupam Goswami.Terming inclusion of Cooch Behar district in West Bengal as violation of treaty signed on August 28, 1949 between the union government and Maharaja Jagaddipendra Naryan as the Koch-Rajbangshi dynasty, GCPA has been demanding creation of a separate state or autonomous body for their people.Rai is said to have considerable influence among the 18.5 lakh Koch-Rajbangshi voters in Assam and seven districts of West Bengal including Coch Behar, which has a significant Rajbangshi population that can swing fortunes in the nine assembly seats in the district.During his visit, Shah will have lunch at Rai’s house on Thursday and is expected to seek the latter’s support for the coming assembly polls in Assam and West Bengal due in April-May. Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and senior minister Himanta Biswa Sarma are expected to accompany Shah.“Amit Shah is coming to have a meal at my place and we all are very happy about it. We will serve him a traditional Koch-Rajbangshi meal and discuss politics,” Rai had told journalists on Tuesday.Security has been tightened in Chirang ahead of Shah’s visit with central forces sanitizing Rai’s residence in Satipur and areas adjoining it. The Union home minister who visited Assam on January 24 and addressed two rallies doesn’t have any other engagement during this visit.Koch-Rajbangshis are one of the six communities in Assam that are demanding Scheduled Tribe (ST) status. Since the BJP had promised to grant that, discussion on it is also likely during Shah’s meeting with Rai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-eye-on-koch-rajbangshi-votes-in-assam-and-wb-amit-shah-to-visit-maharaj-101612961194675.html
10-02-2021||India||'We walked out of Lok Sabha because...': Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury explains Congress' decision||As Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke about the government's stand on farm laws in the Lok Sabha, the Congress MPs started shouting slogans. The uproar led to interruption in the Prime Minister's reply to motion of thanks on the President's address and a brief exchange of words between PM Modi and Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury.The Congress has been against the three contentious laws, and supported the farmers' demand to repeal them. When PM Modi delved into the government's stand on the farm laws, the Congress MPs walked out of the Lok Sabha.Chowdhury later explaied the reason behind their step."We walked out because PM didn't discuss our concerns over farmers' death. He agreed that amendments are required in farm laws, some states will be benefitted and some won't. Why do you have to bring laws that won't be benefitting everyone?" said the Congress leader."206 farmers have died during the ongoing protest, but our Prime Minister is not ready to say anything on the matter," Chowdhury added.The Prime Minister had attacked the Congress during his speech, saying it is misleading the farmers."Congress MPs in House debated on the colour of the laws. It would have been better if they had debated on the content and intent of the laws. Let us understand, as far as the protests are concerned, our farmer brothers at Delhi borders have been a victim of rumours, propaganda and confusion," he said."The farmers' protest is sacred, but when 'andolanjivis' hijack it and show pictures of those jailed for terrorism, what purpose does it serve?" PM Modi said.He also said that the three laws were brought in by the governmenr as an honest effort to improve the conditions of agriculture sector."Three farm laws were brought in by the government. The process of agricultural reforms is necessary and important. The agriculture sector has been facing challenges for years," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-walked-out-because-adhir-ranjan-chowdhury-explains-congress-decision-101612960526899.html

If voted to power, the Congress will scrap these laws," she said.She said the party's fight will continue till the laws are scrapped.The rally is the first in a series of such farmers' meetings planned by the Congress in western Uttar Pradesh, a year before the assembly elections in the state where the opposition party is struggling to revive itself.The Congress leader was presented with a pair of ploughs at the meeting."These three laws were drafted in such a way that government `mandis’ will eventually close down, the farmers will not get the MSP (minimum support price) and there will be hoarding,” she said.“In other words, the farmers’ voice will become weak and the voice of billionaires will grow stronger," she said.Earlier, she tweeted in Hindi, "To listen to the farmers’ 'dil ki baat', understand them, share my feelings with them and support their struggle, I will be in Saharanpur today. The BJP government will have to withdraw the black farm laws."When asked to comment on the Congress event, UP minister Anand Swarup Shukla said a "drama” is being enacted in the name of farmers.He claimed that “gangs” opposing the government have gone international, and referred to tweets on the farmers’ protest by foreign celebrities.He asked Congress leaders to “oppose Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but not the country".Law Minister Brijesh Pathak said the BJP government was committed to help farmers and termed Priyanka Gandhi’s tour an "eyewash". "Some leaders just want to be in the limelight," he added.The Congress general secretary visited the Shakumbhari temple in Saharanpur and offered prayers for farmers, the UP Congress said in a tweet.She also visited Raipur Khanqah Dargah, the party said.UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu and senior party leader P L Punia attended the ‘panchayat’.Opposition parties including the Congress are supporting farmers camping on the borders of Delhi for weeks, demanding the repeal of the agri-marketing laws enacted last September.Most of the protesters are from Punjab and Haryana, but there is sizeable number from western Uttar Pradesh with Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait assuming a lead role in the agitation.Recently, Rashtriya Lok Dal leader Jayant Chaudhary also addressed farmers' mahapanchayats in western UP.Farmer unions say the laws will weaken the MSP system. But the government says they offer more options to farmers to sell their crops, and will help raise their incomes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-will-scrap-farm-laws-if-it-comes-to-power-priyanka-gandhi-101612960171280.html

A divided and confused party like this can do no good to country," said PM Modi.He also said that the uproar and noise against farm laws is part of a well-thought-out strategy."Noises and attempts to obstruct are part of a well-thought-out strategy. The strategy is to keep making noises otherwise the lies and rumours will be exposed, truth will come out and things will get difficult for them. You won't be able to win people's confidence like that," said PM Modi.As Congress MPs started shouting, the Prime Minister asked the party's leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury to maintain the decorum."Adhir Ranjan ji, this is too much. I respect you. You will get more publicity than Trinamool Congress in Bengal, don't worry. This doesn't look good, why are you doing this?" said PM Modi."Three farm laws were brought in by government, these agricultural reforms are important and necessary. Congress MPs in House debated on colour of the laws (black/white), it would have been better if they had debated on the content and intent of the laws," said PM Modi.The leaders of Congress walked out of Lok Sabha as the Prime Minister explained the government's stand.The three bills have sparked protests across the country, including at three key border points of Delhi. The Congress has been supporting these protests; on Tuesday, party leader Manish Tewari said that eight Congress MPs from Punjab will move a private members' bill in Parliament for the repeal of the three contentious farm laws.The group did not involve their Rajya Sabha counterparts and after announcing the plan, Tewari said that they will seek support from party colleagues and like-minded parties.A private member’s bill is a legislation proposed by an MP and not by the government. In the past, 14 such bills have translated into law of the land but since 1970, no private member bill has been cleared by the House.The three bills against which the farmers are protesting since November 26 are: Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-lok-sabha-address-pm-modi-says-congress-divided-and-confused-101612958916556.html

Daily toll collection through FASTag has crossed ₹89 crore mark.As payment on toll plazas through FASTag will become mandatory from February 15, 2021, National Highways Authority of India is targeting to achieve 100 per cent cashless tolling at the toll plazas across the country.

No foul play was detected. The family had borrowed huge sums of money from local people and banks. They probably died by suicide. Investigation is on,” said a senior police officer who did not wish to be named.Locals said that while the man was a government employee, his son had a business dealing in pets. Recently he sold all the birds. He was earlier working in Pune but had returned to Kolkata on his father's request and started a business.“How can a man who always used to smile and tell others to ‘be happy’ die by suicide? We never got any inkling that they would take such an extreme step. They all looked so happy and tension-free. If they had any problems they could have shared with us,” said a relative, who stays in the same locality.In the morning when a local person failed to get any response after repeatedly knocking on the door, he informed the neighbours. The family’s relatives who stay nearby were also informed.“As the doors were all bolted from inside some of them scaled the boundary wall and went to the terrace. When they found the terrace door locked too, they broke it open and entered the house to find that all of them dead in the bedroom,” said the police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/threemember-family-found-dead-in-kolkata-101612956681908.html

Given the increase in the number of pilgrims, the Char Dham board last October decided to allow 3000 pilgrims to Badrinath and Kedarnath, 900 to Gangotri and 700 to Yamunotri daily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-government-starts-preparing-for-char-dham-yatra-101612955470037.html
10-02-2021||India||Madras HC dismisses plea seeking directions to declare Lord Muruga Tamil God||The Madras high court’s Madurai bench has dismissed a plea seeking directions for the state government to declare Lord Muruga a Tamil God, saying it would damage the country’s secular and federal structure. The bench referred to the Constitution’s preamble on the country’s secular nature.“The petitioner may have a justifiable reason to treat Lord Muruga as the Lord of the Tamil Language. It is for him to do so. However, as a state such a request is not feasible for consideration,” the bench said on February 4. It observed that Tamil literature has been enriched by works praising Hindu Gods. But “seeking to declare one God as the sole representative of the Tamil language would mean that other literary writings in praise of Gods other than Lord Muruga cannot be recognised.”Lord Muruga is a popular deity in Tamil Nadu and is considered a Dravidian or Tamil God. The deity is worshipped mostly by backward communities. Devotees march to the deity’s abodes by tonsuring, piercing their face or body or carrying a variety of kavadi (burden).Also Read | Unease in AIADMK as Sasikala returns to Tamil NaduThe court order came months after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), an ally of the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) in poll-bound Tamil Nadu, launched a month-long vetrivel yatra (victorious spear march) in November to Lord Muruga’s six abodes across the state. During the yatra, the BJP accused the Opposition Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) of being anti-Hindu.The vel (spear) carried by the deity is now seen during the campaigns of senior leaders of the DMK, AIADMK, and the BJP.The state government last month declared Thaipusam, an annual festival linked to Lord Muruga, a public holiday on the BJP’s request.Thirumurugan, the petitioner who earlier made a representation on January 7 to the state government for the declaration, moved the court saying ancient literature cited Lord Muruga identifying himself as the Tamil God. He claimed chief minister Edapaddi Palaniswami had made a similar statement.The court noted Palaniswami’s comments were made in the context of announcing the holiday for Thaipusam. “No reliance can be made on the same, even otherwise,” said the two-judge bench of justices M M Sundresh and S Ananthi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-court-dismisses-plea-seeking-directions-to-declare-lord-muruga-tamil-god-101612955703291.html
10-02-2021||India||PM Modi says Congress made noise about colour of farm laws, but didn't discuss their content and intent||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday criticised the detractors of farm laws and said that much has been said about the color of the farm laws but no one has discussed the ‘content and intent’ of the laws.PM Modi said, “Much has been said about the color of the laws but not much has been discussed about the content and intent of the laws.”The Prime Minister also said that the Centre has always wanted the benefit for farmers and the farm laws were framed to benefit the small farmers of the nation. He also said that questions are being raised regarding the necessity of implementing the farm laws and he said that laws are being brought to spur the development of the nation.He said, “There is a strange question being raised in the Parliament. Lawmakers have asked why are laws being brought when no one has asked for it. The point is laws are not brought depending on who wants it or not. Laws are brought to help the nation develop and grow.”“No one asked us to bring law on abolishing triple talaq, to abolish the practice of system of dowry and no one asked us to bring law banning child marriage. We implemented a law ensuring the right to education for all. These laws were not brought because someone asked for it. We brought these laws because there was a need for these laws to foster development and growth,” the Prime Minister further added.Prime Minister Narendra Modi also pointed out that several political parties have desired to bring similar changes to the agricultural sector. He said that former agriculture minister Sharad Pawar had himself highlighted the importance of repealing the APMC Act in the Parliament during the UPA regime.PM Modi also said that he has utmost respect for agitations demanding equal rights and said that protests and agitations are hallmarks of a healthy democracy. He outlined that he is worried that ‘andolankaris’ are being maligned because of the act of ‘andolanjeevis’. The prime minister also said that the Union ministers are engaged in talks with farmers and have their best interests at heart.The Prime Minister’s speech in the Lok Sabha was interrupted several times by Opposition leaders. Congress politicians walked out between the Prime Minister’s speech.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-says-cong-made-noise-about-colour-of-farm-laws-but-didn-t-discuss-101612955593782.html

We have to decide if we have to be spectators, or emerge as world leader. India has to be self-reliant, empowered and capable if it has to emerge as a leader in the world," PM Modi said."We're knocking at the doors of 75 years of Independence. It's a matter of pride for every Indian and an occasion to move forward. We may be in any corner or belong to any strata of society but we must make a new resolve that where do we want to take India at 100 years of freedom," he further said.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) issued a three-line whip to its Lok Sabha members to be present in the House today and support the government's stand.The Prime Minister had replied to the motion of thanks in the Rajya Sabha on Monday in which he talked about a range of issues, including the farmers' protest near Delhi. He urged the protesting farmers to avoid being misled on farm laws while assuring that the minimum support price or MSP will stay.The MSP has emerged as one of the key issues with the farmers claiming it will be abolished putting them at the mercy of big corporate houses. They have been demanding a law as guarantee on MSP.Among other things PM Modi talked about during his Rajya Sabha address was India's battle against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the Republic Day violence and international attention to farmers' protest.He applauded the people's contribution in the fight against Covid-19, crediting them with overcoming the various hardships and following safety protocols.The Prime Minister also congratulated state governments, saying Covid-19 gave an opportunity to enshrine the values of cooperating federalism.PM Modi then turned his focus on the protests against the farm laws in which he said that there are some ‘aandolan jeevis’ (professional agitators), who, he said, are seen at every agitation. "We have to identify them," he said."Some people are trying to create unrest in India. We should not forget what happened with Punjab. In 1984, Punjab suffered the most. What happened in J&K, northeast hurt India. Sikhs are being misled. The country is proud of the Sikhs," PM Modi said referring to the recent international support to farmers' protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-way-india-handled-and-helped-itself-and-the-world-during-covid-19-was-a-turn-101612952912722.html

Rahul Gandhi has been leading the party's attack, saying that Singh, the minister of state for transport and highways, should be sacked."Why is a BJP minister helping China make a case against India?

He added that it would also boost port land usage and amplify competition in port tariffs.The bill was passed in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday through ballot votes with 84 in favour and 44 against it; the Lok Sabha had cleared it in September last year.Major Ports Authorities Bill will encourage good competition between major & private ports. It'll boost port land usage & amplify competition in port tariffs. India's major ports will be able to survive while competing with non-major & private ports: Union Min Mansukh Mandaviya https://t.co/fd18uocUn9 pic.twitter.com/Gl3cOqAMDBThe bill seeks to provide more autonomy in decision-making to the 12 major ports of the country- Deendayal (erstwhile Kandla), Mumbai, JNPT, Marmugao, New Mangalore, Cochin, Chennai, Kamarajar (earlier Ennore), V O Chidambarnar, Visakhapatnam, Paradip and Kolkata (including Haldia)- and also professionalise their governance through the formation of boards.Speaking to the news agency ANI, Mansukh said, “Major Ports Authorities Bill will encourage good competition between major & private ports. It’ll boost port land usage and amplify competition in port tariffs. India’s major ports will be able to survive while competing with non-major and private ports.”Several opposition parties including the Congress, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), the Samajwadi Party (SP), the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) etc opposed the bill by alleging that it was aimed towards the privatisation of ports and depleting the powers of states with regard to land use.Congress MP Shaktisinh Gohil pointed out that loopholes in the draft copy of the bill were intentionally kept with a view to assist the “backdoor entry of the friends” into the sector. Echoing Gohil’s argument, DMK leader P Wilson said that the bill had been passed to serve private players and also reduce the state governments' say in the development of ports.Responding to all these allegations of the opposition leaders, Union minister Mandaviya said that the bill was not intended towards privatising major ports. It would rather boost their decision making powers so that they can compete with world-class ports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/major-ports-authorities-bill-would-encourage-good-competition-union-minister-101612952225204.html

Canada isn’t on list||India has cleared supply of 24 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines to 25 countries on a commercial basis in February, more than twice the 10.5 million vaccines that were exported in January, people familiar with the development said on Wednesday.The government last month mandated that the external affairs ministry would oversee the export of the vaccine on a commercial basis to foreign countries and international organisations.India has supplied 16.7 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII) to 20 countries. This included nearly 6.3 million doses that were supplied free to 13 countries such as Bangladesh, Myanmar, Bhutan, Nepal, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Bahrain and Oman, Barbados and Dominica. About 10 million more doses were supplied on a commercial basis to seven countries including Brazil, Morocco and South Africa.According to the external affairs ministry’s plans for February, the SII has been cleared to supply 24 million doses on a commercial basis to 25 countries including Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Morocco, Myanmar, Nepal, Nicaragua, Mauritius, Philippines, Serbia, UAE and Qatar.This list of 25 countries does not include Canada that recently requested for 1 million doses of the vaccine, a government official said.Canada’s minister of public services and procurement Anita Anand, an Indo-Canadian, faced some embarrassing moments this week when she was unable to respond to questions from a lawmaker who asked if the government reached out to New Delhi to make up for its difficulties in getting Covid vaccines.In a widely-circulated video, Anita Anand told the lawmaker that she hadn’t phoned Prime Minister Narendra Modi but wasn’t aware if anyone else in the government had reached out to the Indian government. “She doesn’t know…. Frightening,” Michelle Rempel Garner, the shadow minister of health for the opposition Conservative Party who pressed for a clear answer, remarked towards the end of the 39-second video.The Justin Trudeau government, which targets vaccination of all residents by September 2021, has been under pressure from the opposition over complaints of inoculation shortages as the winter wave of the Covid-19 pandemic continues in Canada.

10-02-2021||India||Supreme Court rejects plea seeking formulation of national mortal remains management, disposal protocol||The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to entertain a writ petition seeking a direction to the UOI (Union of India) and concerned state authorities for 'National and State Mortal Remains Management Disposal Protocol'.A bench of Justice Ashok Bhushan, while refusing to entertain the writ petition filed by G Manohar, said, a similar issue had already been taken up by the top court and "we had already issued the necessary directions and order in such kind of similar matter".The writ petition filed by Manohar before the Supreme Court had claimed a mix up of her mother's body at a Delhi mortuary in sector-6 in Dwarka's hospital, namely Manipal Hospital.The writ petition filed by Manohar claimed his mother's dead body was allegedly mixed up and cremated by someone else due to lack of proper Dead Body Management Protocol.Thereby, he had approached the Supreme Court under Article 32 for framing a 'National and State Mortal Remains Management Disposal Protocol'.The apex court today opined that as a suo motu petition is pending before the court, therefore it declined to entertain the writ petition but it granted liberty to the petitioner, Manohar, to intervene in the already pending matter."The intervention is allowed in this matter," the apex court said.Manohar, 39, had to bear the trauma of losing his mother and then his fate had turned into double jeopardy, when he could not perform his mother's last rites due to the hospital's alleged lapse during Covid-19 pandemic, forcing his dead mother's last rites to be performed by another man, who also lost his mother.Manohar told ANI that he was the victim of the "callous action" and "negligence" of the Manipal Hospital, Sector 6, Dwarka, which "without any respect to him and his family, denied a decent burial to his mother, as they allegedly handed over the dead body of her mother in the most undignified manner without any verification, to a total stranger and his family to be cremated by them."Manohar has filed this writ petition, in the Supreme Court through his lawyer, Shilpa Liza George seeking proper laying down of a National/State Mortal Remains Management/Disposal Protocol to avoid similar trauma to others.Manohar stated that his mother (who died of non-Covid causes) and her body was allegedly given to one Puneet Kohli, whose mother died due to Covid and it was due to the alleged mix up of the medical negligence of the hospital, these two dead bodies were allegedly exchanged.The petitioner, Manohar, lost his mother on September 14, last year, and realised the next day that she has already been bid farewell to by a stranger family, which was difficult for his family, as they continue to deal with the psychological trauma of having lost their loved one.Manohar said he wanted to highlight the lack of management protocol in the country, as a result of which irreversible harm and agony of this sort was being caused.In his writ petition, Manohar further requested the Apex Court "to direct the Centre and states to set up a National/State Mortal Remains Management/ Disposal Protocol that will be strictly adhered to, so that such trauma and distress can be avoided.""The notion of respect is so rooted that we even agree to deal gently with the bodies of our enemies," Manohar stated in his petition.Manohar had to now live with the hard and bizarre truth that his mother's body was mistaken for some other Covid-19 victim and was given away for cremation by someone else denying him the sacred rights of doing the last rites to his mother, the petition stated.Manohar stated in his petition, a copy of which was exclusively accessed by ANI, that this is due to the absence of a proper Mortal Remains Management Disposal Protocol in the country, because of which such a disastrous and irreversible act has taken place.The complete lack of a proper system of checks and balances is leading to hospitals taking the excuse of being overburdened with dead bodies, he said, in his petition.He stated that he is aggrieved by the fact that his mother's body was so carelessly stored without proper labelling or identification, with other highly infected Covid-19 bodies in the mortuary of the respondent hospital.Then due to a mix-up of bodies, it was handed over to a stranger and his family for cremation, with complete disregard and negligence, as a result of which the petitioner and his family did not get to see or bury the mortal remains of his mother according to their religious rites and rituals, he said.The Manipal Hospitals, Dwarka, however, told ANI that it has always been at the forefront of patient care and strictly follows all protocols and guidelines for treatment and care."Handing over of the deceased is also done as per the laid guidelines. However, the new set of guidelines laid down under Covid 19 pandemic restrict the movement in the mortuary. Covid-19 has also brought in heavy pressure on healthcare workers, systems, and processes," an official from the hospital said.The act done is irreversible and there is no closure for the petitioner and his family as they not only lost their mother but also lost the right to bury her, Manohar said."To make matters worse, the hospital has not shown any remorse for its act, knowing full well that such indignity in death was afforded to petitioner's mother due to the negligent actions of the hospital and due to the lack of a proper Mortal Remains Storage and Management Protocol in Delhi," Manohar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-rejects-plea-seeking-formulation-of-national-mortal-remains-management-disposal-protocol-101612948813308.html

They complained of loud sirens from motorcycles every hour at night and added they disturb their sleep. The complainants cited a Supreme Court order banning sirens in residential localities between 10pm and 6am, provided there is no emergency.“You are, therefore, requested to direct the in charge of the Sadbhavana chowki not to play the siren from 10 in the night to 6 in the morning,” the complaint said.Also Read | Home guard dismissed for showing affection to LGBT partner reinstated by courtGonda police superintendent Shailesh Pandey said they received the complaint but found the demand unwarranted. He added using sirens is an old practice and an essential part of their duty. Pandey said sirens are within the permissible limits of sound. “Sirens at night instill a sense of security among people besides often scaring anti-social elements away.”Alok Roy, another police officer, said sirens were being used is on the outskirts of the city that are prone to criminal incidents, especially during winter.Police chief HC Awasthi said they will look at the wider perspective and not go by anybody’s liking or disliking. “Maintaining law and order, as well as prevention and detection of crime, are police’s primary duty. If anything is necessary for these, then it has to be done.” Awasthi said traffic diversions trouble some people, but they are done for a wider public cause.Former police chief Sulkhan Singh said the residents’ demand is justified. “Using the horn unnecessarily is an offense. ...use of sirens is permitted only when a police vehicle or an ambulance is rushing to attend an emergency. Sirens cannot be used if roads are clear or when the police are moving in the normal course.”Additional transport commissioner Arvind Kumar Pandey said police vehicles can use sirens as may be approved by the registering authority. “However, in practice, no such approvals are sought.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-gonda-residents-file-complaint-against-police-sirens-seek-night-ban-101612947122448.html

Congress MP Ravneet Singh Bittu again misled and our minister Anurag Thakur immediately exposed his lies," Tomar said in another tweet today.The Minister had earlier said that the opposition has failed to point flaws in new farm laws and the opposition did not discuss provisions of these legislations during the motion of thanks to the President's Address in Rajya Sabha."For two months I kept asking the farmers' union what is 'black' in these laws? Tell me if it should be fixed. Opposition leaders called criticising the agrarian reform. But no one tried to explain how are they harming the farmers," Tomar had said.Several rounds of discussion have been held between the government and the protesting farmer unions. The government has said that it is willing to put the farm laws on hold for about 18 months.Farmers have been protesting on the different borders of the national capital since November 26 last year against the three newly enacted farm laws: Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/narendra-singh-tomar-slams-congress-for-lying-misleading-people-on-farm-laws-101612945122675.html

But it also mentioned its inaction on the accounts of media entities, journalists, activists, and politicians citing "violation of freedom of expression" as the reason.Twitter seems to hold itself above the laws of the Indian State.

But Twitter took time to act on that and some of the accounts were restored after a brief suspension. The ministry again wrote to Twitter and warned of penal actions. Twitter, meanwhile sought to meet government representatives in this regard and provided an update in a blog on Wednesday before the meeting.Sorry dude, I don’t want Twitter to ban anyone - Congressi or BJP or anyone.#FoE is sacrosanct.

PM Skerrit, who sought the vaccines on January 19, said he hadn’t really hoped to get the vaccines so soon.The vaccines were flown to Dominica’s Douglas–Charles Airport in neighbouring Barbados’ Air National Guard’s plane on Tuesday.PM Skerrit and his cabinet colleagues formally received the vaccines; they even helped unload some of the boxes of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine from the plane.A gesture of goodwill, an example of support.

One would have thought and understood that in a global pandemic such as this, a nation's size and might would have been the primary considerations. But it is to the credit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi that our request was considered on merit and the equality of our people was recognised,” PM Skerrit said at a formal ceremony at the airport held soon after the plane with the vaccines arrived.Also Watch | ‘India conducting biggest Covid vaccine programme in the world’: PM ModiIndia’s donation of 35,000 vaccines to Dominica is part of PM Modi’s pledge to help other countries overcome the pandemic challenges.

The crop insurance scheme was changed to make it more farmer friendly. The PM-KISAN scheme was also brought in,” he told Parliament, adding that the need of the hour is to improve the lives of the small farmers.While speaking on the contentious agricultural laws that have triggered protests by farmers for the past two months at Delhi borders, Modi quoted former prime minister Manmohan Singh.“There are other rigidities because of the marketing regime set up in the 1930s which prevent our farmers from selling their produce where they get the highest rate of return. It is our intention to remove all those handicaps which come in the way of India realising its vast potential as one large common market,” he cited a previous remark by Singh and said that there is a clear U-turn by the Congress now.The Prime Minister also slammed those behind the farmer’s demonstration against the agricultural laws enacted in September last year, saying a new "breed" of agitators has emerged who cannot live without an agitation and the country should be beware of them. “A new FDI (Foreign Destructive Ideology) has emerged in the country, he said.The Prime Minister also lauded the role India played in the battle against the coronavirus disease, for which he said, “the world now looks up to us.” This was an unprecedented crisis so nobody knew how to handle this unknown enemy. However, today the whole world recognises that India played a significant role in saving humanity,” he said in his speech during the ongoing budget session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-reply-to-motion-of-thanks-on-president-s-address-in-lok-sabha-today-101612943763711.html

Indian army and Indo-Tibetan Border Police personnel are clearing the muck while the state disaster response force (SDRF) is in searching for bodies and relief work in the affected villages in Sunday’s tragedy. Till Wednesday morning, the rescue workers were able to clear up to 100m of the tunnel with the workers feared to be trapped at a distance of 250m inside the tunnel. Beyond that point, muck brought in by the flash floods has filled the area. SDRF deputy director general Riddhim Aggarwal who issued the permission for using drones and dog squad said, “Drones are being used for thermal and laser scanning of the tunnel to get traces of the trapped workers.” Also Read | 13 villages cut off as lone bridge near Rishiganga project washes away“Apart from this, helicopters are also being used for remote sensing so as to enable geographical mapping of the tunnel.

Earlier on Tuesday evening, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, after visiting the dam site, said that the rescue workers are now planning to get inside the tunnel using an alternative way. “They are planning to drill the tunnel and get inside with the help of ropes because they are facing difficulty in clearing the muck even after using heavy machinery,” said Rawat.

"Because we do not believe that the actions we have been directed to take are consistent with Indian law."India had also asked Twitter to restrict access to news accounts, arguing that the "freedom of press does not include freedom to spread misinformation", according to a copy of a government order reviewed by Reuters.Twitter said it had not taken action on accounts run by journalists, news media, activists and politicians, in line with its policy of defending freedom of speech."To do so, we believe, would violate their fundamental right to free expression under Indian law," Twitter said, adding that it had informed the technology ministry of its actions.Twitter has been seeking talks with India's technology minister. A ministry source said that request has been declined and the company has been advised to seek a meeting with the top ministry official instead.India's technology ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Twitter has also said it is exploring its options under Indian law.Tens of thousands of farmers have camped on the outskirts of New Delhi for months demanding the withdrawal of new agriculture laws they say benefit private buyers at the expense of growers.

On Tuesday, there was a hike of 35 paise in the Capital.Replying to questions in Parliament, the minister said the Union government has little to do with petrol, diesel prices and the prices are dependant on international crude oil price. Terming this explanation 'misguiding', Congress MP KC Venugopal said petrol in his village reached ₹100 per litre. "Petrol and diesel prices are highest of all time now but the crude oil price is not the highest of all time now," Venugopal said asking whether the government will take some step to regularise the prices.Replying to questions of Hon. MP Shri Banda Prakash and Shri @SantanuSenMP in Rajya Sabha on the selling price of petrol and diesel. #BudgetSession2021 pic.twitter.com/nP8PUi51PO"Venugopal ji is a wise member and a good politician. With utmost politeness, I would like to share this fact today the international crude oil price is 61 dollar. he belongs to the state of Kerala where a lot of people are staying in the Gulf area. Before coming to the House, he should at least check with some of his close friends from that area what is the price," Dharmendra Pradhan said."This is an issue we have to tackle with utmost care. States are responsible. Union government is also responsible for this tax issue. Centre has increased excise duty and states have increased VAT according to their own developmental need. And sometimes, the government has reduced excise duty as well. In the last 300 days, the prices have not changed at all for 250 days. So it is a misnomer to campaign in that way that the prices are an all-time high," the minister said.Budget 2021: How will cess on petrol, diesel impact you?"Petroleum products' prices are governed by some international pricing mechanism. This is the practice of the last few decades in our country because we have to import almost 85% of our requirement from the international market. When there is a price hike in the international market, we have to go by that mechanism. The price comes down according to the decrease in the crude oil price in the international market. This is a market mechanism developed by all marketing companies. We have given the freedom to them," he said replying to similar questions in the House on Wednesday.Replying to Trinamul MP Santanu Sen's question that 90% of the pricing is controlled by the Centre, Dharmendra Pradhan said, "90% is not governed by Centre. State governments and union governments are careful about their tax collection because everybody has their own welfare commitment. They need some resource from this route. This is a proven route by all governments — irrespective of parties and states."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petrol-diesel-price-wrong-to-say-all-time-high-says-minister-in-parliament-101612940392912.html

The quintessential andolan jeevi was Mahatma Gandhi.#iamanandolanjeeviThe term has not gone down well with the farmers’ leaders, who have been spearheading protests against the three farm laws, as well as the Opposition. All of them have accused PM Modi of using it for farmers who have been protesting peacefully against the legislations on the borders of Delhi since November last year.The Prime Minister came up with the term ‘andolan jeevi’ in the Upper House of Parliament on Monday, while responding to Motion of Thanks on President Ram Nath Kovind’s address in the House. “Today we see that a new class of people have come up. They can be seen wherever there is a protest, be it by lawyers, students, or labourers. They can’t live without protests. We need to identify such people and protect the country from them,” he said, further calling them ‘parasites.’Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Harayana, have been protesting on three borders in the national capital-Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur-against the laws that were passed amid chaotic scenes in the Parliament last September. 11 rounds of talks have failed to resolve the deadlock between the protesting farmers and the central government. The farmers have two main demands: a legal assurance on Minimum Support Price (MSP) and complete rollback of the laws.While the Centre has repeatedly reassured that the MSP will stay, it has categorically refused to withdraw the legislations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/proud-andolan-jeevi-p-chidambaram-s-take-on-phrase-coined-by-pm-modi-101612939783579.html

10-02-2021||India||Parliament: Congress leaders want Rahul Gandhi to initiate debate on budget today||Several Congress leaders are trying to ensure former party chief Rahul Gandhi initiates the all-important debate on the general budget from the Opposition side on Wednesday. The budget debate will start in Lok Sabha on Wednesday after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s reply on the motion of thanks to the President’s speech. The debate on the Union Budget will also commence in the Upper House on Wednesday. While senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor is scheduled to be the first speaker of the Congress on the budget debate, Congress floor leader Adhir Chowdhury told HT on Tuesday evening that the plan might change. “Rahul Gandhi will speak on the budget. He might also be the first speaker,” Chowdhury said. Also Read | Opposition leaders hit out at govt on farm lawsHe also added, “plans can always change” when pointed out that the Congress has informed the Lok Sabha secretariat that Tharoor will initiate the debate. An aide of Gandhi’s also said, “There is a plan for him to speak, but it is not confirmed whether he will open the debate.” Congress leaders pointed out that Gandhi will leave for a two-day tour to Rajasthan on February 12, leaving him a small window—Wednesday and Thursday—to participate in the budget debate. The budget debate is also Gandhi’s last chance to actively participate in the first half of the session as it will end on February 13. The second half of the session will debate the finance bill and demand for grants of different ministries. While he hasn’t spoken so far in the ongoing budget session, Gandhi, has been active on social media to slam the government’s economic policies and the budget and has held two press conferences on farm issues and budget. His aides, meanwhile, also revealed that Gandhi is upset over his party’s floor strategy in the Rajya Sabha vis-à-vis the farm protests. Gandhi disapproved the decision of the Congress leadership in Rajya Sabha to join the debate on the President’s speech last week while the party leaders in Lok Sabha continued to disrupt and protest, exposing a major fissure in the Congress’ parliamentary tactics. According to party insiders, Gandhi has made his displeasure known to the Rajya Sabha leaders. Last Wednesday morning, the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha leadership of the Congress received a missive from Rahul Gandhi: the party should continue to protest if the government did not accept the Opposition’s demand for a separate debate for farm issues. But minutes later, the Rajya Sabha leadership of the Congress, along with other Opposition parties, negotiated with the government’s floor managers to extend the time for debate on the president’s speech by another five hours; and the debate started after the suspension of the Question Hour and the Zero Hour. Gandhi signalled his approval for the party’s stand in the Lower House in a meeting with some Opposition leaders. He told them that they were on the “right path” and a separate discussion on the farm issues is “absolutely essential”. Gandhi also allayed apprehensions that many Opposition MPs might stop coming to the House disruptions persist, and said, “we will ensure that MPs come to the Lok Sabha.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajya-sabha-rahul-gandhi-could-initiate-debate-on-budget-today-101612940102126.html

The government wants to act rather as a facilitator than an authority".In order to strengthen the digital economy, the government will focus on improving connectivity even to remote parts, providing 24/7 electricity, and reducing the rural-urban divide by establishing needed infrastructure, he explained.Highlighting that the industry sector is not showing interest to take up students for internships, he said this needs to be changed and they should be encouraged to undergo internship as youth is the future of the country and talent needs to be nurtured.The KDEM aims to attract investments for the IT/ITeS sector in the state and to create 10 lakh jobs by 2025. It works to achieve the target by focusing on 5 verticals of IT products and services, Innovation and Startups, Electronic System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM), 'Beyond Bengaluru', and 'Talent Accelerator'.He expressed confidence that KDEM would help Karnataka to reach the goal of 150 billion dollars in IT exports and also to become a 300 billion dollars economy by 2025.Dr EV Ramana Reddy, ACS, Department of Electronics, IT/BT and S&T said, "At present, the contribution of IT sector to the GSDP is 25 per cent and in this Bengaluru alone accounts for nearly 98 per cent. Keeping this in view and to increase the contribution of other regions, the 'Beyond Bengaluru' project has been initiated. By the time when India aims to become a trillion-dollar economy in the coming five years, the contribution of 'Beyond Bengaluru' should be in a position to contribute 10 per cent to GSDP."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-digital-economy-mission-office-inaugurated-101612927792129.html

Last week, Chinese authorities had agreed to India’s request to permit a crew change on the merchant vessel MV Anastasia, which was in anchorage near Caofeidian port since September 20. “Great start of the day! Our stranded seafarers of MV Anastasia are coming back to India!” Mandaviya said in a tweet. “The crew will sign off from Japan today and will reach India on 14th Feb. And soon will be reunited with their families!” he added. The minister said the sailors were coming home due to the efforts of the Indian embassy in Beijing and the ministry. A total of 39 Indian seafarers were stranded on two merchant vessels off Chinese ports for months because of the trade row between China and Australia. Both ships were carrying Australian coal, which they weren’t allowed to unload by Chinese authorities.

According to Assam officials, the incident took place at Kachurtal in Hailakandi district of the state over a dispute related to construction of a road on its side of the border. “A fight broke out over the construction of a road on the Assam-Mizoram border on our side. Some Mizoram residents obstructed the construction and it led to a fight between residents of both states and several people got injured,” said Dilip Kumar Dey, DIG (Southern Range), Assam Police. “Three persons on our side got injured. Our personnel dispersed the crowd on reaching the spot. But while returning back to Mizoram, the miscreants burnt down at least 18 houses on the Assam side,” he added. Security personnel from the state police and Central paramilitary forces have been deployed in the area and the situation there is stated to be under control. Also Read | 20 vultures die due to poisoning in Assam; second incident within a monthHailakandi superintendent of police Pabindra Kumar Nath said that three persons from the Mizoram side also sustained minor injuries in the clash. “Though construction was taking place in Assam, Mizoram claims the territory to be disputed. The injuries sustained by the six persons are not serious. Of the three from Assam, one was discharged after first aid while the two others were taken to Hailakandi civil hospital,” Nath said. Tuesday’s incident took place less than a week after a school near the Assam-Mizoram border in Hailakandi district was damaged due to two bomb blasts by unidentified miscreants in the early hours of February 3. Assam and Mizoram share a 164-km boundary and there have been territorial disputes between both states for many years. In October last year, several persons from both states were injured in violence along the border after some residents of Vairengte in Kolasib district of Mizoram set on fire temporary huts made by residents of Lailapur in Cachar district of Assam on a stretch of disputed land. Mizoram said the huts were built on ‘no man’s land’ while Assam claimed the area as theirs. Following the incident, residents on the Assam side blocked the highway going to Mizoram for several days and hundreds of goods-laden trucks on way to the neighbouring state were stranded. The blockade was lifted in November after several rounds of talks between the two states and following intervention of the Union home ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fresh-row-on-assam-mizoram-border-leaves-at-least-6-injured-18-houses-burnt-101612938181665.html
10-02-2021||India||Domestic flights' fare band cannot be permanent feature: Hardeep Singh Puri||Replying to a question in Parliament on Wednesday, Union civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri said fare band on domestic flights can't be a permanent feature and it is expected that when airlines which are now operating 80 per cent of their pre-Covid capacity resume their full services, they won't need fare band.The Centre fixed fare band when airlines resumed their services in May 2020, after the national lockdown. In this process, the ministry determined the ceiling price of tickets so that passengers are not overcharged. "The floor and ceiling price was an extraordinary measure which was necessitated by am extraordinary situation which we found ourselves in. It is designed to ensure that airlines in a situation of limited availability did not charge exorbitant prices. It is not our intention and can not be in an open market deregulated situation to have the fare band made a permanent feature," the minister said.Replying to a question from AIADMK MP M Thambidurai on exorbitant airfares that he faced while flying between Delhi and Chennai, Hardeep Singh Puri said the fare band the ministry imposed on airlines during Covid-19 pandemic pertains to only economy classes, not to the privilege of business classes that MP Thambidurai availed."The price band was confined to only economy class, not to business class...this also depends on when you are booking your tickets. If you are booking your business class tickets 60 days in advance, then the airlines might offer you a cheaper rate, but if you are booking just a day ahead, then the tickets are dearer. Airfare depends on the market. It is not something the Centre decides," he said.Talking about the overall loss of the aviation sector, the minister said, "Nobody has an overall figure on the losses, though IATA and some others put a fantastic figure on it. But the sector is reviving."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/domestic-flights-fare-band-can-t-be-permanent-feature-says-hardeep-singh-puri-101612936864792.html

It added it is “actively exploring options under Indian law — both for Twitter and for the accounts that have been impacted”.The electronics and information technology ministry (MeitY) issued a notice to Twitter again last week asking it to block over 250 accounts and posts. Twitter had restored access to these accounts and posts after closing them briefly for using a controversial hashtag in connection with the ongoing farmers’ protest, officials said.Also Read | As Twitter seeks talks, ministers and celebrities move to Indian-made app KooThe notice said that Twitter, by unblocking the accounts and posts, was in violation of Section 69 (A) of the Information Technology Act that can result in seven years’ imprisonment.Twitter had on February 1 blocked access in India to accounts associated with the farmers’ protest on the government’s demand. Many of the blocked accounts used a hashtag referring to an alleged “genocide”. Among the handles temporarily withdrawn were those of Kisan Ekta Morcha. Following criticism over the move, Twitter unblocked them hours later.“Incitement to Genocide is Not Freedom of Speech; It is Threat to Law & Order,” the government’s notice said.Twitter, in its latest response, has said it has taken steps to reduce the visibility of the hashtags containing harmful content that included prohibiting them from trending on Twitter and appearing as recommended search terms.Twitter has informed the ministry of its enforcement action. It said it has taken a range of enforcement actions against over 500 accounts. They include permanent suspension in certain cases for violation of Twitter rules.“Beginning on 26 January 2021, our global team provided 24/7 coverage and took enforcement action judiciously and impartially on content, Trends, Tweets, and accounts that were in violation of the Twitter Rules,” the company said. It added that it took action on hundreds of accounts that violated the Twitter Rules, “particularly inciting violence, abuse, wishes of harm, and threats that could trigger the risk of offline harm”. It added Twitter also “prevented certain terms that violated our Rules from appearing in the Trends section” and “suspended more than 500 accounts that were engaging in clear examples of platform manipulation and spam”.The company said that “under the Twitter Rules, over the course of the last 10 days, Twitter has been served with several separate blocking orders by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), Government of India, under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act”.“Out of these, two were emergency blocking orders that we temporarily complied with but subsequently restored access to the content in a manner that we believe was consistent with Indian law. After we communicated this to MeitY, we were served with a non-compliance notice.”It added separately, Twitter on Wednesday withheld a portion of the accounts identified in the blocking orders under the Country Withheld Content policy within India only. “These accounts continue to be available outside of India.” Twitter added that the company does not believe that the actions it has been asked to take are consistent with Indian law and refused to take action against any journalists or media entities. “In keeping with our principles of defending protected speech and freedom of expression, we have not taken any action on accounts that consist of news media entities, journalists, activists, and politicians. To do so, we believe, would violate their fundamental right to free expression under Indian law. We informed MeitY of our enforcement actions today, February 10, 2021. We will continue to maintain dialogue with the Indian government and respectfully engage with them,” Twitter said in a blog post. Ruling Bharatiya Janata Party lawmaker Tejasvi Surya hit out at Twitter, saying it seems to hold itself above the laws. “It is picking and choosing what law to follow and what not to. I had raised this issue in Zero Hour in Lok Sabha yesterday [Tuesday], but zero hour wasn’t taken up yesterday. Requesting @GoI_MeitY to act stringently,” he tweeted.The government chose Koo, the Indian microblogging platform launched in April 2020 as an alternative to Twitter, to respond. “Upon the request of Twitter seeking a meeting with the Govt., the Secretary IT was to engage with senior management of Twitter. In this light a [Twitter] blog post published prior to this engagement is unusual. Govt. will share its response soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-withholds-some-accounts-within-india-vows-to-advocate-free-expression-101612935781483.html

The counting of votes began at 4.30 pm, but it went on beyond midnight at many places, where results could only be declared in the early hours of Wednesday.“This victory is due to the welfare schemes being implemented by the YSRC government under the leadership of chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy,” Botsa Satyanarayana said.However, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) has claimed that the candidates supported by the party had won 1,005 out of 2,723 gram panchayats, where polling was held, whereas the YSRC had won only 1,494 gram panchayats.“The ruling party is claiming more panchayats by including those forcibly declared unanimous.

He also heaped praise on their work ethic.Modi tearfully acknowledgement Azad’s compassionate response to a 2006 terror attack in Jammu & Kashmir that left tourists from Gujarat dead. The reference was seen to embody late former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s description of conciliatory politics allowing room for “matbhed [difference of opinion]” but not “manbhed [personal differences]” and also Parliament’s tradition of balancing fiery speeches with courteousness.Also Read | Tears and praises: Rajya Sabha bids emotional farewell to AzadModi, who led the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to massive wins in the 2014 and 2019 national elections, does not shy away from attacking his opponents in bitterly fought elections. But he has on several occasion showered praise on them as well.In his first speech to both Houses of Parliament in 2014, Modi said he welcomes criticism from the Opposition as it would ensure that the government does not succumb to arrogance. “Without your support, my mandate is incomplete. So, I will seek your support and guidance as we proceed,” he said.He also sought cooperation from the Opposition, saying, “… Let’s work together in the first four years and do politics in the last year.”A year later, on the 125th birth anniversary of BR Ambedkar, the architect of the Constitution, he praised all previous governments including India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru for their contribution to nation building. “No one can say that the earlier governments have not done anything for this country,” he said.A similar suggestion of conciliation and cooperation was the highlight of his speech when he returned to power in 2019 with a majority of 303 in the Lok Sabha. Setting aside the acrimony of the election campaign, Modi reached out to India’s minorities, saying “sabka vishwas [everyone’s trust]” has been added to his slogan of “sabka saath, sabka vikas [development for all]”. “We stand for those who trusted us and also those whose trust we have to win over.” Over the years, Modi has taken to complimenting opponents to break impasse or send the message that he is not impervious to alliances or unreceptive to the Opposition. This has come even as the BJP has been accused by the Opposition of pushing ahead with legislation on the strength of numbers instead of following the due process as was the case in the farm bills, which were not referred to a select committee.The Opposition also sees a design in the selective praise of leaders. They read political subtext in the praise, which they feel is aimed at exposing the schism in other parties. The reference to G-23 (the Congress leaders who had written to Sonia Gandhi for the need to bring about changes in the party’s functioning) while praising Azad is cited as a case in point. Most recently, while speaking during the discussion on the motion of thanks on the President’s address, which also included a discussion on the ongoing farmers’ agitation, Modi thanked former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda for his contribution to the discussion on farm reforms. “He [Gowda] has a strong association with the agriculture sector,” Modi said.In the same speech, Modi also praised Azad for his oratory. He said that parliamentarians should learn from Azad how to communicate without resorting to uncivil language. It came when Parliament witnessed daily disruption as the Opposition rallied against farm reforms.Modi has also praised former Union minister Sharad Pawar more than once. In 2015, In Pawar’s pocket borough of Baramati, where he inaugurated an agricultural technology centre, Modi said, “I keep talking with Pawar at least twice or thrice a month and we exchange notes on various issues faced by the country. We need to use Pawar’s more than five decades [of] experience in public life.”He said that whenever projects related to Gujarat hit a roadblock during the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance rule when he was the state chief minister, he turned to Pawar to help him sort out issues with the central government.Speaking on the occasion of the 250th session of the Rajya Sabha, Modi appreciated Pawar’s Nationalist Congress Party and Naveen Patnaik’s Biju Janata Dal (BJD).“These parties have wonderfully adhered to Parliamentary norms. They have never ventured into the Well. Yet, they have made their point very effectively. Much can be learnt from these practices,” he said.While the BJP defends heaping of praise as a parliamentary etiquette, political pundits and Modi critics attribute motives to it. For instance, Modi’s words of appreciation for Pawar came ahead of the latter’s meeting with Sonia Gandhi for a discussion about a prospective alliance with the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra. The BJP, despite being the single largest party, failed to form the government in the state after its long-term ally, the Shiva Sena, left the alliance over differences related to power sharing.Similarly, Modi overtures towards the BJD were read as a signal of an incipient alliance between the two parties.Ahead of the 2019 election, Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav also praised Modi in the Lok Sabha and said he wanted to see him return as Prime Minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-s-politics-from-confrontation-to-conciliation-101612935481717.html

Only a sharp reduction in fuel prices will give relief to the common man," he said.Patnaik said the Congress will also raise the issues of the border dispute between Odisha and neighbouring states, the Mahanadi water dispute and political killings in the state."Under the BJD government, 'jal, jungle aur zameen' (water, forest and land) are in danger in our state. In recent years, killings have become rampant. Our mothers and sisters are not safe on the streets. We need to raise our voice.

The states that reported zero daily Covid-19 deaths were Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Arunachal Pradesh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, Goa, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Ladakh, Lakshadweep, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura.Also, there are seven states and UTs that haven't reported deaths in the last three weeks," Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said.The positive development comes along with a decline in active caseload in the country. There are currently 1.43 lakh cases in the country, which account for just 1.32% of India’s total positive cases that have reached 10,847,304.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-daily-covid-19-toll-below-100-here-s-which-states-are-contributing-most-101612927619199.html

Koo was launched in April 2020 as an alternative to Twitter.“I am now on Koo,” Goyal tweeted on Tuesday. “Connect with me on this Indian micro-blogging platform for real-time, exciting and exclusive updates. Let us exchange our thoughts and ideas on Koo.”Goyal’s ministerial colleague, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, former cricketer Anil Kumble and spiritual guru Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev are among other prominent Koo users.Mayank Bidwatka, Koo’s co-founder, said there has been a substantial spike in the number of Koo users since the standoff began. “We are yet to quantify it.” Bidwatka said Koo has over three million users and is active in seven languages.Also Read | What is Koo? Which ministers have already joined this made-in-India app?Koo won the second prize in the social category after Chingari in Atmanirbhar app challenge in August. It started in Kannada and has since expanded to include Tamil, Hindi, and Telugu.Bidwatka said Koo offers an immersive language experience. “If you type in English, it can translate the Koo into Hindi if that is your preferred language.” He added the electronics and information technology ministry, its departments are using the platform, and talks to create accounts for other government ministries and departments were underway.The standoff began as Twitter declined to block the 257 accounts for referring to “farmer genocide”, citing free speech and newsworthiness. The government on February 4 asked the company to take down additional 1,178 accounts that may “foment trouble”. It has issued a notice to Twitter threatening penal action in case of non-compliance with the government’s orders. Twitter has asked for a meeting with Prasad citing concerns regarding the safety of its employees.India is Twitter’s third-largest market with 18.9 million users. The American platform is the preferred mode of social media engagement for prominent politicians, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi.HT reached out to the electronics and information technology ministry and Twitter for comments but did not receive them immediately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-twitter-seeks-talks-ministers-celebrities-move-to-indian-made-app-koo-101612928641054.html
10-02-2021||India||Protein deficiency, not age or weather, reason for spread of Covid in Europe, US||It was not the age profile or weather conditions, but the deficiency of a particular protein that led to the rapid spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) among Europeans and North Americans, according to a study by researchers from National Institute of Biomedical Genomics-Kalyani.The study was recently published in the journal Infections, Genetics and Evolution.The entry of the Sars-CoV-2 virus in the human body is a two-step procedure. First, the spike protein of the virus attaches to the ACE 2 (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2) protein found on the surface of certain human cells in the lungs, intestine, and other tissues and organs. Second, another human protein TMPRSS2 (type II transmembrane serine protease) breaks the S1-S2 junction in the spike protein to allow the genetic material of the virus to enter the human cell.Also Read | Moderna enters supply agreement for Covid-19 vaccine with Taiwan, ColombiaHowever, the variant of the virus that spread rapidly across the world had acquired a mutation since it left Wuhan that allowed it to use another human protein called neutrophil elastase to also cleave the S1-S2 junction.“Now the neutrophil elastase is used by the human body usually to kill the organism attacking the lungs. However, it also damages the lung tissue in the process. Hence, a protein called Alpha-anti-trypsin (AAT) is needed to balance its action. Our research shows that the deficiency of this AAT protein among the people in Europe and North America led to the rapid spread of the infection in these populations,” said Nidhan Biswas, the co-author of the article.The paper shows a co-relation between the level of AAT in populations and the spread of the infection, he said.“So far, we had seen that these regions were reporting higher number of cases but we did not know why. Some thought it was because of the elderly population or the cold weather. But, if you look at Japan it has a considerable old population but the disease was not as widespread. Conversely, the population of Brazil is younger and yet the disease was widespread. Now, we have shown that the reason for higher spread is the deficiency of AAT protein,” said Biswas.He said, “Even among the European population, the AAT deficiency is highest among those in Spain and Italy. And, Italy saw one of the biggest outbreaks initially.”The study has found a co-relation between the levels of AAT and the disease spread. However, the researchers have not found any link between the level of the protein and the severity of the disease.“This is the first time a co-relation has been established between this protein and the spread of Covid-19. However, this will have to be validated in appropriate cell lines and animal models. However, this gives us important information about the mechanism used by the virus to enter the human cells and the knowledge may be used to develop molecules in the future that can prevent the entry of the virus into the human body,” said Dr Soumitra Das, director, NIBMG.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protein-deficiency-not-age-or-weather-reason-for-spread-of-covid-in-europe-us-101612928342246.html
10-02-2021||India||Madras HC says Bar Association polls are tainted; issues guidelines||The Madras high court on Tuesday said that the “election process in our country has become a mockery” due to malpractices while disposing a writ petition on the conduct of the Salem Bar elections and issued a slew of directions to the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry to guard against monopoly.“Elections to Advocates Associations or Bar Councils are no different from general election to legislature in which invariably, to woo the electorate, communal, religious, political cards etc., are played; Money power is exhibited; Liquor is generously offered,” the court said.“Sadly, our bar leaders are not properly elected by following democratic processes, without any malpractices. Present members of the so-called ‘noble profession’ are readily selling their votes for ‘money, liquor, foreign tours’, etc. This is the practise in almost every election for association or Bar Council. One bar association election is the subject matter of this case,” the court added.The court said that such activities paved the way “for election of non-practising advocates with tainted backgrounds to the association/bar councils.” In its direction, the court barred elected candidates from contesting for a second consecutive election but allowed them to contest in alternative elections.“As followed...Madras High Court Advocate Association and Madras Bar Association, two very old Associations of India, it is appropriate to permit the elected office bearers to contest the election in the alternate elections, so that the democratic character would be given to the election process, thereby, avoiding monopoly by the elected office bearers being elected continuously,” the court said. It also restricted elected office bearers from printing photographs on calendars. The statutory norm of one bar one vote should be followed across the country’s bar associations as per a judgement in the case of Supreme Court Bar Association versus BD Kaushik, it said.Also Read: Madras High Court warns advocates against property grabbingThe court said that its intervention in the internal matters of bar associations which are "nowadays formed on communal and political basis" was important so that the administration of justice isn’t affected “because of the election of non-practising advocates, advocates with tainted background and inexperienced lawyers, who, invariably, call for boycotts affecting the justice delivery system and eroding the faith of the general public in Courts.” The court stated that it receives complaints of elected ‘disgruntled elements’ threatening and blackmailing subordinate judicial officers. “These are all the realities in the Lower Courts and this Court cannot lose sight of the same,” it said.The Salem Bar Association elections have faced several allegations such as elected members contesting successively and inclusion of outsiders in the voters list. The court appointed retired district judge Venugopal as a neutral election officer along with S D Manivasagam (appointed as the election officer in 2018) to conduct the election of the office bearers to Salem Bar Association before April 26. The matter was posted for reporting compliance on April 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-hc-says-bar-association-polls-are-tainted-issues-guidelines-101612927546774.html

This will be the first kisan mahapanchayat in west UP where the leader will address farmers. This also comes amid the farmers’ protest on Delhi borders against three new farm bills.Party’s district unit president Muzaffar Ali Gurjar said before leaving for the mahapanchayat, Gandhi will offer prayers at Shakumbhari Devi Temple in Behat area and also visit the dargah (mausoleum) of Shah Abdur Raheem in Raipur village.

In a letter to Naidu, the TDP MP has said the House should “take a serious note of the misconduct...resulting in the denigration of the august office of the chairperson”.On Monday, Reddy had urged the Chair to expunge portions of a speech by the TDP MP on the grounds that it was not relevant. He said the statement was “objectionable” and should not have been raised in the House. When Reddy tried to raise the point of order under rule 238 (5) and rule 238 (3), Naidu said the issue cannot be raised as a point of order and that it should be brought to his notice in writing. Subsequently, Reddy made a comment against the Chair that was later expunged from the proceedings and Naidu said he felt “sad.”Also Read | Opposition leaders hit out at govt on farm lawsThe incident has brought the differences between the TDP and the YSRCP to the fore. In his letter, Kumar has said, “...It was no surprise to me being aware of the manner in which the YSRCP and the government of Andhra Pradesh have been attacking the constitutional institutions like a legislative council of the state, the High Court and the State election commission since coming to power in 2019.”He goes on to say, “ Reddy‘s unfortunate outburst against the Chair in the House on February 8, seems to have been propelled by my participation in the proceedings of the House on February 4 during the discussion on motion of thanks to the President‘s address. During the debate I made some observations against the Andhra Pradesh government and the chief minister in the context of deteriorating situation in the state on all fronts. Sh Reddy wanted them to be removed from records...” Kumar said his submissions were “neither incorrect, objectionable or unparliamentary. None of them violated any of the rules of procedure and conduct of business in the council of states.”After refusing to allow Reddy to raise the point of order, Naidu had said, some members have been “continuously making allegations” and the idea was to make the “chairman dysfunctional”. “...There are methods if you don’t have confidence on the chairman. I have no problem. But I will not be cowed down by this sort of effort for making the Chair dysfunctional. The day I assumed the post —even before accepting this proposal —I had resigned from the party. And since then I am not going to any political programme or attending any such function affiliated to any particular party,” Naidu said. Several members including Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad, Congress MP Jairam Ramesh and BJD’s Prassana Acharya has also pointed out that Reddy’s comments should be excluded from the proceedings.Reddy did not respond to messages for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tdp-mp-writes-to-rs-chair-to-take-action-against-ysrcp-mp-for-derogatory-comment-101612927140924.html

After the rejection, no fresh date for further consultation after the 11th round was decided, though Prime Minister Narendra Modi from the Rajya Sabha said that the agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar is in constant touch with the farmers.Environment of enmity must end: Farm unionsAfter Republic Day violence, the image of the so-far farmers' protest became sullied. Farmers union leaders also came under fire. The executive committee meeting of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha comes at a time when a need to reset the direction of the protest is being felt.As the issues of the farmers have gained massive support in the mahapanchayats held so far, the focus from now onwards will be to organise more such mahapanchayats. Bharatiya Kisan Union spokesperson Rakesh Tikait, who became the revival force of the farmers protest after Republic Day setback, has started attending these panchayats drawing a huge number of crowd. Tikait has attended three mahapanchayats so far — Jind, Dadri, Kurukshetra. Congress leader Sachin Pilot has addressed a mahapanchayat in Rajasthan; Priyanka Gandhi will address one in Saharanpur.The last programme of the farmers was peaceful 'chakka jam', which garnered support from across the country. Rakesh Tikait said the Centre has "time" till October to repeal the laws dropping hints that the protest will go on till October.In October 2021, it will be a year of the protest and farmers are mulling future path as farmers sitting on the borders and continuing the protest is not resolving the deadlock. The future plan includes holding more mahapanchayats where prominent farmer leaders will be present; sending out the message that farmers are open to discussion; not compromise on their demand of a complete withdrawal of the farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eye-on-mahapanchayats-samayukt-kisan-morcha-to-decide-future-of-farm-stir-today-101612926032911.html
10-02-2021||India||Odisha govt approves re-promulgation of farm reform ordinance amid farmers’ stir||Even as the agitation by farmers demanding repeal of three farm laws rages on across the country, the Naveen Patnaik government on Tuesday evening decided to re-promulgate the ordinance to reform the Odisha Agricultural Produce Markets Amendment Act to enable geographically restriction-free trade and transaction of agricultural produce including livestock across the state.The state cabinet which met under the chairmanship of chief minister Naveen Patnaik Tuesday evening, gave assent to the re-promulgation of the Odisha Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (promotion and facilitation) Ordinance for the third time, enabling the state to move ahead with the abolition of notified market area in so far as enforcement of regulation by Agricultural Produce and Livestock Market Committee (APLMC) was concerned.The ordinance would also help the government create an environment for setting up and operating private market yards and farmer consumer market yards (Krushak Bazar), sub-market yard and market sub yard with the aim to enhance competition for the farmer's produce to the advantage of farmers.The ordinance also seeks to remove geographical restrictions on sale of agricultural produce and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere within the state. It also seeks to promote e-trading to enhance transparency in trade operations and integration of markets across geographies.The Odisha Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (promotion and facilitation) Ordinance framed around Centre’s Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2017 is aimed at bringing comprehensive market reforms in the agriculture sector.The ordinance approved by the state Cabinet for re-promulgation on Tuesday was supposed to be brought in as a Bill in the last assembly session in September last year along with the Odisha Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming and Services (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill. But the government developed cold feet due to the opposition to the three farm reform laws passed by the Narendra Modi government.Also Read: Odisha to build memorial to honour fallen Covid warriorsFarmer leader Lingaraj, who has been vociferous in his opposition to the Central farm laws as well as the state's ordinances on agriculture, said the Naveen Patnaik government's decision to re-promulgate the ordinance to repeal the Odisha Agricultural Produce Markets Amendment Act showed that the party is in a bind."It clearly wants to junk the marketing yards as they have proved to be its bugbear with farmers all over the state accusing the government of inefficient paddy procurement. However, it does not publicly want to be seen on the same side as the BJP. I don't know if the government can bring it as a Bill in the Budget session this month. The ordinance is just a way to keep the legislation alive in case it fails to bring it up as a Bill," said Lingaraj.As agriculture falls under the state list of the Constitution, the Centre has been urging the states to amend the respective APMC acts to free agricultural markets from the clutches of politicized market committees and infuse investments and competition. In November 2019, the 15th Finance Commission headed by N. K. Singh in its report had said that states which enact and implement all features of the Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2017 will be eligible for certain financial incentives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-govt-approves-re-promulgation-of-farm-reform-ordinance-amid-farmers-stir-101612925788814.html

It was started in militancy-hit Jammu and Kashmir last week where the police issued a circular asking citizens to register themselves as volunteers.The volunteers are asked to keep an eye on posts which are against the sovereignty and integrity of India, against the defence of India, against the security of the State, against friendly relations with foreign States, content aimed at disturbing public order, disturbing communal harmony and child sex abuse material.A spokesperson of Jammu and Kashmir police said that any Indian citizen can get associated with this programme by registering in any of three categories of cyber volunteers -- Cyber Volunteer Unlawful Content Flagger, Cyber Awareness Promoter and Cyber Expert.While the first category will help identify illegal and unlawful online content like child pornography, rape, gang rape, terrorism, radicalisation, anti-national activities etc, the second category will help create awareness about cyber crime among citizens, including vulnerable groups like women, children, the elderly, rural population etc.Cyber Expert category volunteer will help deal with specific domains of cybercrime, forensics, network forensics, malware analysis, memory analysis and cryptography.While there is no prior verification required for the first category, a background verification of volunteers of other two categories will be done as per the norms of Know Your Customers (KYC) by the respective state governments and union territories.The volunteers are required to furnish personal particulars like full name, father's name, mobile number, email address, residential address.Once the registration process is complete, the details of the volunteers would be accessible to the Union Territory Inspector General of Police (crime branch) who is the nodal officer for cybercrime.The I4C is an idea conceived to fight against cybercrime in a coordinated and comprehensive manner."One of the important objectives of I4C is to create an ecosystem that brings together academia, industry, public and government in prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of cybercrimes," a document of the Home Ministry said.This programme also envisages bringing together citizens with a passion to serve the nation on a single platform and contribute in the fight against cybercrime in the country.The Home Ministry document made it clear that the programme is "purely volunteer" with no monetary benefits and a volunteer shall not use it for any commercial gain.The volunteers are barred from issuing any public statement about their association with this program and are also "strictly prohibited" from using the name of Ministry of Home Affairs or claim to have an association with the ministry on any social media or public platform.While asking volunteers to read Article 19 of the Constitution which deals with freedom of expression, the Home Ministry said that they shall maintain strict confidentiality of task assigned or carried out by them as a part of this program, and any violations would lead to their re-registration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-asks-people-to-register-as-cyber-crime-volunteers-check-unlawful-online-101612924761733.html

10-02-2021||India||Wadia institute scientists visit Chamoli disaster site, explain what caused it||A breach in a temporary water body formed due to a hanging glacier crashing down after a huge rockslide, a few kilometres upstream of Rishi Ganga river, resulted in the flash-flood in Chamoli district, the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology has said.A team of scientists from the institute visited the flash-flood site in Chamoli before submitting its interim report to the institute’s director, Kalachand Sain, on Tuesday. This is the first team of scientists to visit the disaster site.A team of five scientists led by Manish Mehta and Amit Kumar inspected the area on Tuesday and submitted their findings in the evening, tallying their ground observation with satellite imagery, Sain said.The team found that it all started at a peak, called Mrighu Dhani by locals, a few kilometres uphill of Raini village, the last human habitat in the upper reaches of Chamoli district, said Sain.“There was a hanging glacier on the peak and at the top head of this hanging glacier, there was a huge rock mass,” he said.Due to freezing, thawing and temperature variation, the rock mass loosened and came down, creating pressure on the hanging part of the glacier, he added.“The fresh snowfall had also added to the weight over the hanging glacier. And this hanging glacier broke off due to the gravitational pull, slid down with the entire rock mass, snow and took along more snow, debris, and boulders and soil,” Sain explained.The huge mass came down with force and slowed down near the base of the valley, where Raunthi Gadhera stream flows. This stream receives waters from the glaciers, he said.“As the huge mass slowed a bit, then stopped, it blocked the water of the stream and the water quantum kept increasing. This damming up of the stream increased to such an extent that it breached the whole accumulated mass. The whole mass of water, boulders, and rock mass came crashing down with force towards the Rishi Ganga dam site,” he said.Also Read: ISRO experts revealed mix of rockfall, snow avalanche caused Chamoli tragedy: CMThe slush from Raunthi Gadhera stream coming down with huge force washed away a hydel project on Rishi Ganga river and caused massive damage to the under-construction Tapovan hydel project. Till Tuesday evening, officials in Uttarakhand said 32 bodies have been recovered and another 174, who are missing, are feared dead.Geologist Dan Shugar of the University of Calgary had hinted at a similar possibility on Monday, saying, a large rock-slope (about 200 meters) detached from a mountain and hit a glacier and brought debris to the base of the valley already having huge debris from the 2016 avalanche. He, however, did not speak about the possibility of a temporary lake forming at the bottom of the valley.It is not yet clear to the team of scientists for how long the water had accumulated. “Prima facie it seems it was for a few days and then the breach happened. Our team is studying the area further to get more details,” Sain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wadia-institute-scientists-visit-chamoli-disaster-site-explain-what-caused-it-101612923345955.html

10-02-2021||India||The dream of the Indian Republic||Every major landmark in the sands of time presents an occasion for reflection on the past, present and the future. One such landmark in the history of modern India is the completion of 100 years of representative democracy with the first direct elections held to the central and provincial legislatures in the winter of 1920. In a representative democracy, people participate in lawmaking and governance through their elected representatives. People are supreme in a Republic. India has completed a journey of 71 years as a Republic. How has it evolved to be a representative democracy and a Republic and what is its present status after such a long journey?There were never times when human beings existed without some form of power or authority over them. This is because an individual or group power or authority is required to regulate and resolve the inherent conflicts incompatible with community life. Such systems of control either emerged spontaneously or sprang from a common sense of community and enforced by sanctions of social pressure, or acquired a definite institutional status and operated by means of legal mandates. This form of social control is what we call Government.Government based on the consent of the people is the best form of government since a government without such consent is inconsistent with personal liberty, human dignity and equality. From the Western perspective, the Greeks were the first to give a democratic dimension to organized political institutions even though there are copious references to democratic and elective principles in the ancient Indian literature.Representation in ancient India‘Samiti’ and ‘Sabha’ existed as institutions associated with broader decision making, their execution, election of kings and controlling the administration, as referred to in the Rigveda, Atharvaveda and Chandogya Upanishad. Bala Kanda, Ramayana says that when king Sagara died the subjects elected the pious Amsuman as their king. Ayodhya Kanda, Ramayana mentions that king Dasharatha crowned Rama as the king with the approval of an assembly of people’s representatives. Rigveda exhorted people to form strong councils with distinguished persons from all sections of the society. Women could also be the members of the Sabha and Samiti.Aitareya Brahmana, Panini’s Ashtadhyayi, Kautilya’s Arthashastra, the Ashokan Pillar inscriptions, and Buddhist and Jain texts speak of the existence of several ‘republics’ during the post-Vedic period, known as ‘Ganas’. During the Buddhist period, the Sangha (congregation), as mentioned in the Vinaya Pitaka was guided by detailed rules and procedures of majority, resolutions, censure, quorum etc. Some matters were delegated to the committees by the Sangha for deliberation. Indicating the existence of strong systems of Panchayats since ancient times, Manusmriti, Mahabharata and Arthashastra referred to the functioning of ‘Grama Sangha’. It is, hence, evident that India is not new to the principles of consultation, representation and democracy and modern Indian democracy is not entirely founded on Western principles.Republics and monarchies including constitutional hereditary monarchies coexisted for long in India till they were challenged by expanding empires and foreign invasions. There were kings for long, but most of them were subject to the subjects.Representation during colonial ruleJohn Stuart Mill said: “Political institutions are the work of men; owe their origin and their whole existence to human will. Men did not wake on a summer morning and found these sprung up.” The emergence of modern democratic institutions in India did not come about easily. It has a history of about 200 years before India became a Republic in 1950.The East India Company and the British colonialists never thought that Indians were competent for self-rule and were stubbornly reluctant to involve Indians in lawmaking and administration for long. This premise served their unstated objective of exploiting the resources of India for their own good. However, with rising awakening and the demand for increased representation of Indians in the law making governance gaining momentum, the colonialists had to make concessions from time to time, accommodating Indians in the administration of the country. This happened through the Charter Acts of 1833, 1853, The Indian Councils Act of 1861, 1892 and 1909 and The Government of India Acts of 1919 and 1935. Accordingly, India had to wait for about 200 years to become a Republic in 1950.Under the Charter Act of 1833, Macaulay was nominated as the lone law member in the Governor General’s executive council to guide in matters of lawmaking. Six judges from the four provinces were inducted as six law members later under the Act of 1853, for the first time according representation to the provinces. Further to the first war of Indian independence in 1857, to win over the support of Indians, three landed aristocrats were nominated as law members. They were Maharaja Narendra Kumar of Patiala, Raja Dinkar Rao Raghunath of Gwalior and Raja Deo Narain Singh Bahadur of Banaras. In course of time, 45 Indians were so nominated of which, 25 were Zamindars and seven were rulers of princely states. All were supporters of the British.Under the Act of 1892, a provision for indirect election of the non-official members was made while official majority was maintained both in the central and the provincial councils. Pherozeshah Mehta was the first to be so elected indirectly followed by Gopalakrishna Gokhle, Rash Behari Ghosh, Ashutosh Mukherjee, P. Anandacharulu, Saleemullah etc. The absence of direct elections and lack of association of Indians in the executive government led to an upsurge of resentment among the Indian leadership and people, forcing the Minto-Morley Reforms and the Indian Councils Act, 1909. With the spirit of nationalism strengthening, the colonial government was keen to enforce a divide-and-rule policy and provided for communal electorates with reservation of seats for Muslims under this Act. Surendranath Banerjee, Ratanji Dada Bhai Tata, Sachhidananda Sinha, Gopalakrishna Gokhle, Vithhalbhai Patel and Muhammad Ali Jinnah were among those elected. Thus far, the official majority was maintained in the central legislative council. Non-official majority was first allowed in the provinces under this Act.The first direct electionsAll along till 1920, there was no involvement of directly elected Indian representatives in lawmaking and the executive with the British only conceding incremental changes in response to the demands of the moderate leaders of freedom struggle for increased representation of Indians in governance. The return of Gandhi-ji to India and the resentment over India’s association with the first World War without consulting its local leaders forced a rethink on the British, resulting in the Government of India Act, 1919.This Act for the first time provided for direct elections to the central legislature and provincial legislative councils with a majority being elected members in a bid to address the mounting resentment. Accordingly, the first direct elections were held during the winter of 1920 and the first central legislature was inaugurated on February 9, 1921 by the Duke of Connaught. Despite the Indian National Congress rejecting the Act, leaders such as Annie Besant, Bipin Chandra Pal, Tej Bahadur Sapru, Surendra Nath Banerjee supported the Act. Jinnah resigned from the Congress. The Act for the first time provided for a bicameral central legislature.This Act was, however, further expanded and consolidated communal electorates, extending to it Sikhs, Christians and Mohammedan landlords. Sardar Patel condemned communal electorates as a “poison which had entered the body polity of the country” and later attributed to it the partition of India. The method of election and nomination under the Act of 1919 made the legislature a representative house of capitalists class, mercantile aristocrats, communal and other vested interests. The legislature consisted of more elected members than nominated but had no authority to overwrite the executive, which could overrule the legislature.In the second general elections held in 1923 under the Act of 1919, leaders such as Madan Mohan Malviya, Bipin Chandra Pal, Hridaya Nath Kunzru, Jinnah etc. were elected and Vithalbhai Patel became the first Indian to become the President of the central legislative council. Five elections were held under this Act. Ghanshyam Das Birla was elected to the central legislature in the third election in 1926. Indian women became eligible to vote for the first time in 1934 in the fifth general election with severe restrictions on the eligibility. Out of the total registered women voters of 81,602, only 14,505 women voted.The Government of India Act, 1935 provided for a federal assembly at the centre subject to the rulers of princely states joining the federation. But the federal provisions did not become operational.With pressure mounting for setting up of a Constituent Assembly for drafting a Constitution, the provincial assemblies elected the Constituent Assembly in 1946. Jawaharlal Nehru was elected from the United Provinces for the first time. The Constituent Assembly was converted into a provisional Parliament and an interim government formed on September 2, 1946. India became a Republic with the Constitution coming into force on January 26, 1950 after a long and arduous struggle for self-rule.The Republic of IndiaThe electorate for the first direct elections in 1920 was only over 9 lakh of 250 million Indians. It later increased to only 12% of 300 million Indians for the elections held under the Act of 1935. Voting was then restricted based on the property held, payment of taxes etc. Women got to vote only in mid 1930s. Such was the nature of representative democracy in our country under the colonial rule. It all changed in one stroke with the Constitution conferring the voting right on all Indians in 1950. The Indian Republic has come a long way since then.However, on the occasion of the Indian Republic completing 60 years, Nani A. Palkhiwala observed: “The pre-independence (years) represent the period when India rightly asserted that good government is no substitute for self government. In the last 60 years, thinking India became equally conscious that self governance is no substitute for self government.” He was clearly pointing out the republican deficit.It is said that nothing works well in India other than successfully held periodic elections. People’s will is supreme in a Republic and consent is conveyed through their elected representatives. As a corollary, effective functioning of the legislatures holds the key to effective lawmaking and governance, required to enable the people to fulfill their aspirations. There is a wider concern about the democratic deficit in our country over the years with the world’s largest democracy being called a flawed one by some in the Western world. Such sweeping generalization is contestable given the success of our democracy and the Republic but the flaws need to be acknowledged and remedied.Our democracy is vibrant, throwing up silent revolutions with the might of the ballot. However, there are some broader concerns such as rising money power in elections, growing number of legislators with reported criminal antecedents, suboptimal functioning of legislatures due to frequent disruptions, negative perception of elected representatives, poor representation of women in the central and State legislatures, considerations of caste, community, region and religion while voting, quality and processes of lawmaking, defections and delays in deciding on defection and election cases, voter apathy in urban areas, inadequate representation of young India in the legislatures etc.These concerns are an index of the deficit to be addressed at the earliest so as to fulfill the dream of our Republic. A perfect correlation between the people’s consent expressed through regular elections and the norms of functioning of the Republic shall be ensured by addressing the palpable shortcomings.We have been a Republic for 71 years during the last 100 years of direct elections. Do we give our Republic as many marks based on the present status of its functioning?If you don’t agree, you need to think of what is to be done to make our Republic a near perfect one. Time is of essence.(The writer is Vice President of India)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-dream-of-the-indian-republic-101612919345008.html

This is something that would continue month on month. It is not a one-off or a one-time exercise where we procure upfront and then do nothing. This is a fortnightly, monthly procurement exercise, which takes into consideration the total amount procured, the total amount consumed, and the shelf life of the vaccine doses which have been procured,” Bhushan said.Bhushan also said ample precautions were being taken to ensure that no vaccine vial is wasted, which included making changes to the Co-WIN app to accommodate walk-ins among registered beneficiaries, and also certain measures are being put in place at the vaccination sites.“The site officers have been asked to regularly assess the...vaccine consumption, and also not to open a vial until there are 10 beneficiaries at the site as one vial contains 10 doses etc. Nothing is being wasted,”Bhushan said on the sidelines of the briefing.Both the approved Covid-19 vaccines are two-dose vaccines, being administered 28 days apart. India’s Covid-19 vaccination drive was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 16, and those who received their first dose on that day are eligible to receive their second dose on February 13.Union health minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan said in Parliament recently that as many as 22 countries had sought the Indian-made Covid-19 vaccines. “As on February 2, 5.6 million doses have been sent as grant doses, and 10.5 million as contract doses to at least 15 countries,” he said.The countries that have received or will receive India-made vaccine against Covid-19 as part of vaccine maîtri (friendship) initiative include Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal, the Maldives, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Algeria, Afghanistan, Bahrain, Nicaragua, Barbados, Seychelles and Mauritius.India will also consider opening up the vaccine supplies for people to buy privately once the government’s target of vaccinating its vulnerable population is met.“The immediate concern is to vaccinate our 300 million individuals who are at high risk, once that is taken care of then other options can be explored. Vaccine-derived herd immunity is what we are looking at attaining,” said Dr VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, said during the press brieifing.The government’s priority list of 300 million high-risk individuals comprises about 10 million health-care workers, about 20 million front-line workers, and 270 million people above 50 years of age and people with comorbidities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-govt-orders-14-5mn-more-doses-as-preparation-for-second-dose-begins-101612911222590.html
10-02-2021||India||CIC upholds DoPT’s non-disclosure to RTI, goes by SC order||The Central Information Commission (CIC) has upheld the Department of Personnel and Training’s (DoPT) refusal to share minutes of meetings headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to select the country’s anti-corruption ombudsman, Lokpal, under the Right to Information Act (RTI), saying the Supreme Court had also refused to direct the government to provide the said information.The government appointed former Supreme Court judge Pinaki Chandra Bose as the first Lokpal of the country on March 19, 2019. RTI activist Anjali Bhardwaj filed an application with DoPT, seeking a copy of the minutes of the meetings of the committee that selected Bose.The central public information officer (CPIO) of DoPT declined to share the information saying that the minutes of the Lokpal selection committee meetings were marked as “secret” and therefore, cannot be shared. The officer , however, provided details of when the selection committee meetings were held and who participated in them. The Lokpal selection committee was headed by the Prime Minister.Bhardwaj, in her appeal before CIC, said that marking a file as “secret” is not a ground under the RTI law to deny information, and claimed CPIO had not used any provisions of the transparency law to deny the information sought. “Under the law, access to information can be rejected only on the grounds mentioned in section 8 or section 9 of the RTI Act. Secret is defined under the Officials Secrets Act, which is not applicable under RTI,” she said in her appeal.Rejecting her claim, information commissioner Saroj Punhani relied on two Supreme Court judgements to deny the information sought by Bhardwaj.The first was issued in a case related to the constitution of Lokpal by the Central government in 2014. The Supreme Court said with regard to prayer of lawyer Prashan Bhushan to put names recommend by search committee in public domain that no direction should be assigned in this regard. “Rather the matter should be left for a just determination by the selection committee as and when the meeting of the committee is convened,” the court said.The second was regard to transparency in appointment of information commissioners by the central government. In its order in 2018, the Supreme Court said DoPT has put names of the applications for posts of information commissioners, names of members of the search committee, agenda of the search committee and minutes on its website, which shows the process was transparent.The search committee sends its recommendation to the select committee headed by the PM, and with the leader of the opposition and a Cabinet minister as members, to decide on the appointment of the information commissioners. The court said that the statutory (selection) committee consists of very high ranking persons and the department had provided all “essential” information in respect to each candidate on its website.In its order, CIC said that the process of selection commission of appointment of the information commissioners and the Lokpal is same in nature. “Therefore, the commission is of the considered view that in the instant matter, CPIO upheld the interest of transparency by informing the (RTI) appellant regarding all the details of the selection committee and its meetings; hence the question of lack of transparency does not hold ground,” the information watchdog’s order said.CIC also said that having taken cognizance of the averred dictum (judgements) of the apex court, the commission does not find it appropriate to intervene with the decision of CPIO.Nikhil Dey of National Campaign for People’s Right to Information said that CIC has not addressed the issues raised in the appeal by Bhardwaj . “I would have liked CIC to address the concerns raised by Bhardwaj in its order. Now, SC (orders) will be a ground to deny information under RTI.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cic-upholds-dopt-s-non-disclosure-to-rti-goes-by-sc-order-101612910848580.html
10-02-2021||India||Major rockslide hit hanging glacier, led to disaster: Scientists||A huge rockslide may have crashed into a hanging glacier, forming an artificial water body and causing the glacier to crash a few kilometres upstream of the Rishi Ganga river in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli , spawning the deluge that devastated parts of the district on Sunday, according to the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology.A team of five scientists who visited the flash-flood site in Chamoli submitted its interim report to the institute’s director Kalachand Sain on Tuesday. It was the first team of scientists to visit the disaster site.Sain said the team of scientists led by Manish Mehta and Amit Kumar, who inspected the area on Tuesday, had tallied their ground observations with satellite imagery.Giving details of the team’s findings, Sain said it all started at a peak known by locals as Mrighu Dhani, a few kilometres uphill of Raini village, the last human habitation in the upper reaches of Chamoli district.“There was a hanging glacier,” Saini said, and on top of the glacier was a huge rock mass.Because of freezing, thawing and temperature variation, the rock mass became loosened and came crashing down, creating pressure on the hanging part of the glacier.“The fresh snowfall had also added to the weight over the hanging glacier also. And this hanging glacier broke off due to gravitational pull, slid down with the entire rock mass, all snow and took along more snow, debris, and boulders and soil.”Sain said as the huge mass came down with force and slowed down near the base of the valley, where the Raunthi Gadhera stream flows. This stream receives waters from the glaciers.“As the huge mass slowed a bit, then stopped, it blocked the water of the stream and the water quantum kept increasing. This damming up of the stream increased to such an extent that it breached the whole accumulated mass. The whole mass of water, boulders, and rock mass came crashing down with force towards the Rishi Ganga dam site,” he said.The slush from Raunthi Gadhera stream, coming down with torrential force, washed away a hydropower project on the Rishi Ganga river and caused massive damage to the under-construction Tapovan hydel project. Until Tuesday evening, officials in Uttarakhand said 32 bodies had been recovered and another 174, who are missing, are feared dead.Geologist Dan Shugar of the University of Calgary had hinted at a similar possibility on Monday, saying that a large rockslope (about 200 meters) became detached from a mountain and hit a glacier and brought debris to the base of the valley, where debris had already piled up from 2a 016 avalanche. He did not speak about the possible formation of an artificial lake.Sain said it was not yet clear for how long the water had accumulated. “Prima facie it seems it was for a few days and then the breach happened. Our team is studying the area to get more details,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/major-rockslide-hit-hanging-glacier-led-to-disaster-scientists-101612910375845.html
10-02-2021||India||Took turns to sit on excavator, hung from rods to keep warm: How Uttarakhand workers survived inside tunnel||In the seven hours that they were trapped inside a tunnel immediately after a flash flood in Tapovan on Sunday, and before they were rescued around 5.45 pm on Sunday, the dozen men kept themselves warm by exercising, swapping warm clothes, staying close to each other, and they kept themselves hopeful by reciting Urdu couplets and singing songs -- first romantic and then sad ones -- as time ticked away.Iron rods protruding out of the tunnel’s walls, an excavator and the network connection in one of their mobile phones kept their hopes alive before a team of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) broke in through an emergency door and rescued them.The dozen men, masons, electricians, and engineers, walked into the tunnel around 8am on Sunday to carry out construction work. But for the flash flood, they would have emerged from the tunnel for their lunch around 12.30pm.“Around 10.45, we saw some men running away from the tunnel and shouting to us to rush out. Before we could react, the tunnel entrance was flooded,” said Chitra Bahadur, one of the four masons from Nepal trapped in the tunnel.The next moment, their ears were assailed by the roaring sound of the flood.At that point, these men were about 350 metres away from the tunnel’s entrance.Nine of them hurriedly scrambled to find iron rods jutting out of the tunnel walls and used them to climb higher along the walls of the six-metre-high tunnel as the water level rose by the second.Two other men were in an excavator that was pushed away almost five metres from its position by the force of the water, but the vehicle temporarily kept them above the water. Moments later, from their perch they saved the life of Satish Kumar, an electrician who was swept away by the torrent of water.“As I was passing by the excavator, the two men used their feet to stop me and then hauled me inside,” said an injured Kumar, who was left with a single shoe that he decided to dump.But the inside of the excavator was not safe for too long. As the water rose three-four metres inside the tunnel, the excavator driver kept using a jack in the vehicle to raise it higher. Eventually, the three men were compelled to climb the excavator’s roof until their heads were almost hitting the roof.And so, within five minutes of the flash flood, nine men were dangling from iron rods and three men were atop the excavator. The tunnels entrance was blocked by debris from the flood.“When the entrant was blocked, we were hardly able to see around us. We thought of trying to swim through the water and debris, but it was impossible, ” said Kiran Vishwakarma, another labourer from Nepal.Soon, breathing was becoming a little difficult, but it was the cold that was unbearable. Over the past week, the temperatures in Joshimath have been plummeting to three and four degrees below zero.It was here that these dozen men worked as a team to survive the bitter cold, exacerbated by their soaked clothes.“In batches of three, we began taking turns to sit atop the excavator for about 10 minutes each. The rest of the men would continue to hang from the rods,” said the excavator driver, Rakesh Bhatt.Sitting on the excavator allowed the men to exercise to keep themselves warm. “We would clap, we would rotate our hands vigorously in the limited space that we had. We rubbed the hands of each other and tried to blow hot air on the man next to us. Sometimes the men on the excavator hugged each other or sat in each other’s laps. We were doing everything to keep warm,” said Vinod Singh Pawar, a welder.Those hanging from the rods did pull-ups in the hope of generating heat in their bodies.“But all that exercise was not enough. Sometimes we felt like our legs didn’t exist. So, we urinated on our legs to keep them alive. We would control our bladder and urinate periodically so that we could keep warm for longer,” said Satish Kumar.Then, those with dry sweaters passed them around so that every one had at least a few minutes of warmth regularly.More important was to keep their spirits up, so the men sang Hindi and Garhwali songs and urged each other to recite couplets.“I sang a Garhwali song, the lyrics of which are about coming across a person who appeared to belong to my region. All of us knew the song and we sang in unison as it made us feel we belonged to each other,” said Srinivas Reddy, a geologist from Andhra Pradesh.Then, they moved to romantic songs. “We sang the ‘Dil hai ki maanta nahi’ (the heart doesn’t agree) song, among others. As hopelessness began to set in, we sang sad songs,” said Virendra Kumar Gautam, a senior foreman, who remembers singing ‘Lambi Judaai’ (prolonged separation).They also fantasised aloud of hot water baths and drinking hot tea. The idea was to keep everyone engaged and hopeful, said Gautam.Amidst all this, the men decided to move towards the entrance that was fully blocked, but offered their only hope of escape. So, they abandoned the excavator, divided themselves into two groups and used the rods to move forward.“It took us over two hours to move 300 metres. Some of us were using the torch in our phones to show the path to others,” said Gautam.Since water wasn’t gushing into the tunnel anymore and the level had reduced, they again began taking turns to sit on two large boulders which had been washed into the tunnel.Around the same time, there were two encouraging signs in quick succession.“The mud at the entrance of the tunnel was falling and that led to a tiny opening, about two inches wide. We could finally see natural light and knew that we would have oxygen,” said Gautam.Soon after, welder Pawar found a network in his phone. “It was the BSNL SIM card that I would never use for calling. Usually, network inside the tunnel was limited to five metres inside, but my BSNL was working,” said Pawar.Pawar first called an NTPC official to update him about their location and then some local villagers who knew the topography. “We all felt the urge to call our relatives, but we controlled ourselves. We didn’t know how long we would be stranded inside and needed the phone to be working,” said Pawar, adding that the device was at 30% charge at that time.Outside, meanwhile, ITBP officers, who were struggling to reach the tunnel’s entrance, were alerted about an emergency gate made of concrete and iron mesh. They worked on that gate to finally break into the tunnel after which ropes were used to pull out the men.Since they were suffering from hypothermia, they were quickly washed with hot water, given necessary injections and rushed to an ITBP hospital in Joshimath.Dr Jyoti Khambra, an assistant commandant at the hospital, said that the vitals of the men had recovered to normal and they were ready to be discharged on Tuesday. “They are all fit to work again,” said Khambra.The rescued men may have little choice but to return to work, wherever they can find it, but for now their worry is reaching their homes. “All my money was washed away. I lost my phone. I have nothing. I don’t know how I’ll get back home,” said Sant Bahadur, one of the rescued men from Nepal.While a video of Gautam raising his arms in happiness on being rescued was widely shared on social media, the rescue didn’t really end well for one of them.Soon after they were brought to the hospital, one of these men, Lal Bahadur, got to know that his brother hadn’t been as lucky as him. “The body of Lal’s brother was found in the barrage of the hydrothermal plant. He left the hospital as soon as he could walk,” said Sant Bahadur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-disaster-how-workers-survived-inside-tunnel-101612910056296.html
10-02-2021||India||Congress’ Lok Sabha MPs from Punjab to push private bill against farm laws||Eight Congress MPs from Punjab including former minister Manish Tewari announced on Tuesday they will move private members’ bills in Parliament for the repeal of three contentious farm laws that have sparked protests across the country, including at three key border points of Delhi.The step appeared to be an attempt by the Congress Lok Sabha MPs from Punjab to carve out a separate political space for themselves over the raging issue. The group did not involve their Rajya Sabha counterparts and after announcing the plan, Tewari said that they will seek support from party colleagues and like-minded parties.A private member’s bill is a legislation proposed by an MP and not by the government. In the past, 14 such bills have translated into law of the land but since 1970, no private member bill has been cleared by the House.“With 14.5 crore Kisan Families across the country dependent on agriculture for their livelihood, with 86% of them owning less than five acres of land, it is a travesty that the NDA/BJP wants to replace the abolished practice of Zamindari with Corporate Companydari,” Tewari said, flanked by seven other MPs at the Punjab Bhavan.The Congress has so far taken two different approaches to raise the issue in Parliament. The Rajya Sabha MPs joined the debate to corner the government and the Lok Sabha MPs’ protest washed out four consecutive days of proceedings while demanding a separate debate on the farm laws. The Lok Sabha MPs later joined the debate on the motion of thanks to the President’s speech. The Punjab MPs have now planned The Repealing and Amending Act 2021 as the third line of protest.Apart from Tewari, Praneel Kaur, Ravneet Singh Bitoo, Amar Singh, Chowdary Santokh Singh, Jasbir Singh Gill, Gurjit Singh Aujala and Mohmmad Siddiquie are the other MPs who want to move their bills.Congress MP Ravneet Singh Bittu said: “There are 203 MPs in the Lok Sabha and 64 in the Rajya Sabha who have shown agriculture as their profession. So, we appeal to them to help with these private member’s bills by coming out of partisan politics.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-lok-sabha-mps-from-punjab-to-push-private-bill-against-farm-laws-101612909712411.html
10-02-2021||India||Opposition leaders hit out at govt on farm laws||Opposition leaders launched an attack on the central government on Tuesday over three contentious farm laws, with former Union minister and Shiromani Akali Dal leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal alleging that there were atrocities against protesting farmers and that the movement was being linked to the Khalistanis.Harsimrat, who resigned from the Narendra Modi-led Cabinet over protests against the farm legislation, said the farmers were braving the cold and waiting at Delhi’s borders but the government’s “eyes and ears are shut”.“I was in the government for six years but when it became inhuman, what is the point of staying in such a government? Even when these (agriculture) ordinances were brought in, I told the Cabinet to consult more people. I was told that they will do that when the ordinances become law,” she said.Former Uttar Pradesh chief minister and Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav said the farmers were not getting minimum support price even now in several parts of the country and hit out at Prime Minister Modi’s “andolanjeevi” remark during his speech in the Rajya Sabha on Monday. “The nation attained independence through agitation. Innumerable rights were received through agitation. Women received the right to vote through agitation. Mahatma Gandhi became the Father of the Nation because he agitated...,” Yadav said. “What is being said about the agitations? That people are ‘andolanjeevi’. What should I call the people who go out to collect donations? Are they not members of ‘chandajeevi sangathan’?”Meanwhile, in a written reply to the Lower House, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said that the PM Modi-led government had set an ambitious target of doubling farmers’ incomes by 2022.Responding to a query on whether the target fixed for the year 2022 can be achieved at the present annual growth, the minister said: “The government has been pursuing the target of doubling farmers’ incomes.”He said the implementation of various recommendations and comprehensive interventions of the government are “having a positive impact on growth of agriculture and income of farmers”.The minister also mentioned that the committee on doubling farmers’ incomes recommended seven sources of income growth, including improvement in crop productivity and livestock productivity.Participating in the debate, National Conference president Farooq Abdullah on Tuesday said in the Lok Sabha that the farm laws were not religious scriptures that could not be changed.Citing the example of revoking Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, the NC chief said: “The government had not discussed the issue with us (stakeholders) nor did they discuss the farm laws with them (farmers).”Abdullah also expressed concern over Covid-19 deaths and said it was essential to distribute coronavirus vaccines across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-leaders-hit-out-at-govt-on-farm-laws-101612908308111.html
10-02-2021||India||Environment of enmity must end: Farm unions||A day ahead of a crucial meeting of farm unions, leaders of the over two-month-long protest against three farm laws said on Tuesday that direct talks with the government were the only way to end the agitation for which, they added, the government must end “the atmosphere of enmity” by lifting restrictions on the Internet and restoring essential services, such as water and electricity, at protest sites.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), the platform of farm unions spearheading the protests, will hold its full working committee meeting on Wednesday, in which its leaders would discuss ways to scale up their campaign and reiterate their stand on being open to talks, said Darshan Pal, a key farm leader.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, speaking in Parliament on Monday, had urged farmers to end their agitation and resume dialogue and assured them that a system of minimum floor prices for key crops would continue as usual. The farm unions, however, lashed out at the PM for calling supporters of the farmers’ agitation “andolan jeevi,” or protest parasites.So far 11 rounds of talks between 40 farm leaders and the government have failed to resolve the crisis. Both the government and farmers had called off the series of discussions on January 22, citing lack of progress. The unions have rejected the government’s offer to freeze the laws for 18 months, demanding their repeal .“The Prime Minister has said the government is open to dialogue. We are open too. It is up to the government to follow up on what the prime minister said,” Pal told HT.Pal said the unions would continue the protests and discuss the agitation’s next course, especially on strengthening it in other states, in their general body meeting.Tens of thousands of farmers, braving cold weather, have been camping in the open since November 26 on national highways leading to Delhi to demand the repeal of three pro-reform farm laws.The government has said that the laws will bring investments and give farmers freedom to sell their produce directly to large buyers in a sector that accounts for nearly 15% of India’s $2.9 trillion economy and employs half its workforce. Farmers say the laws will threaten their livelihoods by forcing them to sell to corporate giants instead of government-run markets.Wednesday’s full meeting of the SKM willl brainstorm on ways to scale up protests in multiple states. “We will organize many more mahapanchayats (rural meetings). Farmers across the country are united and we will continue to protest until the black laws are repealed,” said Rakesh Tikait, a farm leader who has organized several large rural rallies called mahapanchayats in the past week, as part of the protests.The farm unions, while emphasizing that they believed in talks even as the protests continue, blamed the government for creating a confrontational atmosphere.“Only direct talks with the government will end the agitation. But for the dialogue to resume, the government must end the atmosphere of enmity. The PM must show magnanimity and offer something new,” Hannan Mollah, another working committee member of the SKM, said.He said the government must restore the internet at protest sites and resume essential facilities, such as water and electricity. “Such steps would help in restarting the dialogue”.His views were echoed by descriptor Kavitha Kuruganti, who said while farmers were open to a resumption of talks, “attacks on farmers must stop”.Police have summoned or arrested several farm leaders after turmoil on Republic Day, when farmers clashed with police and breached the Red Fort during a planned tractor rally in the national capital.The issue has also garnered global attention with celebrities such as popstar Rihanna and environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg announcing their support for the farmers. The external affairs ministry has slammed international comments in support of the farmers’ agitation as “inaccurate and irresponsible”, saying “vested interest groups” were trying to build opinion against the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-direct-talks-with-govt-can-end-stir-farm-unions-101612908054518.html
10-02-2021||India||Tears and praises: Rajya Sabha bids emotional farewell to Azad||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday heaped praise on Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad by describing him as a leader who cared not just for his party, but about the country and its Parliament, and welled up while describing shared experiences with Azad, whose tenure in the Upper House ends on February 15.“I am concerned that whoever is appointed to his position may not be able to match up to him,” Modi said, pointing to Azad, who was sitting across the hall in the slot occupied by the Opposition floor leader in the Rajya Sabha.“Posts come, power comes but how to handle these one must learn from Ghulam Nabi Azad,” the PM added. He saluted in his direction, and said:“On the basis of events and experiences, I respect him as a friend.”Modi also complimented Azad for being a stellar Parliamentarian whose word he respected, and on a lighter note, for his interest in gardening.Modi’s emotional farewell speech for Azad came while he was talking about the members of the House whose tenures end this month -- these, apart from Azad, are Nazir Ahmad Laway (February 15), and Mir Mohammed Fayyaz of the People’s Democratic Party and Shamsher Singh Manhas (February 10) of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).While speaking at length about his association with Azad, the PM recalled how, as the then chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Azad called Modi as the then chief minister of Gujarat, after several tourists from Modi’s state were attacked in a terror ambush in the Valley in May 2006.“He had not just called to inform me... his tears were flowing uncontrolled. Pranab Mukherjee was then the defence minister, and I called him to ask if the defence planes could be provided for ferrying the bodies… At night Ghulam Nabi ii called me from the airport. He sounded as concerned as people are when talking about their own family members,” the PM said, pausing as he was overcome with emotion and had to take a few sips of water before continuing.When Azad later referred to the same incident in his speech, he got emotional as well. He said there have been only a few occasions when he wept aloud, and the incident that the PM recounted was one of them.“When I went to the airport. These young kids who had lost family members clung to my legs, weeping. I could not control myself and wept aloud,” Azad said, his voice quavering.In his farewell speech, Azad -- he has spent 28 years of his 40 years as a parliamentarian in the Rajya Sabha -- said he was a proud Indian, and that when he reads about circumstances in Pakistan, he feels proud to be a Hindustani Muslim.“If any Muslim should feel proud in the world, it should be the Indian Muslim. Over the years we have seen how Muslim countries from Afghanistan to Iraq are getting destroyed. There are no Hindus or Christians there, they are fighting amongst themselves…” Azad said.He also recalled how he had the opportunity of learning from not just Congress leaders but also imbibed lessons in politics from BJP stalwarts. “I learnt how to be the leader of the opposition from Atalji...how to break a deadlock, how to run the House,” he said.Earlier, referring to the two PDP MPs, Modi said he had heard their views on various subjects in his chambers several times. And recalling how he would go riding a scooter with Manhas when they were party workers in Jammu & Kashmir, the PM said he cannot even recall how long their association dates back to. Appreciating his dedication, he pointed out that Manhas’s attendance in the house has been 96%, and whatever responsibilities have been given to him, he has perform them to the best of his ability.Modi went on to say that his doors are open for all four retiring members as their experience and suggestions are necessary for the country. “Your experience will be very valuable... I will keep expecting this and I will not allow you to retire.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tears-and-praises-rajya-sabha-bids-emotional-farewell-to-azad-101612907770618.html
10-02-2021||India||Allahabad HC comes to rescue of man fired over sexual orientation||The Allahabad high court has reinstated a Bulandshahr man in a government job after he was fired for his sexual orientation on the basis of a video that filmed him with his same-sex partner. The court underlined that a person’s sexual orientation was their individual choice.The order was passed by justice Sunita Agarwal on February 2 but made public on Tuesday. It came on a dismissal order passed by the Bulandshahr district commandant of home guards on June 11, 2019, firing the petitioner, Pramod Kumar Sharma, from his position as a home guard.The dismissal order came after unidentified people filmed Sharma with his partner and uploaded it on social media. In the dismissal order, the commandant referred to the sexual orientation of the petitioner as “indulgence in untoward activity”. But the HC rejected the reasoning and said it violated the Supreme Court’s landmark 2018 verdict in Navtej Johar vs Union of India that decriminalised homosexuality and upheld the rights of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender (LGBT) community. “It was held that any display of affection amongst the members of the LGBT community towards their partners in the public, so long as it does not amount to indecency or has the potentiality to disturb public order, cannot be bogged down by majority perception,” the court order read.The court ordered the UP commandant general of home guards to take Sharma back in service with immediate effect.“From the reading of the [dismissal] order itself, it is found to be vindictive in nature,” the order said.Sharma’s lawyers hailed the order. “We were able to argue that the man was dismissed from his job with no opportunity to make his case, investigation, or inquiry committee,” said Awadesh Kumar Malviya, who represented Sharma.Sharma was hired as a home guard in 1985 and promoted as an assistant company commander in 1992. On May 25, 2019, he was served with a show-cause notice by the Bulandshahr district commandant of home guards and asked to explain the video showing him with another man, also a home guard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/allahabad-hc-comes-to-rescue-of-man-fired-over-sexual-orientation-101612906957437.html
10-02-2021||India||Over 30% deaths in ’18 caused by fossil fuels: Study||Over 30% of deaths in India in 2018 were caused by air pollution from the burning of fossil fuels, a new study conducted by scientists from Harvard University, University of Birmingham, the University of Leicester and University College London have found. Researchers estimated that exposure to particulate matter from fossil fuel emissions accounted for 18% of total global deaths in 2018, which was around one out of five.The study, which has been published in Environmental Research, a peer-reviewed journal, states that more than 8 million people are killed each year by air pollution from burning fossil fuels like coal and diesel. However, topping the global charts in the most number of such deaths was India and China.China had the highest premature mortality with 3.91 million deaths and India accounted for 2.46 million deaths.Data collected by the researchers showed that in India, Uttar Pradesh, where 471,456 additional deaths were reported because of fossil fuels, reported the maximum deaths caused by exposure to fossil fuel fumes. This was followed by Bihar with 288,821 deaths caused by fossil fuel burning and West Bengal, where 276, 312 such deaths took place.The study also stated that Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu also reported over 1 lakh (each) such deaths.Scientists said that while previous researches on similar areas relied on satellite and surface observations to estimate the average global annual concentrations of airborne particulate matter, known as PM2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres), the satellite and surface observations were unable to tell the difference between particles from fossil fuel emissions and those from dust, wildfire smoke or other sources.In this study, however, the scientists have used a more advanced technology of GEOS-Chem, a global 3-D model of atmospheric chemistry, which has a high spatial resolution.This means that the researchers could divide the globe into a grid with boxes as small as 50 km x 60 km and look at pollution levels in each box individually.“Rather than rely on averages spread across large regions, we wanted to map where the pollution is and where people live, so we could know more (about) exactly what people are breathing,” said Karn Vohra, a graduate student at the University of Birmingham and first author of the study.Environment and health experts stressed on the need for governments to control the use of fossil fuels and check on the emissions caused by it, to prevent such premature deaths.“When we see that deaths from fossil fuel combustion exceed deaths from malaria by a factor of 20, we must recognise that this is a major global health crisis,” said Sarah Hsu, executive vice chair, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University.“...As healthcare workers, we have the obligation and opportunity to save millions of lives by advocating for clean energy, divesting from fossil fuels, and de-carbonizing our healthcare facilities,” Hsu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-30-deaths-in-18-caused-by-fossil-fuels-study-101612906705160.html
10-02-2021||India||Number theory: The Covid-19 story across the country’s districts||India has recorded at least 10.8 million confirmed cases of Covid-19, the second highest in the world after the US. But the trajectory of the new cases in India has been showing a promising trend – one that actually started almost five months back. India recorded 11,492 daily new cases on average in the week ending February 7, only 12% of the peak – 93,617 cases were recorded at peak on September 16. India is so far the only country among the five countries with the highest number of confirmed cases to not have seen a second wave of the infection. New cases of the infection are now significantly lower than the peak in most parts of India except in the state of Kerala.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverage1. Daily cases nil in 25% districts, below 20 in other 64% districtsOf the 707 districts – this includes 11 revenue districts of Delhi as one single unit – data for which is compiled by How India Lives, a quarter have reported zero daily new cases on average in seven days ending January 31. A majority 56% have reported fewer than 10 new daily cases on average while only 21 districts (or 3%) have reported more than 100 daily cases on average in this period. This is a significant improvement over the last four months. In mid-September, only about 9% districts were recording no new cases while 28% districts were reporting at least 100 new cases daily on average.2. Most districts are far off from their peaksDaily new cases reported in 89% of the districts in the week ending January 31 are under 10% of their respective peaks. No district in India is at its peak at present. The case tally on January 31 was at least 50% of the peak in only 10 districts, nine of them in Kerala and one in Chhattisgarh.India’s daily new cases peaked in mid-September. September is also the month when cases peaked in nearly 45% of India’s districts. Some districts hit the peak even before September. Seven districts hit their peaks in January this year.3. Kerala is an outlierKerala is currently the only state showing a rising trend in the daily new cases in India. Nearly half of the country’s new cases in the week ending February 7 have been reported from Kerala. Its share in the country’s new cases has been rising fast. It was 25% on January 1 and even lower, 15%, on December 1. Maharashtra, the state with the second-highest number of confirmed cases, has around 20% share in the country’s new cases now compared to as high as over 40% in June last year.What lies aheadDaily new cases being reported in India at present are only around 12% of the country’s peak. India has so far not seen a second wave of infections unlike most other big countries. New cases in the US stopped dropping after the first wave when the new cases were 64% of the first peak (and the second wave began). In Brazil, the third most affected country by case count, cases stopped decreasing when they reached 29% of the first peak (and the second wave began). This figure was 43% in Russia. Compared to them, India’s new case tally has so far seen a significant drop. But this should not make anyone complacent. This is because there are other examples such as the United Kingdom and France where cases after the first peak dropped to as low as 7.3% and 2.4% of their first peaks before rising again, ultimately overtaking peaks seen in the first wave. To be sure, the situation in India at present is very different – there is an ongoing vaccination drive and a significant share of population in big cities has reportedly developed immunity – and the chances of a second wave may be lower than the example cited above. But why be sorry later, when one can be safe now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/number-theory-the-covid-19-story-across-the-country-s-districts-101612905375196.html
10-02-2021||India||Uttarakhand disaster: Hopes of tunnel rescue dim as flood toll hits 32||Rescuers scoured ravines and waded through slush to find victims of devastating flash floods in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli region on Tuesday but struggled to break through a column of mud and debris choking a key tunnel with dozens of workers trapped inside.Toll from the tragedy climbed to 32 as rescue personnel pulled out bodies, some of which were lodged in knee-deep silt or atop trees. At least 174 people are still missing — 35 of them inside the 1.7km tunnel at the Tapovan power project where two days of excavation has failed to make much headway.“There is almost no progress… there is a ‘T bend’ at a distance of 180m but there is so much muck inside that after clearing till 150m, the muck from inside is again filling the cleared area,” said state director general of police Ashok Kumar.Also Read | Rescuers race against time to save 37 men trapped in tunnel in Chamoli’s TapovanIn Delhi, Union home minister Amit Shah told Parliament that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was monitoring the situation and that efforts were being made on a war footing to rescue people.“I assure the House that the Centre is extending all possible assistance to the state government for relief and rescue work. The central government is working in close coordination with the state and all necessary steps, which are considered appropriate, are being taken,” he told Rajya Sabha.Shah added that according to the state government, there was no danger of downstream flooding and the rise in water level was contained. The first instalment of ₹468.50 crore, out of an allocation of ₹1,041 crore under the State Disaster Risk Management Fund (SDRMF), was released to the state, he said.The disaster struck on Sunday morning, when a glacier breach sent a torrent of water, rock and dust hurtling down a valley into the Rishiganga river, where workers were building a dam.Visuals showed floodwaters smashing most of the plant before roaring downstream into the Dhauliganga and partially damaging the National Thermal Power Corporation’s (NTPC) 530 MW Tapovan Vishnugrad project, roughly 8km away.The surging waters washed away homes, cut off 13 villages, and snapped crucial road links and bridges. The disaster is the worst to hit the state since the 2013 Kedarnath floods killed 5,700 people and highlighted the impact of the climate crisis and degradation of the fragile ecology.A focus of the operation is the 1.7km tunnel. Since Sunday, rescue workers have used machine excavators and shovels to clear sludge from the tunnel in an attempt to reach the workers as hopes for their survival fade.“We have been able to clear about 110m of the slush from the tunnel, but we may have not covered even half of the distance. The drones didn’t help much. We can’t say how long the rescue operation will go on,” said Benudhar Nayak, commandant of the Indo Tibetan Border Police’s (ITBP) first battalion.Rescuers used wooden planks to negotiate the mud, and even tried to rappel into the tunnel by fixing hooks to the roof, but couldn’t make much progress.“We tried to push in our men, but there isn’t enough working space inside. Also, as we go deeper, we are facing a barrage of slush and debris hurtling towards us,” said an army lieutenant colonel requesting not to be named.Until Tuesday evening, there was no contact with the trapped men, which include engineers and labourers. According to a map with the authorities, the men are stranded at a point where the main tunnel is joined by a 240m-long subsidiary tunnel.“The rescue workers are thinking to drill the tunnel from outside and then get inside with the help of ropes to rescue the trapped workers,” said Kumar.Personnel rescued 12 people on Sunday evening from the other end of the tunnel. They told authorities that a bulldozer and two multi-utility vehicles are trapped with the 35 men.“We see that as good news. The vehicles could possibly have stopped slush from drowning the trapped men. They could also have served as a safe space for them,” said Rajiv Chhibber, an army major general.As hope of the rescue dimmed and officers refused to give a time frame for the operation, clots of distraught relatives gathered at the site.“I couldn’t bear the cold at night. I don’t know how my brother will survive inside. I am just hoping he has found a space inside one of the vehicles stranded inside,” said Sunil Pal, whose brother Amit Pal is trapped.Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat inspected the 13 villages cut off by the floodwaters and said the government was air dropping relief packets for the 2,500 stranded people. “I would urge all the people to keep calm as government has all the required resources to tackle the situation,” he said.A list of missing people released by the state government showed the maximum were workers at the two power plants, who hailed from Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, West Bengal, Jharkhand and other states. The list also included 12 local villagers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-disaster-hopes-of-tunnel-rescue-dim-as-flood-toll-hits-32-101612905083922.html
10-02-2021||India||Will hold mahapanchayats in all states to unite farmers: Rakesh Tikait||Farmer leader Rakesh Tikait on Tuesday said the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha will hold Kisan Mahapanchayats in all states of the country to unite and mobilise farmers against the three new farm laws.Addressing a gathering at Gumthla Garhu in Kurukshetra, Tikait said, “The Prime Minister (PM) said the andolan is restricted to only a few states. We have decided to unite all farmers in the country by holding mahapanchayats in every state. We will organise such panchayats in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, and bring 40 lakh tractors to the agitation.”Reacting to the PM’s statement in which he warned the country against “andolanjeevis” (those who live off protests), and the influence of FDI (“foreign destructive ideology”), Tikait said, “This government has lost its conscience. They are terming us as Parjeevi (parasites) and andolanjeevi. I want to ask them whether freedom fighter Bhagat Singh was also a Parjeevi for he led the andolan for the freedom of this country.”“Hum andolankari hai, par jumlebaaz nahi (We are agitators, not those who make false promises),” he said in an interaction with mediapersons.Urging farmers to stay united and support the agitation, Tikait said, “They are trying to divide us on the basis of religion, region and size of land holdings. But a farmer is a farmer and we all are united against these laws.” He added that the agitation will go on till October 2 and beyond if required.Later in the evening, Tikait also reached Karnal’s Bastara toll plaza on the NH-44 where farmers were protesting.Reacting to the arrest of Deep Sidhu, he said that he police should investigate this case to find out if there was a conspiracy behind this incident. On being asked about chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s statement wherein he asked Tikat to interact with the farmers of UP and not to make Haryana his Kurukshetra, Tikait said he was a resident of Haryana and the whole country was his home.‘Laws will affect every citizen, especially poor’ On PM’s proposal for talks, Tikait reiterated that farmer leaders were ready to talk with the government if they are invited through a proper channel. In an attempt to garner support of labourers and small shopkeepers, Tikait said the new laws will affect every citizen of this country, especially the poor as they will have to buy food grains at higher rates from big corporations.Yudhvir Singh, another farmer leader, said, “The government tried to divide farmers. Our unity has defeated their attempts to end this agitation. We want to tell the government that our agitation is disciplined and peaceful.” He said they will not allow the government to end the Mandi system which was a gift of peasant leaders like Late Chhotu Ram.He further said, “The PM’s ego will ruin the country. Even in the Parliament, he called us a new zamat of andolanjeevis. Either the PM is trying to befool us or he does not know anything about agriculture.”Harinder Singh Lakhowal, a farmer leader from Punjab and Khap panchayat leaders, also urged the farmers to get united for the protest. In support of the agitation, Punjabi singer Rupinder Handa also announced to return the award she was given by the Haryana government in 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-hold-mahapanchayats-in-all-states-to-unite-farmers-tikait-101612898338471.html
10-02-2021||India||Deep Sidhu spent 13 days as fugitive with friends, was active on Facebook||Farmers protesters at Singhu border never allowed actor-activist Deep Sidhu to speak from the stage because of his “association with the ruling party” and his “extremist views”, said Harinder Happy, a member of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha -- a group of 40 farm unions that is spearheading the agitation against the three farm laws.But, around 8pm on January 25, Sidhu allegedly hijacked the stage and addressed the people. “He delivered a provocative speech. We asked him to leave the spot immediately. Nobody saw him after that,” Happy said.Also Read | Come forward: Delhi Police appeal for information on Jan 26 violenceProtesters at the Singhu border claim that was the last they saw of Sidhu until he was seen again at the Red Fort during the Republic Day’s tractor parade.Delhi police are now trying to piece together the sequence of events from that evening to the afternoon of January 26, when Sidhu was seen among those who stormed the Red Fort, vandalised the monument and hoisted two flags —one of the farmers union and another a religious flag.Police are also probing if someone else was also involved with Sidhu in planning the vandalisation at Red Fort. Police have alleged that the violence during the rally and the events at the Unesco World Heritage site, were not spontaneous acts but were planned as part of a conspiracy. At least 394 police officials and 10 farmers were injured when protesters deviated from the pre-approved routes of the tractor rally and clashed with police when they were stopped from entering parts of New Delhi and Central Delhi.Police officials, who are privy to the details of Sidhu’s interrogation, said on January 26, as soon as his photographs and videos started circulating in the media, the actor quietly fled to Sonipat, about 20 km away from Singhu border. He was with many friends and supporters, but their numbers thinned as the calls for his arrest grew louder. Police suspect that he borrowed vehicles from his friends as some of the vehicles that Sidhu was using, until January 26, were not spotted by any CCTV camera installed at the toll plaza on the GT Karnal Road.“For the first 24 hours, his phone was on. He was staying at a friend’s place in Sonipat. On January 26, he released his first Facebook Live, claiming innocence and hitting at those who branded him a traitor” said an investigator associated with the case.At 8pm on January 27, the Delhi police held a press conference reiterating that no person involved in the violence will be spared.“Within two hours of the media briefing, at around 10pm, Sidhu switched off his cell phone. His last location was Sonipat. Then, he started changing his location,” the first investigating officer added.After the January 27 press conference, at least 12 teams of the crime branch, special cell, and the local police were conducting raids at multiple locations in Punjab and Haryana to find Sidhu. Police also tapped the phone number of many persons related to Sidhu. A team even visited his wife’s house in Purnea, Bihar.“He was not in Bihar either. We found that during all these days, Sidhu visited Chandigarh, Bilaspur(Himachal Pradesh), Amritsar, and then Karnal from where he was finally arrested. He has claimed that he stayed at his friend’s house. We are verifying this. He even removed his turban to avoid being identified. The videos of Sidhu at the Red Fort and in the days before the violence show him with a turban,” a second police officer added.On Monday night, when police arrested Sidhu, he was waiting for a car to flee to Purnea. “He was waiting at the Karnal bypass for a car that was offered by his associate for the journey, when the police team caught him around 10.30pm. He was hiding in Karnal and was dropped at the bypass by another associate on a bike, just 10 minutes before his arrest,” the officer said.A third police officer, who did not wish to be identified, said on February 3, after Delhi police announced ₹1 lakh reward on Sidhu’s arrest, Sidhu found himself cornered and could not find many friends to shield him while in hiding.“He could have passed off as one of the farmers among the thousands already on the GT Karnal road with their tractors. But the farmers union had distanced themselves from Sidhu, so this made it more difficult for him to hide. He had to stay away from the protest sites. We have information that he visited some of his friends near Singhu (not the main stage or near farm leaders) on February 1 but he did not stay there for long. We will question him on why he visited the border again,” the third officer added.But even while in hiding for 13 days, Sidhu was active on his Facebook account. Between, January 26 and February 8(until his arrest), he uploaded five videos and claimed that he was not among the rioters; reiterated that lies were being spread against him; and asked people to stay united. He also wrote posts about how the protest started after the farm laws were passed in September and the “reality of the political and social structure” and alleged that he was “set up by the farm union leaders”.On Tuesday afternoon, hours after Sidhu’s arrest, special cell deputy commissioner of police Sanjeev Yadav said such posts and videos were uploaded by Sidhu’s friend from the US and that Sidhu was careful to not do it himself to avoid arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deep-sidhu-spent-13-days-as-fugitive-with-friends-was-active-on-facebook-101612897601631.html
10-02-2021||India||IEA calls for overhaul of energy mix for zero emissions by 2060||India needs to adopt transformational changes in its energy mix to be able to transition to net zero emissions by the mid-2060s, according to the India Energy Outlook report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) on Tuesday.Net zero emissions mean that any new greenhouse gas emissions are balanced by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere. Several countries including the United States, China and members of the European Union have already announced plans to achieve net zero emissions in the coming decades.To achieve net zero emissions by the 2060s, India’s energy sector will need “profound transformation,” the India Energy Outlook said. India is the fourth largest global energy consumer now after China, the United States and the European Union.Also Read | India inks MoU with IEA for global energy security, sustainabilityAt current rates of growth, India will overtake the European Union by 2030 to move up to third position. India’s rate of gross domestic product (GDP) growth will add the equivalent of another Japan to the world economy by 2040, IEA said.For India to achieve net zero emissions, energy demand in 2040 should fall nearly 30% below the projected level, based on current policies, with a complete switch from traditionalbiomass-based energy. India will have to shift away from coal, and solar photovoltaic cells will have to take up coal’s share of electricity generation a full decade ahead of what current policies envisage, the IEA report explained.“As the report highlights, India needs to work towards a climate resilient and low carbon development strategy. This can be achieved by looking at sectoral transitions (particularly in energy, transport and industry sectors). We are seeing that energy efficiency continues to increase, largely driven by energy-intensity reduction across sectors. Further, electrification of fossil fuel use (e.g., in transport) will accelerate – especially as system-wide cost-effectiveness increases. Green hydrogen and biomass-based fuels will predominate in applications where electrification is not viable,” said Abhishek Kaushik, Associate Fellow and Area Convener, Centre for Global Environment Research, The Energy and Resources Institute.In addition, oil demand will have to plateau by the end of the 2020s while the share of alternative fuels in road transport – electricity, gas and bioenergy -- will have to rise. Together these alternative fuels will have to meet 35% of road transport demand by 2040.Fossil fuels will have to account for less than 60% of primary energy demand by 2040 and use of traditional biomass falls need to drop to zero by 2030, as clean cooking goals are fully achieved, the report said. spelling out the changes India needs to make.India’s energy consumption has at least doubled since 2000, propelled by a growing population and rapid economic growth. Over 900 million citizens have gained an electrical connection in less than two decades according to the report. But at least 80% of India’s energy needs are still primarily met by three fuels: coal, oil and solid biomass.Oil consumption and imports have grown rapidly due to rising vehicle ownership and road transport use. Despite expanding coverage of liquified petroleum gas (LPG) in rural areas, 660 million Indians have not fully switched to clean cooking fuels, the report said.On the brighter side, the report said solar power is set for explosive growth in India, matching coal’s share in the Indian power generation mix within two decades.Presently, solar energy accounts for less than 4% of India’s electricity generation, and coal close to 70%. By 2040, they are likely to converge in the 30%s driven by India’s target to reach 450 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030. Solar is also likely to out-compete existing coal-fired plants in terms of cost. Coal’s hold over India’s power sector is already loosening, according to IEA.IEA said India will overachieve one of its nationally determined contributions (NDC) under the Paris climate change agreement of reducing the emission intensity of GDP by 33 to 35% compared to 2005 levels. India is likely to achieve this under current policies “with a CO2 emissions intensity reduction of over 40% by 2030,” the report said.It has warned that India’s combined import bill for fossil fuels. especially oil, is likely to triple over the next two decades. “Domestic production of oil and gas continues to fall behind consumption trends and net dependence on imported oil rises above 90% by 2040, up from 75% today. This continued reliance on imported fuels creates vulnerabilities to price cycles and volatility as well as possible disruptions to supply,” it said.The Covid-19 pandemic led to fall of about 5% in the country’s energy demand in 2020 due to lockdowns with coal and oil use suffering the biggest falls. The pandemic also hit investment in the energy sector, which fell by an estimated 15% in 2020.“IEA’s India Energy Outlook 2021 once again highlights that emerging economies such as India are at the forefront of the global energy transition. In 2010, India had less than 20 megawatts (MW) of solar. Today, India offers one of the largest renewable energy markets operating on market principles,” said Arunabha Ghosh, CEO of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water“ Transitions in energy efficiency, sustainable mobility and sustainable cooling are also underway. India now needs to focus on reducing the cost of finance for clean energy projects, providing access to capital to finance distributed clean energy systems, driving capital to help small and medium industries become energy-efficient, and exploring innovative financing models for R&D {research and development} for disruptive technologies like green hydrogen to further accelerate the energy transition,” Ghosh added..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iea-calls-for-overhaul-of-energy-mix-for-zero-emissions-by-2060-101612895157540.html
10-02-2021||NA||Highlights: Actor Deep Sidhu, key accused in Jan 26 violence case, arrested by Delhi Police||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday in his reply to the motion of thanks on President Ram Nath Kovind's address in Rajya Sabha said that the government is working towards empowering small farmers. He also reiterated that minimum support prices (MSP) will continue and mandis will be modernised. “MSP was there. MSP is there. MSP will remain there in the future,” PM Modi said. After the speech, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait responded by saying that a law was needed on MSP. "Prime Minister said 'MSP hai, tha aur rahega' today but he did not say that a law will be formed on MSP... the country does not run on trust. It runs on the constitution and law," said Tikait.In a symbolic protest on Saturday, farmers staged a 'chakka jam' for three hours, nationwide, during which farmers blocked major state and national highways. The protest was largely peaceful and the farmers said that they are ready to resume talks with the government, reiterating their demand for repeal of the three contentious laws. Thousands of farmers have been protesting since November 26, demanding a rollback of the three farm laws: Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.Follow all the updates here:Harsimrat Kaur Badal accuses Centre of passing farm laws without consultationHarsimrat Kaur Badal said that the Centre did not listen to the opposition, or their own allies regarding the implementation of the farm laws.Harsimrat Kaur Badal slams use of tear gas, water cannons against farmersHarsimrat Kaur Badal said that protesting was a basic human right but tear gas, water cannons were used to break down farmers protests by the government was not.
