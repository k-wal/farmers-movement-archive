Reject the outdated Communist ideology, Communist hypocrisy and Communist tyranny. They neither empathise with our soldiers nor our citizens," tweeted BJP.Earlier today, the CPI(M) tweeted a commemorative message on the death anniversary of Deng Xiaoping, who was the paramount leader of the People's Republic of China between December 1978 and November 1989."Twenty-four years ago, on February 19, 1997, Comrade Deng Xiaoping had died. He was a revolutionary communist, leader of the People's Republic of China from 1978 to 1989. CPC led China socialism with Chinese characteristics, be guided with Marxism-Leninism, Mao Thought and his Theory," read the tweet.Notably, India and China have had a stand-off along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) since April-May last year due to actions of the Chinese army and have held several rounds of military and diplomatic talks.Assembly polls in West Bengal and Kerala are scheduled this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-slams-cpi-m-for-commemorating-former-chinese-leader-101613757784240.html

Experts from both the central forensic science laboratory and the state forensic science laboratory also visited the spot to collect samples and take pictures of the blast site.“A broken mobile, a burnt circuit and a strip of wire have been found from the platform and the railway tracks. They have been sent for analysis. Whether the circuit and wire were used to trigger an IED blast can be confirmed only after an analysis,” said a police officer, without divulging details.Officials said that the blast had formed a small crater measuring around 5 inches in diameter on the concrete platform suggesting that it was a powerful explosion.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had earlier said that it appeared to be a conspiracy and pre-planned attack to kill Hossain. The opposition, including the BJP and the Congress have demanded a CBI probe into the incident. She had also hinted towards an IED explosion.State BJP president Dilip Ghosh had on Thursday made the demand for a CBI probe, and on Friday Adhir Chowdhury, Congress leader in the Lok Sabha said: “I am demanding a CBI probe. West Bengal is incapable of unearthing the truth. Police is clueless about this incident.”Hossain and 26 others were injured in a blast on platform number 2 of Nimtita railway station in Murshidabad district on Wednesday.Allegations had surfaced that the area where the blast took place was dark as there were no lights. Railway officials, however, said that the entire area was well lit except for the southern end of the platform. Security personnel were also present on the platform contrary to what was alleged.Hospital authorities have said that Hossain’s condition was stable but critical.“He had to undergo a surgery on Thursday soon after being shifted to a state-run hospital in Kolkata from Murshidabad. His condition is stable but critical. He will need to undergo one more surgery,” said a doctor of SSKM hospital where Hossain was admitted along with 14 other victims of the blast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/forensic-analysts-sit-visit-blast-site-in-bengal-s-murshidabad-no-arrests-yet-101613757221885.html

Now, the Central government will surely approve the proposal,” he said.Under the rules for changing names of places, the Union home ministry approves proposals sent by state governments to change the name of districts.In 2008, Chouhan had made the announcement of changing the name of the district.For the past few days, BJP leaders have been raising the issue of changing the names of several places including Hoshangabad. Recently, BLP MLA and pro-tem speaker Rameshwar Sharma said, “Any place shouldn't be named after a destroyer.”MP Congress Committee spokesperson JP Dhanopia said, “The BJP-led state government has nothing to do with the development of the state. They don't want to put any effort to ensure the safety of girls because they are busy in renaming places and communalising everything.

The Leader of the Opposition in the assembly also seemingly indicated his ambition to become the Chief Minister once again, as he declared that on coming back to power he will provide 10 kg rice per head to the poor free of cost. "....elections will come in two years and we will come to power and we will do your work..there is no doubt about it. hundred per cent we will come back," Siddaramaaih said. Speaking at an event in Mysuru, he hit out at the BJP government for reducing the quantity of free rice provided to the poor from seven kg that was announced during his tenure as Chief Minister, to five kg. "They (BJP) have reduced it to 5 kg and I got to know that they will further reduce it to 3 kg. Can those who do injustice to the poor be tolerated?... So, once our government comes back to power, I will give 10 kg rice per head to the poor. Let it cost how much ever, money is not a matter," he declared. Siddaramaiah was earlier Chief Minister from May 2013 to May 2018 during which the Anna Bhagya scheme was a populist programme under which seven kg of rice is provided free of cost to every member of a BPL household.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/siddaramaiah-confident-of-congress-coming-back-to-power-in-2023-101613753667432.html
19-02-2021||India||'DigiLocker' for MEA's 'Passport Seva' launched||Inaugurating the "DigiLocker" platform for the "Passport Seva Programme" of the Ministry of External Affairs, Union minister V Muraleedharan on Friday said it would enable citizens to submit the documents required for passport services in a paperless mode and they would not be required to carry the original documents.Speaking at the event, the minister of state for external affairs said the "Passport Seva Programme" has brought in huge transformation towards the delivery of passport services in the country."This has seen a sea change in the last six years. The monthly submission of applications has crossed the one million-mark for the first time in 2017. I am told that more than seven crore passports have been issued through the Passport Seva project till date," he said."We took several significant steps to improve the service delivery experience for the citizens. Not only the work of simplifying passport rules has been achieved but also, we have worked towards taking passport services closer to the doorstep of the citizens," Muraleedharan added.Noting that starting passport seva kendras in head post offices was a step in this direction, he said as a result of that, 426 post office passport seva kendras (POPSKs) have been operationalised and many more are in the pipeline.This, when added to the 36 passport offices and 93 existing passport seva kendras, makes a total of 555 passport offices for the public, the minister said.To give further fillip to the citizen-centric approach and enhance the passport service experience in a paperless mode, "we have now successfully integrated into the DigiLocker platform of the government", he said.This would enable citizens to submit the documents required for passport services in a paperless mode through DigiLocker, Muraleedharan said, adding that now, they are not required to carry the original documents."I would also like to add here that as a next step, we are working on the idea of a passport to be included as one of the documents in DigiLocker. Moving forward, I am confident that this will help the citizens to retrieve the passport whenever required," he said.In case of loss of passport and while reissuance, this facility will be of great help, the minister pointed out.DigiLocker is a flagship initiative of the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) under the Digital India Corporation (DIC). DigiLocker aims at "digital empowerment" of citizens by providing access to authentic digital documents in their digital document wallet.The issued documents in the DigiLocker system are deemed to be at par with original physical documents."We are also working towards rolling out e-passports for the citizens that are designed to increase security, making it more difficult to tamper with the data recorded on a passport, thereby limiting the chances of fraud," Muraleedharan said.In the coming years, biometric passports would help improve immigration processes at airports that are equipped with automatic e-passport gates, he added.In the upcoming Passport Seva Programme V2.0, the use of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, chatbot, analytics, robotic process automation (RPA) will further ease the experience of the citizens and lead to expeditious service delivery, the minister said.With the availability of the DigiLocker facility now, the citizens do not have to look for the original documents to carry with themselves when they are away from home, he said."I welcome all the citizens to use the DigiLocker facility and make the passport application process paperless," Muraleedharan said.For the ease of the Indian diaspora abroad to avail passport services smoothly, the government has integrated 150 Indian missions and posts in foreign countries into the Passport Seva project, he said."The government under (Prime Minister) Narendra Modi has been giving due importance to realising the full potential of Digital India. Digital India is transformational, it brought in public accountability through mandated delivery of the government's services electronically and minimised the interaction between officials and citizens."I am confident that leveraging the DigiLocker for passport services would ensure ease of access for all citizens," the minister added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/digilocker-for-mea-s-passport-seva-launched-101613753079951.html

19-02-2021||India||Banks liable for safety of lockers: SC; asks RBI to issue guidelines in 6 months||Banks offering locker and safe deposit facilities owe a duty of care to customers operating the lockers and are liable for its safety, the Supreme Court held in a significant decision passed on Friday.Issuing guidelines in this regard, a bench of Justices Mohan M Shantanagouder and Vineet Saran said, “Banks as service providers under the Consumer Protection Act owe a separate duty of care to exercise due diligence in maintaining and operating their locker or safety deposit systems. This includes ensuring the proper functioning of the locker system, guarding against unauthorized access to the lockers and providing appropriate safeguards against theft and robbery.“The very purpose for which the customer avails of the locker hiring facility is so that they may rest assured that their assets are being properly taken care of,” the Court said in its order. It observed how in a globalized world, the steady movement towards a cashless economy has made lockers an essential service for the common man.“The banks cannot wash off their hands and claim that they bear no liability towards their customers for the operation of the locker….this will lead to a state of anarchy wherein the banks will routinely commit lapses in proper management of the lockers, leaving it to the hapless customers to bear the costs,” the bench observed. Such actions of the banks would not only be violation of the Consumer Protection Act but also damage investor confidence and harm reputation of our emerging economy, the judges added.The case before the Court was of a hapless consumer whose locker was broken open by United Bank of India’s Kolkata branch in September 1994 for non-payment of rent. He approached the district consumer court for compensation. The top court held, “The breaking open of the locker was in blatant disregard to the responsibilities that the bank owed to the customer as a service provider,” and went on to award ₹five lakh compensation to the petitioner and ₹one lakh towards litigation expenses. The bank was directed to pay the amount to the petitioner either by itself or by deducting it from the salaries of the erring bank officials, provided they were still in service.While examining the case, the Court stumbled upon the fact that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) did not specify the liability of banks in such a scenario. In 2007, RBI issued directions to banks imposing duty of care in respect of protection of bank lockers and mandating transparency vis-à-vis the locker holder in allotment and breaking open of the lockers. However, it was largely left to the individual banks to formulate the exact procedures for fulfilling this duty of care. Going by past decided cases before National Consumer Commission and High Courts, the top court noticed that the banks often took the defence that they were not liable as they were not aware of the locker contents.The bench said, “The banks as custodians of public property cannot leave the customers in the lurch merely by claiming ignorance of the contents of the lockers.” The present state of regulations on locker management was found “inadequate and muddled” by the Court with every bank following its own procedure.The threat faced by customers would be more pronounced in modern times with dual key operated lockers giving way to digital lockers, the judges opined. Customers would be completely at the mercy of the bank for protection of their assets and the electronically operated lockers could face manipulation by miscreants.Taking a proactive approach, the bench gave RBI six months to lay down comprehensive directions mandating the steps to be taken by banks with respect to locker/safe deposit facility management. While doing so, the banks should not have the liberty to impose unilateral and unfair means on the consumers, the bench said. Till such time the RBI guidelines are framed, the Court directed the principles laid down in this judgment to be binding upon banks.In the present case, although the bank accepted its mistake as the petitioner had cleared dues of 1994-95 prior to the breaking open of his locker, the bench laid down that henceforth, due notice in writing shall be given to the locker holder giving reasonable time prior to breaking open of the locker.Further, the locker shall be opened in the presence of authorized officials and an independent witness after due notice is served to the locker holder. This part was considered essential as the petitioner in the present case alleged that he was returned only two gold ornaments while he had kept seven ornaments in the locker. The Court did not examine this issue and asked the petitioner to file a civil suit where evidence in this regard could be submitted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/banks-liable-for-safety-of-lockers-sc-asks-rbi-to-issue-guidelines-in-6-months-101613750503846.html

The number of active cases stands at 59,814 while 961,789 people have recovered till now. The state has seen more than 4,061 deaths since the beginning of the outbreak last year. On Thursday, 4,584 new cases and 14 more deaths were recorded in the state.Kozhikode, Ernakulam and Malappuram districts are the major contributors to Kerala’s daily Covid-19 figures. Kozhikode added the most number of cases on Thursday (638) followed by Ernakulam (609) and Malappuram (493). As many as 255,000 lakh people have been placed under the observation of which 9,506 are in isolation wards. The hotspots in the state have gone up to 433 after three more areas were added and two more were removed from the list, the state government had said.Follow live coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic hereKerala continues to be among the worst-hit states from the pandemic in the country - apart from Maharashtra. The uptick in daily cases in Kerala has happened due to the reopening of several activities and further easing of restrictions. Amid this worrying trend, the state is organising a seven-day annual cultural festival ‘Utsavam 2021’- starting Saturday.Earlier, spas, ayurvedic resorts and other such facilities were allowed to reopen in January in accordance with safety norms. The tourism industry- which has massively suffered due to earlier lockdown restrictions- was allowed to resume a select number of activities in October last year.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan had said on Tuesday that there was a substantial need to increase the testing figures in the state. Echoing his concern, NITI Aayog member (Health) V K Paul said, “If we look at Kerala, the increase in the number of cases can be traced since the time of festivals.”Meanwhile, Pune on Friday became the latest region to make RT-PCR tests mandatory for passengers arriving from Kerala. Earlier, the Karnataka government had issued new guidelines mandating all those coming into the state from Kerala to produce a negative RT-PCR test report of not older than 72 hours. Karnataka health minister Dr K Sudhakar said on Friday that those arriving from Kerala and Maharashtra will be ‘monitored scrupulously’ with a special focus on border districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-adds-4-505-covid-19-new-cases-15-more-deaths-tally-over-1-03-million-101613744761182.html

Later, she announced that she would hold a series of Atmeeya Sammelanams (meetings with her close confidants) from all districts of Telangana before coming out with a concrete action plan.A senior YSR Congress party leader of Telangana, who is now playing a crucial role in Sharmila’s proposed political party, said she has been holding hectic consultations with retired bureaucrats, officials and leaders who had earlier been associated with late YSR.“She is going about with her task in a calculated manner. She is taking advice from all those who were close to her father in formulating her political philosophy. She is also making a thorough study of the issues concerning different parts of Telangana,” he said.Also read: Activist Disha Ravi sent to jail for 3 days, cops want to question her next weekRetired IAS officer K Prabhakar Reddy, who had worked as an additional secretary in the chief minister’s office during the YSR regime, met Sharmila a couple of days ago and gave many inputs to her on preparing the party agenda. Similarly, retired IPS officer Udaya Simha, who was the chief security officer of YSR, also held talks with her.Sharmila is also focussing on powerful caste groups of Telangana who had been the backbone of her father in the past. On Thursday, she held a meeting with Telangana Reddy Sangham leaders and discussed the strategy to consolidate the Reddys - a strong community constituting nearly 15 per cent of the vote bank in the state.“We shall extend support to the new political party of Sharmila. The Reddys have lost their political relevance during the Telangana Rashtra Samithi regime, which is dominated by the Velamas. We are confident that Sharmila will bring back the glory to the Reddy community,” said Reddy Sangham president Satyanarayana Reddy.Political analyst Suresh Dharur said Sharmila would become a rallying point for the Reddy community which was feeling lost during the TRS rule in Telangana. “Reddys had been the backbone of the Congress for a long time, but they had taken a beating after the death of YSR and the party suffered a series of electoral debacles after the formation of Telangana,” he said.Though some leaders like PCC working president A Revanth Reddy are making efforts to restore the fortunes of the Reddy community, the party has failed to show any signs of revival. “That is why they must be looking towards Sharmila,” Dharur said.He, however, wonders whether Sharmila would shrug off her Rayalaseema tag and appeal to the masses of Telangana, where the regional sentiment is strong.But, the leader close to Sharmila quoted above said she might be from Rayalaseema, but she was very much a daughter-in-law of Telangana. “We shall play the Telangana daughter-in-law card to counter the Telangana sentiment,” he asserted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagans-sister-sharmila-ropes-in-father-s-confidants-into-her-new-telangana-part-101613741355863.html

Patole wondered why the two actors have not questioned the price rise like they did when the Congress-led coalition was in power at the Centre until 2014.While Kumar is considered a supporter of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Bachchan has been frequently accused of not taking a stand on any important issue. The BJP is currently in power at the Centre and is the main Opposition party in Maharashtra.

19-02-2021||India||Lalu Yadav's bail plea in fodder scam rejected||The Jharkhand High Court on Friday declined bail to ailing RJD chief Lalu Prasad, who is presently in AIIMS Delhi, in a fodder scam case. This case against Prasad relates to fraudulent withdrawal of ₹3.76 crore from Dumka treasury during December 1995 to January 1996."The bench of justice Aparesh Kumar Singh rejected Prasad's bail application after finding that the leader was yet to serve about two months in custody to complete the half of the seven years sentence," said assistant solicitor general and CBI's counsel Rajiv Sinha.The RJD chief has been languishing in jail since December 23, 2017, after his conviction in three fodder scam cases. He has already secured bail in two cases on the ground of completion of half sentence. He moved bail application in the third and last case on similar ground in the high court last year.Prasad argued that he had completed half of the seven years sentence (42 months) in custody in the third case and urged the court to grant him bail.Supporting his claim, the RJD chief, last month, had submitted several lower court orders with detailed computation of the period of his custody.However, the CBI, the opposite party, vehemently opposed Prasad's claim and argued that the leader is yet to serve more than four months in custody to complete half sentence.A special CBI court, in 2018, had sentenced Prasad to 14 years of imprisonment - seven under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections and another seven under Prevention of Corruption Act - in the said case. It had expressly said both sentences would run consecutively.Prasad's lawyer Prabhat Kumar said that the high court, for the purpose of bail, was considering the maximum seven years’ sentence.The RJD chief was handed over 3.5 years and 5 years in prison in earlier two fodder scam cases in which he had secured bail after completing half of the sentence.Prasad, who had been undergoing treatment in custody for over two years in Ranchi's Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS), was shifted to AIIMS New Delhi last month after his condition deteriorated.The RJD chief had suffered a jolt in the fodder scam case on September 30, 2013, when a trial court in Ranchi held him guilty in the first of six cases against him. The conviction got him five years in prison, disqualification from Parliament and a ban on contesting elections. He was given bail by the Supreme Court in December that year. The leader is still facing trial in two fodder scam cases one each in Ranchi and Patna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lalu-yadav-s-bail-plea-in-fodder-scam-rejected-101613738189052.html

The number of new cases in the district jumped from 82 on Tuesday to 230 on Wednesday.Dr Subhash Salunke, technical adviser to the Maharashtra government on the Covid-19 outbreak, said those with comorbidities are at a greater risk due to a virus mutation found in samples from the district."The mutated virus is more infectious and triggering pneumonia early. If a person has pre-existing health conditions, such type of infection could increase the risk of death. However, it is only a possibility, and the district so far has not reported any spike in death toll," he said.Dr Salunke, however, also said that "complete carelessness" on people's part was the main reason for the spike. In many cases, people from the same family have tested positive, he noted."This means they are exposed to infection during the same period. It could happen only at some public function, gathering, etc, where Covid-19 protocols has been ignored," he said.The state government was focusing on contact tracing and increase in RT-PCR tests to tackle the surge in cases, he added.On Thursday, an official had said that researchers had found two new mutations in coronavirus samples from Amravati and Yavatmal districts of eastern Maharashtra after genome sequencing.These mutations were characterized by the virus' ability to escape neutralizing antibodies in the host person's body, said Dr Rajesh Karyekarte, head of the Department of Microbiology at the state-run B J Medical College in Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amravati-surge-due-to-covid-19-mutation-people-s-carelessness-says-maharashtra-official-101613737326949.html

He accused that the government looted ₹21.50 lakh crore through taxes imposed on petrol and diesel prices since May 2014 and said that the BJP should now be called as ‘Bhayankar Janloot Party’.“BJP’s new name should be- ‘BhayankarJanloot Party’. Congress demands that the Modi government should stop oil loot and give relief to the people of the country by cutting petrol and diesel prices,” Surjewala said while addressing a press briefing.From May 1, 2019, the prices of petrol and diesel went up by ₹15.21 per litre and ₹15.33 per litre, respectively, Surjewala said adding that petrol price was increased by nearly 200 times or even more since this period.‘ईंधन-टैक्स-जीवी’ मोदी सरकार देश की जनता के लिए बनी अभिशापमई 2014 से आज तक पेट्रोल-डीजल पर टैक्स लगा की 21.50 लाखCr की लूटBJP का नया नाम- ‘भयंकर जनलूट पार्टी’कांग्रेस मांग करती है कि मोदी सरकार तेल लूट बंद कर देश की जनता को पेट्रोल-डीजल के दाम में कटौती कर राहत देबयान-: pic.twitter.com/pB1b1H8fXM“The crude oil prices on Friday stood at $63.65 per barrel and on the basis of this, petrol should be priced at ₹32.72 per litre and diesel should be at ₹33.46 per litre. Then why isn’t the Modi government selling the fuels at these prices?” Congress's press release showed. Expanding on this point, Surjewala pointed out during the briefing that the Centre had imposed 820% additional excise duty on diesel and 258% additional excise duty on petrol.With regard to the domestic use of crude oil in India, Congress said the production level had been reduced by 53,66,000 metric tonne by the Centre and the budget for the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) had been reduced to ₹28,800 crores this year from ₹32,501 crores in 2020-21.Petrol and diesel prices continued to rise for the 11th consecutive day. In Delhi, petrol crossed the ₹90 per litre-mark after an increase of 31 paise while diesel was being sold at ₹80.60 per litre, after an increase of 33 paise.

No major economic activity has taken place (in Jammu and Kashmir) after the abrogation of Article 370 and Article 35A," JCCI president Arun Gupta told reporters here.Voicing his concern over the continued restrictions on the movement of people at Lakhanpur, the gateway to Jammu and Kashmir, Gupta said 40 per cent of the businesses, including hotel and transport industries, depend on pilgrims and tourists but due to the continued restrictions, people are reluctant to visit the UT."The Covid-19 restrictions were eased across India in January this year but the J&K government has kept Lakhanpur in the red zone category and not allowing inter-state bus services, besides subjecting people coming from outside to Covid testing," he said.Gupta said the people are suffering immensely due to the "harsh restrictions" and are affecting the business in the UT, which has already suffered a lot due to the prolonged lockdown."The governments outside J&K are coming to the rescue of their residents by reducing existing taxes but on the contrary the J&K government is planning to impose property tax to further weaken the people economically. This time when people are struggling to make both ends meet and pay tuition fees of their children, the imposition of property tax is grave injustice and illogical," he said.He said the chamber is not willing to take an agitation path due to the economic crisis people are facing, but "we will not hesitate to launch indefinite strike if government imposes property tax. We will not allow it to happen."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-major-economic-activity-in-j-k-post-abrogation-of-article-370-traders-body-101613734354937.html

Either the farmers will accept the loss of one crop or farmers will take the help of more workers to harvest crops. But the protest sites will not be vacated, the union leader has said.After rail roko on February 18, the Bharatiya Kisan Union is now planning to reach Kolkata on tractors, as Rakesh Tikait said at Hisar mahapanchayat on Thursday.Following Republic Day violence in Delhi, the focus of the protest has shifted to garner more support from other states through mahapanchayats to counter the government's claim that only Punjab farmers are protesting the laws. A number of mahapanchayats of Kisan Sabhas have been held in January-February in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan and Punjab. Congress leaders Priyanka Gandhi, Sachin Pilot have attended these gatherings. The BKU leadership has upped the ante against BJP leaders and said they will not be invited to any family function or programme until the farm crisis is resolved. The decision was recently taken at a panchayat of farmers held at Muzaffarnagar. "Consider this an order or advice, but nobody should send them (BJP leaders) invitations (for functions)," BKU chief Naresh Tikait said.Farmers have been protesting against three agriculture laws since November, making little headway in the stalemate situation. The implementation of the laws has been put on hold by a Supreme Court order. While the government has reiterated that room for more discussion is open, no date for further discussion has been fixed yet.

Lalu Yadav's bail plea was heard by the high court, which asked him to file a fresh petition after two months.

19-02-2021||India||SC expunges remarks against NCLAT members by larger bench||The Supreme Court on Friday expunged disparaging remarks passed against three sitting members of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) in an order passed by a bench of five members of the same Tribunal last year. Hurt by the personal remarks made against them by the five-member bench on December 22, the three members – Justice (Retd) Jarat Kumar Jain, Balvinder Singh and Vijai Pratap Singh – had approached the top court. A reference made by a three-member bench had led to the passing of the said order where the five-member bench of NCLAT held the reference to be not maintainable, a “misadventure” which was against judicial discipline. On going through the petition, the apex court agreed that the remarks required to be expunged. The bench of Justices RF Nariman and BR Gavai said, “We are with you. Shall we expunge the remarks straightaway?” Appearing for the petitioners, senior advocate Vinay Garg informed the court that the remarks offending his clients were reproduced in the petition. Also Read | No evidence but can’t rule out conspiracy against Gogoi: SCThe five-member NCLAT bench had remarked, “We hope and trust the members of the Referral Bench would exhibit more serious attitude towards adherence of the binding judicial precedents and not venture to cross the red line….such misadventure weakens the authority of law, dignity of institution as also shakes people’s faith in rule of law.” There were other portions too pointed out in the petition containing personal remarks against the three members. The bench said, “We are of the view that the observations made against the members of the tribunal in the special leave petition (SLP) be expunged.” What invited these remarks against the petitioners was a decision given by them sitting in a three-member combination on September 25, 2020. In that order, they noticed an earlier decision by a five-member bench of NCLAT that was contrary to decisions rendered by the Supreme Court. The issue related to whether entry in the company’s statutory balance sheet would amount to acknowledgement of debt by the company. The Supreme Court judgments held in the affirmative while a five-member NCLAT bench ruled the opposite. Since a five-member NCLAT ruling binds a three-member bench, the petitioners chose to refer the question to the five-member bench. The petition by the three members in Supreme Court filed through advocate Amit Sharma, said, “The larger bench has crossed the limits of its jurisdiction and has made unsavoury and most disparaging comments which tend to be personal in nature against the Referral Bench.” The three members did not challenge the setting aside of their reference order but limited their challenge to the personal remarks made against them. They approached the court under Section 62 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code which allows any NCLAT order to be appealed before the top court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-expunges-remarks-against-nclat-members-by-larger-bench-101613734070199.html
19-02-2021||India||Australia PM reaches out to PM Modi for support in fight against Facebook||Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has reached out to his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi for support in his fight against Facebook over a proposed law that aims to make the social media giant pay for sharing content from media organisations. The matter figured in a phone call between Morrison and Modi on Thursday, amid worldwide outrage over Facebook blacking out news and media content for its users in Australia and barring them from sharing news articles. Morrison said in a tweet on Friday that he and his “good friend” Modi had “discussed progress of our [Australia’s] media platform bill” but didn’t give details. He said India and Australia, as comprehensive strategic partners, can work together on common challenges such as Covid-19, the circular economy and an open, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific. Also Read | Facebook’s Australia face-off could backfire across the globeMorrison also told the media in Sydney on Friday that the law figured in his call with Modi. “There’s a lot of interest in it. People are looking at what Australia doing,” he said. There was no official word from the Indian side on the conversation. Modi said in a tweet on Thursday that he and Morrison had reiterated their commitment to consolidating the comprehensive strategic partnership and discussed “regional issues of common interest”. He added, “Look forward to working together for peace, prosperity and security in the Indo-Pacific.” In a message posted on Facebook on Wednesday, Morrison had said he was “in regular contact with the leaders of other nations” over “Facebook’s actions to unfriend Australia...cutting off essential information services on health and emergency services”. He described Facebook’s actions as “arrogant” and “disappointing”. Morrison’s raising of the issue with Modi on Thursday was the “first step of a plan to mobilise global support to stop Facebook ‘bullying’ elected governments”, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. Morrison’s government is also preparing for a long-drawn battle with the tech giant if needed, the report said. Anger grew in Australia after Facebook also blacked out posts from essential government departments such as state health departments, fire and rescue services and the Bureau of Meteorology, and crisis services such as Suicide Prevention Australia. Facebook has some 17 million users in Australia. Also Read | Australian news sites’ traffic falls after Facebook blocks content: ReportThe Australian side’s move to lobby India for support is understandable as the country is estimated to have more than 300 million Facebook users and is the tech giant’s largest market worldwide. In his post on Facebook, Morrison said the company’s actions “only confirm the concerns that an increasing number of countries are expressing about the behaviour of BigTech companies who think they are bigger than governments and that the rules should not apply to them”. He added, “They may be changing the world, but that doesn’t mean they run it.” Morrison said Australia will “not be intimidated by BigTech seeking to pressure our Parliament as it votes on our important News Media Bargaining Code. Just as we weren’t intimidated when Amazon threatened to leave the country and when Australia drew other nations together to combat the publishing of terrorist content on social media platforms.” Ahead of Australia’s Senate debating the proposed law on Monday, Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg held talks with treasurer Josh Frydenberg on Friday and the negotiations were set to continue over the weekend. Canada too plans to make Facebook pay for news content and is seeking allies in the campaign against tech giants. Canada’s heritage minister Steven Guilbeault, who is overseeing efforts to frame similar legislation, condemned Facebook’s actions in Australia and said Canada could adopt the Australian model.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/australia-pm-reaches-out-to-pm-modi-for-support-in-fight-against-facebook-101613733170294.html

19-02-2021||India||Bank unions plan to march towards Parliament against privatisation||Opposing government's privatisation plans, bank unions on Friday staged protest in all the state capitals and plan to march towards Parliament next month if their demands are not met, All India Bank Employees' Association (AIBEA) said.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman during her Budget speech earlier this month announced plans to privatise two public sector banks.About 10 lakh bank employees and officers under the banner of United Forum of Unions consisting of nine unions AIBEA, AIBOC, NCBE, AIBOA, BEFI, INBEF, INBOC, NOBW, NOBO are agitating against government's proposal, AIBEA said in a statement.The bank unions, after Friday's dharna, will stage protests across the country in the next 15 days. "On 10th March, we will hold a protest demonstration before Parliament during the Budget session," AIBEA said.Thereafter, 10 lakh employees and officers of the banks will observe two days of continuous strike on 15-16 March, 2021. "If the government proceeds further, we will intensify the agitation and go for prolonged strikes and indefinite strike. We demand of the government to reconsider their decision," AIBEA added.The union said after India got independence no private sector bank came forward to help the economic development of the country that necessitated the nationalisation of major private sector banks in 1969.Since then, banks have made great strides and have played a significant role in the country's development and from 8,000 bank branches in 1969, today there are as many as 100,000 bank branches across India, of which many are in rural areas.AIBEA said from 2010 to 2020, public sector banks have earned a total profit of ₹14,57,000 crore."The only problem facing banks is the bad loans. Most of the bad loans are by the corporates and rich industrialists. Instead of taking action on them, the government wants to privatise and hand over the banks to them," AIBEA General Secretary C H Venkatachalam said.Throwing light on the condition of private sector banks today, the bank union said many of them have collapsed, last year Yes Bank was in trouble and recently Lakshmi Vilas Bank was acquired by a foreign bank."We have seen the problems in ICICI Bank. Hence one cannot accept that private sector banking is very efficient. Only public sector banks give loans to common people, poor people, agriculture, small-scale sector, etc. Private Banks help only the big corporates," AIBEA said.Moreover, the public sector banks have given permanent jobs to young unemployed, while in private banks, it is only contract jobs. "There will be no reservation in jobs for SC/ST category employees if banks are privatized."Citing government claims that crores of poor people have opened their accounts in banks under Jan Dhan Yojana as public sector banks with 75 per cent of total branches have opened 40.50 crore of new accounts but the private sector banks with 25 per cent of total branches have opened only 1.25 crore accounts under this scheme.AIBEA said the banking sector has total deposits worth ₹146 lakh crore currently, which is hard-earned public savings."We cannot allow private hands to play with this huge public savings. Hence privatisation is a bad idea. If the government is serious about economic development, public sector banks should be strengthened. In public interest, in people's interest, in the country's interest, we oppose privatisation of public sector banks," Venkatachalam said.In 2019, the government had given the controlling stake in IDBI bank to insurance behemoth LIC.Besides, in 2020, 10 public sector banks were consolidated into six big size banks last fiscal. With this the number of public sector banks in India now stands reduced to 12 from 27 in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bank-unions-plan-to-march-towards-parliament-against-privatisation-101613729986757.html

Disha Ravi, who was arrested from her Bengaluru home on February 13 in connection with the Greta Thunberg toolkit case, was produced before the judge after being questioned by the police for five days.The court order came after the police requested the judge to remand her in judicial custody for three days because they wanted to question her again on February 22.Additional public prosecutor Irfan Ahmed, appearing for the police, told the court that Disha Ravi had been evasive during interrogation. Ahmed said the police want to question her again and bring her face-to-face with the other co-accused in this case.The public prosecutor said the police had served notice to co-accused Shantanu Muluk who was expected to be questioned on February 22.Disha Ravi, he said, had sought to shift the blame for the toolkit on Muluk and lawyer-activist Nikita Jacob, the third accused in the case.The three, Ahmed said, needed to be confronted with each other.Disha Ravi has also filed a bail application which is likely to be taken up on Saturday. Muluk and Jacob have already been granted transit anticipatory bail by the Bombay High Court.Countering the additional public prosecutor, Siddharth Agarwal, who was appearing for Ravi, said that the case diary was not properly given and was also not in accordance with the law.Earlier in the day, a city court directed the media and the police to exercise restraint while giving out details of the case, which dates back to earlier this month, when Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg tweeted out a toolkit over the ongoing farmers’ protest in India. The kit, it is alleged, was given to Thunberg by Ravi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-police-seek-three-day-extension-of-disha-ravi-s-custody-order-shortly-101613730326454.html
19-02-2021||India||Tibetan tourist guide dies following torture in Chinese prison, sparks fury||A Tibetan tourist guide, Kunchok Jinpa, aged 51, who was tortured in Chinese prison succumbed to prison injuries resulting in largescale fury over the custodial deaths.Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD) expressed concern over the increasing number of custodial deaths in China.There had been no news of Jinpa's whereabouts since his detention in 2013. New information indicated that the Chinese authorities detained Kunchok Jinpa on November 8, 2013, providing his family no information on his whereabouts, and later convicted him of leaking state secrets for passing information to foreign media about local environmental and other protests in his region.His 21-year sentence is unparalleled for such an offence, and no information about his trial or conviction had been publicly available outside China until now, stated TCHRD.Kunchok Jinpa died in a hospital in Lhasa in the Tibetan Autonomous Region on February 6, 2021, less than three months after being transferred there from prison without his family's knowledge.Local sources said he had suffered a brain haemorrhage and was paralysed."A well-regarded Tibetan man in his early 50s known for his strong courage and conviction in exercising human rights in Tibet has been beaten to death by the Chinese authorities in Tibet while he was being transferred to a hospital in Lhasa. He was sentenced to 21 years imprisonment because he shared information about peaceful protests that were happening inside Dhiru in Tibet to the outside world i.e. International Media," said Tenzin Dawa, a researcher at TCHRD.She further stated, "So there must be an immediate impartial and independent investigation of custodial deaths in Chinese prisons and all these investigations must be carried out according to the United Nations standards. We also call upon the Chinese authorities to revoke its policy being subjected to arbitrary detentions and imprisonments."Tibet has been under Chinese-occupation since March 1959. Over 155 Tibetans have set themselves on fire inside Tibet since 2009 in protest against China's repression and occupation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tibetan-tourist-guide-dies-following-torture-in-chinese-prison-sparks-fury-101613729747241.html

19-02-2021||India||Disha Ravi’s petition in Delhi High Court in ‘toolkit case’: Who said what||The Delhi High Court on Friday heard 22-year-old climate activist Disha Ravi’s plea seeking to restrain the city police from leaking information related to its probe of the 'Google toolkit’ on farmers’ protest to the media. While the police have denied leaking any information to the media, the Bengaluru activist in her plea stated the police had prejudged her guilt in the matter and had been putting out a “biased and defamatory narrative”.The Delhi Police have submitted an affidavit in the matter denying any leak of information accessed during the investigation. The court has directed the police to stick to its stance in the affidavit and told media organisations to ensure their information came from authentic sources. Here’s who said what at the hearing What the police saidDelhi Police told the court that the plea by Ravi is an attempt to defame and vilify the police and put pressure on the investigating agency. Additional solicitor general SV Raju, representing the police, told the court that the climate activist’s messages which have allegedly been leaked are from February 3 and she was arrested on February 13. “She must have sent the messages to several people, why only blame the police,” he said during the hearing. Ravi was arrested from her home in Bengaluru for her alleged involvement in creating and editing a ‘toolkit’ related to the farm stir in the national capital. On February 14, she was sent to five days in police custody by a court in Delhi. What Delhi High Court directedBefore dictating the directives for the police and media personnel, the court told the counsel of TV news channel Network 18, “There is no doubt that the video is sensational, extremely sensational.” The bench was referring to the broadcast of a news report on the case by the channel. The Delhi HC directed the police to stick to their affidavit that they have not leaked anything and also asked them to adhere to the office memorandum of 2010 on press briefing. The court said they were entitled to brief the media but must strictly follow guidelines laid down by the Union ministry of home affairs. Media houses were directed by the court to ensure that their sources are authentic. The editorial team at news organisations must note that such news breaks should be verified and the sources should be authentic, the court underlined. “While a journalist cannot be asked to reveal his source, it must be authentic,” it said.The court has also told editors to exercise proper editorial control so that dissemination of information does not hamper the investigation. There is an important role of the media and they should not sensationalise the same. The leak ought not to be disseminated that it prejudices the right of an individual,” the court noted, adding that there is no doubt that regulation of content has been a very contested issue across the world and India was no exception.The court, however, refused to take down the articles already published and said that the issue would be considered at a later stage. Three factors considered by the court are—the balance between the privacy and dignity of an individual and public interest, sovereignty and integrity of the country, and the right to free speech.The high court told Ravi to ensure that people related to her did not share information regarding the case. What Disha Ravi saidThe Bengaluru climate activist asserted that she would not make attempts to malign the police in sharing scandalous information. The matter will next be heard on March 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disha-ravi-s-petition-in-delhi-high-court-in-toolkit-case-who-said-what-101613726951726.html

There was no such undertaking in the present matter," the state government said in its affidavit."It is most submitted that the State of Andhra Pradesh has not taken any step in violation of any agreement/ direction. The State of Andhra Pradesh has been duly administrating its own territories and has not infringed upon the territory of the petitioner," it said.Andhra Pradesh told the apex court that it has been consistently holding elections in Ganjaybadra, Pattuchennuru and Paguluchennuru villages and they fall in No.1 Araku Lok Sabha Parliamentary Constituency and in No.13 Saluru Assembly Constituency."The SC categorically noted, after the dismissal of the Suit, that it was merely recording the fact that parties had entered into a mutual agreement. Therefore, by no stretch of imagination, can it be stated that there was a breach of undertaking or that of any order/direction passed by this Hon'ble Court. The contempt petition is therefore liable to be dismissed on this ground alone," it said.The state government told the apex court that elections have consistently been held to Lok Sabha and the State Assembly in the aforesaid villages since the year 1952 and so far as the local body elections are concerned, it has conducted local body elections in these three villages since inception of Panchayat Raj Act."The Answering Respondent herein submits that even in the years of 2006 and 2013, elections were held to the Panchayats concerned and the following persons came to be elected as Sarpanches. In view of the above, it is clear that the villages fall within the State of Andhra Pradesh."There is, therefore, absolutely no contempt that is made out. The Petitioner has failed to even refer to any document that entitles," it said.The top court on February 9 had asked Andhra Pradesh to file its response on a plea filed by Odisha seeking contempt action against senior officials of the southern state, for notifying panchayat polls in three 'disputed area' villages of the petitioner state.More than five decades since the first status quo order on the territorial jurisdiction dispute with AP over 21 villages, Odisha has moved the top court once again seeking contempt action against officials of the southern state for notifying panchayat polls in three of its villages.The Naveen Patnaik government has said the notification amounts to invading Odisha's territory.The dispute over territorial jurisdiction over 21 villages popularly called as Kotia Group of villages first reached the top court in 1968 when Odisha on the basis of three notifications -- issued on December 1, 1920, October 8, 1923 and October 15, 1927 -- claimed that Andhra Pradesh had trespassed into its well-defined territory.During the pendency of the suit filed by Odisha, the top court had on December 2, 1968 directed both the states to maintain status quo till the disposal of the suit and said, there shall be no further ingress or egress on the territories in dispute, on the part of either party .The suit filed by Odisha under Article 131 (the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction over any dispute arising between the states or between the centre and state) of the Constitution was finally dismissed on technical grounds by the top court on March 30, 2006, and with the consent of both the states it directed that status quo be maintained till the dispute is resolved.Now, the Odisha government has sought contempt action against AP's three senior officials -- Mude Hari Jawaharlal (contemnor-1), collector of Vizinagaram district; Adityanath Das, Chief Secretary of AP (contemnor-2), and N Ramesh Kumar, State Election Commissioner of Andhra Pradesh (contemnor-3).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/administrating-own-territories-not-infringed-upon-odisha-s-area-andhra-to-sc-101613726154155.html

Through the drug inspector, the partially used vials will be sent to Kausauli’s Central Drug Laboratory for testing.”The post-mortem report on one of the babies who had breathing difficulty and died four hours after being administered the vaccines attributed the death to what has been described as a pneumonic consolidation on the left lung.The family of the second infant who died 18 hours after being administered the vaccines, told the hospital not to conduct the autopsy on their child.The infants had received three vaccines - Pentavalent, rotavirus and oral polio on Wednesday at two centres.Pentavalent is a five-in-one vaccine given to all newborns for diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type B.Thirteen other children who also received the same batch of vaccination along with him at an anganwadi in Masakalipalayam are said to be healthy. Six other children who were vaccinated along with the second infant at a primary healthcare centre in Sowripalayam are also said to be fine.“The vaccine technical committee is looking into the cause of deaths,” health secretary Radhakrishnan told reporters in Coimbatore on Thursday.“We will do a thorough inquiry. When there is an adverse event, we immediately stop the batch of vaccines and report to local and district committees. In this case, other babies who were given the same batch of vaccines are normal. It’s not right to speculate; the committee will find the correct cause.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/paediatric-vaccines-sent-for-tests-says-tamil-nadu-govt-after-2-infants-die-101613726048677.html

It hit the target five out of five times at the range and now is ready for induction on HAL Rudra and light combat helicopters. The final test was conducted on Friday morning.The HELINA missile is a third-generation anti-tank weapon with infra-red seeker, fire-and-forget features. It is comparable with the wire-guided HJ-8 or Hongjian-8 system with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and BARQ laser-guided missile developed by Pakistan.While the Indian Apache Longbow helicopters are fitted with Hellfire missiles with over 10 kilometres range, the Helina is the Indian answer to a helicopter launched anti-armour missile. The significance of helicopter launched missile has assumed significance after the stand-off with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in east Ladakh with the China deploying a large number of armour and rocket regiments in the battle theatre. HELINA provides an option of taking down enemy tank beyond its range by using the fire and forget mode.The HELINA system has an all-weather day and night capability and can take out enemy tanks with conventional and explosive reactive armour. The missile can engage targets both in direct hit mode as well as the top attack mode. The IAF version of the missile is called Dhruvastra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/helina-missile-strikes-5-out-5-ready-for-induction-101613719486762.html

The talks will be held on the Chinese side of the LAC in Moldo.During the 10th round of talks, corps commander-ranked officers of the two armies will discuss disengagement at other friction points—Depsang, Hot Springs and Gogra—in eastern Ladakh, officials said.As part of the agreement on disengagement between the two nations, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) was to move its forces to the east of Finger 8 on the north bank, and the Indian Army was to move to its base near Finger 3, defence minister Rajnath Singh told Parliament earlier this month. He added that India and China have also agreed to temporarily suspend their regular patrolling activities on the north bank.The minister said these are mutual and reciprocal steps and structures that were built by both sides after April 2020 in both north and south bank areas will also be removed.“India's strategy and approach during disengagement talks with China are based on directions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi that we will not allow an inch of our territory to be taken by anyone. It is a result of our firm resolve that we have reached the situation of an agreement," Singh had said. The border standoff between the Indian Army and PLA erupted on May 5 last year after a violent clash in the Pangong Lake areas and both sides gradually increased their deployment by rushing thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry to the tense Ladakh region.Earlier in the day, China admitted that four of its soldiers were killed in a clash with the Indian troops in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley in June last year. The rare acknowledgement came in a PLA Daily newspaper article. As many as 20 Indian soldiers were killed in the brutal clash.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disengagement-complete-in-pangong-tso-india-china-military-commanders-to-hold-10th-round-on-saturday-101613715107206.html

Ramdev's Patanjali had last year brought out its medicine against Covid-19.Releasing the scientific research paper, Ramdev emphasised its certification from the World Health Organization (WHO) and said this research paper is to satisfy those who had earlier questioned the scientific relevance of the medicine. Union health minister Harsh Vardhan and Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari were also present at the event.1st evidence-based medicine for Covid-19 (CoPP-WHO GMP certified)With the guidance of Pujya Swami Ji & Pujya Acharya Ji & the hard work of scientists at Patanjali Research Institute, the efforts have been successful.#Patanjalis_EvidenceBased_Medicine4Corona #PatanjaliCoronil pic.twitter.com/L4xdZTajWWPatanjali's Coronil was under scrutiny earlier due to the lack of scientific evidence and trials that could determine its efficacy in combating the deadly virus that has taken more than 156,000 lives in the country. Coronil was first advertised as a cure for the coronavirus infection but later licensed as an "immunity booster" amid the controversy over its trial data and composition.The yoga guru said during the event that the aim of the institute is to accredit the ancient medical science of India globally by providing scientific evidence and fulfill the Aatmanirbhar Bharat vision in healthcare. He said while modern medicine aided the highest recovery rate and the lowest case fatality rate in the country, the credit should also be given to ayurvedic medicines and yogic lifestyle of the people of India."Patanjali Research Institute’s scientific research and success on the first evidence based corona medicine will benefit 158 countries of the world," the company's dairy arm also tweeted.Patanjali Research Institute’s scientific research and success on the first evidence based corona medicine will benefit 158 countries of the world#Patanjalis_EvidenceBased_Medicine4Corona #PatanjaliCoronil pic.twitter.com/uH3JbjXyYyThe union health minister also emphasised the need of using modern scientific tools to highlight the importance of Ayurveda at the international level. Patanjali under the leadership of Acharyaji and Swamiji will help Ayurveda get the recognition it deserves at the international level, he said.Citing the conversation between WHO's director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the global body is impressed with India's work in the field and would want to establish a global centre for Ayurveda in India, the minister added.Also Read | China officially admits 4 PLA soldiers killed, 1 injured during Galwan clashThe minister further noted that Ayurveda's economic contribution to the country, he said during the pre-Covid era it used to contribute ₹30,000 crore to the national economy with a growth rate of 15- 20 per cent. The growth rate of Ayurveda's economy has increased to 50-90 per cent after the pandemic hit the world, with increased interest from FDI as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ramdev-releases-research-paper-on-ayurvedic-covid-19-medicine-coronil-101613711000964.html
19-02-2021||India||A year later, UAE govt grants birth certificate to interfaith couple’s child||When 39-year-old Regulavalasala Tirumala Kalyan Chakravarthy and his 35-year-old wife Javeria Masood were blessed with a girl child in Abu Dhabi in January last year, they felt they were the most fortunate couple on the earth.But little did they realise then that their troubles had just begun. Chakravarthy and Javeria applied for a birth certificate for their daughter, whom they named Suhakshita, from the department of health, Emirate of Abu Dhabi, in the first week of February.As per the laws of the United Arab Emirates, obtaining a visa for a new-born child of an immigrant is mandatory within four months of the delivery of the baby. Chakravarthy got a passport for his daughter from the Indian embassy in Abu Dhabi, but he was shocked when his application for a birth certificate required for obtaining the visa was rejected by the health department. “The authorities told me that according to the marriage rules for expatriates in the UAE, a Muslim man can marry a non-Muslim woman but a Muslim woman cannot marry a non-Muslim man, and so, the child born to them cannot be acknowledged as per the law of the land,” Chakravarthy said, on phone from Abu Dhabi.Chakravarthy, a Hindu, and a graduate in science from Vishakapatnam, met, fell in love and married Javeria, a Muslim and a graduate in physiotherapy. Their families approved. “We got married in 2008 with the blessings of elders from both sides. We were blessed with a son in 2011. After working for a few years in private companies, we moved to Abu Dhabi in 2018 for a better life,” he said. “We were blessed with a daughter on January 28, 2020 and we named her Suhakshita,” he said.The couple pleaded with the UAE authorities to grant a birth certificate to their daughter, saying that they were not aware of the local rules.Chakravarthy and Javeria sought help. “We requested local Indian associations and Indian embassy to come to our rescue. We even consulted not less than 15 lawyers and as a last resort, filed a petition in the Abu Dhabi Judicial Department in the last week of February,” he said.According to Raja Srinivas, community welfare secretary of Indian social and cultural centre, Abu Dhabi, a person without valid visa will be treated as an illegal migrant and be penalised heavily for the period of stay in the country. “In Chakravarthy’s case, too, his child would be liable to be penalised for not having a valid visa, for the period four months after her birth. That was his concern,” Srinivas said.As the judicial department was looking into his petition, a lockdown was imposed in the country due to coronavirus pandemic. And there was no way the issue could be settled within four months. After the lockdown rules were relaxed gradually, the couple intensified their efforts. “Luckily, we got help from good Samaritans like Raja Srinivas who took up the matter with the Ministry of Interior, UAE through the Indian embassy and continued to pursue the matter,” he said.On February 2 this year, Chakravarthy and Javeria got a call from the judicial department to present themselves along with the daughter. “The councillor at the department heard our case patiently and asked us to come back on February 7, when he gave the order in our favour,” he said. Within hours, the couple got a call from the health department.“On February 8, we were handed over the birth certificate for my daughter and it was a big relief for us,” Chakravarthy said.The couple has applied for the visa for Suhakshita and is hopeful of receiving it soon. “We are grateful to the UAE government for respecting our rights,” Chakravarthy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-year-later-uae-govt-grants-birth-certificate-to-interfaith-couple-s-child-101613714110548.html

The court also refused to restrain media houses from reporting on the matter but asked them to ensure that their sources were authentic and to not sensationalise the issue. “The leak ought not to be disseminated that it prejudices the right of an individual,” the court said.The court also refused to take down the articles already published and said that the issue would be considered at a later stage. It directed the editors of media houses to exercise proper editorial control so that dissemination of information does not hamper the investigation. “While a journalist cannot be asked to reveal his source, it must be authentic,” it added.The court also told Ravi to ensure that people related to her do not share information. The Bengaluru-based climate activist asserted she would not make attempts to malign the police in sharing scandalous information.The court dictated the order based on three factors—the balance between privacy and dignity of an individual and public interest, sovereignty and integrity of the country and the right to free speech.It was hearing a petition filed by Ravi seeking to keep the Delhi Police from leaking “any investigation material” accessed by them as part of the probe into the ‘toolkit’ case. The police claim that the Bengaluru activist was the one who shared the document on farmers’ protest with Swedish teen activist Greta Thunberg. Ravi, however, said that the police had pre-judged her guilt and were giving “biased and defamatory narrative.”During the hearing, the Delhi Police told the court that the 22-year-old activist’s petition to stop them from leaking probe material to the media was an attempt to defame and vilify the force and put pressure on the investigating agency.Additional solicitor general SV Raju, who is appearing for the police told the court that the messages which have allegedly been leaked are from February 3 and Ravi was arrested on February 13. “She must have sent the messages to several people, why only blame the police,” Raju said.The court also rebuked television channel Network 18 for the news report they had broadcast. “There is no doubt that the video is sensational, extremely sensational,” the court told the Network 18 counsel.The police have denied leaking any investigation material contained in the first information report to the media following which the court had asked the police to file an affidavit.Justice Prathiba M Singh, who is hearing the activist’s plea, had issued notices to the News Broadcasters Association Network 18 and Times Now news channels on Ravi’s petition.Ravi was arrested on February 13 from her home in Bengaluru and produced before a Delhi court on the next day for her alleged involvement in sharing the toolkit related to the ongoing farmers’ protest on Delhi’s borders with Thunberg. The police have alleged that Ravi had later asked the Swedish activist to take down the post that comprised the document after its incriminating details accidentally got into the public domain.The police have also issued warrants against Mumbai-based activist and advocate Nikita Jacob and Shantanu Muluk, an activist from Beed, for creating and sharing the document for creating and amplifying an online campaign related to the ongoing farmers’ protest on Delhi’s borders. According to the police, a second toolkit of similar nature was also in the works but could not be executed. Investigators said the second document was created by Jacob and Muluk and a UK-based activist Marina Patterson, who is allegedly linked with the global movement “Extinction Rebellion” also referred to as “XR”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disha-ravi-s-plea-an-attempt-to-defame-cops-put-pressure-on-investigating-agency-delhi-police-tell-court-101613710812703.html

The D614G strain which is prevalent was found in all the samples," he said.But in Amravati, Yavatmal and Satara, they also came across different mutations, Dr Karyekarte said."In Amravati, we came across a mutation named E484K in all the four samples. When we inquired if all samples belonged to one family, we were told they were taken from different locations, so the conclusion was that it was a common mutation," he said.The character of the strain found in Amravati is that it escapes neutralizing antibodies, he said.Also Read: Sealing of buildings back in Mumbai amid Maharashtra Covid-19 surge"In a nutshell, even if there are neutralizing antibodies in the human body, the particular mutation escapes or saves itself from these antibodies," Dr Karyekarte said.In Yavatmal samples, they found a mutation named N440K, which is commonly seen in Andhra Pradesh, he said."It was also found in a case of re-infection in Delhi. This mutation too can escape the neutralizing antibodies and cause re-infection," he added.In Satara sample, a new mutation named V911I was found but the researchers could not find significant scientific references about this mutation in published journals, he said.All these strains are of A2 type of coronavirus, which is common in India.Maharashtra on Thursday reported over 5,000 new cases after a gap of 75 days.Dr Murlidhar Tambe, Dean of B J Medical College and Sassoon General Hospital, said these "small curves" (spurts in infections) are happening due to lax behavior as gatherings, weddings and various functions are happening and no physical distancing is being followed.They have received six samples for genome sequencing from Akola where a spike has been witnessed, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-mutations-found-in-two-maharashtra-districts-101613711563960.html

19-02-2021||India||China officially admits 4 PLA soldiers killed, 1 injured during Galwan clash||China on Friday made public for the first time details of four People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers killed in a clash with the Indian troops in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley including one who died during a rescue mission near the Line of Actual Control (LAC) between the two countries in June last year.A PLA regimental commander survived with head injuries suffered in the clash, an article in China’s official military daily said on Friday.The rare acknowledgment in a PLA Daily newspaper article comes amid the ongoing disengagement of border troops after several rounds of diplomatic and military talks from near the south and north banks of Ladakh’s Pangong Tso. After the clash, Indian military planners put a much higher number of Chinese casualties even as China had not disclosed the numbers. The disengagement and withdrawal are believed to have been caused at least in part by internal factors.Also Read | China says disengagement in Ladakh progressing smoothlyHT has reached out to the ministry of external affairs and the army for their responses. This story will be updated once the responses come.A prominently published article on page one of the daily gives details of the incident leading to the deaths but does not explain the reason why the information was being shared eight months after the clash. As many as 20 Indian soldiers were killed in the clash.The article used a Chinese saying as the headline: “Saving tears for Victory”. It claimed the clash as a major victory for the PLA. The article was subsequently carried by other state media outlets. It said the five Chinese officers and soldiers stationed in the Karakorum Mountains were recognised by the Central Military Commission (CMC) of China for their role in the border confrontation with India to commemorate their contributions to defending national sovereignty and territory.The CMC, headed by President Xi Jinping, awarded Qi Fabao, the regimental commander from the PLA Xinjiang Military Command, the title of “Hero regimental commander for defending the border,” Qi is said to be alive with head injuries.The remaining four were posthumously awarded for bravery: Chen Hongjun with “Hero to defend the border”. Chen Xiangrong, Xiao Siyuan, and Wang Zhuoran were awarded “the first-class merit”. The first three were killed in the clash and Wang Zhuoran while conducting a rescue mission across a river.“This is the first time China has unveiled casualties and details of these officers and soldiers’ sacrifice, four of whom died when dealing with the Indian military’s illegal trespassing of the Galwan Valley LAC,” the tabloid Global Times reported.The Chinese state media outlets blamed India for the clash. India has consistently denied the allegation and said the PLA trespassed across the LAC.“The awards process also revisited the whole incident - how the Indian military deployed a large number of soldiers who premeditatedly hid, trying to force the Chinese military to concede. How the Chinese soldiers defended the sovereignty of the country amid attacks of steel tubes, cudgels and stones was also highlighted,” the article said. It claimed Indian soldiers had outnumbered the Chinese border troops.“When facing enemies that outnumbered us, none of us flinched. Amid their stone attacks, we drove them away,” Chen Xiangrong, one of the soldiers killed was quoted to have written in his diary.“Since April 2020, relevant foreign military violated the previous agreement… they trespassed the border line to build roads and bridges and intentionally incited troubles, changing the status quo along the border… they even violently attacked Chinese soldiers that were sent for communication,” the PLA Daily report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-pla-soldiers-killed-1-died-during-rescue-mission-in-galwan-in-june-china-101613707847416.html

This was the third such visit organised by the government in its bid to dispel “misinformation” after the revocation of Article 370, which earlier governed the region.In Jammu, the envoys met woman sarpanches, Jammu Mayor, members of West Pak Refugees Action Committee, Valmiki community and others.“They sought to know about revocation of Article 370 and we told them that we are very happy over its revocation because it was a stumbling block in development and it was highly discriminatory against the people of the UT,” said Vandana.“We told them how the three-tier Panchayati raj system is helping the poor immensely and ensuring development at the grass roots level,” said another woman Sarpanch, Anjali Sharma from Mathwar. She said they also told the envoys how Pakistan has been peddling lies at the international forum to mislead the world community over Jammu and Kashmir.The Central government has maintained that the revocation of Article 370 was done to end discrimination against people of Jammu and Kashmir and the ‘dynastic’ rule which had prevented the growth of the region. The envoys visit, the ministry of external affairs said on Thursday, was an opportunity to witness, first-hand, “Jammu and Kashmir's march on the path of inclusive development and the dynamism in the grassroots democratic institutions.”“On behalf of my community, I told the envoys about what had been happening to us during all these 73 years. I told them that for the first time, we voted in the district development council (DDC) elections and that earlier, when Article 370 existed, we were deprived of our basic right to vote in the assembly elections,” said Sukhdev Singh Manhas, vice president, West Pak Refugees Action Committee.We also told them how our children were not considered for government jobs, professional courses and didn’t have the right to property here, Singh added.Also Read: Foreign envoys’ visit to J&K is an eye opener, saw visible change: OfficialsJammu Mayor Chander Mohan Gupta said, “I told them how elections to local bodies could be held and the 73rd and 74th amendments to the Constitution could be implemented in J&K only after the revocation of Article 370.”Akash Kumar and Manisha from the Valmiki community told the envoys of the “worst kind of slavery” their community faced due to successive Kashmir centric governments and how Article 370 deprived them of voting rights, jobs and property.“We told them how under Article 370, we only got jobs as sweepers in the municipal bodies irrespective of our educational qualifications,” said Manisha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/article-370-was-discriminatory-envoys-told-and-apprised-of-pak-lies-on-jk-101613707370764.html

This highlights the potential risk of a surge in cases amid fears of mutant strains gaining ground, and laxity in adhering to protocols due to Covid fatigue being reported across the country.In a setback for the country, five states — Kerala, Maharashtra, Punjab, Haryana and Jammu & Kashmir — have not witnessed any respite as the first wave continues unabated.This is evident at a time when the country is functioning with sparse restrictions in most states.

"I love my mother. I am making an appeal to the President that her death sentence is commuted. It is up to the President to forgive her. But I have faith," Mohammed Taj was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.According to the agency, Taj has been living with his custodian parent Usman Saifi in the Sushila Vihar colony in Bulandshahr.Shabnam, a school teacher, and her lover Saleem were sentenced to death for sedating seven members of her family and slitting their throats on April 14, 2008. Among the dead was a 10-month-old child, who was strangled. Shabnam’s family was against her relationship with Saleem, a Class 6 dropout due to the difference in their social and economic status.Also read | UP teacher who killed her family may be India's 1st woman to be hanged in 70 yrsShabnam and Saleem were arrested within days of the murders and were sentenced to death by the trial court in 2010, which was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2015. Their mercy plea was rejected by Rashtrapati Bhavan and the Supreme Court also turned down their review petitions in January last year, saying that Salim had “meticulously executed the killing after Shabnam administered sleeping pills in tea”.The death warrant about the date and time of hanging has not been issued by Amroha court.

But that does not mean the BJP will form its base in those countries. His statement was explained in a wrong way," Nath said. The video clip of his statement was shared on social media platforms on Thursday."We feel that the whole world will accept the thoughts of the BJP. Those who are in Sri Lanka are now thinking of accepting thoughts of the BJP. America is also thinking to accept. The entire world is now thinking," said Nath.The minister further claimed that the entire world was drawn towards Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ideals and persona."We launched the Covid-19 vaccine and other countries are procuring the vaccine from us.

19-02-2021||India||It is in America's interest to assist the rise of India: US think tank||Asserting that the US ought to counteract the influence of Chinese authoritarianism early and often, a top American think tank on Thursday said that one relatively low-cost way is to encourage India to engage more deeply as a competitor with China in the global economy.In its latest report "A US-India Trade Agenda for the Biden Administration", the Washington-DC based think tank Hudson Institute said that India should aim for better relations with American corporations as increased US investment and trade relations will enhance the potential for US-India cooperation in confronting the rise of China.The report, written by Husain Haqqani and Aparna Pande, says that it was in America's interest to assist the rise of India."The US ought to counteract the influence of Chinese authoritarianism early and often. One relatively low-cost way is to encourage India to engage more deeply as a competitor with China in the global economy," it said.The report calls upon India to move away from protectionism."For Indian consumers and business, protectionist practices deliver the opposite of protection. Softened restrictions could attract American and European companies that are moving away from China," it said.Not only would India's economy grow but this would also help with employment generation, it said.It also suggested that Indian bureaucracy's antipathy to foreign corporations has become an obstruction in closer India-US relations."Preventing competition within the Indian market," the report points out, and "using regulation to benefit indigenous companies" will only impair India's growth and limit its potential.The Hudson Institute, in its report, calls upon the Biden administration to "encourage India to lower tariffs, to remove barriers to foreign retail, to roll back unnecessarily restrictive data privacy rules, and to provide economic incentives for foreign investment."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-is-in-america-s-interest-to-assist-the-rise-of-india-us-think-tank-101613698615703.html
19-02-2021||India||Meet Dr Swati Mohan, Indian American leading NASA's Perseverance Rover Landing on Mars||The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Perseverance rover on Thursday (local time) successfully touched down on the surface of Mars after surviving a blazing seven-minute plunge through the Martian atmosphere. Among the scientists who are part of this historic mission, Indian-American Dr Swati Mohan spearheaded the development of attitude control and the landing system for the rover."Touchdown confirmed! Perseverance is safely on the surface of Mars, ready to begin seeking the signs of past life," exclaimed NASA engineer Dr Swati Mohan.When the world watched the dramatic landing, in the control room, calm and composed bindi-clad Dr Mohan was communicating and coordinating between the GN&C subsystem and the rest of the project's team.Apart from being the lead systems engineer during the development process, she also looks after the team and schedules the mission control staffing for GN&C.NASA scientist Dr Mohan emigrated from India to America when she was just one-year-old. She spent most of her childhood in the Northern Virginia-Washington DC metro area. At the age of 9, after having watched 'Star Trek' for the first time, she was quite astounded by the beautiful depictions of the new regions of the universe that they were exploring. She had immediately realised that she wanted to do that and "find new and beautiful places in the universe."She also wanted to become a pediatrician until she was 16. It was, however, her first physics class and the "great teacher" she received, that she considered "engineering" as a way to pursue her interest in space exploration.Dr Mohan holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from Cornell University and completed her MS and PhD from MIT in Aeronautics/Astronautics.While she has been a member of the Perseverance Rover mission since the beginning at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, CA, Dr Mohan has also been a part of various important missions of NASA. The Indian-American Scientist worked on projects Cassini (a mission to Saturn) and GRAIL (a pair of formation flown spacecraft to the Moon).The largest, most advanced rover NASA has sent to another world touched down on Mars Thursday, after a 203-day journey traversing 293 million miles (472 million kilometers). The agency's Perseverance rover landed on the Red Planet at 3:55 pm (Eastern US time) Thursday, bringing an end to the "seven minutes of terror" that saw a fiery atmospheric entry and parachute-assisted descent.The rover's landing mechanism then fired eight retrorockets to slow down and guide it to a proper landing spot before using nylon cords to lower it onto the surface.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meet-dr-swati-mohan-indian-american-leading-nasa-s-perseverance-rover-landing-on-mars-101613694037800.html

19-02-2021||India||Hit by Covid-19 pandemic, country’s aviation sector yet to witness growth in passenger traffic||Indian airlines flew 7.734 million passengers in January, far lower than the 12.7 million they did a year ago as restrictions on flights, flying, and international travel (and travellers), all on account of the Covid-19 pandemic took their toll on the sector.The Directorate General of Air Travel released domestic passenger data for the month of January on Thursday. In December, according to DGCA, airlines carried 7.32 million domestic passengers. That marked a 15% improvement over November.In contrast, January has seen only a 5.5% growth over December. In December, DGCA allowed airlines to sell tickets up to 80% of an aircraft’s capacity, up from 70% the previous month. This stayed the same in January.The average number of daily flights in January was around 2100, much lower than the average number of daily flights of around 3100 in January 2020, according to a report by Icra.“Domestic traffic will not be able to go back to pre-Covid levels firstly because domestic traffic also has an international component. Many passengers land into Delhi or Mumbai, and then travel towards their destinations taking domestic flights,” said CS Subbiah, former chief executive officer of Alliance Air.Subbiah added, “Currently we are operating maximum 100 (international) flights under the government’s scheme, which is way below the original international flight numbers. This international component towards domestic travel itself is around 20% or may be even more as not only Air India but also foreign carriers who have tie-ups with domestic airlines. Secondly, even though many states have smaller numbers, they are still asking travellers to produce test reports that they are not infected.”Read more: Covid-19 mutant strains: Civil aviation ministry releases updated SOPAccording to Subbiah, things will improve only from the summer of 2022.According to the DGCA report, the load factor (seats occupied to those available) of six major domestic airlines IndiGo, SpiceJet, GoAir, Air India, Vistara and AirAsia India was between 65% and 70% in January.DGCA said low-cost carrier IndiGo flew the most number of passengers (4.2 million).IndiGo also recorded the highest on-time performance (OTP) in January with an average 93.7% of its flights from four metro airports -Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad -- departing and arriving on time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hit-by-covid-19-pandemic-country-s-aviation-sector-yet-to-witness-growth-101613680900715.html
19-02-2021||India||Rahul, BSP MP raise LAC situation at defence standing committee meet||At least two opposition Members of Parliament (MPs) questioned Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat on the border situation involving China at a defence standing committee meeting on Thursday, according to three people aware of the details.Congress MP Rahul Gandhi and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MP Kunwar Danish Ali also asked General Rawat questions about whether India was at a disadvantage due to having ordered fewer Rafale jets than what the previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government planned, the people said.The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government’s decision to enter a government-to-government deal -- worth $8.7 billion -- with France to buy 36 Rafales was announced in April 2015, with the deal signed a little more than a year later. This replaced the UPA’s decision to buy 126 Rafale aircraft, 108 of which were to be made in India by state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) using parts imported from France.Read more: Puducherry CM translates fisherwoman's complaint as a praise to Rahul GandhiOn the second day of the three-day meetings to examine the defence ministry’s demand for grants, Gandhi wanted to know what made the government settle for 36 jets instead of 126. General Rawat answered Gandhi’s queries by referring to the government’s flagship Make in India initiative, which encourages local manufacturing, and how the government planned to plug gaps in India’s defence infrastructure by placing orders with HAL, according to the people cited above.To this, both Gandhi and Ali pointed out that HAL was not an offset partner in the deal.“Gandhi was also curious about the ongoing disengagement process at the India-China border and Rawat was answering him,” said one of the MPs HT spoke to.Read more: Puducherry political crisis: LG orders floor test on Feb 22However, Jual Oram, chairman of the committee, asked Gandhi to stick to the agenda.

There could now be a separate discussion on China.General Rawat, who attended the meeting with defence secretary Ajay Kumar and other ministry officials, told Gandhi that defence minister Rajnath Singh had already made the government’s position clear about the border standoff, with Indian and Chinese troops having agreed to disengage in eastern Ladakh’s Pangong Tso after months of stand-off.A Bharatiya Janata Party MP said the difference of opinion was not very significant. “There was no blame game,” he said.

19-02-2021||India||WhatsApp to launch public outreach exercise to push policy||Mobile messaging service provider WhatsApp has decided to launch a public outreach exercise to explain its controversial privacy policy to users, outlining in more detail what this involves, but seemingly deciding to go ahead with a plan that the Indian government has asked the company to abandon.The move relates to the company’s decision to enforce a new privacy policy, which was under fire by critics who said it allowed WhatsApp to share more data with its parent Facebook without giving users the opportunity to opt out of it.In a blog post published early on Friday, the company said it will now simplify the update to make people understand the nuances of the revised policy. “We’ve reflected on what we could have done better here. We want everyone to know our history of defending end-to-end encryption and trust we’re committed to protecting people’s privacy and security.Read more: SC pulls up FB, WhatsApp over privacy: Key takeaways from proceedings“We’ve also included more information to try and address concerns we’re hearing. Eventually, we’ll start reminding people to review and accept these updates to keep using WhatsApp,” the company said, indicating that it planned to go ahead with enforcing the policy, which was deferred to May 15.The company pushed back the enforcement of the policy after backlash in January. As per the new policy, WhatsApp said it will share some data about users’ interactions with business accounts with its parent company Facebook, and that accepting these terms were mandatory in order to use the application.Read more: ‘Police leaked private WhatsApp chat’: Disha Ravi asks court to stop cops, mediaThe ministry on January 19 wrote to WhatsApp CEO Will Cathcart expressing “strong concerns” over this and asked the company to roll it back. Earlier this week, the Supreme Court also issued a notice to WhatsApp, asking it to explain its plans, with a remark that Indians highly value their privacy.A Meity official told HT on Thursday that WhatsApp has not formally conveyed to the government whether it will go ahead with the new policy. “The ministry will respond after it reviews the matter.”The company has said it will now present banner pop-ups on the app to guide users through the policy.Watch: WhatsApp explains new privacy policy changes in latest Android betaThe government in its January 19 letter reminded WhatsApp to “respect the informational privacy and data security of Indian users” and pressed it on whether there were different rules for Indian users and those on other countries.A person familiar with WhatsApp’s policy said India has the same policy as all countries except European Union region, where it needs to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/whatsapp-to-launch-public-outreach-exercise-to-push-policy-101613672974699.html
19-02-2021||India||Activist Disha Ravi seeks restraint on private chat leaks||The Delhi high court said on Thursday that a plea filed by detained climate activist Disha Ravi, seeking to restrain the city police from leaking information related to its investigation of the “toolkit” related to the farmers’ protest to the media, needed to be considered even as the police denied responsibility for any such leaks.Justice Prathiba M Singh, who will hear the petition on Friday, issued notice to the News Broadcasters Association and two news channels — Network 18 and Times Now — on Ravi’s plea that the police had prejudged her guilt in the matter and had been putting out a “biased and defamatory narrative”.Emails sent to the channels by HT had elicited no response as of press time.Read more: Disha Ravi's arrest: 'False to say there were lapses', says Delhi Police chiefThe court also asked the police to file an affidavit after solicitor general (SG) Tushar Mehta and additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma, appearing for the police, told the court that Delhi police had not leaked any investigation material contained in the first information report against Ravi to the media.Ravi, 22, was arrested on February 13 from her home in Bengaluru and produced before a Delhi court on February 14 for her alleged involvement in sharing the toolkit (for creating and amplifying an online campaign) related to the ongoing farmers’ protest on Delhi’s borders with Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg. Ravi broke down in the courtroom and said she had edited two lines in the toolkit in support of the farmers’ movement against three agricultural reform laws.The same document was shared on social media by Thunberg and later deleted.Read more: Disha Ravi can get warm clothes, masks and books in police custody, says Delhi courtRavi’s plea, filed in the high court, said that she was “severely aggrieved and prejudiced by the media trial surrounding her arrest and the ongoing investigation, where she is being viscerally attacked by the police and several media houses.”On Thursday, senior advocate Akhil Sibal appearing for Ravi, told the court that the police was behind the leak of information.He also sought a statement by the police that no information on the case would be shared with the media in future. The solicitor general opposed this and said the demand was designed to attract media attention.In her petition, Ravi said that police took away her mobile phone on February 13 and forced her to provide them with the credentials of her private accounts.“Thus, only police had access to the contents of Ravi’s private conversations and any leaks of the same necessarily constitutes the commission of a cognizable offence and is a violation of the petitioner’s dignity, reputation, and fundamental right to privacy, guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution,” the petition said.Read more: Were informed about activist Disha Ravi's arrest later, says Bengaluru policeThe plea has also said the police first “leaked investigative material” such as her WhatsApp chats which were only in their possession. It said that the chats were published and disseminated by various media houses.The petition has also claimed that the “media houses published one-sided, defamatory suggestive innuendo, and half truths about the petitioner”.Ravi said that police took away her mobile phone on February 13 and forced her to provide them with the credentials of her private accounts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/activist-disha-ravi-seeks-restraint-on-private-chat-leaks-101613679925718.html
19-02-2021||India||Social media moderation: Government plans new platform to flag online posts||As the process of amending the Information Technology Act, 2000 gathers pace, the Centre is considering an alternative system for faster adjudication of cases related to cyberspace, revolving around what experts term a civil takedown of content.The alternative system would be worked out in such a way that the process has legal sanctity and confers powers on the government to take strict action on complaints against offensive content, officials familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity.“The idea is that people who do not want to approach courts or the police regarding violative online content, say a video that the user wants taken down, can have an alternative,” said one of the officials.Read more: Changing the status quo for social media companies in IndiaThe official added that one of the options is to set up a website for grievance redressal that would address such complaints speedily. At present, complainants can either challenge the content they find offensive in the courts or report it to intermediaries, if any are involved, to address their concerns.“The ideal time frame for action would be 48 hours, so that the content can be contained. Cases of women’s safety or cyber frauds can also be reported this way,” the official said. “Of course, criminal cases would need more time to investigate. This wouldn’t clash with that.”At present, for cases that do not constitute a crime, a possible civil solution is to approach the courts. “The ministry of electronics and information technology has been receiving a far greater number of complaints,” a second official said. “There is a need for strengthening of cybersecurity, the provisions relating to intermediaries are also in the works and the country should soon have a data protection law as well.”Read more: ‘Police leaked private WhatsApp chat’: Disha Ravi asks court to stop cops, mediaIn February 2019, the ministry of home affairs (MHA) noted that over 60,000 cybercrime cases were recorded in the previous three years. “As per data maintained by the National Crime Records Bureau, 12,317, 21,796 and 27,248 cases of cybercrime incidents have been registered in year 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively,” the ministry said.NCRB’s data show that 44,546 more cases of cybercrime were registered in 2019.MHA runs a cybercrime reporting portal, cybercrime.gov.in, that was initially started in 2019 to record cases relating to the safety of women and children online. It dealt with online content such as rape videos and child pornography, but has since expanded to include other kinds of cases as well, such as cyber fraud.The portal has no fixed time frame for resolution of cases. “Substantive parts of the IT Act are up for a new avatar,” the second official said. “The government is also revisioning how digital services are provided and consumed.”Read more: Delhi education department to enhance its social media presenceThe first official added that right now, services are provided in different forms, such as cloud services, small applications, big applications, intermediaries and third-party content. “There needs to be a reassessment. There are companies that have gained dominance across different forms. Their positions have to be clarified.”NS Nappinai, a Supreme Court advocate and founder of Cybersaathi, said the move would be welcome. “A remedy for a civil takedown {of offensive content} would be most welcome,” she said. “I would urge the ministry to evaluate a shorter time period than 48 hours, since under the IT Act the takedown period for intermediaries is 36 hours and international trends are for takedowns in 24 hours or less.”She added that victims had little recourse to immediate civil options over offensive content against them posted online. “The only issue is that the victim should not be made to run from pillar to post. A cohesive system has to be worked out,” she added.Nappinai stressed that the issue is complex because everyone assumed that an intermediary meant an online entity. “One may be a digital entity and not online but still be able to avail the safe harbour granted to intermediaries under section 79 of the rules.” Section 79 pertains to intermediary guidelines, which provides safe harbour for intermediaries in a way that they are exempt from penal action for content shared by users.“There is need to gain an understanding of whether they are entitled to safe harbour under all roles,” said the second official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/social-media-moderation-government-plans-new-platform-to-flag-online-posts-101613680077473.html
19-02-2021||India||Signs of Covid uptick as states lower guard||Three states and one Union Territory have seen their seven-day averages of daily Covid-19 cases rise by between 20% and 69% of lows seen after the end of the first wave of the pandemic, an analysis by HT shows. This highlights the potential risk of a surge in cases amid fears of mutant strains gaining ground, and laxity in adhering to protocols due to Covid fatigue being reported across the country.In addition to the regions mentioned above — Maharashtra, Punjab, Haryana and Jammu & Kashmir — the first wave continues unabated in the southern state of Kerala.To be sure, all this comes even as India has vaccinated 10 million people, although an outbreak now could divert the attention of the public health system from vaccination to managing infections.The increase in cases is being reported from these areas as restrictions on several economic and social activities have eased, and people and governments appear to be getting complacent, with almost no mask discipline in many parts of rural India, and even some cities. At the same time, testing is over 50% of its peak across India; in Delhi, too, it is 30% lower than peak capacity levels.Read more: Israel researchers test drug to prevent severe Covid casesWhile Maharashtra, the state worst-hit by the disease, is again seeing a strong resurgence of infections with cases rising rapidly over the past week, Punjab, Haryana and Jammu & Kashmir also face the immediate risk of seeing a second Covid-19 surge, according to HT’s analysis. Kerala, meanwhile, remains the only state in the country which is yet to bring its primary wave of infections in control.This resurgence in new cases, along with rising positivity rates and a drop in testing comes at a time when cases across the majority of the country are at the lowest in eight months, which has prompted local governments to start relaxing norms, and encouraged people to drop their guards.To identify the regions where cases are rising again, HT analysed data from India’s 20 most populous states and UTs to narrow down on four regions where the case rate (the seven-day average of daily cases) appears to have bottomed out and has again started rising — Maharashtra, Punjab, Haryana and Jammu & Kashmir. In these regions, the case trajectory has risen as high as 69% and at least 20% from the lowest levels since the peak of the first wave.Read more: Bharat Biotech seeks Covid-19 vaccine approval in over 40 countriesEpidemiological estimates by the University of Michigan’s Centre for Precision Health Data Science show that while India overall has an effective reproduction number (Rt) of 0.95, only these four states have an Rt of above 1 – Punjab (1.16), Maharashtra (1.12), Haryana (1.05) and Jammu and Kashmir (1.03). An Rt of more than 1 means an outbreak is expanding in a region.Experts warn that these cannot be treated as isolated islands of infection, and with travel restrictions eased, an outbreak in one state can easily spread to another. In Maharashtra, which leads the country with 2.08 million infections and 51,669 deaths as of Wednesday, cases have gone up 69% from their recent trough. In the past week, 4,088 new cases have been reported in the state on average against a low of 2,415 on February 11.Another alarming sign for the state is the rapidly rising positivity rate. On average, 8.4% of all samples tested in the past week have been positive – this has doubled in the last three weeks. The single-day positivity rate in Maharashtra in the past five days, for instance, has been 6.3%, 12.2%, 9.8%, 9.0% and 8.4%. HT reported on Tuesday that the increase has coincided with the resumption of suburban train services – with almost no social distancing norms.Read more: Karnataka imposes restrictions on travel from Kerala amid Covid spike in B'luruTo contrast these numbers against the rest of the nation, India’s overall Covid-19 number has deviated only 3% above the lows seen since the end of the first wave, while the average positivity rate is only 0.1% above the lowest point (1.6%).Testing has also dropped significantly in the western state. In the past week, the state has tested 51,060 samples a day on average, nearly half the peak capacity — at its peak the state was testing an average of over 101,893 samples a day in mid-September.Read more: Covid-19 mutant strains: Civil aviation ministry releases updated SOPIn Maharashtra, the administration has gone into damage control mode in the past week.

High-risk contacts will again be stamped with indelible ink on their hands for identification. Buildings in Mumbai with more than five positive cases will now be sealed as well. On Wednesday, seven districts in the state (Amravati, Buldhana, Yavatmal, Akola, Nagpur, Parbhani and Jalna) imposed restrictions on movement of people and have restricted gatherings to five or fewer people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/signs-of-covid-uptick-as-states-lower-guard-101613679629992.html

The one-man enquiry committee headed by Justice Patnaik was asked to examine the allegations of a lawyer Utsav Singh Bains who filed an affidavit before the Court giving details of a larger conspiracy by a lobby involving fixers, corporate accused and disgruntled judges and politicians. The Committee was not to go into the merits of the sexual harassment complaint leveled against the former CJI.Read more: SC denies registering suo motu contempt against Rajdeep SardesaiIn April 2019, the Supreme Court took suo moto cognizance of these allegations and constituted Justice Patnaik Committee to examine its veracity. The Director, Intelligence Bureau, Commissioner of Delhi Police and Director, Central Bureau of Investigation were asked to assist the Committee in its work.The bench after going through the exhaustive report, said, “The report has also taken note of the limited investigative powers and access to records which it had and based on those materials and evidence before him, it has been opined that it is not possible to find corroborative material qua the allegations of Utsav Singh Bains made in the affidavit.Simultaneously, the bench noted, “The report also acknowledges that the existence of a conspiracy cannot be completely ruled out and this has been so opined as Justice AK Patnaik has not been able to obtain various records including electronic records of Whatsapp, Telegram etc.”Read more: Supreme Court agrees to consider issue of priority vaccination for members of legal fraternity, issues notice to CentreThe possible conspiracy theory was attributed in the report to a letter written by IB Director on July 5, 2019 which stated “on account of the then Chief Justice of India taking serious tough decisions like in the case relating to National Register of Citizens (NRC), there was strong reason to believe that persons who were unhappy with those decisions hatched a conspiracy against the then Chief Justice of India.”The report also made a reference to certain tough administrative decisions taken to streamline the process in the Registry. The bench told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta who alone appeared in the suo moto proceeding, “We are of the view that two years having passed and the possibility of recovery of electronic records at this distance of time is remote, especially since the scope of the enquiry and the power of the learned Judge is limited, no useful purpose will be served by continuing these proceedings.” The Court closed the suo moto case and directed the enquiry report to be placed back in sealed cover.Read more: No link between Char Dham road widening and glacier burst, govt tells Supreme Court; hearing adjourned for 2 weeksThe suo moto proceedings were initiated by a bench headed by former Supreme Court judge Justice Arun Mishra.

This in-house Committee was headed by the present CJI, Justice SA Bobde along with two other judges – Justices Indu Malhotra and Indira Banerjee. In November 2019, Justice Gogoi retired and three months later, the Supreme Court staffer who leveled the sexual harassment allegation was reinstated into service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-evidence-but-can-t-rule-out-conspiracy-against-gogoi-sc-101613678497381.html

They were taken to Begumpet police station and let-off later.Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee president N Uttam Kumar Reddy demanded that the state government hand over the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation, since the people had lost faith on the state police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/murder-of-advocate-couple-triggers-protests-telangana-hc-takes-up-case-101613677562422.html
19-02-2021||India||Movement of trains hit as farmers block rail tracks||The “rail roko” call given by farmers’ bodies impacted rail movement in Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh and parts of Rajasthan on Thursday with reports of sporadic blockades reported from other parts of the country. Railway officials said there was negligible impact of the strike even as some trains were stopped as a precautionary measure.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha, a group of about 40 farmers’ bodies protesting against three new farm laws, had given a call for a four-hour nationwide rail blockade from noon till 4pm.According to farmers’ bodies, the strike received massive support across the country with trains being stopped. “In many places trains were not stopped for long to prevent inconvenience to passengers,” the All India Kisan Sabha said in a statement.In Punjab and Haryana, farmers at several places squatted on railway tracks, which led to disruptions. Protests were also staged at some places in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka.Read more: 'Rail roko agitation passed off without any untoward incident': Indian RailwaysIn Punjab, trains passing through rural areas were stopped at several places, especially in agriculture belts of Malwa and Doaba areas. In several places, tea and snacks were offered to stranded passengers. Some trains coming into Punjab were stopped at Jammu, officials said. In Haryana too, hundreds of farmers, including women, peacefully participated in the agitation at multiple locations in Dadri, Bhiwani, Jind, Sonepat, Rohtak, Hisar and Fatehabad, said Dayanand Punia, state secretary of Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sabha. Due to the blockade, the busy Delhi-Ambala-Amritsar railway track was affected, leading to the diversion of six trains and the stoppage of many others.Read more: Rail roko: Trains halts in Punjab as hundreds of farmers lay siege to railway tracksThe affected trains waiting at various railway stations were allowed to commence their journeys after farmers lifted the blockade at 4pm.In Rajasthan, officials said the Rewari-Sri Ganganagar special train was the only one cancelled due to the agitation, while a few others were delayed. Most of the protests were in western Rajasthan. “The train movement remained almost unaffected. There were reports of minor blockade on two of our routes. However, it was ensured that the issue is addressed. Hence, train movement remained unaffected,” said Ajit Kumar Singh, chief public relation officer (CPRO), North Central Railways — the zone which covers a large part of Uttar Pradesh.Read more: Rail roko will be peaceful, will not join politics: Rakesh TikaitIn Bihar, trains were blocked in Patna-Buxar, Gaya-Patna, Mokama-Barauni, Siwan-Chhapra, Kiul-Gaya, Muzaffarpur-Samastipur, Bhagalpur-Jamalpur and Patna-Darbhanga stretches. Supporters of the CPI (ML), the RJD and the JAP took part in the agitation. Railway officials said that around 20 trains were affected by the agitation.The protest saw a mixed response in Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu with some sporadic protests by Left organisations. Some members of Left farmers’ bodies were arrested in Madhya Pradesh for trying to disrupt rail traffic. No disruption in rail traffic was reported from Goa, Kerala and north-eastern states.“Majority of the zones have reported not a single case of any stoppage of train by the agitators. Few trains were stopped in some areas of some railway zones, but now train operation is normal and trains are being operated smoothly,” said a railway spokesperson. The railways deployed 20 additional companies of the Railway Protection Special Force across the country.Thousands of farmers have been camping at Delhi’s borders since November last year, seeking a repeal of the new farm laws, which they say will erode their bargaining power, weaken a system of assured prices, and leave them vulnerable to exploitation by big agri businesses.The government has maintained that the laws aim to ease restrictions on farm trade by setting up free markets, allow traders to stockpile large stocks of food for future sales and lay down a framework for contract farming.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/movement-of-trains-hit-as-farmers-block-rail-tracks-101613675319767.html

India rejects UN experts' concerns on ending of J&K's autonomy||India on Thursday said concerns expressed by UN human rights experts on Centre's move to scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and enact new laws disregarded the fact that the region is an integral part of the country and that the decision on the changes was made by Parliament.Fernand de Varennes, special rapporteur on minority issues, and Ahmed Shaheed, special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, had said in a statement issued in Geneva that the changes in Jammu and Kashmir could curtail political participation of Muslims and other minorities and lead to potential discrimination in employment and land ownership.Also read: Quad meet stresses on rules-based world order, respect for territorial integrityThe external affairs ministry questioned the timing of the remarks by the UN experts, saying they were “deliberately timed” to coincide with the visit by 24 envoys to Jammu and Kashmir.ALSO WATCH | 24 foreign envoys reach J&K’s Srinagar to assess situationThe statement by the special rapporteurs “disregards the fact that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral and inalienable part of India and the decision of 5 August 2019 regarding the change in the status of the state of Jammu and Kashmir into a union territory of India was taken by the Parliament of India,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.Srivastava said it was “deplorable” that the experts had not waited for India’s response after sharing a questionnaire on February 10. “Instead, they chose to release their inaccurate assumptions to the media,” he said.De Varennes and Shaheed said in their statement, “The loss of autonomy and the imposition of direct rule by the government in New Delhi suggests the people of Jammu and Kashmir no longer have their own government and have lost power to legislate or amend laws in the region to ensure the protection of their rights as minorities.”The experts said the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir was “established with specific autonomy guarantees to respect the ethnic, linguistic and religious identities of its people”, and it was the only Indian state with a Muslim majority.They contended the government had “unilaterally and without consultation, revoked the constitutional special status of Jammu and Kashmir” in 2019, and passed “domicile rules which removed protections given to those from the territory” in May 2020. “Subsequent changes to land laws are further eroding these protections,” they said.Also read: 'New laws, ending of J&K's autonomy affect rights of minorities' - UN expertsThe experts added, “The number of successful applicants for domicile certificates that appear to be from outside Jammu and Kashmir raises concerns that demographic change on a linguistic, religious and ethnic basis is already underway.”The new legislation “overrides previous laws which granted the Kashmiri Muslim, Dogri, Gojri, Pahari, Sikh, Ladhaki and other established minorities rights to buy property, own land, and access certain state jobs”.“These legislative changes may have the potential to pave the way for people from outside the former state of Jammu and Kashmir to settle in the region, alter the demographics of the region and undermine the minorities’ ability to exercise effectively their human rights,” de Varennes and Shaheed said.The special rapporteurs urged the Indian government to ensure that economic, social and cultural rights of the people of Jammu and Kashmir are protected, and they are able to “express their political opinions and participate meaningfully in matters affecting them”.However, Srivastava said the UN experts had failed to account for steps aimed at “ending decades of discrimination, enshrining democracy at the grassroots level through successful conduct of local elections for the District Development Councils, and ensuring good governance”. He said their statement also “ignored the positive impact of extending laws applicable to the rest of India to Jammu and Kashmir, enabling the people... to enjoy the same rights as available to people in other parts of India”.Srivastava said apprehensions of a demographic change are “baseless and unfounded” as most of the domicile certificates were issued to erstwhile permanent resident certificate (PRC) holders.“We expect the special rapporteurs to develop a better understanding of the issues under their consideration before jumping to hasty conclusions and issuing press statements,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deplorable-india-rejects-un-experts-concerns-on-ending-of-j-k-s-autonomy-101613675119326.html
19-02-2021||India||From kin to Saraswati Puja, salvos from Shah, Mamata turn personal before polls||Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday raised political heat in the poll-bound state by several degrees when salvos they aimed at each other became personal, targeting Shah’s son and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief’s nephew.Sparks flew in the district of South 24 Parganas where Amit Shah launched the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) fifth and last Rath Yatra and addressed rallies at Namkhana and Kakdwip while Banerjee addressed her party workers at Pailan.Shortly after Shah, who is on a two-day visit to Bengal, accused Banerjee of not letting people perform Durga and Saraswati pujas and alleged that the only person benefitting in Bengal was her nephew Abhishek, a Lok Sabha member from the same district, the chief minster hit back.She accused Shah’s son, Jay Shah, of amassing wealth and dared the Union home minister to contest Abhishek before challenging her.Though Shah and other BJP leaders have made similar remarks at their recent election rallies, this was the first time Banerjee defended her nephew in public. The strong words she used drew public attention.“The Central government has sent ₹3,60,000 crore for the people of Bengal. But do you get any money? In Bengal, the bhatija (nephew) is the only beneficiary,” Shah told the crowd at Namkhana.“I have never seen any Union home minister lying so much,” Banerjee, who is popularly called didi, or elder sister, said while hitting back.“They keep parroting the words didi and bhatija (nephew). I feel bad when I see Abhishek facing this because of me. He was a child when he saw me getting injured in an attack during the Left era. He was emotionally affected. After growing up, he wanted to join politics. I have not made him the deputy chief minister or cabinet minister. He is just an MP. I wanted to send him to the Rajya Sabha but he insisted on getting elected by the people,” said Banerjee before flaring up.“I dare you (Shah) to field your son in politics. Don’t play with fire. There should be a lakshman rekha (line of demarcation)….. I challenge Amit Shah. First you contest Abhishek and then face me. Your son will not escape from corruption charges. Your son is my bhatija too. He had no money. Tell us how he made hundreds of crores of rupees. How is he a leader in the cricket world?” said Banerjee.Jay Shah is the secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India and president of the Asian Cricket Council.Referring to the road accident in which Abhishek Banerjee suffered an injury to his left eye in October 2016, the chief minister alleged that it was a conspiracy to kill him and as a result he cannot see with one eye. She, however, did not name any suspect.“Does Mamata Ji allow you to perform Durga Puja? Can people in Bengal perform Saraswati Puja? We saw her performing Saraswati Puja for the first time this year,” Shah said at the Namkhana rally.Shah also announced development projects for Sagar Island, venue of the Ganga Sagar Mela during Sankranti festival when millions of pilgrims visit the island. With an eye on the polls to be held in March-April, Shah said if the BJP comes to power in Bengal it will implement the recommendations of the 7th pay commission for state government employees and give ₹6000 a year to every fisherman in the coastal belt. “We will also reserve more than 33% government jobs for women,” he said.Shah also visited the famous Kapil Muni Ashram at Ganga Sagar. He said at the rally that the place will be developed into an international tourism hub.Mimicking Shah in Hindi, Banerjee said, “This man has no other work but to drop in every other day. He keeps saying Mamata Ji has not done this and Mamata Ji has not done that. He says I do not let people perform pujas. Can you recite mantras (prayers in Sanskrit) for Saraswati Puja?” said Banerjee, who has been performing Saraswati Puja at her residence since decades. To drive home her point, she recited parts of three separate mantras dedicated to Saraswati, the Goddess of knowledge.“If Durga Puja is not taking place then how could we give ₹50,000 to each of the state’s 28000 community clubs for the festival…..We know Hindutva very well. We can teach you,” said Banerjee.Banerjee also targeted the BJP’s strategy of sending its senior leaders to the homes of voters.Women are my top supporters. I urge them to box the ears of these leaders and take photos of the act. Boxing someone’s ear will not lead to a police case,” said Banerjee.Reacting to Banerjee’s comments on Jay Shah, the Bengal BJP said the allegations are very old and legal reply was given to those raised it.“Making these allegations once again will not help Banerjee in the coming elections. It will have no effect on people,” said Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-kin-to-saraswati-puja-salvos-from-shah-mamata-turn-personal-before-polls-101613672955352.html
19-02-2021||India||Akbar’s lawyers may rely on part of judgment in appeal||A day after a Delhi court acquitted journalist Priya Ramani in a defamation case filed by former minister and MP MJ Akbar, some legal experts said that a possible appeal by the latter could revolve around the judgment itself, which admits in one part that the content referred to in the suit is “defamatory in nature”, and that the “defence of the accused regarding” only part of the article referring to Akbar and the rest to “other male bosses is rejected” .To be sure, the judgment then went on to say that “Akbar was not a man of stellar reputation”, and reasoned that “the right to reputation cannot be protected at the cost of right to life and dignity of women as guaranteed in the Indian Constitution...”. It added that “.. perpetrators of sexual harassment ... can also be a person of reputation...”. Based on this reasoning, laid out in the verdict, judge Ravindra Kumar Pandey acquitted Ramani.Read more: Priya Ramani vs MJ Akbar case: 5 takeaways from the orderWhen contacted, Akbar’s counsel said they were intending to file an appeal.“With the court saying that the contents are defamatory, he (Akbar) stands vindicated. This was what we had intended to show to the court that you cannot make such defamatory comments through the article and social media posts,” senior advocate Geeta Luthra, heading the legal team for Akbar saidSome legal experts were of the opinion that Akbar’s legal team could focus on the judgment’s comment on the content being defamatory in an appeal, and on it dismissing one aspect of Ramani’s defence that only part of the article was about Akbar.The case concerns Ramani’s tweet in 2018, read in consonance with an article she wrote for Vogue magazine in 2017. In the latter, she wrote about a situation where an editor interviewing her made her feel uncomfortable by conducting the interview in his hotel room.Read more: Priya Ramani acquitted in MJ Akbar defamation caseIn the tweet, which came in the wake of the MeToo movement, she named Akbar as the editor. Several other women spoke about their experiences with him at the same time; one of them Ghazala Wahab even testified in favour of Ramani during the case. Akbar resigned as junior foreign minister and sued Ramani for defamation.Siddharth Dave, a senior advocate in the Supreme Court said there are established exceptions by which an act may not be defamatory. In this case, he added, the exceptions would be: truth; that the content was published in good faith and for the larger public good. “The judgment is convoluted in its reasoning as the logic given by the court does not explain how the exceptions claimed stood justified. The judge should have confined himself within the walls of defamation,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/akbars-lawyers-may-rely-on-part-of-judgment-in-appeal-101613674423657.html
19-02-2021||India||Interview: ‘Centre denied rights to people of Puducherry’, says CM Narayanasamy||At a time when Puducherry’s new Lieutenant Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan has asked him to prove his majority in the state assembly on February 22, CM V Narayanasamy, 73, spoke to Divya Chandrababu about the four MLAs who quit the party, the upcoming floor test, and the Congress’s prospects in the state elections this year. Edited excerpts:Are you ready to face the floor test?They’ve asked for a floor test. I’m clear, whenever we have been asked, that we will do according to the Constitution.Are you in talks with any of the MLAs who have quit? Have you accepted Malladi Krishna Rao’s resignation?We are talking to Malladi Krishna Rao. The other people’s resignations have been accepted.Are you saying you have a majority including him which will take your support to 15 MLAs?I’m not going into numbers. We have got a majority.You seem confident that your government won’t fall.Definitely. Whatever they (the BJP) do, it will be a death knell for them. People will say these are the people who are responsible for topping the government.Now that the L-G has taken charge, do you see it as a relief because you wanted the President to call back Kiran Bedi?She (Soundararajan) took oath in Tamil. For the first time a Tamilian has been appointed as L-G to take additional charge. But we have to see, you know the attitude of the Government of India, and the present NDA government.Some central BJP leaders said that Bedi was removed so that your standoff with her doesn’t work in your favour in the upcoming polls.Let them say that. Our main grievance is against the central government. Kiran Bedi is secondary for us. Our main issue is the central government denied the genuine rights to the people of Puducherry.Do you believe there was a plan to bring your government down ahead of Rahul Gandhi’s visit ?In politics, we have to face everything boldly. We will face any eventuality. The people of Puducherry love the Gandhi family.But your government has been weakened two months before elections.This is the BJP’s ploy in every state. They purchase and blackmail MLAs. They use ED, CBI, I-T against the opposition party leaders. That’s what they did in Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, and West Bengal. They are murdering democracy.Are you saying they purchased or blackmailed the four MLAs who have resigned?Not four MLAs. I’m telling you about the three MLAs -- except Malladi Krishna Rao -- they’ve been blackmailed by BJP.What about your own candidature?Our Congress-led UPA alliance will come to power. Our leadership and alliance parties will have to decide (on the CM candidate)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/interview-centre-denied-rights-to-people-of-puducherry-says-cm-narayanasamy-101613673130790.html
19-02-2021||India||Maharashtra Congress threatens to block Bachchan, Akshay Kumar films||Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole slammed Bollywood actors Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar for their silence over the fuel price rise and threatened to stop the shooting and release of their films in the state. He questioned why the two actors have not spoken out against the price rise like they did during the Congress-led central government’s regime until 2014. Patole, who made the comments in Bhandara during a tractor and bullock cart rally in support of the farmers protesting against the three farm laws, said the actors should speak up in public interest. “Both the actors reacted on social media when petrol prices touched ₹70 per litre during Manmohan Singh’s government. Now petrol and diesel are being sold at ₹96 and ₹86, while cooking gas is priced at ₹800. But both the stars have kept mum. They haven’t uttered a word against the anti-national policies of the [Narendra] Modi government, which are hurting the common man the most. We won’t allow their films to release or the shooting to take place anywhere in Maharashtra.” Patole also questioned if the actors are afraid of the “Modi government’s dictatorship”. “This is not a threat, but in democracy it is the responsibility of celebrities, who are idols of the citizens, to talk in the interest of the general public. If they are not speaking owing to the pressure from the ruling BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party), the people of the country would not pardon them,” he said. Opposition leader and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis called Patole’s comments a publicity stunt. “Patole knows that the statement can gain him publicity by naming Bachchan and Kumar. How can anybody stop the shooting or stall the release of movies in a democracy. You are the head of a ruling party and not the owner of the state,” said the BJP leader. BJP vice-president Madhav Bhandari said such threats result in losses to business and employment. “The threat would not hurt the actors. They have the option to move out to other states in such a scenario. But it leads to a major loss of investment and employment generation. This is an attempt to bring mob rule by the Congress.” Also Read | New Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole vows to take party to the topMeanwhile, the Congress announced a state-wide protest against the Centre over the continuous rise in fuel prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-congress-threatens-to-block-bachchan-akshay-kumar-films-101613645173870.html

He cited the Act and said it required the reserve to be kept “as an inviolate area for the purposes of tiger conservation”.“Not only has the law of the land been violated... but they have also compromised with the safety, protection, and conservation of the national animal..”The Wildlife Protection Act says that tiger reserves shall not be diverted for ecologically unsustainable uses. Bansal said in case it is required, then it is mandatory for the government to seek NBWL’s approval and NTCA’s advice. He added none of this was done in case of allowing private buses in the core area.Read more: No evidence but can’t rule out conspiracy against Gogoi: SCIn December last year, days after Uttarakhand government allowed bus service from the core area of CTR, NTCA sought a factual status report from the state forest department over the move citing the violation of the Wildlife Protection Act after taking cognisance of Centre for Wildlife & Environment Litigation Foundation’s (CWEL) letter.“It is clear…that tiger population at the Corbett Tiger Reserve is important for maintaining the viability of the entire Terai landscape and disrupting it by way of allowing bus service which shall pass through the core area of Corbett Tiger Reserve shall jeopardize one of the few viable tiger populations in the country,” the CWEL letter said.The reserve is home to 231 tigers and is spread across 1,288 square km.

19-02-2021||India||Rail roko: Local train service unaffected in Maharashtra||Farmers in Maharashtra continued their agitations on Thursday and resorted to ‘rail roko’ (rail blockade) stir across the state and tried to disrupt outstation train services to protest against the three farm laws enacted by the Centre. One outstation train – the Aurangabad-Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) Janshatabdi Express – was blocked at Lasur railway station for 30 minutes around 10.05am. There were no other disruptions in the operation of outstation trains anywhere else in Maharashtra. The protests did not have an impact on the functioning of Mumbai local trains either. The farmers staged agitations at places such as Dahanu, Aurangabad and Parbhani before they were stopped by police personnel and detained. “We staged a rail roko at Dahanu, Aurangabad and Parbhani and blocked the trains. Our farmers were taken into police custody. We will continue such agitations till the laws are repealed,” said Ajit Navale, general secretary, All India Kisan Sabha (Maharashtra). In Dahanu, nearly 300 agitators reached the circulating area of the railway station. The city police blocked the entry of the agitators on the railway tracks. “The protestors arrived at the circulating area on the west side of Dahanu railway station. They were protesting with the Communist Party of India (CPM) banners. There was no impact on train movements,” said Sumit Thakur, chief public relations officer, Western Railway. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said the protesters are not farmers but workers of the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA). “Farmers will never cause inconvenience to others. The protestors are Congress, NCP (Nationalist Congress Party) and Shiv Sena workers and not farmers,” said BJP legislator Ram Kadam.Also Read | Rail roko: Delhi Metro shuts entry, exit to four stationsThe Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of 40 farm unions had given a call for a four-hour rail roko demonstration across the country on Thursday, as a part of their campaign to get the three farm laws repealed. Thousands of farmers have been protesting at different borders of Delhi since last November against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. In December, farmers from across Maharashtra had gathered in Mumbai to agitate against the three laws, in solidarity with the farmers protesting at Delhi borders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rail-roko-local-train-service-unaffected-in-maharashtra-101613640186075.html
