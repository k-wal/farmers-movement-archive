The BSF team carefully searched the entire area and found the package which when opened revealed two jars containing a powdery and crystalline substance –weighing 4 lbs. They then contacted the forest officials who said that the substance looked like Cobra venom in the powdery and crystalline form. The forest officials also added that snake venom was a very expensive substance in the international market.The BSF personnel contacted the DFO at Balurghat to ascertain the veracity of the product. The DFO said that snake venom is normally priced at about $120 per gram if purchased officially, but in the grey market the seized amount would cost approximately ₹24 crore. The entire amount has been handed over to officials of the Forest department.The jars had markings which read “Cobra SP – Red Dragon –Made in France – Code No- 6097”. The venom had possibly been brought in from France into areas of Chittagong in Bangladesh from where it was taken to Rangpur in Bangladesh. It is from there that the smugglers attempted to push the product into India from where it may have been taken to China.Cobra venom is used in the preparation of chemicals needed for Chemotherapy of terminally ill Cancer patients. More information is awaited about the seized cache, the modus operandi by which it was being smuggled and the ultimate destination of the venom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bsf-team-seize-smuggled-snake-venom-worth-rs-24-cr-near-indo-bangladesh-border-101613581902150.html

He was 73.Sharma was suffering from cancer and was ailing for some time."He died at 8.16 PM at Goa. His last rites would be done in Delhi on Friday, as the body is being brought from Goa," his son Samir told PTI.A close aide of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, Sharma was Union Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas from 1993 to 1996 in the Narasimha Rao government.Born on October 11, 1947 in Andhra Pradesh's Secunderabad, Sharma was a professional commercial pilot.A three-time Lok Sabha MP who represented Rae Bareli and Amethi constituencies, Sharma was a Rajya Sabha member for three terms representing the states of Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.He first became a member of Rajya Sabha in June 1986 and was later elected to the Lok Sabha from Amethi in 1991 after the death of Rajiv Gandhi.He was later a member of Rajya Sabha from July 2004 to 2016.

17-02-2021||India||Satellite images show China emptying military camps at border row with India||China has dismantled dozens of structures and moved vehicles to empty out entire camps along a disputed Himalayan border, where Indian and Chinese troops have been locked in a face-off since last summer, satellite images released on Wednesday show.The nuclear-armed neighbours last week announced a plan to pull back troops, tanks and other equipment from the banks of Pangong Tso, a glacial lake in the Ladakh region, that became a flashpoint in the prolonged border dispute.Satellite imagery of some areas on the northern bank of Pangong Tso from Tuesday supplied by Maxar Technologies show that multiple Chinese military camps, which could be seen there in late January, have been removed."Similar action is happening from our side also," an Indian official in New Delhi, who asked not to be named, told Reuters.India's defence minister Rajnath Singh told parliament that both sides had agreed to pull back troops in "a phased, coordinated and verified manner" around Pangong Tso, after which military commanders would discuss ending the standoff in other parts of the Ladakh frontier.Tensions began rising along the high-altitude border in April, when India accused Chinese troops of intruding into its side of the Line of Actual Control, the de facto border. China denied the allegation, saying it was operating in its own area.But the confrontation spiralled in June when 20 Indian soldiers and an undisclosed number of Chinese troops were killed during hand-to-hand clashes in Ladakh's Galwan region - the first such casualties along the 3,500 km (2,200 mile) long border in decades.Despite several subsequent rounds of diplomatic and military talks, India and China had been unable to settle on an agreement until February, making the ongoing first phase of the withdrawal critical."What is happening now is that wherever troops, especially north and south of Pangong Tso, were in eyeball-to-eyeball contact, they have taken a step back to reduce tensions and pave way for further de-escalation," the Indian official said.Videos and images released by the Indian army earlier this week also showed Chinese troops dismantling bunkers and tents, and tanks, soldier and vehicles moving out as part of the disengagement process.But some experts have cautioned that current withdrawal is only the first step in a potentially long-drawn out process."It is still nowhere near a full disengagement or an agreement on what we should be doing," India's former National Security Adviser Shivshankar Menon told The Wire news outlet."We need much more than just disengagement. We need a return to the positions before April last year."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/satellite-images-show-china-emptying-military-camps-at-border-row-with-india-101613578913208.html
17-02-2021||India||Trinamool Congress expels district leader known to be close to Suvendu Adhikari||The Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Wednesday expelled Mosharaf Hossain, the sabhadhipati (president) of the Murshidabad Zilla Parishad (district council), on charges of anti-party activities.Hossain is among those leaders in Murshidabad who are known to be close to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former TMC minister Suvendu Adhikari. He was earlier in the Congress but switched sides a few years ago.“The TMC has done me a great favour. I will join the Congress-Left alliance since it is not possible for me to join the BJP. Adhikari, however, will remain my friend,” Hossain said in the evening.A leader close to him said he will join the Congress at a rally on February 19.Senior TMC leaders in Murshidabad and most of the Zilla Parishad members held a meeting in Berhampore town in the afternoon. The expulsion was announced by the party’s district president Abu Taher Khan.There has been tension between Hossain and senior district leaders for the last few months. He did not attend party meetings and even skipped chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s rally in Berhampore last week, saying his father was unwell.Khan said, “Hossain was ignoring the party. He took the lead role in organising a programme for Adhikari. He inaugurated several roads and bridges and held programmes where no TMC flag or photograph of Banerjee could be seen. Hossain displayed his own photos.”“He was trying to make several Zilla Parishad, Gram Panchayat and Panchayat Samiti members leave the ruling party,” said Khan.“A few days ago, we made him the vice-president of the TMC’s district unit but today we unanimously decided to expel him. We have approval of the state leadership,” Khan added.Hossain did not comment on the allegations brought against him.District Congress spokesperson Jayanta Das said, “There was a cold war between Khan and Hossain when both were in the Congress. It seems it has not ended.”“It is impossible to work in the TMC if one has a clean image. Our state president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury has declared that all those who want to join our fight against the TMC and BJP are welcome. If Hossain wants to return to the Congress we will welcome him.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trinamool-congress-expels-district-leader-known-to-be-close-to-suvendu-adhikari-101613577785865.html

As the Jatha (caravan of pilgrims), which may have nearly 600 members, is scheduled to visit five Gurudwaras across Pakistan over a period of a week, we apprehend considerable threat to the safety of a large number of our citizens during this visit,” the home ministry letter said.A person familiar with the development acknowledged said the home ministry decision was unusual. Sikh Jathas have never been stopped from going to Pakistan in the past even when bilateral relations between two countries were at its worst, during the 26/11 Mumbai attacks or Pulwama attack. There may have been instances where individuals were stopped but Sikh Jathas were allowed to travel to Pakitan in November 2020 also.Wednesday's home ministry letter said its permission was needed "in view of the ongoing suspension of cross-border traffic due to Covid-19 pandemic"India had suspended travel to Pakistan in March 2020 in view of the coronavirus pandemic that infected more than 10 million people and led to 1,55,913 deaths.The home ministry letter added: “While the pandemic continues to persist, it is pertinent to note that Pakistan has so far recorded over half a million cases with over 10,000-plus deaths due to Covid. Considering the capacity of health infrastructure in Pakistan, it is not advisable for a large group of our citizens to visit Pakistan for a week during the pandemic”.There has been no reaction from the SGPC so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-won-t-allow-600-sikh-pilgrims-to-travel-to-pak-says-threat-to-their-life-101613577085714.html

One will have to first disclose their identity, religion, income everything before one enters into a marriage with any girl,” Sarma told journalists in Guwahati.In the backdrop of some states announcing laws on ‘love-jihad’, the minister, who holds finance, health, education and PWD portfolios in the Sarbananda Sonowal-government, had said in November last year that the state government was mulling bringing in a legislation that requires the bride and groom to disclose their religion, income etc.He had stated that the legislation was aimed at bringing in more transparency in a marriage and with the intention of empowering women. The legislation would require couples from same religion as well to disclose details about themselves and their families, Sarma had said.“We are also against the concept called land ‘jihad’. Many of our lands in lower and middle Assam including those belonging to our monasteries are being grabbed by certain elements. There will be something in our manifesto on this as well,” said Sarma.“We are against radicalism, fundamentalism and communalism.

17-02-2021||India||PM Modi says middle class burdened due to previous govt's import dependence||On a day when petrol crossed the ₹100 mark, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said the middle-class would not have been burdened if the previous governments had focussed on reducing India's energy import dependence.Without referring to the relentless increase in retail fuel prices, which are linked to international rates, he said India imported over 85% of its oil needs in the 2019-20 financial year and 53% of its gas requirement."Can a diverse and talented nation like ours be so energy import dependent?" he asked, addressing an online event to inaugurate oil and gas projects in poll-bound Tamil Nadu."I do not want to criticise anyone but I want to say (that) had we focused on this subject much earlier, our middle-class would not be burdened," he said.Price of petrol crossed the ₹100 per litre mark in Rajasthan after fuel rates were hiked for the ninth day in a row. Since India imports the majority of its oil needs, retail rates are benchmarked to international prices, which have spiralled in recent weeks.Opposition parties including Congress have criticised the price hikes, blaming it on the Modi government raising taxes to scoop out the benefit that arose from international oil rates plunging to a two-decade low in April/May last year. While global rates have rebounded with pick up in demand, the government has not restored the taxes, which are at a record high.Central and state taxes make up for 60% of the retail selling price of petrol and over 54% of diesel.The Prime Minister further said it was a collective duty to work towards clean and green sources of energy as well as energy independence."Our government is sensitive to the concerns of the middle class. That is why India is now increasing the focus on ethanol to help farmers and consumers," he said.Ethanol extracted from sugarcane is being doped in petrol to reduce the requirement of imports. Currently, 8.5% of petrol is ethanol and this proportion is targeted to be raised to 20% by 2025, helping cut imports as well as give farmers an alternate source of income.India, he said, is looking to cut energy import dependence as well as diversify its sources to reduce risks.The focus now is also towards using renewable sources of energy, which will by 2030 form 40% of energy generated in the country, he said, listing measures such as increased share of solar power, focus on public transport, switching to LED bulbs, scrappage policy for vehicles and use of solar pumps in irrigation."Today, India is increasing the share of energy from renewable sources. By 2030, 40% of all energy will be generated from green energy sources," he said.Modi further said India is looking to reduce energy import dependence through capacity building. "In 2019-20, we were fourth in the world in (oil) refining capacity. About 65.2 million tonnes of petroleum product have been exported. This number is expected to rise even further."Also, Indian firms have ventured overseas in the acquisition of oil and gas assets, which provide energy security."Today Indian oil and gas companies are present in 27 countries with an investment worth about ₹2.70 lakh crore," he said.Modi said the nation is looking to build a natural gas pipeline grid to boost usage of the environment-friendly fuel that would help cut carbon emissions."We have planned to spend ₹7.5 lakh crore in creating oil and gas infrastructure over five years," he said. "A strong emphasis has been laid on the expansion of city gas distribution network by covering 470 districts."City gas projects will provide clean cooking fuel to households in form of piped natural gas, alternate transport fuel as CNG to vehicles and feedstock and fuel to industries.The government is working towards raising the share of natural gas in the energy basket to 15% from the current 6.3% and is committed to bringing it under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime to eliminate cascading effect of multiple taxes, he added."We are trying to eliminate the cascading effect of different taxes on natural gas across different states," he said adding this would help bring down the cost of gas."We are eager to increase the share of natural gas in energy basket from 6.3% currently to 15%... We are committed to bringing natural gas under the GST regime," he said.When the GST in 2017 subsumed over a dozen central and states taxes, five products -- crude oil, natural gas, petrol, diesel and jet fuel (ATF) -- were kept out of it for the time being.This has meant that taxes paid on inputs cannot be offset by taxes on the final product."Since 2014, we have brought in various reforms across the oil and gas sector, covering exploration and production, natural gas marketing and distribution. We are working on attracting domestic and international investment through investor-friendly measures," Modi said.

The Indian premier was earlier scheduled to visit Dhaka in March last year but the trip was called off due to the Covid-19 pandemic.New Delhi has worked to remove irritants in ties with Dhaka over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and sped up work on several connectivity and transit projects. Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla made his first foreign visit amid the pandemic to Dhaka in August last year and had handed over a personal message from Modi to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.During the virtual summit with Hasina on December 17, Modi described Bangladesh as an important pillar of India’s “Neighbourhood First” policy.The two sides signed seven agreements at the summit in areas ranging from hydrocarbons to agriculture and revived a cross-border railway line that was snapped 55 years ago, giving a boost to connectivity initiatives and energy cooperation.Bangladesh foreign secretary Masud Bin Momen visited India last month for foreign office consultations and India provided two million doses of the Covishield vaccine to Bangladesh under the “Vaccine Maitri” initiative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eam-jaishankar-to-visit-bangladesh-on-march-4-to-review-bilateral-ties-101613574354674.html

17-02-2021||India||In a first, Centre approves financial powers for top military officers||The Cabinet on Wednesday approved enhanced financial powers of up to ₹200 crore for senior military officers to make capital procurement, a government statement said. The deputy chief of army staff (capability development and sustenance) – a post created last December – is among the officers who have been granted enhanced financial powers.This is the first time regular financial powers (as opposed to special financial powers) have devolved below the vice chief level for specified items of capital nature to meet emerging security challenges, people familiar with the matter said. The enhanced powers come in the backdrop of challenges along the borders with China and Pakistan.The Cabinet approved financial powers to the tune of ₹200 crore for one category of officers and ₹100 crore for the second category that consists of military officers of the rank of commanders-in-chief (senior three-star officers heading different commands).Among the officers who have been given authority to spend ₹200 crore are the navy’s chief of material, the air force’s chief of maintenance, the deputy chief of Integrated Defence Staff and the coast guard’s additional director general, the statement said.“This delegation of powers within service headquarters and up to command level for items of capital nature such as overhauls, refits and upgrades will enhance the utility of existing assets and will facilitate faster processing and implementation of projects for modernisation of the armed forces to meet security challenges,” the statement said.Delegation of financial powers is a welcome step as it will provide impetus to capability development, shorten procurement cycles and enhance operational readiness, said Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), a former director general of military operations.The Cabinet has also approved enhanced financial powers in the ‘Make-I category’ under which government funding of up to 70% of the prototype development cost is available for design and development of equipment, systems and platform upgrades.“The Chief of Integrated Defence Staff to the Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee or CISC, vice chiefs of the army, navy and air force, and Director General, Coast Guard have now been given powers to sanction government support up to ₹50 crore towards cost of prototype development,” the statement said.Financial powers have also been increased for other competent authorities under ‘Make-I’, in line with the government’s plan to boost the self-reliant India campaign to build a robust defence industrial ecosystem, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-first-centre-approves-financial-powers-for-top-military-officers-101613573852586.html
17-02-2021||India||‘Karnataka govt, police not informed’: Cong MP on Disha Ravi's arrest||Congress MP Syed Naseer Hussain alleged on Wednesday that the Karnataka government and the state police were not informed about climate activist Disha Ravi’s arrest. Hussain added that Ravi’s arrest was similar to the ones made in Punjab over the ongoing protests against the Centre’s three new farm laws and earlier, during the stir against the contentious Citizenship Act.“Disha Ravi’s arrest was made without informing the Karnataka police & state govt. These kinds of arrests have also been done in CAA-NRC cases, in Punjab who have been agitating against farm laws,” Hussain was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.In the last 6 yrs, 140 sedition cases registered against Indian citizens but the conviction rate has been around 1%. They just want to see that nobody speaks or agitate against govt & create some sort of fearmongering among the common citizens: Syed Naseer Hussain, Rajya Sabha MP pic.twitter.com/AwAc2PxlDMThe Rajya Sabha MP further pointed out that 140 cases had been registered against Indian citizens in the past six years but the conviction rate was close to only 1%. Sharpening his attack, Hussain said that the Centre just wanted to ensure that nobody speaks or protests against it. “They just want to see that nobody speaks or agitates against govt and create some sort of fearmongering among the common citizens,” he told ANI.Hussain is the latest Opposition leader to condemn Ravi’s arrest. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has also targeted the Centre over the issue, accusing the government of ‘destroying the nation’s character and destiny by frightening people and not allowing them to talk.’ Addressing college students in Puducherry, Gandhi urged youngsters to not allow anyone to frighten them into silence.Bengaluru-based Disha Ravi was arrested by the Delhi Police on February 13 in connection with the toolkit tweeted by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg over the ongoing farmers’ protest in India. She is currently in a five-day judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-govt-police-not-informed-cong-mp-on-disha-ravi-s-arrest-101613572601614.html
17-02-2021||India||Ahead of kisan mahapanchayat in Malwa region, MP issues prohibitory orders||The Indore district administration in Madhya Pradesh has imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC preventing the assembly of four or more people for the next two months in wake of announcement of kisan mahapanchayats (farmers’ meetings) in the Malwa region, the richest agrarian belt of the state.Farmers’ unions protesting three recent farm laws have been holding kisan mahapanchayats in several states since January 27 when the Uttar Pradesh police tried to evict farmer leader Rakesh Takait from the UP-Delhi border at Gazipur.The farmers have held their meetings in several places including Meerut, Saharanpur, Muzzafarnagar in Uttar Pradesh, Jind and Ambala in Haryana and Bharatpur, Sikar and Dausa in Rajasthan. A large farmers’ meet has been planned in Malwa in Madhya Pradesh in the next few days.On Wednesday, the Indore district administration banned public rallies, protests, dharnas and public meetings unless permitted by the district collector till April 15. Even social, political and religious organisation will not be allowed to advertise and publicise any programme without permission, the administration said in its order.“There will be a ban on posters, hoardings, banners, flags and other publicity materials related to religion, persons, caste and community. Nobody can write slogans and graffiti on a wall of government and private building without permission. There will be a ban on using public announcement system. In case of violation of the order, action will be taken under Section 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of IPC,” said the order.The prohibitory order in Indore district came into force on Wednesday after the first kisan mahapanchayat in Madhya Pradesh was held in Khargone district on Monday. As many 500 farmers attended the Mahapanchayat.Farmers panchayats in Chambal, Bundelkhand, Central and Naramadpuram region were not very impressive and in terms of numbers.Rashtriya Kisan Majdoor Mahasangh, national president Shivkumar Sharma ‘Kakkaji’ said the prohibitory order will not stop the farmers from attending the mahapanchayats.“The governments of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled states are trying to suppress the farmers’ agitation. After Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, the BJP has started targeting the protests in Madhya Pradesh. The farmers of Malwa region have started coming out of their houses and are planning to hold mahapanchayat in Indore. The order won’t stop the farmers.”Kisan Sangh Sanyukt Morcha MP convener Badal Saroj said, “In Chambal and Gwalior division, the administration and police are not even allowing us to hold small meetings. The state government’s authoritarian behavior will not work. Now, farmers have started understanding that the Centre’s new farm laws are not for them but in favour of industrialists.”The opposition Congress also attacked the state government for imposing prohibitory orders.“The government wants to suppress the voice of Congress and farmers against the injustice of BJP-led state and Central government. MP Congress Committee is holding many protests across the state including in Indore against the rise in prices of fuel and LPG. We are going to organize a programme on February 21 in Indore and this order will not stop us from becoming a voice of farmers and common people,” MP Congress general secretary Rakesh Yadav said.Former Madhya Pradesh advocate general Anand Mohan Mathur said, “The misuse of section 144 has been increased in the past 5-6 years in Indore. The prohibitory orders are being imposed without any reason to suppress protests.”But Indore’s additional district magistrate (ADM) Himanshu Chandra said it was only a “common prohibitory order”."This is a common prohibitory order to maintain law and order in the district. It has nothing to do with farmers protest and any other protest,” he said.The ruling BJP tried to play down the prohibitory order and accused the Congress of politicising the matter.BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said, “The district administration takes this decision to maintain peace in the district. If someone wants to protest or hold a rally, they can do so by taking permission. Some leaders failed to get the support of farmers in MP so they are targeting the state for that. Similarly, the Congress leaders are unnecessarily trying to politicize the matter.”(With inputs from Neha Jain in Indore)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-kisan-mahapanchayat-in-malwa-region-mp-issues-prohibitory-orders-101613572109859.html
17-02-2021||India||IAF proposes closure of Jammu airport for civilian traffic next month||The Indian Air Force (IAF) has proposed closure of the Jammu airport for civilian traffic for 15 days next month for runway resurfacing work , drawing a strong resentment from the Jammu and Kashmir administration which has sought the defence ministry's intervention into the matter, officials said on Wednesday.Nearly two dozen flights operate to and from the Jammu airport, and in view of the development, all the companies operating their flights in the sector have stopped booking for the period.Quoting a communication addressed to the Jammu airport director, the officials said Air Force Station, Jammu wants complete closure of the runway for 15 days towards laying of final two top DAC-II layers on the runway surface from March 6 to 20, which has been approved by Air Headquarters.The officials said Jammu and Kashmir Chief Secretary B V R Subrahmanyam lodged his protest with the Civil Aviation Ministry against such a move and requested intervention of the defence ministry into the matter to ensure that the resurfacing is carried out in such a manner that civilian air traffic is not affected during the day time."Complete closure of the airport for 15 days would create huge administrative issues for the government of Jammu and Kashmir," Subrahmanyam had written in his letter to Civil Aviation Ministry Secretary Pradeep Singh Kharola.The officials said the chief secretary highlighted that the Jammu airport, being the only civil airport in the division, caters to the requirement of civilian air traffic for the entire province and serves as the only connecting airport for Mata Vaishno Devi shrine."In the eventuality of the closure for 15 days, air traffic would have to be diverted to the nearest civil airport in Punjab, which would result in various logistical issues," Subrahmanyam said.He added that air connectivity to Kashmir also gets disturbed and even disconnected in extreme weather conditions and in such cases, the air traffic at Jammu increases manifold as Kashmir-bound passengers also prefer disembarking at the Jammu airport.The chief secretary further said tourist activities have only recently picked up in the union territory after easing of restrictions imposed on account of the COVID-19 pandemic."In the given scenario, it would be administratively and operationally prudent to explore the possibility of carrying out the resurfacing work at night time and simultaneously utilising ramp facilities for aircraft operations at the said runway, a practice which is generally adopted by the AAI (Airport Authority of India) for all resurfacing work," he said.Responding to the letter of the chief secretary, Kharola took the matter with his counterpart in the defence ministry, Ajay Kumar, and requested his intervention into the matter, citing inconvenience to passengers and tourists and likely fallout on the economy, the officials said.They said the AAI has already requested IAF Headquarters to plan and execute the proposed work of runway surfacing during night time so that civil aircraft operations are not hampered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-proposes-closure-of-jammu-airport-for-civilian-traffic-next-month-101613570916165.html

The sales have not reached the level of pre coronavirus yet.” said M Venkatrao, president, Petrol Dealers’ Association.Residents say they have no option but to buy petrol at a higher rate. “We are forced to commute in this manner. Local train services are not available which is why people are travelling by their personal vehicle. The state government should reduce the value added tax on fuel products,” said Aadi Jain, a Byculla resident.Citizens have urged the central government to intervene immediately to reduce fuel prices. “The central government can reduce the fuel prices. They need to intervene immediately to reduce petroleum cost,” said Ajeet Verma, a Matunga resident.In Delhi, petrol is selling at ₹89.29 per litre today, while diesel is priced at 79.95 per litre.In Rajasthan's Ganganagar, the price of petrol crossed ₹100 per litre mark today.

Last month, the Sri Lankan government scrapped the trilateral deal with India and Japan to develop the Colombo Port’s Eastern Container Terminal (ECT).Gammanpila told a gathering at the Colombo north suburb of Kolonnawa that talks with the Indian High Commissioner in Colombo on this issue concluded last Sunday."I am happy to state that the Indian High Commissioner was very flexible at the talks. He ignored the conditions mentioned in the agreement signed in 2017 in order to be helpful to us," Gammanpila said, referring to his discussions with High Commissioner Gopal Baglay."He was flexible to agree to all our conditions. A majority of ships which sail around Trincomalee are from India. So we need India's cooperation to win their market," he said."I am proud to announce that the oil tanks the use of which had been denied to us since 2003 will be soon ours," Gammanpila said on the Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm.The Trincomalee Harbour is one of the deepest natural harbours in the world. It was developed by the British during World War II.These tanks will have the capacity to offer bunkering facilities to the ships sailing in close proximity to Trincomalee, Daily Mirror newspaper reported on Wednesday."After World War II, these tanks were abandoned without being used. In 2003, the tanks were leased to the Indian Oil Company. But we are happy to say that Sri Lanka will soon have those tanks back," the minister said.Sri Lanka in 2003 had leased out 99 oil tanks to the IOC for 30 years for an annual payment of $100,000.The IOC was also given one third share of the Sri Lankan government entity, Petroleum Stirage Limited. However, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) trade unions had been pressing for the takeover of the tanks.Initially, the CPC wanted to develop 25 of the tanks by investing $25-30 million. The CPC maintains that it will allow them to strengthen their oil storage and distribution in the north and eastern provinces while allowing stock maintenance to suffice 2-3 months.Last month, the Mahinda Rajapaksa government said it has decided to run the Colombo Port’s Eastern Container Terminal as a fully-owned operation of the State-run ports authority.India, Japan and Sri Lanka had inked an agreement in 2019 on development of the terminal project.The Colombo port trade unions opposed the proposal of investors from India and Japan buying 49% stake in the ECT. They demanded the ECT to remain 100% owned by the SLPA as opposed to the 51%.India expressed regret over the cancellation of the deal and asked Sri Lanka to abide by its commitment to the trilateral deal with it and Japan.Japan has also conveyed its unhappiness with the Sri Lankan government over the cancellation of the deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sri-lanka-to-re-acquire-99-oil-tanks-leased-to-indian-oil-corporation-minister-101613570180762.html

17-02-2021||India||Andhra assembly to adopt resolution against privatisation of Vizag steel plant||Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy on Wednesday announced that the state assembly would adopt a resolution soon requesting the Centre to drop its proposal to privatise the prestigious Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL), better known as Visakhapatnam Steel Plant.“We shall make all out efforts to ensure that the Vizag steel plant, which is a sentiment of the people of Andhra Pradesh, will not be sold out to private parties under any circumstances. I am confident that the Centre will change its stand in this regard,” Jagan said.The chief minister held an hour-long meeting with the representatives of various trade unions belonging to Visakhapatnam Steel Plant in the wake of intensifying agitation of the workers against privatisation of the plant.He said he had suggested to the Centre to restore the leases of the RINL in the iron ore mines in Odisha as a strategy to prevent proposed privatisation of the steel plant.The chief minister said the RINL was suffering losses due to lack of captive mines and it was forced to spend an additional amount of ₹4,000 per tonne of iron ore. “I wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting that a captive iron ore mine in the neighbouring Odisha state be allocated to the RINL,” he said.He pointed out that the RINL had earlier been given 51 per cent of share in five iron ore mines Odisha, the remaining 49 per cent stake belonging to the Central government, LIC and Odisha Mineral Development Corporation.“These mines have high quality iron ore to the extent of 200 million tonne, which is enough for the RINL for the coming several years. However, the lease agreement of these mines had lapsed long ago. If this agreement is revived and the stakes of RINL is restored, the steel plant will be back into profits,” Jagan said.He further said the RINL had an accumulated debt of ₹22,000 crore, including long-term loans worth ₹12,000 crore and another ₹11,000 crore loans obtained from banks towards working capital. Some banks had given loans at a high interest rate of 14 per cent.The chief minister said he had suggested conversion of high-interest long-term loans into equity so as to reduce the interest burden. “It will immediately help the RINL overcome the burden of repayment of around ₹3,000 crore. This will bring the company into profits. The RINL can come out with a public issue and get the shares listed in the stock exchange, so that the banks could use the exit options whenever they want,” he said.The chief minister also suggested another solution to bail out the RINL from losses. “The steel plant has around 20,000 acres of land, of which 7,000 acres are still not in use. The state government will give approval to the steel plant for the land use conversion, since it is under the purview of the state. The RINL management can auction these vacant lands and plough the money that is accrued back into the steel plant. It will increase the cash reserves of the steel plant,” he said.The chief minister requested that the Bharatiya Janata Party leaders, too, support these suggestions and take them up with the Centre to drop the privatisation plan. “We shall also make our own efforts in this direction,” he said.Jagan, however, appealed to the workers of the steel plant not to strike work but operate t with more efficiency. “Under any circumstances, we shall not create an impression that the plant was running in losses due to lack of production,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-assembly-to-adopt-resolution-against-privatisation-of-vizag-steel-plant-101613568374945.html

Both breathed their last while being shifted to Peddapalli government hospital in an ambulance,” the SP said.The driver of the car, who was an eyewitness to the gory murder, is being questioned by the police.A video clip of Vamana Rao, lying on the road profusely bleeding with multiple stab injuries, telling the onlookers that someone named Kunta Srinu from Gunjamadugu village had attacked him and his wife went viral on social media.The SP, too, said the advocate had named Kunta Srinu, a local Telangana Rashtra Samithi leader, before succumbing to injuries. “We understand Vaman Rao had a dispute with Kunta Srinu over a temple issue. Srinu is absconding. We have formed six special teams of police to launch a manhunt for the killers. We shall probe the case irrespective of their stature and political links,” he said.The couple had been arguing cases against local political leaders in Peddapalli district, apart from the infamous case of custodial death of a Dalit Seelam Rangaiah in Manthani police station in May 2020.In November last, the couple approached the high court seeking protection as they were getting threatening calls from the police. On February 8 this year, the state high court issued a direction to director general of police M Mahender Reddy to ensure that the advocate couple was not harassed by the police.Vaman Rao’s brother Indrasekhar told reporters that he was suspecting the hand of Kunta Srinivas, who was allegedly involved in land encroachments, against which his brother was fighting in the courts.Congress MLA from Manthani D Sridhar Babu demanded a CBI investigation into the killing of Vaman Rao and his wife Nagamani, as the couple was facing threat from the police in the lock-up death case.Telangana bar council strongly condemned the murder of Vaman Rao and Nagamani. “We demand that the police act swiftly and arrest the culprits. We also demand security for the advocates who are arguing sensitive cases,” G Jitender Reddy, bar council member, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lawyer-couple-hacked-to-death-had-sought-police-protection-few-months-ago-101613567875487.html
17-02-2021||India||'I might get arrested for saying this...': Rahul Gandhi on Disha Ravi's arrest||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said people were being arrested in the country "for what they think". Speaking at an interaction with students of Bharathidasan Government College for Women in Puducherry, Gandhi reacted to climate activist Disha Ravi's arrest and said that the nation's character was being destroyed as people were not being allowed to talk."Maybe I'll get arrested for saying this... if you're shutting up the nation and frightening people and not allowing them to talk, you're destroying the nation's character," he said.The 22-year-old Ravi was arrested by the cyber crime unit of Delhi Police for allegedly sharing on social media a toolkit related to the farmers’ protests against the Centre’s contentious agricultural laws. According to the police, it was Ravi who had shared the toolkit document with Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg. She was booked for sedition, promoting enmity and criminal conspiracy, among other offences and was produced at a city court on Sunday, after which she was sent to five days in police custody.“Disha Ravi, arrested by CyPAD Delhi Police, is an Editor of the Toolkit Google Doc & key conspirator in document’s formulation & dissemination. She started WhatsApp Group & collaborated to make the Toolkit doc. She worked closely with them to draft the Doc,” a tweet by Delhi police read. “In this process, they all collaborated with the pro-Khalistani Poetic Justice Foundation to spread disaffection against the Indian State. She was the one who shared the Toolkit Doc with Greta Thunberg,” another tweet read.The police further claimed that the call was to wage an economic, social, cultural and regional war against India. Thunberg, who had shared the toolkit on Twitter, later deleted the original tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-might-get-arrested-for-saying-this-rahul-gandhi-on-disha-ravi-s-arrest-101613567587520.html

The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), a representative body of protesting farmers, announced the rail blockade last week, in a bid to amplify the voices of agitating farmers.Here’s all you need to know about tomorrow’s 'Rail Roko' protest:The movement is being held all over the country but the Railway Protection Force (RPF) has tightened security in four key states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. The RPF has deployed 20 additional companies across these states. “Railways has appealed for peace. We will have additional security focus on Punjab, Haryana, UP and Bengal. 20 additional companies of RPF have been deployed. We appeal to everyone to maintain peace calling for peaceful protests so as not to inconvenience passengers,” a railway ministry spokesperson said.The Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) is also planning to hold a Kisan Mahapanchayat in poll-bound West Bengal. BKU leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni told PTI that farmer unions will hold meetings in poll-bound West Bengal and will be asking people in Bengal not to vote for those who are "snatching our livelihood".This is not the first railway blockade launched by farmers; last year in September, before farmers set off for Delhi, they held a state-wide rail blockades in Punjab, resulting in total suspension of train services in the state for nearly two months. Many passenger trains were later re-routed as the state and central government sparred over allowing passenger trains to traverse through the state.The railway ministry informed Parliament during last week’s budget session that the railways suffered a loss of ₹1,462.45 crore in Financial Year 2020-21 due to “various agitations/strikes including dharnas at platforms and near tracks”.Along with 'Rail Roko', Mahapanchayats are being organised all over the country. Both BKU and SKM have made it clear that farmers will not stop protesting until the three contentious farm laws are repealed by the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-you-need-to-know-about-farmers-rail-roko-call-101613567304355.html
17-02-2021||India||Experts say India's Covid-19 'human barricade' to keep cases under control||With falling rates of Covid-19 infection in India and surveys suggesting nearly 300 million people may already have antibodies, some experts believe the worst of the disease has passed, despite a recent uptick in two hard-hit states."There is a human barricade for the virus," said Bhramar Mukherjee, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan, who with a team of researchers, has been modeling the trajectory of the outbreak in India."By the end of March, we should see a very slow, steady decline (in cases)," she added.Cases that were rising by nearly 100,000 a day in September are now growing at just 10,000 a day. And India's official number of total infections, which was projected to surpass that of the United States in late 2020, now stands at 11 million, well behind the US tally of about 28 million.Total deaths so far in India are just under 156,000, the world's fourth highest number of fatalities."India suffered through a lot and because it suffered through a lot, it's reached the other shore now," said Ramanan Laxminarayan, an epidemiologist at the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy, a research firm based in Washington, DC. and New Delhi. "I don't see the prospect of a second wave in India. If it does happen, it will likely be a modest one."A recent government serological survey indicated 21.5% of Indians were likely infected by Covid-19, giving them a degree of immunity, while antibody tests on more than 700,000 people by a diagnostic company showed that 55% of Indians may have already been infected.To be sure, not all epidemiologists agree India is out of the woods. The country is currently battling a surge in cases in two states - Maharashtra and Kerala, which account for a combined 70% of nationwide active cases.Even those predicting further declines in cases, like Mukherjee, warn that India will need to continue Covid-19 containment measures and surveillance of new variants, besides aggressively vaccinating its people.More socializing, coupled with a recent restart of local trains in the financial hub of Mumbai, could be causing the spike in Maharashtra, say experts, while a restart of schools in Kerala is being blamed for the surge there. New clusters have also been identified in the tech hub of Bengaluru."Even though there are advisories against large gatherings, people have started to take it easy," said Pradeep Awate, a senior health official in Maharashtra.Still, Mukherjee notes the "percentage of cases that require hospitalizations in Kerala and Maharashtra has gone down."VaccinationThe reason why millions of Indians are asymptomatic — as survey numbers suggest — has flummoxed experts.Theories range from India's early lockdown implementation to its youthful population and an intrinsic immunity among Indians. Some say an open-air lifestyle in villages could have prevented a surge in rural India, where two-thirds of India's 1.3 billion people live.But epidemiologists say finding the true reason will require research that could take years.While experts agree many Covid-19 cases and deaths may be under-reported in India, available indicators like hospital-bed utilization rates point to a falling curve.Epidemiologists say a key factor would be how aggressively India moves on its vaccination drive."If vaccines are given in large numbers right away, we're going to be in a very good position," said Mukherjee. "By the time infection-induced immunity wanes, people will get vaccine-induced immunity."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-say-india-s-covid-19-human-barricade-to-keep-cases-under-control-101613567028418.html
17-02-2021||India||No data Indian vaccines' efficacy against SA, Brazilian variants: Scientists||Preliminary research shows the two vaccines against Covid-19 approved in India are effective against the UK variant of the novel coronavirus but there is no data on their efficacy against the South African and Brazilian mutants detected in the country.On Tuesday, the Health ministry said four people were detected with the South Africa variant of SARS-CoV-2 and one tested positive for the Brazil variant, a first for India, prompting scientists to stress the need for more data and studies so the country’s vaccine programme can be tailored to evolving exigencies.The number of people who have tested positive for the UK variant in the country has climbed to 187, officials added.The vaccines currently approved for emergency use in India are Covishield, from the Oxford-AstraZeneca stable manufactured by Pune’s Serum Institute of India, and Covaxin, developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research and the National Institute of Virology (NIV).Answering the question uppermost in many minds, researcher Deepak Sehgal said it is difficult to say how effective the two will be against the new emerging variants, particularly the South African and Brazilian ones, unless scientists have studied them properly.“Having said that, among the two vaccines currently in India, Covaxin may do better against the new mutants because it generates protection against the whole virus. The Covishield vaccine is targeted at only one protein of the virus,” Sehgal, head of the department of Life Sciences, Shiv Nadar University, Uttar Pradesh, told PTI.Covaxin, he explained, can produce antibodies against many epitopes, or many regions of the complete virus, while Covishield produces antibodies against only a specific region of the virus.“So even if there is a mutation in one region, there are antibodies being produced against other regions of the virus which will be effective in case of Covaxin,” he added.Covaxin is an "inactivated" vaccine developed by chemically treating novel coronavirus samples to make them incapable of reproduction. This process leaves the viral proteins, including the spike protein of the coronavirus which it uses to enter the human cells, intact.Covishield contains an engineered version of adenoviruses that infect chimpanzees to carry the gene responsible for the spike protein of the novel coronavirus.Adenoviruses are common viruses that typically cause mild cold or flu-like illnesses.Both the vaccines claim to have some efficacy against the UK variant.According to a yet-to-be published study on 26 participants, Covaxin was found to be effective against the UK variant, Bharat Biotech said in late January.Similarly, a study by Oxford University found that the ChAdOx1-nCoV19 vaccine, known as Covishield in India, was effective in tackling the UK variant.Immunologist Vineeta Bal noted that the UK variant had only one mutation that mattered and hence these results were not surprising.“While Bharat Biotech results were on a small number of samples to check inhibition against UK virus in the present evolving situation, this can be taken as adequate preliminary data,” Bal, from Pune’s Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), said.However, both the South African and Brazilian variants have many more mutations and hence significant decrease in efficacy may be seen, she said.“We do not have an answer for the efficacy against the new variants yet. I am sure efforts are on to test sera (blood) from vaccinated individuals for their ability to block the growth of new variants in the tissue culture system,” Bal told PTI.“For that the variant virus has to be available and also the testing facility. NIV, for example, has competence to do it and I am sure they are attempting to test,” she said, adding that no results are available in the public domain yet.Globally, 10 COVID-19 vaccines have been either approved by several countries or are under limited emergency use.New variants of coronavirus are emerging that are more infectious than the one that started the pandemic.UK government scientific advisers say the COVID-19 variant now predominant in the country may be 30-70 per cent more "deadly" than previous variants, underscoring concerns about how mutations may change the characteristics of the disease.A recent study suggests the vaccine co-developed by the American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and the German biotechnology company BioNTech can neutralise variants of the novel coronavirus that were first reported in the UK and South Africa.The research, published in the journal Nature Medicine, noted that the vaccine is effective against coronavirus variants carrying the N501Y and E484K mutations.In January, US biotechnology firm Moderna said lab studies showed its COVID-19 vaccine would remain protective against variants of the coronavirus first identified in the UK and South Africa.However, out of caution, the company will test adding a second booster of its vaccine -- to make three shots in total -- and has begun preclinical studies on a booster specifically for the South African variant.In the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, the messenger RNA -- or mRNA -- acts as a blueprint for the production of the coronavirus spike protein and is encapsulated by lipid molecules and delivered into human cells.mRNAs contain a blueprint for producing proteins in cellsBased on the reports rather than solid published data, it appears that rapid spread of these emerging variants would pose some risk to individuals who have recovered from earlier infection as well as those already vaccinated, Bal said.“In India we do not know how effectively testing, screening and quarantine is implemented for contacts and cases.“Depending upon that, spread can be curtailed with varying efficiency and hopefully serious spread will not happen and another round of lockdown will not be needed,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-data-indian-vaccines-efficacy-against-sa-brazilian-variants-scientists-101613566028358.html

The SKM is an umbrella body of farmers’ unions spearheading the agitation and holding talks with the Centre.2. The blockade will be the third major demonstration by the farmers as part of their agitation. Besides the January 26 tractor march, they held a nationwide ‘chakka jam’ on February 6.3. In view of the impending blockade, several trains have been diverted or cancelled in Punjab. Farmers in the state had blocked railway tracks last September, days after the laws were passed. Two months later, the protesters shifted their agitation to Delhi.Also Read | Railways cancels, diverts trains in Punjab amid rail roko call by farmer unions4. 20 additional companies of the Railway Protection Special Force (RPSF) have been deployed across the country, news agency PTI reported.

17-02-2021||India||'Don't have anger towards anybody': Rahul Gandhi on father Rajiv Gandhi's killers||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said that he still carries his father Rajiv Gandhi inside him. Interacting with a group of students in Puducherry, Gandhi said that violence cannot take anything from you.The response came after a student asked Gandhi how he feels about LTTE members who assassinated Rajiv Gandhi."I don’t have anger towards anybody. Of course, I lost my father and for me it was a difficult time. It's like someone has cut your heart out. I felt tremendous pain. But I don’t feel angry. I don’t feel any hatred. I forgive," the former Congress president said at the Bharathidasan College for Women."I still carry my father with me. Understand something - violence cannot take away anything from you. It doesn't have that power. You can give up something but violence cannot take anything from you. My father is alive. A lot of things you have heard today, they came to me from my father. So my father is talking through me. So it’s not that my father is not here today," Gandhi added.Rajiv Gandhi took over the charge of the Congress in 1984 following the assassination of his mother and then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. He became India’s youngest Prime Minister at the age of 40.Rajiv Gandhi served as the sixth PM of India. He was assassinated during an election rally in Tamil Nadu by a Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) suicide bomber in 1991.The suicide attack was carried out by Dhanu at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu on the fateful night of May 21, 1991 killing Rajiv Gandhi and 15 others on the spot. Dhanu perished in the bomb attack.During the course of investigations, pictures clicked by S Haribabu, an LTTE photographer who was also killed in the blast, exposed the role of Nalini Srihatan - a key team member in the LTTE plot to assassinate Gandhi - and others.Sriharan, along with six other people - her husband V Sriharan, Perarivalan, Santhan, Jayakumar, Robert Payas and P Ravichandran - were convicted in the case. They have been in prison for close to three decades.Though most parties supported the release of seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) had opposed it.Rahul Gandhi is in Puducherry amid a crisis where Congress party's government has come in minority. He earlier interacted with the fishermen community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-have-anger-towards-anybody-rahul-gandhi-on-father-s-killers-101613564025974.html
17-02-2021||India||Priests against Uttarakhand govt proposal to restrict Mahakumbh to a month||The priest community has objected to the Uttarakhand government proposal to curtail the four-month Mahakumbh to a month amid the Covid-19 pandemic.Local priests and even traders’ associations have vehemently opposed chief secretary Utpal Kumar’s recent statement about curtailing the Mahakumbh to just a month from April 1 to April 30. “There is confusion all around Mahakumbh due to the government’s changing statements over the mela duration. Local priests, traders are quite concerned and unhappy with the government attitude towards Kumbh,” said Ganga Sabha president Pradeep Jha. However, Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad (ABAP), the apex body of all the thirteen akhadas, is divided over this move with both president and general secretary making contradictory statements. ABAP president Mahant Narendra Giri said he has decided to raise the issue during a February 24-25 meeting of the parishad’s executive committee. Also Read | Agitators’ shower flowers on pilgrims in a unique way to protest Mahakumbh SOP“Earlier, the state government announced a grand Mahakumbh fair for 60 days. Later, director general of police Ashok Kumar remarked that a fair duration will be of 48 days. Now, again the state chief secretary has stated the fair will be further shortened to just a month. We will discuss this matter in Akhada Parishad meeting and then decide whether it is feasible or not,” he said. Another section of saints, led by Akhada Parishad general secretary Mahant Hari Giri, said in view of the new strain variants of England,Brazil, South Africa which are more transmissible, we need to adhere to government’s guidelines. “We need to look at the larger picture. A shorter and safer Kumbh is better than a grand yet unsafe one,” said Mahant Hari Giri. District Trader Association president Sunil Shetty has urged the state government to organise Mahakumbh along the lines of Magh Mela in Prayagraj. BJP ward councillor Anil Mishra questioned the state government and Kumbh Mela administration’s motive, saying why works worth crores of rupees are still being done for Kumbh when it will be held for only 30 days. “It is a wastage of money when pilgrims will be arriving in fewer numbers owing to strict guidelines,” he said. Meanwhile, Hindu Jagran Manch state president Krishan Singh Bora has announced a statewide protest on February 26 against Kumbh restrictions and its SOP. Saints are also concerned about March 11 Maha Shivratri festive bath which is a Shahi Snaan. Swami Rishishwaranand of Chetan Jyoti ashram pointed out that if Kumbh fair is notified from April 1 to April 30, then will Maha Shivratri festive bath not officially be a Shahi Snaan (Royal Bath)?. He said there are four Shahi Snaans falling in the March-April period, which are highly regarded, and most devotees arrive for these festive baths. The government should also clarify regarding this, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priests-against-uttarakhand-govt-proposal-to-restrict-mahakumbh-to-a-month-101613563083622.html

A documentary on the life history of KCR was also screened on the occasion.Yadav also presented a golden saree weighing 2.5 kgs to Goddess Yellamma at Balkampet on behalf of KCR’s daughter Kalvakuntla Kavitha. The golden saree, designed in Bengaluru, was donated by TRS leader Kuna Venkatesh Goud from Sanathnagar as an offering to the deity on the occasion of KCR’s birthday.Another TRS leader Balka Suman, who, too, in the past said KTR had all the qualities of replacing his father as the chief minister, said that KCR had all the qualities of becoming the Prime Minister of the country. “On his birthday, I wish KCR should give a new direction to the country,” he said.Birthday wishes for the chief minister also poured in from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and various leaders in the country and the state.The TRS leaders organised various other programmes including Mrutyunjaya, Navagraha and Anjaneya havans as well as Koti Kumkumarchana for the well-being of KCR and also for the welfare of the State.

His speech was translated by Narayanasamy.Also read | Rahul Gandhi reaches Puducherry as political crisis brewsGandhi then made a request to the fishermen, “Next time I come here I want to go with you in the fishing boat to see what you experience so that when I go back to Delhi, I can truly understand what farmers of Puducherry feel.”Answering a range of questions about the functioning of the media in the country to the role of electronic voting machines (EVM), Gandhi said that the EVM is a big issue and the media is not owned by poor people and is not interested in their issues.“The current government in Delhi has given ₹10 lakh crores of loan to the richest people in this country. During Covid ₹1.5 lakh crore was given to the richest people in this country as a gift. But when the labourers who are going back home, asked for a bus ticket or railway ticket they were not given,” Gandhi added, as he urged that poor people need to be more organised by themselves.“I will come next time for lunch,” the Congress leader said while parting, after many in the crowd asked him to join for lunch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-of-sea-rahul-gandhi-interacts-with-fishing-community-in-puducherry-101613557696597.html

17-02-2021||India||PFI says two of its men were abducted and arrested by UP’s STF||The Popular Front of India (PFI), a radical outfit, on Wednesday said two of its workers arrested by the Uttar Pradesh police in connection with alleged terror activities were innocent and they were abducted by UP’s Special Task Force (STF) while they were going to West Bengal for poll-related work.The STF claimed that the two men from Kerala - Ansad Baharuddin and Firoz Khan - were planning a series of bomb attacks in UP and seized improvised explosive devices from them. It also said they were on a mission to train local youth and had prepared a list of top Hindu functionaries to attack them.The PFI rejected this claim and said STF was planning to implement the agenda of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).“They were missing for the last three days and their relatives had filed complaints with the police in Kozhikode and Pandalam. They were on their way to West Bengal in connection with upcoming elections and were abducted by the STF along the Bihar-Bengal border,” said PFI’s national secretary Nasaruddin Elamaram in Kozhikode (north Kerala).He said there was a concerted campaign to portray the PFI in a bad light for opposing the RSS agenda and the latest incident was part of it. “The STF is playing into the hands of the RSS. The seized materials were planted. We will approach the court against their illegal detention,” he said.Last week UP police had taken Campus Front of India, PFI student wing, national secretary Rauf Sharief to Mathura in connection with a complaint regarding an alleged move to incite unrest in Hathras last October following the death of a young Dalit woman after gang rape.Central agencies had also raided offices and houses of many PFI leaders including Nasaruddin Elamaram. The UP police had alleged that Rauf Sharief bore travel expenses of Kerala journalist Siddique Kappan and three others who were arrested in October on charges of planning to incite unrest in Hathras.On Monday, the Supreme Court allowed a five-day bail to Kappan to meet his ailing mother.The latest arrest of the two PFI came at a time when many BJP-ruled states have sought a ban on the organisation. The PFI is considered an offshoot of the banned Students’ Islamic Front of India (SIMI). Many of its leaders were members of the SIMI.The PFI describes itself as a social movement committed to empower people belonging to the minority communities, Dalits and other weaker sections of the society.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pfi-says-two-of-its-men-were-abducted-and-arrested-by-up-s-stf-101613555712182.html

Sometimes even the victim does not understand as to what is happening. Despite going through extreme cruelty, the they chose to stay quiet," the court said.The court accepted the contention that Akbar was not a man of stellar and impeccable reputation and pointed out that right of reputation can't be weighed over the right of the life of a woman.It regretted the absence of laws to protect survivors of sexual harassment when the incident had happened. "Prior to the issuance of the Vishaka guidelines by the Supreme Court, they (survivors) did not have the option to lodge the complaint of sexual harassment due to social stigma,” the court ruled.In 2018, Ramani had made allegation of sexual misconduct against Akbar in the wake of #Metoo movement. According to the former journalist, in December 1993, Akbar sexually harassed her when she was called to a Mumbai hotel for a job interview.The allegations against Akbar had forced him to resign from the Union Cabinet on October 17, 2018.

As emissions, traffic accidents and inefficient traffic flows characterise more and more of the world's major cities, the hack aims to develop solutions to these problems," said Klas Molin, Ambassador of Sweden to India."It's very encouraging to see that several Indian organisations and companies have joined the hackathon as partners," Molin said.Anna Lekvall, Consul General of Sweden in Mumbai, added, “Innovation is at the heart of the Sweden India relationship, and safe, sustainable transport has grown immensely as a vital new area of co-operation.""The Sweden-India Mobility Hackathon is expanding this partnership, providing a strong platform for students, start-ups, companies, experts from the two countries to co-create new solutions for mobility. Together, we can change the way we move,” Lekvall added.According to the statement, the theme of the hackathon has a strong connection to the "joint innovation partnership" that exists between India and Sweden and the Sweden-India Transport Safety and Innovation Platform (SITIS), which was launched in February last year.The event is supported by several Swedish and Indian partners including startups, incubators, research institutes, innovation cells, road safety organisations and companies in sectors of sustainability, automotives and transport, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-sweden-to-host-42-hour-digital-hackathon-to-tackle-traffic-issues-101613553296157.html

17-02-2021||India||Digital transactions helped reduce corruption: PM Modi at Nasscom event||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday lauded the work done in the digital sector by the government, which, he said, reduced corruption during the procurement and tendering process for infrastructure and housing projects. “People used to raise all kinds of questions about the government’s procurement process for various projects,” Modi said. “We too raised concerns; everyone had heard of similar problems. But now, we use the transparent system, the government’s e-market place or GEM, which has enabled us to invite tenders online.”The Prime Minister was speaking at the National Technology and Futuristic Forum organised by Nasscom.“Due to some reasons, the large domestic market of India could not be used by the IT industry,” he said. “The digital divide in the country kept increasing because of this. In a sense it was a period of ‘diva tale andhera’ [darkness under a lamp]. Our government has changed this. The government has lifted unnecessary restrictions on the tech industry.” Also Read | India invites Pakistan to virtual SAARC meet on Covid-19Modi added that geo-tagging of projects was being done to ensure timely completion and technology was being leveraged to provide fast, precise and futuristic solutions to all sections of society.“Digital India has connected the ordinary citizen to the government,” he said. “We have also democratised data. Online delivery of services has helped the lower and middle classes find relief from corruption.”He added that India has moved from being a heavily cash dependent economy to one that uses digital transactions. “The more digital transactions happen, the more we reduce the prevalence of black money.” The PM also stressed transparency as the building block of minimum government and maximum governance. “The government has moved from its registers to the dashboard. The attempt is that whatever the government does should be accessible to the ordinary citizen on their phones.” Modi also mentioned that the government was mapping villages using drones and reducing human involvement in the tax filing process. He urged entrepreneurs to move from Make In India to Make for India. “Use your CSR (corporate social responsibility) funds to provide education to children who do not have access such facilities.”He added that innovation was needed, especially in the space of agriculture and health. “India needs mentors,” he said. “To become a global leader, India’s IT sector needs to focus on a culture of excellence and institution building.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/digital-transactions-helped-reduce-corruption-pm-modi-at-nasscom-event-101613553721190.html

17-02-2021||India||India pushing ahead with key Kaladan transit project in Myanmar||India is pushing ahead with the Kaladan transit project in Myanmar’s Rakhine state as it is seen as key to improving connectivity with the landlocked northeastern states and creating conditions to facilitate the repatriation of Rohingya refugees.The Kaladan multi-modal transit transport project, being implemented with an Indian grant of $484 million, includes development of Sittwe port in Myanmar, an inland water terminal at Paletwa on the Kaladan river and creating road connectivity from Paletwa to Zorinpui in Mizoram.The project has been hit by delays due to work being affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and the threat posed by rebels of the Arakan Army, which has targeted the shipment of materials for the infrastructure project and attacked Myanmar troops providing security to the venture.During a visit by foreign secretary Harsh Shringla and Indian Army chief Gen MM Naravane to Myanmar last October, both sides discussed the operationalisation of Sittwe port in the first quarter of 2021. Despite questions raised by the military coup in Myanmar, recent remarks by external affairs minister S Jaishankar indicated the project is on track.Also Read | Myanmar’s Suu Kyi faces new charge as crackdown intensifies“The Kaladan multi-modal transport link, including the Sittwe port and the Paletwa inland water terminal, will add to our access to the Myanmar coastline,” Jaishankar said during an address in Guwahati on Monday.The project is aimed at enhancing access to the sea for the seven northeastern states, which are currently dependent on ports in Bangladesh. Access to a port in Myanmar will shorten the distance for transporting heavy cargo for northeastern states such as Manipur and Mizoram, which share borders with Myanmar.The Indian government is also keen on the project as it believes it will boost economic development in Rakhine state and create the grounds for the return of Rohingya refugees currently sheltering in Bangladesh. India, which has often been nudged by Bangladesh to help facilitate the repatriation of the refugees, believes the best course for it in this matter is to create conditions in Rakhine for the safe and sustainable return of the Rohingyas, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.Another reason for India’s push for the Kaladan project is to counter China’s plans to create the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC) centred round a deep-water port at Kyaukpyu in Rakhine state.The people said one of the crucial portions of the Kaladan project, which has faced several delays, is the construction of a 109-km road from Zorinpui in Mizoram to Paletwa in Myanmar. This work is expected to take some more time, the people said.The parliamentary committee on external affairs, in a recent report, expressed concern that current allocation of funds for Myanmar was “not congruent with the ongoing strategic projects” such as the Kaladan project. The committee also called on the external affairs ministry to take adequate steps to ensure the allocations are used optimally for completing ongoing projects.The ministry, in its reply to the committee, said the status of the road segment of the Kaladan project is being closely monitored along with the department of heavy industries, the parent department of Engineering Project (India) Limited that is part of the joint venture implementing the project. India’s budget for 2021-22 included an outlay of ₹400 crore as grants and loans for Myanmar.Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said the Kaladan project will improve connectivity by facilitating the shipment of cargo from India’s eastern ports to Myanmar and to the northeastern states.“The essential idea is to provide the northeast with quick access to the sea via Myanmar and also to help boost exports from the northeastern states,” said Bhatia, who served as India’s envoy to Myanmar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-pushing-ahead-with-key-transit-project-in-myanmar-101613551020873.html
17-02-2021||India||Bihar to unveil ethanol production incentive policy soon to woo big investors||The Bihar government will soon unveil an incentive policy to attract investment to set up ethanol plants with easy availability of land and raw materials in the next one month, a top official said on Wednesday.“The policy will be aimed to attract investment for production of ethanol from molasses, sugarcane, maize and cereals. It will cover all aspects so that setting up of plants is easy. It will come up in the next one month or so,” said additional chief secretary (industry department) Brijesh Mehrohtra.In December last year, Union minister for MSME and road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari in an interaction with chief minister Nitish Kumar had asked the state government to boost production of ethanol promising the Centre would help in purchasing it. Based on Gadkari’s assurance, the state government has been working on the new incentive policy.A few days back there were discussions between industry minister Syed Shahnawaz Hussain and sugarcane industry minister Pramod Kumar on promoting ethanol production in the state with better co-ordination among the two departments and other agencies concerned.In Bihar, the production of ethanol is still low. Most of the organic chemical is produced by distilleries in Gopalganj and Jandaha in Vaishali district. Ethanol is widely used in alcohol production and now increasingly in motor fuel.Officials said the production in these distilleries is 65-75 kilo litre per day and the supplies are given to various oil companies.Officials said the new incentive policy would be in sync with the Bihar Industrial Investment Policy, 2016 where there are provisions of easy clearance of projects, land availability and tax reliefs for investors.“We are looking to attract investment for producing ethanol from maize and even rice which has high production in the state. It will help the sugarcane sector and also help farmers to get better prices for their produce be it sugarcane or maize,” said one official in the industry department.The state government had tried to raise production of ethanol to boost industrialisation and give fillip to the sugarcane sector from 2006 onwards but the initiatives did not attract much investors owing to certain conditions laid down by the Centre that only sugar factories can produce ethanol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-to-unveil-ethanol-production-incentive-policy-soon-to-woo-big-investors-101613549650808.html

Addressing a NASSCOM event, PM Modi urged the IT industry veterans to look for talent in smaller cities of the country."India is not short of ideas, it needs mentors to turn those ideas into realities," the Prime Minister said during the address via video conferencing."There are many young innovators in smaller cities, they want your support. Government is planning to build infrastructure in tier 2 cities, to help all of you," he added.He then lauded the efforts of the country's IT sector during the Covid-19 crisis. "At a time when every sector was affected due to Corona, you achieved a two per cent growth. It's commendable if India's IT industry adds 4 billion dollars to its revenue at a time when suspicions of de-growth were being cast," said PM Modi.The Prime Minister then asked those present at the event to create world-class products "that will set the global benchmark on excellence". "There can be no compromise on these goals. Without them, we will also be a follower and not a global leader," said PM Modi.The markets in tier 2 cities - outside the metro cities - have picked up fast in the last few years. The incentives were introduced by the Modi government during its first term.These incentives include tax rebates and government's push for affordable housing to attract companies and people.Another factor that has worked for the smaller cities is that, as the gaps in infrastructure and lifestyle have narrowed, businesses have moved in, drawing migrant professionals, creating a melting pot culture that is more cosmopolitan and urban, and eventually drawing people back home to those cities from prime metros.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-not-short-of-ideas-needs-mentoring-pm-modi-on-developing-tier-2-cities-101613549956099.html
17-02-2021||India||Lingaraj temple priests cite threat to Shivratri as Odisha temple war escalates||The political battle between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) over the temple beautification drive intensified on Tuesday. The priests of the 11th century Lingaraj temple, backed by the BJD, claimed that the draft bylaw for the 13th century Vaishnavite temple Ananta Basudeva, issued by a Central agency, will hinder Shivaratri festival at the Lingaraj temple."The draft bylaws of the Ananta Basudeva temple are an outcome of the difference of opinion between the BJP and the BJD. If the government doesn’t roll back the draft regulations with immediate effect, it may have an impact on the upcoming Shivaratri rituals. Political game over the matter is playing spoilsport in the development of the temple," said Biranchi Pati, secretary of Brahmana Nijog, one of the most powerful bodies of priests of Lingaraj temple. His contention was similar to what Odisha chief secretary Suresh Mohapatra said in his letter to the Union culture secretary on Monday.Last month, the National Monument Authority or the NMA, under the Union culture ministry issued draft bylaws for Jagannath temple of Puri, and Ananta Basudeva and Brahmeswar temples of Bhubaneswar under the provisions of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010. As per the draft bylaws, construction activities are prohibited within the first 100 metre radius of the monument and are regulated within the next 200 metres. The draft bylaws, however, are in conflict with the Odisha government's proposed temple beautification drive in Puri and Bhubaneswar.In his letter to Centre, the Odisha chief secretary demanded withdrawal of the draft bylaws of Ananta Basudeva temple citing apprehensions of a widespread agitation leading to disturbance in religious rituals. "The kind of atmosphere in temples is bound to hurt the religious sentiments of lakhs of devotees. It is important to have a peaceful atmosphere for conducting the annual Maha Shivratri festival in which a large number of devotees from all over the state participate," the chief secretary wrote, referring to the possible impact of the bylaws on the Lingaraj temple, situated less than 100 metres from the Ananta Basudeva temple.However, Bhubaneswar BJP MP Aparajita Sarangi accused the Naveen Patnaik government of misleading the people since construction in the close vicinity of monuments protected by the Archaeological Society of India is already banned under the existing Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010. She also alleged that the draft bylaws in contention could not have been formulated without the knowledge of the director of the culture department of Odisha.Early this month, Union minister for petroleum and natural gas and senior BJP leader Dharmendra Pradhan wrote to Union culture minister Prahallad Singh Patel requesting him to send an expert team from the ASI in Delhi to carry out a detailed study and thorough scientific excavation of the area around Lingaraj temple, which is being developed by the Odisha government. Soon after, a team of BJP leaders visited the site and demanded a halt to the ongoing work in the region till the entire area surrounding the complex is excavated.Also Read: Odisha: Devotee donates over 4 kg gold, 3 kg silver to Puri Jagannath TemplePolitical analysts said the sparring between the BJD and the BJP over the NMA draft bylaws showed religion was going to be an important issue in the forthcoming polls in Odisha. "The BJP is aware that the BJD is trying to snatch its religious card through development of old temples in a deeply religious state like Odisha. So the NMA draft bylaws on heritage temples may have come as a blessing for the BJP as the party can now challenge the BJD's temple development plank. But how much can the BJP counter the BJD's plan is not easy to predict," said political science professor Gyana Ranjan Swain of GM University in Sambalpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lingaraj-temple-priests-cite-threat-to-shivratri-as-odisha-temple-war-escalates-101613549430866.html

He also lauded the solutions given by tech experts which he said served as an inspiration to the world during Covid-19 crisis.He then talked about the various initiatives taken by the government in liberalising various sectors, most recent being the mapping sector. The government on Monday liberalised regulations on geospatial data and maps to achieve a $5 trillion economy and the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat or self-reliant India."In a major move, policies regarding mapping and geospatial data have been liberalised for the industry. This step will empower our tech start-up eco-system and the mission of Aatmanirbhar Bharat," PM Modi said while addressing the National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM)'s Technology and Leadership Forum (NTLF) via video conferencing."The biggest consideration on geospatial regulations was on security. India is more confident nation now which can be seen on our borders," he added.The Prime Minister said that whether it's projects related to infrastructure, or houses of the poor, everything is being geo-tagged so that projects can be completed on time."Technology has empowered the regular citizen in the country and connected him with the government. We've democratised data as well and last-mile service delivery has also been effective," PM Modi said.Under the new policy, geospatial data from government agencies such as the Survey of India and the Indian Space Research Organisation will also be made available to public and private companies.After the liberalisation of regulations on geospatial data, private companies can now conduct surveying and mapping without prior approvals and share the data for various everyday applications, from logistics and transport to road safety and e-commerce.The new guidelines will allow an increase in the scale, speed, and accuracy of mapping.The government estimates that the new guidelines will boost the geospatial data sector to a value of ₹1 lakh crore and create jobs for 2.2 million people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-nasscom-event-pm-modi-spotlights-new-mapping-policy-says-biggest-consideration-was-on-security-101613548278293.html

Jacob approached the HC after the Delhi cyber crime unit raided her residence on February 11 and seized her computer and phone in connection with the toolkit which was allegedly authored by her and Disha Ravi, an activist from Bengaluru. Also Read | Toolkit case: Bombay HC grants transit anticipatory bail to Shantanu MulukAnother activist from Beed, Shantanu Muluk, who had applied for transit anticipatory bail before the Aurangabad bench of the HC, was granted the same for a period of ten days on Tuesday. The single bench of justice PD Naik held that Jacob had no religious or political intent to incite violence and she apprehended arrest which was corroborated by the fact that a NBW was issued against her.The court also referred to the order of justice Vibha Kankanwadi that was passed in Muluk’s application on Tuesday and said that similar reliefs had been sought by Muluk as well and the same were granted.The bench of justice Vibha Kankanwadi while granting bail to Shantanu Muluk in her order passed on Tuesday had observed that apprehension of arrest was the key factor, that is, required to be considered in such applications and as Muluk was seeking limited protection to enable him to approach the competent court or officer, the HC was competent to grant the same. Justice Naik said Jacob had been interrogated after which she was apprehensive of being arrested hence approached HC seeking relief to go to Delhi to approach the appropriate court. In light of this and the fact that the issue of transit anticipatory bail was pending but still the same was granted by other courts, the court granted protection to Jacob for three weeks and in the event of an arrest, she was to be released on a personal bond of ₹25,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/toolkit-case-hc-grants-nikita-jacob-transit-bail-for-three-weeks-101613546400689.html

17-02-2021||India||SC seeks Centre’s response on system to avert air crash on table top runways||The Supreme Court on Tuesday sought Centre’s response to a petition seeking installation of an advanced technological system at vulnerable airports to prevent aircrafts from overshooting runways. The petition cited the example of the United States where over a dozen aircraft accidents could be prevented due to the technology, as per the court documents.“A crash is something horrible. To see people trapped in the aircraft is a terrible sight to watch,” The SC bench observed while asking the Centre not to view this petition as ‘adversarial’ but to respond positively to the concern raised in it.“This technology (EMAS) has been installed in approximately more than 125 airports across the world, with more than 100 in the United States itself. The installation of Engineered Material Arresting System or EMAS would not only have saved hundreds of lives but would have also saved crores of rupees in aircraft equipment. There are at least 15 incidents in the United States, where the EMAS has come into play and prevented accidents,” the petition filed by advocate Shohit Chaudhry said.Last year, an airplane fell into a valley from a table-top runway at the Calicut airport, causing several deaths and injuries. A similar and more deadly crash took place at the Mangalore airport, another table-top runway, in 2010. Citing these two accidents, public interest litigation (PIL) filed by a retired mechanical engineer Rajen Mehta, questioned why the Centre could not install a technology similar to the Engineered Material Arresting System (EMAS) used in 125 airports across the world.Earlier in September last year, the Supreme Court issued a notice to the Centre and the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Mehta’s petition but there was no response.“We have seen the issues raised in the petition and will respond to it,” said additional solicitor general (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati.The EMAS works as an “arrestor bed” which uses crushable material placed at the end of a runway to stop an aircraft that overruns the runway. This crushable material generally consists of concrete blocks and can reduce the 1000 feet runway end safety area (RESA) requirement to 600 feet or less. The wheels of the plane dig into the concrete resulting in a controlled deceleration that brings the airplane to a smooth halt within a predetermined distance. “This minimizes or virtually eliminates the potential for aircraft nose gear collapse and injury to passengers and crew,” the petition stated.Also Read: SC seeks Centre’s response over priority Covid vaccination for judges, lawyersThe petitioner, an 85-year-old engineer retired from a company that globally supplied the EMAS system to airports, pointed out that the government had initially planned to install the EMAS technology at Calicut and later at Mangalore runways, which could have averted the accidents.The petition claims that in 2008, the Calicut EMAS project was shelved citing economic crisis. Two years later, after the Mangalore crash, the inquiry committee probing the crash recommended installation of the EMAS on the runway overshoot areas. Yet, no action has been taken on the recommendation till date, it said.The SC bench, comprising Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde and justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian posted the petition after two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-centre-s-response-on-system-to-avert-air-crash-on-table-top-runways-101613543072288.html

On a previous occasion but he did not appear despite being summoned.The ED wants to question him in connection with business dealings, if any, with Sarnaik’s son Vihang Sarnaik, who is reportedly a close friend of Jain. The directorate claims it has come across several communications between the two. The investigators had also searched Jain's premises in the past. But the agency later stopped the searches following the death of Jain's uncle Rajiv Kapoor.Vihang and his father Pratap Sarnaik were previously questioned by ED in the case.The ED had earlier arrested Sarnaik's close associate Amit Chandole and TopsGrup Security Services Limited (TGSSL) managing director M Shashidharan in the cae where TopsGrup had allegedly bagged contracts from MMRDA in collusion with Sarnaik through illegal means. These illegal manoeuvres aimed to get undue benefit by inflating bills at the cost of MMRDA and illegal cash gratification to Sarnaik for facilitating this scam. Sarnaik used to get 50% of the profit earned of the said contract through Chandole, the ED had claimed.It said that in 2014, a contract was signed by TGSSL with MMRDA under which 350 to 500 guards were to be deployed at MMRDA sites monthly. Out of the same, only 70% of guards were deployed. However, the billing was done for all the guards as per the contract and the wage details were submitted to MMRDA for 100% of the contract vałue.Mumbai police's economic offence wing (EOW) is also probing cross complaints of TopsGrup chairman Rahul Nanda and his former employee Ramesh Iyer (the complainant in the ED's case). Nanda has alleged that Iyer and other employees siphoned off the company's money, while Iyer claimed that Nanda, through his company, indulged in massive misconduct and financial irregularities worth ₹175 crore.On Tuesday the agency also recorded the statement of Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) commissioner RA Rajeev, who said that MMRDA has not given clean chit to anyone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/armaan-jain-reaches-ed-office-for-questioning-in-topsgrup-money-laundering-case-101613541514867.html

This Brazilian and South African variant virus has the capacity to easily enter the lungs,” said Dr Balram Bhargava, director general, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).Last year, the centre had created the Indian Sars-CoV-2 Genomic Consortium (INSACOG) of 10 advanced laboratories based at the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Union ministry of health and family welfare, as part of sentinel surveillance measures taken for early detection of variants of concern of Sars-CoV-2 that may have caused clustering, high mortality etc.“Fortunately, there has been no increase in mortality,” said Dr Bhargava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/risk-of-covid-19-spread-during-ongoing-wedding-season-say-experts-101613541960625.html

17-02-2021||India||Telangana MP A Revanth Reddy's padayatra exposes Congress fault lines||The 10-day-long padayatra or foot-march campaign by Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee working president and party MP A Revanth Reddy ended on Tuesday, exposing serious differences in the state unit of the party, said leaders aware of the developments.Reddy’s padayatra-- The Rythu Bharosa Yatra or the march supporting farmers seeking the withdrawal of the controversial farm-reform laws ended at Tukkuguda on the outskirts of Hyderabad, from where he took out a tractor rally up to Raviryala, where a public meeting was held in the evening. However, several senior leaders of the Telangana Congress didn’t attend the programme as they were reportedly under instruction from the Pradesh Congress Committee president to boycott it, said a party leader, who didn’t wish to be named.“How can he decide on taking out the padayatra without even informing the state party leadership or the high command in Delhi?” the leader said, quoting the PCC chief.Reddy’s padyatra began after a rally of farmers at Achampet in Nagarkurnool district on February 7. Reddy, who represents Malkajgiri parliamentary constituency, walked through Nagarkurnool, Mahabubnagar and Ranga Reddy districts covering a distance of 130 km before reaching Tukkuguda.Pradesh Congress Committee president N Uttam Kumar Reddy and Congress Legislature Party leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka stayed away from the public meeting organised at Raviryal for the grand culmination of Reddy’s march. All India Congress Committee in-charge of Telangana, Manickam Tagore too, dropped out at the last moment under pressure from the PCC leadership, the Congress leader quoted above said.The boycott call was apparently given since Reddy’s rally did not have the permission from the high command.Revanth Reddy is seen as one of the front-runners for the PCC chief post ever since Uttam Kumar Reddy offered to step down after the party’s poor show in the GHMC elections in December last.Though majority of the party leaders have extended support to Revanth Reddy as the next PCC chief, several senior leaders opposed saying he was relatively a new-comer to the party – Reddy joined the Congress in 2017. Veteran Congress leader and ex-MP V Hanumanth Rao even threatened to resign if Revanth Reddy was made the PCC chief, said a senior Congress leader.Also Read: Cong MP Reddy says BJP implementing East India Company modelDespite the boycott by the seniors, many Congress leaders attended the rally on Tuesday. They include former ministers Mohd Ali Shabbir, Konda Surekha and S Rajaiah, ex-MPs Balaram Naik, Mallu Ravi and Suresh Shetkar, PCC working presidents Kusuma Kumar and Ponnam Prabhakar and MLA D Sitakka, besides several ex-MLAs and party office-bearers.AICC spokesperson Dasoju Sravan, who also attended the rally, said there was no need for taking permission from the high command for such padayatra and rallies, as was demanded by certain seniors. “You don’t need to take permission to kill a serpent. It has to be done instantaneously. Revanth Reddy did the same. Such efforts would only strengthen the party,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-mp-a-revanth-reddy-s-padayatra-exposes-congress-fault-lines-101613540501934.html

17-02-2021||India||SC denies registering suo motu contempt against Rajdeep Sardesai||The Supreme Court late on Tuesday clarified that a suo motu criminal contempt petition was inadvertently listed on its website against journalist Rajdeep Sardesai and the process was on to rectify it.This case was registered over Sardesai’s tweets criticising the apex court’s decision against activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan last year, despite attorney general KK Venugopal denying permission to initiate contempt over the same tweets five months ago.“This is in context with news item being flashed in some news channels about initiating suo motu criminal contempt proceeding against Mr. Rajdeep Sardesai by Supreme court, it is made clear that no such proceeding has been initiated against Mr. Rajdeep Sardesai. However status shown at Supreme Court website vide case no. SMC (Crl) 02/2021 has been placed inadvertently. Appropriate action to rectify the same is under process,” the court said in a statement.Also Read | Centre’s charges of rioting, sedition against journalists are not correct: Shiv SenaThe website showed that a petition by law student Aastha Khurana was converted into a suo motu (on its own) criminal contempt plea on February 13 and the Supreme Court registry informed Khurana’s lawyer Omprakash Ajitsingh Parihar of the development on Tuesday. No date was indicated for hearing the petition.Parihar questioned how such an error could take place. “We received the message from the Supreme Court about the listing of our case and even the website is showing so.”The petition filed by Khurana alleged that Sardesai’s comments will cause disrespect to the Supreme Court in the minds of citizens.“Alleged contemnor being an Indian news anchor is a well-known personality and various people take his statement as true and correct, therefore his statement on the top judicial body of this country indicates a threat to the society which will lead to no trust on the judiciary,” the petition read.When contacted, Sardesai on Tuesday said he did not wish to comment at this stage.The offence of criminal contempt carries a punishment of up to six months in prison or a fine up to ₹2,000 or both.The law student first filed the contempt plea under Article 129 of the Constitution on September 21. At the time, Venugopal refused consent to initiate contempt, calling his tweets “trifling remarks”.“The reputation of the Supreme Court as one of the great pillars of our democracy has been built assiduously over the last 70 years. Trifling remarks and mere passing criticism though perhaps distasteful are unlikely to tarnish the image of the institution,” Venugopal wrote in his response to the petition last year.The tweets by Sardesai were not of a serious nature so as to undermine the majesty of the court or lower its stature in the minds of the public, the Centre’s top law officer said.Under section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act and Rule 3 of Rules to Regulate Proceedings for Contempt of Supreme Court, the consent of the AG or the solicitor general is required before the apex court can hear a criminal contempt petition filed by a private individual.In her petition, Khurana included tweets by Sardesai criticising the top court’s decision to convict Bhushan for contempt and impose a fine of Re 1.The first tweet by Sardesai, as quoted in the petition, said, “Prashant Bhushan held guilty of contempt by Supreme Court, sentence to be pronounced on August 20. This even as habeas corpus petitions of those detained in Kashmir for more than a year remain pending.”The second tweet, as per the petition, said, “Re 1 token fine imposed by SC on Prashant Bhushan in contempt case. If he doesn’t pay it, then 3 months jail sentence. Clearly, court looking to wriggle out of an embarrassment of its own making.”Khurana referred to older tweets by Sardesai on former top court judge Arun Mishra, who headed the bench hearing the Bhushan case, She also reproduced an earlier tweet against former Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi.“All these actions of the alleged contemnor clearly show that he has no respect towards the Supreme Court of India and he is trying to defame this court by doing such type of tweets,” the petition read.On August 31, the SC directed Bhushan to pay a fine of Re 1 for two tweets against the CJI and the apex court. “It is not expected of a person who is a part of the system of administration of justice and who owes a duty to the said system, to make such tweets which are capable of shaking the confidence of general public,” the judgment read.Venugopal, who appeared in his personal capacity at the court’s request, asked the court not to punish Bhushan and let him off with a reprimand. That case was also registered suo motu by the top court on a petition that didn’t have the consent of the attorney general.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-denies-registering-suo-moto-contempt-against-rajdeep-sardesai-101613538720455.html

But whatever these groups of citizens do culminates in the judicial system. Lawyers, judges, staff employed with courts and lawyers should be given priority in administration of the vaccine,” argued Amit Khemka, the petitioner’s counsel.The petition filed by a lawyer, Arvind Singh, equated judges, lawyers, court staff and the staff employed by lawyers as frontline workers rendering essential services of administering justice even during the difficult times of Covid-19 pandemic. The petitioner said that the government has identified certain groups of citizens as deserving of the vaccine in the first round, leaving out the essential services being performed by the judicial system.The petition was drawn by advocate Rishi Sehgal, who said, “despite forming part of ‘essential services’, working continuously and discharging their respective duties towards the constitutional framework of India even during the times of this deadly Covid-19, the Judges, court staff, lawyers and their staff do not find mention in the priority group identified by the respondents for administration of vaccine.”Also Read: GST evasion case: Let's try not to put everyone in jail, says Supreme CourtIt was on December 28 last year that the government came out with the “Covid-19 Vaccines Operational Guidelines” laying out the mechanism for the rollout of vaccination across the country.

He was honoured in a simple event in Imphal on Tuesday.“We appreciate that Dr Singh has earnestly dedicated himself to deepening the bonds between Japan and Manipur. During his tenure from 2012 to 2017 as president of Manipur Tourism Forum (MTF), Japan and Manipur rediscovered each other and got even closer, going beyond our historical ties,” said a statement from Japanese ambassador Suzuki Satoshi, read out by Japanese embassy counselor Kajita Takuma.Dr Dhabali was involved in organising the commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Imphal in 2014, an event attended by dignitaries from Japan, Britain and Australia.Later with support from the Sasakawa Peace Foundation and the Nippon Foundation of Japan, the Imphal Peace Movement (IPM) was launched on June 22 in 2019, which, Ambassador of Japan termed as ‘another symbolic achievement’. The MTF played an important role in giving shape to IPM during Dr Dhabali’s tenure as its president.The decoration was constituted by Japanese Emperor Meiji in 1875. It is one of the highest orders conferred in the name of his majesty the emperor, by the government of Japan to non-military and apolitical persons, who have made distinguished achievements in international relations, promotion of Japanese culture, achievements in their respective field, development in welfare or preservation of the environment.The highest Japanese order, the Order of the Chrysanthemum, is reserved for heads of state or royalty, while the second highest order, the Order of the Paulownia Flowers, is mostly reserved for politicians.Dr Dhabali thanked everyone particularly the members of MTF and the Second World War Imphal Campaign Foundation (ICF) who had been instrumental in providing a definite direction to the promotion of tourism between the two countries.Also Read: Manipur's iconic women-run market reopens after nearly 11 months“Words truly fail to express how humbled I feel for the acknowledgement of what I still consider to be a small contribution.

17-02-2021||India||Temple in Srinagar closed due to militancy reopens after 31 years on Panchami||A temple in Srinagar, which closed its doors for devotees 31 years ago due to militancy and outmigration of Hindus, was reopened on the auspicious occasion of Basant Panchami.Shital Nath Temple located in the Habba Kadal area of Srinagar reopened on Tuesday. A special 'pooja' was also performed by devotees at the temple.Santosh Razadan, a devotee who came to offer prayers at the temple, said that they received huge support from locals especially those from the Muslim community for the reopening of the temple."Shital Nath temple reopened after 31 years. People used to come here before to offer prayers but it was closed due to militancy. Hindus residing near the temple had also left. Locals mostly belonging to the Muslim community helped us," she told ANI.Ravinder Razdan, one of the organisers of the pooja conducted at Shital Nath temple, said people from the Muslim community provided much-needed support to us in this initiative and they even came forward to clean the temple."Our Mulsim brother and sisters brought pooja items. We used to do this pooja every year. Baba Sheetal Nath Bhairao's birth anniversary falls on Basant Pachmit that is why we celebrate this day with fervour," Razdan said.Terrorist violence cases and stone-pelting incidents have dropped in Jammu and Kashmir following the abrogation of Article 370 in August 2019 that gave special status to the erstwhile state. Jammu and Kashmir was also bifurcated into two union territories- Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.On February 8, Union Minister of State Home Affairs G Kishan Reddy had informed Rajya Sabha that the number of terrorist violence cases and stone-pelting incidents in Jammu and Kashmir have reduced drastically in 2020 in comparison to 2019. "A total of 157 terrorists were neutralised in 2019 and 221 were eliminated in 2020. There were 594 cases of terrorist violence in 2019, which reduced to 244 in 2020. There were 327 stone pelting incidents in 2020 as compared to 2,009 such incidents in 2019," he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/temple-in-srinagar-closed-due-to-militancy-reopens-after-31-years-on-panchami-101613525586752.html
17-02-2021||India||PLA preps for Round 2 of disengagement, parks heavy vehicles in depth areas||Indian military planners point to the presence of large number of tank transporters at area headquarters of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) at Rudok and Xiadullah across Rezang La and Karakoram Pass respectively as an indication that the Chinese Army has plans to move armour from the East Ladakh front lines to depth areas in Xinjiang and Tibet — part of the disengagement along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh that ends a 10-month standoff between PLA and the Indian Army.“All I can say is that the disengagement process is moving on well, though the date of next meeting of military commanders is yet to be decided,” said a senior Indian official who asked not to be named. The military commanders of the two countries have met nine times to facilitate the disengagement, although the breakthrough is recent.The withdrawal spans several friction areas along LAC. The scale of the withdrawal, the planners said, shows the extent to which Beijing had built up its military presence in the area.Analysts said a combination of smart manoeuvring by Indian troops, resolve from New Delhi, and non-military pressure brought to bear on Beijing on both the diplomatic and economic fronts. While the Northern Command of Indian Army on Tuesday released pictures to confirm withdrawal of armour by both sides, there is evidence of the presence of around 28 tank transporters on the southern banks of Spanggur Tso, near Rezang La ridgeline, to ferry armour from the front-line to the depth areas, the people cited in the first instance added. Spanggur Tso, a bitter water lake, houses the Moldo garrison of PLA on its banks. Although the PLA withdrawal is on track, Beijing’s decision to suddenly restore status quo ante on both banks of Pangong Tso has baffled many within the Indian security establishment.While a section of national security planners believes that this withdrawal is tactical and driven by internal considerations, others believe that Beijing acted to stem the rapid slide in bilateral relations. However, one thing on which both agree is that China will have to be watched very carefully for the remaining part of the year before coming to any conclusion.Since February 10, there has been intense activity between finger 4 and finger 7 mountainous spurs on the north banks of Pangong Tso with no less than 25 vehicles, 10-12 tanks and 14 tents being seen at Srijap complex, east of finger 8 of the lake.Watch: Indian & Chinese troops disengage from Pangong lake area in LadakhAt Rudog, which has been PLA headquarters since the 1962 war and is situated 63 kilometres diametrically opposite Rezang La in occupied Aksai Chin, at least 250 heavy military vehicles are being used to transport deployed troops to depth areas.At Xiadullah, again a PLA headquarter since 1962 and 96 kilometres across Karakoram Pass, as many as 12 tank transporters are being used to ferry tanks from deployments across the Daulet Beg Oldi sector.PLA is known to have deployed its strategic missiles near Xiadullah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pla-preps-for-round-2-of-disengagement-parks-heavy-vehicles-in-depth-areas-101613513045526.html

Subsequently, the diesel rate climbed to ₹79.95 a litre in Delhi.Adding to a common man's plight, petrol prices have been soaring for nine days in a row, touching the highest level India has ever seen in states like Rajasthan.At the start of this week, petrol price was raised by 30 paise per litre and diesel by 35 paise.The relentless hike in prices has been criticised by the opposition parties including Congress that has demanded an immediate cut in taxes to ease the burden on the common man.Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan last week had told Parliament that the government is not considering a reduction in excise duty to cool rates from their record highs.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday had attacked the government over high fuel prices and alleged that it was "looting people"."The Modi government is determined to loot people, just to ensure the development of "two"," he said using the hashtag "FuelLoot".Central and state taxes make up for over 61 per cent of the retail selling price of petrol and about 56 per cent of diesel.The price of liquefied petroleum gas domestic cylinders has also increased by ₹50 per unit this week in Delhi.The new price of ₹769 per 14.2 kilograms LPG cylinder was applicable in the national capital from Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petrol-diesel-prices-increase-in-delhi-by-25-paise-each-101613524473633.html

We wanted her to be removed for unconstitutional behaviour, interfering in the day-to-day activities of the administration, ignoring the elected government and not following rules and procedures. We launched several agitations against her. We also organised signature campaigns for her removal," Narayanasamy said.The Chief Minister accused Bedi of blocking the welfare schemes in the Union Territory."Due to pressure from us, the Government of India has removed Bedi. This is a great victory for the people of Puducherry. She blocked the welfare schemes. However, the rights of the Puducherry people have been saved today. Now, Puducherry will teach a lesson to BJP," he added.Meanwhile, Congress workers celebrated the removal of Bedi as Puducherry LG by bursting firecrackers and distributing sweets.Bedi has been removed as the Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry, the Rashtrapati Bhavan said in a statement on Tuesday.Telangana Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan has been directed to discharge functions of the Lieutenant-Governor of Puducherry, in addition to her own duties, until a new appointment is made, the statement said.Earlier, Congress MLA from Kamaraj Nagar constituency, A John Kumar had resigned from his post, citing "dissatisfaction with the Congress government."This comes ahead of the Puducherry Assembly polls scheduled to be held later this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/puducherry-cm-terms-ouster-of-lg-kiran-bedi-as-victory-of-people-101613522016487.html

17-02-2021||India||Twitter’s clash with government gives boost to Koo app||An Indian alternative to Twitter Inc. is experiencing a surge in popularity after the US microblogging site clashed with the country’s government, a sign of the growing political challenges for social media services.The Koo app, which lets users send out tweet-like posts in English as well as seven Indian languages, shot to prominence after the San Francisco company got into a weeks-long standoff with the Indian government over blocking certain content. Prominent officials -- including Piyush Goyal, the minister of industry and commerce -- defected to Koo and urged supporters to follow suit.That led to a 20-fold explosion in daily users, overwhelming the servers and 10-person engineering team at parent Bombinate Technologies Pvt. Aprameya Radhakrishna, co-founder and chief executive officer, said the Bangalore-based startup’s primary goal is not political at all, but rather to expand the reach of social media to a broader demographic.“We are building for 100% of India and not just the top 1%,” Radhakrishna said in a phone interview. “You may not be able to follow Elon Musk on Koo but you can connect with Indians who speak and write in a multitude of languages.”Twitter declined to comment.Koo, whose logo of a yellow chick bears a resemblance to Twitter’s blue-and-white bird, was founded just a year ago and is a fraction the size of Twitter. It had approximately 2.6 million installs from Indian app stores last year, compared with about 28 million installs for Twitter, according to data from analytics provider Sensor Tower. But from Feb. 6 to Feb. 11, Koo’s installs soared by 901,000, according to the firm’s mobile insights strategist Stephanie Chan.Twitter’s clash with the Indian government has echoes of its controversial decisions in the US, including the banning of Donald Trump after riots in Washington, D.C. In India, the government pressed the social media company to block accounts because of farmer protests over agricultural laws that the government said included misinformation and threats to national security.Twitter first resisted and then complied with a majority of orders, shutting hundreds of accounts the government had flagged. However, Twitter refused to ban others, citing freedom of expression. Politicians like Goyal have urged followers to go to Koo. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology said it will post exclusive updates on the app.Even the country’s Supreme Court has gotten involved. It has asked the government and Twitter for input on litigation over how to curb toxic content and fake news online. Any ban on Twitter in India could hit user growth in a critical market.The sudden rise of Koo has sparked privacy concerns over its collection of personal data and security questions because one of its investors is China’s Shunwei Capital. While Koo plans to buy out the Chinese venture firm, Radhakrishna is mostly focused on building the capability to serve more users.“We are working really really hard to get this to more Indians,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitters-clash-with-government-gives-boost-to-koo-app-101613517083858.html

Digvijaya Singh has done this (donated for Ram Temple construction). A Congress MLA (in Kerala) also did the same. Congress should realise that such a move amounts to giving acceptance to the RSS," he said.Vijayan further criticised the Opposition for the ongoing protest against back door appointments."We have seen campaigns alleging back door appointments including by the former Chief Minister. The answer is truth-telling figures. The Public Service Commission (PSC) has published 4012 rank lists during the last 4 years and 7 months of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government. During the same period of the last United Democratic Front (UDF) government, only 3113 rank lists were published," he said."During the LDF government, 13,825 appointments were made in the police. During the same period of the last UDF government, 4,791 appointments were made. LD Clark recruited 19,120 people during the 2016-20 period. It was 17,711 during 2011-16. Such appointments have been made by overcoming circumstances, including Covid," he added.The Chief Minister said that the state government is committed to giving opportunities to all and filling eligible vacancies on time."The LDF government has decided to give appointments to those who are eligible with clear criteria. This government has fixed only those posts which are not left to PSC and with more than 10 years of service," he said."UDF leaders are campaigning by saying more than three lakh temporary workers were given permanent appointments. It is not known where such a figure came from. The total number of employees in the state is 5,28,231. Then they have to clarify where such figures come from," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/difference-between-congress-bjp-narrowing-down-says-kerala-cm-vijayan-101613516937072.html
17-02-2021||India||Gujarat Rajya Sabha bypolls: Old-timer, OBC leader on BJP’s list||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday announced the names of candidates for by-elections to two Rajya Sabha seats in Gujarat on March 1 — one an old-time party worker of four decades, Ram Mokariya, and the other a backward classes leader, Dinesh Anavadiya.The ruling party will have a walkover on both the seats since the Congress has decided not to nominate any candidate because it doesn’t have the adequate numbers to win any seat — particularly since voting will be held separately for the two seats. The opposition party will, therefore, have to concede the seat that fell vacant after the death of veteran Congress leader Ahmed Patel.Another seat held by the BJP fell vacant after the death of Abhay Bhardwaj. Both Patel and Bhardwaj succumbed to Covid-19 complications.Ram Mokariya, who is a surprise choice from the party, founded Gujarat’s first Shree Maruti Courier service in 1985 to cater to four cities in the Saurashtra region. The primary reason for Maruti’s success was that it delivered to remotest towns in Gujarat.“I have been a dedicated party worker for four decades without any expectations. I am indeed happy that the party has picked me to contest the Rajya Sabha elections,” Mokariya told reporters after his selection.The other candidate is Gujarat’s OBC Morcha chief Anavadiya, a senior leader from North Gujarat’s Banaskantha district who was director of the Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation between 2014 and 2017.The BJP, which won 99 seats in the 2017 elections, now has 111 legislators in a House of 182, while the number of the Congress has fallen from 77 to 65 after several desertions. The Bharatiya Tribal Party has two MLAs, Nationalist Congress Party one, and Jignesh Mevani is the only independent MLA.As of now, two assembly seats are vacant.“We don’t have the numbers to nominate a candidate. If polling was to be held together for both seats, we could still have stood a chance of retaining our one seat since the voting MLAs would be equally divided. In two separate ballots, all 180 MLAs will vote for each seat,” Gujarat Congress chief spokesperson Manish Doshi said.Meanwhile, there is some surprise in the BJP camp as well since the party was expected to field Balwantsinh Rajput, who created an upset in 2017 when he quit the Congress to join the BJP. He was immediately nominated against Ahmed Patel for the Rajya Sabha, and came close to pulling off a win against his former mentor. Patel won the seat by one vote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-rajya-sabha-bypolls-old-timer-obc-leader-on-bjp-s-list-101613513496891.html
17-02-2021||India||GST evasion case: Let's try not to put everyone in jail, says Supreme Court||The Supreme Court (SC) has decried demands for “keeping everybody in jails”, stating that the criminal jurisprudence in the country needs a correction yet again.“We don’t understand what is happening to the jurisprudence in this country. Everybody wants everybody to remain in jail. Nobody should come out on bail, ever. What is this?” asked an SC bench, headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, earlier this month. It recently came across several such cases relating to bail.On January 18, the bench, which also included justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy, gave bail to an accused who was behind the bars in connection with a Goods and Services Tax evasion case.Additional solicitor general (ASG) SV Raju opposed the plea for bail, arguing there was siphoning of ₹21 crore and that the money belonged to the nation. But the court said it failed to understand why somebody should be kept incarcerated in a case of GST evasion where most of the evidence would be documentary. The bench also noted that the accused was remanded to police custody for the maximum period of 15 days, but the police still wanted him in jail.“Let us keep jurisprudence to what it was – bail is the rule and jail is an exception. We must correct our jurisprudence again,” the bench told ASG Raju on January 18, as it released the accused on a regular bail even though the initial plea before the top court was for an interim bail on medical grounds.Similarly, there was a petition for cancellation of bail in a case registered under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. The bench was amused to learn that the appeal was being filed after a delay of almost two years.Additional solicitor general KM Nataraj sought to explain the delay and also the fact that the cancellation was being sought since the quantity involved was commercial in nature. But the bench was unmoved.“If it was such a serious matter, why did you take 617 days to file an appeal? Now that man is already out and you want this court to send him back to jail. But there are no good reasons you have shown to us. Why should everyone be in jail?” asked the court as it dismissed the appeal by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) by an order last month.Earlier this month, another petition came up for hearing before the Justice Kaul-led bench in a cheating case where the man had been given bail but the complainant wanted it cancelled. The court observed that it was “worried to see how people wanted everyone behind bars”.It summarily rejected the plea, saying: “So, according to you, everyone should be in jail till the time the trial is over. Nobody should be given bail. What has happened to the jurisprudence that we had? It needs a correction.”Veteran lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi told HT: “The principle is unexceptionable and age-old. The problem lies with the high degree of inconsistency with different benches of different courts in applying the principle that bail is the rule, jail is exception. This salutary principle became a chimera in the hands of the subjective judges, applying whimsical discretion.”The senior advocate added: “My personal view is that there should be a reset and the bail should again become a norm after applying the triple test — flight risk, non-cooperation with the investigation and interference with the evidence. Apart from the triple test and in cases of some heinous offences such as serious terrorism and child rape, there is a need to make this principle not only a theoretical standard but an operational norm.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gst-tax-evasion-case-let-s-try-not-to-put-everyone-in-jail-supreme-court-101613514803232.html

17-02-2021||India||To avoid Jat backlash, Nadda, Shah discuss farm stir with leaders||The senior Bharatiya Janata Party leadership on Tuesday held a meeting with legislators and MPs from Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan to chalk out a strategy to prevent the ongoing farmers’ stir from stoking unrest among the Jat community, which is part of the party’s support base in the northern states.At the meeting, chaired by party chief JP Nadda, which was attended by home minister Amit Shah and agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar, the MLAs and MPs were directed to counter the “misinformation campaign” on the laws.The leaders were asked to submit a feedback, a person familiar with the details of the meeting said. “The party is concerned by the implications that a Jat stir can have on the fate of the Manohar Lal Khattar government in Haryana and on the outcome of the elections in Western UP,” a functionary said.In Haryana, the BJP with its 40 legislators in the 90-member assembly runs a coalition government with JJP, which counts Jats as its main vote-bank.“The farmers’ stir has put a strain on the alliance as JJP is under pressure from the Jat Panchayats to walk out. Several JJP leaders have already demanded the repeal of the farm laws and a protracted agitation will not augur well for the government,” the functionary explained.Last week, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attended a Kisan Mahapanchayat in UP.In UP, the party wants to placate the community ahead of the polls as at least 73 seats in the western region of the state are considered to hold the key to the chief minister’s chair. “The government has maintained from the beginning that it is ready for talks but the farmers have to tell us where they think the laws will hurt them,” a minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-avoid-jat-backlash-nadda-shah-discuss-farm-stir-with-leaders-101613514732149.html

The law does not differentiate between a 22-year-old and a 50-year-old. She was produced before a court which sent her to five-day police custody,” Shrivastava said on the sidelines of an event to mark Delhi Police’s 74th Raising Day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explain-activist-s-arrest-women-s-panel-to-cops-101613508705411.html

The protesters, affiliated to All India Students’ Association (AISA) and other student organisations, also submitted a memorandum to the commissioner demanding the release of persons associated with the farmers’ ongoing protest against the Centre’s farm laws.“In a highly condemnable act, Delhi Police has arrested Disha Ravi, a 22-year-old Bengaluru-based environment activist for supporting the farmers’ movement. All activists such as Shiv Kumar and others arrested for merely supporting the farmers’ movement must be released,” Prasenjeet Kumar, national working general secretary of AISA, said in the memorandum.The students said toolkits have been “a common tool for agitation” and the malicious ploy to term it an ‘international conspiracy’ is the BJP’s way of defaming the mass farmers’ protest. Activists also raised their voice against the vilification of Ravi on social media.Madhurima Kundu, JNU student and AISA activist, said it was shameful that “a dedicated propaganda machinery” was focussed on “maligning” Ravi’s image. “The false links to ”international conspiracy” is a prime toolkit of fascist politics,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/students-protest-outside-delhi-police-hq-demand-disha-ravi-s-release-101613508745322.html
17-02-2021||India||Will ask ‘toolkit’ suspect why he was at Tikri on R-Day: Cops||Delhi Police on Tuesday said it will ask Maharashtra engineer Shantanu Muluk, who allegedly created a social media toolkit on the ongoing farm protests, to explain why he was present at the Tikri border on January 26 when violence broke out at many places in the Capital during a tractor rally by farmers.“Our technical probe to ascertain Muluk’s phone location shows that he was present in Delhi between January 21 and 27. And, that he was at Tikri border protest site on January 26. We will ask him to join the investigation and tell us what was he doing at Tikri border when farmers were taking out the tractor parade,” an officer associated with the investigation said on condition of anonymity.The Bombay high court on Tuesday granted transit anticipatory bail to Muluk while reserving the order on a similar appeal by Mumbai-based lawyer Nikita Jacob, another accused in the case, for Wednesday.Read more: Disha Ravi can get warm clothes, masks and books in police custody, says Delhi courtOn Saturday night, Delhi Police arrested 22-year-old climate activist Disha Ravi from Bengaluru on charges of sedition, intending to riot and criminal conspiracy, for editing and creating a toolkit, essentially a Google document.The police alleged that the toolkit was created to spread misinformation and incite unrest. They also alleged that Ravi shared the document with Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg who tweeted it but later removed it.Muluk has been accused of similar charges as Ravi.Investigators said that Ravi created a WhatsApp group, International Farmers Strike, on December 6. Police said Jacob allegedly joined the group on December 11 while a few members of pro-Khalistani group, Poetic Justice Foundation (PJF), also joined it.Muluk was added to the group on December 6, the police alleged, adding that the group was created to discuss the modalities of the Google toolkit document titled Global Farmer Strike and Global Day of Action, 26 January, backing the ongoing agitation by the farmers against the three laws passed by Parliament in September.Read more: Disha Ravi's arrest: 'False to say there were lapses', says Delhi Police chiefThe three suspects also attended a meeting organised on video conferencing platform Zoom by the PJF on January 11 this year, investigators said.The police said they have written to Zoom and WhatsApp, seeking details such as the identities of the participants, the creator and administrator of the group, the meeting coordinator, apart from the deleted chats, videos and documents.“These details will help us ascertain the sequence of events leading to the creation of the Google toolkit documents and the role each participant played in it. Disha deleted the WhatsApp group soon after Greta Thunberg accidentally posted the entire toolkit document on Twitter and later deleted it,” said a senior police officer associated with the case, requesting anonymity.The police’s decision to arrest Ravi and charge the activists has drawn sharp criticism from activists and Opposition politicians.On Tuesday, Karnataka Congress chief DK Shivakumar attacked the Centre. “Arrest of Disha Ravi is an attack to weaken the moral strength of India’s Youth and make dissent illegal. Police action against her, using a concocted ‘Toolkit’ conspiracy violates legal norms. Why not approach a competent court before arresting a young woman?” Shivakumar tweeted.Read more: Delhi women's panel sends notice to police over Disha Ravi’s arrestActivists from various organisations say creating a toolkit was standard operating procedure for advocacy and media outreach, and did not constitute a crime as it was entirely up to people whether or not to follow what toolkits suggested.The Left-wing All India Students’ Association (AISA) staged a protest at the Delhi Police headquarters on Tuesday, demanded Ravi’s immediate release and accused the Bharatiya Janata Party of running an “anti-democracy campaign”.Police said Ravi’s interrogation, and examination of her laptop and mobile phone showed that she deleted a series of emails related to the toolkit. Efforts to retrieve those emails are being made, they said.A second police officer, who did not want to be named, said their investigation so far has shown PJF founder Mo Dhaliwal contacted Ravi, Jacob and Muluk through a Canada-based woman named Puneet.“Puneet got in touch with Jacob in the first week of December and was told about the PJF’s ‘bigger plans’ pertaining to the farmers’ agitation. We have reason to believe that after Jacob agreed to be part of the plan, she roped in Muluk and Disha. Muluk is the common link between Jacob and Disha. Disha’s direct link with Thunberg could be the reason why she was included in the toolkit plan,” the second officer said.Police said their probe pointed to the alleged involvement of another PJF member, Anita Lal.“We have found that Disha, Jacob, Muluk and others communicated each other through an email created on PJF’s domain apart from other secured messaging apps,” the second officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-ask-toolkit-suspect-why-he-was-at-tikri-on-r-day-cops-101613508449542.html

All the plots were attached as per provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) by ED in 2019.ED, which probes financial crimes, initiated an investigation in 2015 -- after a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government came to power -- based on a First Information Report, or FIR, by the Haryana vigilance bureau.The FIR was subsequently transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in 2016, which registered a case under relevant sections and Section 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act.ED said investigations revealed that Hooda, as the then ex-officio chairman of the Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA), three retired IAS officers and other office-bearers of the body illegally favoured pre-selected acquaintances of the then CM by allotting them 14 industrial plots, while denying worthy applicants.The three retired IAS officers are: Dharam Pal Singh Nagal (the then chief administrator, HUDA), Surjit Singh (the then administrator, HUDA), and Narinder Kumar Solanki (the then zonal administrator of HUDA’s Faridabad Zone).Two other HUDA officials named in the charge sheet are: Subhash Chandra Kansal (the then chief controller of finance, HUDA) and Bharat Bhushan Taneja (the then superintendent, HUDA).The agency said the criteria for allotment was altered 18 days after the last date of application in such a way to favour the pre-selected applicants. It added that the entire interview process was “vitiated and compromised”.State home minister and BJP leader Anil Vij said “irregularities” committed during the Congress rule in Haryana were getting exposed through investigations. “Law of the land will take its course,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/illegal-land-allotment-case-ed-charge-sheets-hooda-21-others-under-pmla-101613506116933.html
17-02-2021||India||Top court rebukes retired Madhya Pradesh district judge for ‘flirting’||The Supreme Court on Tuesday reproached a former district judge from Madhya Pradesh for “flirting” with a junior woman judge, and said such conduct was “unacceptable” in the judiciary.“Such conduct by a senior judge for a junior lady judge is not acceptable at all,” said an SC bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, as it heard an appeal by the retired judge against the disciplinary proceedings, initiated suo motu (on its own) by the Madhya Pradesh high court.While his petition emphasised that there could not be any inquiry after the woman judge had chosen to “settle” the matter with him, the high court defended its action on the ground that his conduct was unbecoming of a judge and an example had to be set.During the hearing, senior advocate Ravindra Shrivastava, appearing for the high court, also read out a WhatsApp conversation between the former district judge, who retired last year, and the woman judicial officer, who was posted under him in 2018.Read more: Orders that set the bar: How Allahabad HC stood for civil rightsThese messages were about how the former wanted to “touch” her, have an affair with her like “husband and wife”.HT is not naming the retired district judge because there has been no decision on his guilt or otherwise, and his petition has challenged the initiation of the inquiry itself.Shrivastava pointed out that the woman officer had made a complaint and also recorded her statement against her senior, but later withdrew from the inquiry under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, saying she had settled the matter.He contended that the male judge was a senior judicial officer and there must have been some kind of pressure on the woman judge that made her retract.According to Shrivastava, even though the inquiry under the sexual harassment act could not conclude after the woman judge opted out, the gender sensitisation committee of the high court had the authority to take a suo motu note of the demeanour by the former district judge and recommend a disciplinary inquiry, as it did in November 2019.Read more: Supreme Court agrees to consider issue of priority vaccination for members of legal fraternity, issues notice to CentreHe presented before the bench the district judge’s statement to the committee -- the judge had admitted the WhatsApp conversation with the woman officer, and called it “flirting”.At this, senior advocate R Balasubramanium, representing the retired district judge, said that his client might have gone “overboard”, but he could not be proceeded against when the complainant has herself said that she did not want any inquiry.He also questioned the timing of the complaint, pointing out the district judge was being considered for appointment to the high court when the allegations surfaced.Read more: Supreme Court notice to WhatsApp: ‘People value privacy more than money’But the bench declined to entertain such contentions. “We understand these are two adults talking. And you thought it is a private conversation. But you have not just gone overboard. Your WhatsApp messages are offensive and improper,” the Supreme Court bench told advocate Balasubramanium.It said that the former district judge should withdraw his petition and face the consequences of the disciplinary proceedings lest the court pass “some sweeping observations against him”.Balasubramanium was given a week to consult the former judge and come back with instructions on withdrawing the appeal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-court-rebukes-retired-madhya-pradesh-district-judge-for-flirting-101613505164883.html

The two were arrested by the Delhi Police for alleged sedition and circulating rumours by posting videos on social media.“The law of sedition is a powerful tool in the hands of the state to maintain peace and order in the society. However, it cannot be invoked to quieten the disquiet under the pretence of muzzling the miscreants,” the judge said on Monday. The court said the invocation of Section 124 A (sedition) of the Indian Penal Code was a “seriously debatable issue” in the case.Read more: Karnataka police yet to file charge-sheets in 3 sedition cases filed a year agoBurdak and Ram, both aged 25, were booked under sections 124A (sedition), 505 (spreading rumors), 468 (forgery) and 471 (fraud) of the IPC. While Ram, a labourer, was arrested from Mahisagar in Gujarat, Burdak was arrested from Nagaur in Rajasthan. The police alleged that both the accused circulated a video on social media that showed a senior police official briefing other personnel during the farmers’ protest. It alleged that though it was an old video of September 2020, it was being projected through social media posts as being connected with the farmers’ agitation and the violence son January 26 in an effort to project that there was unrest within the police forces.“In the recent violence that occurred on Jan 26 at Red Fort, near ITO and other areas in Delhi, a large number of police personnel were injured and these posts have been released on social media at a strategic time deliberately in an attempt to excite disaffection towards the government established by law and with an intent to cause any officer or soldier in the Armed Forces to mutiny or otherwise disregard or fail in his duty as such,” the police told the court.Read more: Kangana Ranaut seeks quashing of FIR for sedition, tells court her tweets did not incite violenceThe investigating agency also said that the accused circulated fake videos and also charged them for forgery. The court, however, rejected both the contentions and said that the invocation of sedition in this case was a “debatable issue”.“Evidently, law proscribes any act which has a tendency to create disorder or disturbance of public peace by resort to violence. In the absence of any exhortation, call, incitement or instigation to create disorder or disturbance of public peace by resort to violence or any allusion or oblique remark or even any hint towards this objective, attributable to the accused, I suspect that Section 124 A IPC can be validly invoked against the accused,” the court said.It also said that “it had personally seen the video in the courtroom where evidently a senior police officer of Delhi Police is raising slogans, in a very agitated tone, and a group of Delhi Police personnel are seen standing beside him. The background voices also suggest a very charged up atmosphere”.Read more: JNU sedition case: Delhi court takes cognisance of chargesheet against Kanhaiya Kumar, othersThe judge also rejected the charges of forgery and said that the video in question was not created by the accused and was merely forwarded by them.“Consequently, since the prosecution has failed to point out the creation of any false document in the instant case, I fail to understand as to how come the offence u/s 468/471 IPC (forgery) can be invoked in the instant case,” the judge said.Advocate Surender Chaudhary, the counsel representing the accused, said that it was complete injustice on the part of the police to arrest the two young men who had no connection with the farmers’ protest. He said that his clients had not even visited the Red Fort or any of the protesting sites and they were arrested from their homes.“This is complete travesty of justice. The career of the young boys is at stake now. This is also suppressing the right to protest envisaged under the Indian Constitution,” he said. Senior advocate Siddharth Luthra said sedition has a high benchmark and the SC has said that unless there is an incitement to violence, the act will not constitute sedition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sedition-can-t-be-used-to-quieten-disquiet-delhi-court-observes-101613501393189.html
17-02-2021||India||4 South Africa variant cases found, 1 with strain from Brazil||Four people who flew into India last month were infected with the South African variant of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, and another traveller was found infected with the Brazilian variant, the Union health ministry said on Tuesday, announcing the detection of the two mutations that scientists fear can make coronavirus vaccines less effective and trigger reinfections among people.Authorities have carried out contact tracing for the five people, and no other person is found to have contracted the new variants till now, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said at the weekly government briefing on Covid-19 in the Capital. People returning from these countries will now be tested more aggressively, he added.“There are no direct flights from South Africa or Brazil, so the health ministry and the civil aviation ministry are in touch on the steps to be taken on the matter,” Bhushan said, while refusing to give details about which airport the five people arrived at or their location at present in order to protect their privacy.Read more: Covid-19: South Africa's health care workers eager for first vaccinesIndia now has all three of the coronavirus variants that are a global concern -- B.1.1.7, first discovered in the UK; B.1.351, which is now dominant in South Africa; and P.1, which has spread in Brazil. All three have a unique collection of mutations, two of which -- N501Y and E484K -- seem to make it spread more readily or cheat vaccine-immunity triggered by the virus predominant in the world. The UK variant carries the N501Y mutation, the Brazilian variant has the E484K mutation, and the South African variant has both.Bhushan indicated that genomic tests of all positive cases among people who arrive from Brazil and South Africa are likely to be carried out. “We got genome sequencing done of all those who were found positive among those tested for the UK variant. This strategy worked significantly well, and most likely the same strategy we will apply for flights coming from South Africa and Brazil,” he said.But, he added, passengers from South Africa and Brazil do not take direct flights. “The traffic is largely routed from other sectors; for example, the Gulf sector. So, to have measures that can be put in place for passengers coming from these two countries, the Union health and civil aviation ministries are in constant touch and should come up with a solution soon that will be made public,” he said.Read more: Covid-19 variant in UK picks up worrying South Africa mutationThe South African strains were found among two people who returned from the country as well as one traveller each from Angola and Tanzania.“All travellers and contacts have been tested and quarantined, and ICMR-National Institute of Virology is attempting to isolate and culture the South Africa variant strain from the samples of these four individuals,” said Dr Balram Bhargava, director general, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).The South African and Brazil variants are different from the UK variant because the Brazilian and South African variants have the capacity to easily enter the lungs, Bhargava said.Last year, the Union government created the Indian Sars-Cov-2 Genomic Consortium (INSACOG) of 10 laboratories based at the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Union ministry of health and family welfare, as part of a surveillance mechanism for early detection of variants of concern.“For the UK variant, we have found 187 such variants. We were able to isolate the virus and culture the strain and have also tested the efficacy of the Covid-19 vaccine. Neutralising potential with the UK variant is there with the vaccine that is in use in India,” Bhargava added.Read more: Oxford Covid-19 shot less effective against South African variant: StudySuch experiments in South Africa have showed that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine’s efficacy dropped to an insignificant 22% against the B.1.351 variant. The country dropped its plan last week to use the vaccine, which is also being used in India as Covishield, and has decided to offer doses to the African Union, where the variant has not reached. Vaccine trials carried out by Johnson & Johnson-Janssen and Novavax too showed a significant drop in efficacy due to the variant.Similar implications could also hold for people who were previously infected. World Health Organization chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said on February 14 that WHO had received new reports of reinfection, including some from South Africa where people who had Covid-19 were infected again.The coronavirus outbreak has waned dramatically in India and over the past week, the country recorded around 93 deaths a day -- a level not seen since early May. The decrease has raised fears that people might become complacent, and that variants such as the three of global concern could take hold, wiping out population immunity and triggering a resurgence.According to ICMR, experiments to assess vaccine effectiveness against this strain are currently underway. “The significance of a mutation will depend on where the mutation has happened, as mutations in RNA viruses happen all the time. It will be significant if the mutations help the virus to attach to the cell easily as then it will impact the disease spread,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head, microbiology department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-south-africa-variant-cases-found-1-with-strain-from-brazil-101613503495609.html

Hours later, Kiran Bedi was replaced as the Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry, with the Telangana governor being given the additional charge of the UT.With Congress legislator A John Kumar’s resignation on Tuesday, the Congress’s tally in the 33-member assembly dropped to 10. Kumar, who was seen as a close aide of Puducherry chief minister V Narayanasamy, resigned after health minister Malladi Krishna Rao announced he was quitting the House on Monday. Two Congress MLAs-- A Namassivayam, and E Theepaindan -- resigned in January this year and later flew to Delhi to join the BJP. Another Congress MLA, N Dhanavelu, was disqualified in July 2020 for anti-party activities.Read more: Assembly polls in Puducherry, Tamil Nadu will be held simultaneously: CECThe assembly has 30 elected seats and three nominated members. In the 2016 assembly polls, the Congress won 15 seats. It has the support of three MLAs from the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and an independent MLA. The Opposition comprises the All India NR Congress, a splinter group of former chief minister N Rangasamy, with seven seats and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, with four members. Three members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have been nominated as MLAs to the assembly. Unlike some other states, the nominated members can vote in the Puducherry assembly.Gandhi is scheduled to launch the Congress’s campaign on Wednesday for the UT’s elections, due in April-May.Kumar handed his resignation on Tuesday to speaker VP Sivakolunthu after the health minister posted his resignation on Twitter on Monday. The Speaker told PTI he was perusing the letter and will take a decision soon. He said he received Rao’s resignation letter from the House through fax on Monday night. With the five vacancies, the strength has reduced to 28 in the Puducherry assembly.Read more: Rift in Cong-DMK alliance in Puducherry; all eyes now on ties in poll-bound TNOn Tuesday night, a Rashtrapati Bhavan spokesperson said Bedi will “cease to hold” the office of the Lieutenant Governor. “The President has directed that Dr. Kiran Bedi shall cease to hold the office of the Lieutenant-Governor of Puducherry and has appointed Dr. Tamilisai Soundararajan, Governor of Telangana, to discharge the functions of the Lieutenant-Governor of Puducherry, in addition to her own duties, with effect from the date she assumes charge of her office, until regular arrangements for the office of Lieutenant-Governor of Puducherry are made,” Ajay Kumar Singh, press secretary to the President, said in a statement.An official in the L-G’s office said the development came as a surprise. “We are yet to receive an official communication of the change,” the official said, asking not to be named. “She likes to be in the driver’s seat, which is what created the friction between her and the chief minister,” the official added. At least three functionaries in Tamil Nadu told HT that one of the possible reasons of Bedi’s removal could be that she had a bitter relationship with the Congress leaders who recently quit the party and joined the BJP.Read more: BJP appoints election in-charges for Puducherry, 3 poll-bound statesThe Puducherry Congress said that its alliance held the majority amid calls from the Opposition, demanding CM’s resignation. “Our alliance with the DMK is strong...We have a majority and we will continue to function,” Narayanasamy said.Rangasamy, however, said: “They have lost the majority with the four resignations, so the government has to come forward and voluntarily quit.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-loses-puducherry-majority-after-4-mlas-quit-bedi-replaced-101613504145202.html
17-02-2021||India||Spell out regulatory regime, SC tells govt on OTT norms||The Supreme Court on Tuesday directed the Union government to spell out the kind of regulatory regime they intend to put in place for over-the-top (OTT) platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hotstar.A top court bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde told the government that a “mere contemplation” on regulation was not sufficient, and that they must come forth with something “concrete” since the issue was important. “This is an important issue. It is not adversarial at all. The government should tell us what it is doing about the OTTs. What is it you are doing, a legislation or what?” asked the bench, which included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.Read more: Contemplating 'some action' on regulating OTT platforms, Centre tells SCThe court was initially of the view that PIL demanding institutional regulations for OTTs should first go to the government, as solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, made a statement that “something” was being done about it.However, when the bench sought to know exactly what was being considered, there were no answers on the specifics. Instead, additional solicitor general (ASG) KM Nataraj, also appearing for the Centre, submitted: “We are looking at the issue. The issue is under deliberation. Nothing is finalised yet. We are contemplating something in this regard.” This submission made the bench retort: “We cannot accept the word mere ‘contemplation’. We need to know what exactly you are doing. Everyone in the world contemplates. So that’s not enough. You file your affidavit and tell us what is it that you are planning to do. Tell us something concrete.” Two weeks have been given to the government for filing their reply to the petition by Shashank Shekhar Jha and Apurva Arhatia.Last October, the court issued notices on this PIL, which had sought establishment of a proper institution for the monitoring and management of content on different OTT and streaming and digital media platforms.Read more: Manoj Bajpayee says OTT will lose its charm if it comes under censorshipNone of the OTT platforms including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Zee5, and Hotstar have signed the self-regulation provided by the ministry of Information & Broadcasting since February 2020, said the PIL. It had also stated that absence of a monitoring and regulatory body has let writers, directors, and producers to experiment limitless, due to which unchecked and uncensored contents on cruelty, violence, sex, obscene language and on screen-smoking were being streamed on these platforms.In November last year, the Union government had brought the streaming video services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, and news websites under the ambit of I&B ministry for regulation. This notification was seen as a precursor to the government approving future rules — either through legislation or endorsement of self-regulatory mechanisms. At present, there are no laws or autonomous bodies that have a say on the sort of content on streaming services or news websites.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spell-out-regulatory-regime-sc-tells-govt-on-ott-norms-101613503941290.html
17-02-2021||India||Activists question govt's move to push on with Uttarakhand hydel projects||The environment ministry said in a statement that it has come up with a common policy for the seven under-construction hydropower projects in the higher reaches of Uttarakhand, a move that gains significance in the wake of the February 7 glacial lake overflow flood in the Rishi Ganga valley.The policy, which is to be presented in the Supreme Court in July, has been drafted by the environment, power and Jal Shakti ministries.One of the seven projects is National Thermal Power Corporations’ 520 MW Tapovan Vishnugad project that has been completely destroyed following the flood on February 7 and which will have to be rebuilt. As of Tuesday, the bodies of 17 workers have been recovered and 123 are missing at the Tapovan Vishnugad site.The list includes the 444 MW Vishnugad Pipalkoti, a few kilometres downstream of Tapovan; the 99 MW Singoli Bhatwari; and the 76MW Phata Byung projects.The Tapovan Vishnugad project is in a so-called paraglacial zone (above 2,000 metres in Uttarakhand), while the Vishnugad Pipalkoti, Singoli Bhatwari and Phata Byung projects are located in areas bordering paraglacial zones. These are landscapes that are extremely vulnerable to changes in geology related to glacial retreat. All also partially bore the brunt of the 2013 flood or floods that came before.Read more: Uttarakhand glacier burst: Heavy damage to two hydel projects at the epicentreThe apex court, in its order dated January 24, 2015, in the Alaknanda Hydro Power Co. Ltd Versus Anuj Joshi & Ors, sought a common policy framework from the environment, power and Jal Shakti ministries for implementation of projects in the upper reaches of the Ganga (Alaknanda and Bhagirathi Basin).“A common policy framework has been arrived at with consensus on the implementation of the following seven under-construction projects,” a statement from the environment ministry said.Hydropower projects impact ecological flow in the Ganga and they can amplify disasters from extreme weather events as was seen in the February 7 glacial flood. Ecological flow is the minimum flow needed in a river to sustain life. Dams and hydropower projects create barriers to this flow.Experts hope that the February 7 flood will be the last such reminder of the risks associated with hydropower projects in these regions.The impact of the February 7 disaster would have been manifold had the flash floods impacted Vishnugad Pipalkoti, which is under-construction a few kilometres downstream of the Tapovan Vishnugad project. Further downstream of Pipalkoti is the Srinagar hydroelectric project of 330 MW, which is already generating electricity but is vulnerable to upstream floods.Read more: Amid rescue ops in Uttarakhand, identifying decomposed bodies a big challengeIn 2013, the apex court ruled that no new hydroelectric power projects should be set up in the state of Uttarakhand. In all, 69 projects were envisaged in the region, and 24 were granted environmental clearance. These clearances were also stayed by the SC. The court sought a detailed and scientific assessment of the cumulative impact of hydropower plants in the state.Following the SC order, a committee headed by Ravi Chopra, director of the People’s Science Institute, submitted a detailed report which warned that a glacial retreat in the state, coupled with structures built for hydroelectricity generation and dams, could lead to large-scale disasters downstream.“We (the committee) had recommended that 23 of the 24 hydropower projects should be cancelled. My opinion is that those under-construction should also be cancelled. Tapovan Vishnugad is already destroyed and will take years to be commissioned... Vishnugad Pipalkoti is again very close to the para-glacial zone and extremely vulnerable. Why would the government want to commission these?” said Chopra.Read more: Uttarakhand disaster: Locals feared Kedarnath-like tragedyThe 2013 court order came in the wake of the Kedarnath flash floods.“The under-construction and existing dams were the reasons for the escalated damage and impact of the 2013 disaster. The same phenomenon was seen in Asi-Ganga flash flood of 2012 and also in the recent Uttarakhand tragedy in Rishi and Dhauli Ganga. These dams must be cancelled with immediate effect and the existing dams too must be systematically decommissioned in phases...” said Mallika Bhanot, an activist from Ganga Ahvaan.Following submission of the committee’s report, the top court ordered a stay on 24 hydropower projects.The February 7 disaster has also raised concerns about disaster preparedness. For example, early warnings weren’t triggered both at the 13.2 MW Rishi Ganga project and the Tapovan Vishnugad project even though systems were in place according to officials at the disaster site.“We had a complete system of emergency measures. But water came with such volume and speed that reaction time was nil,” said a senior NTPC official who asked not to be named.“The abnormality this time was that the water level was even higher than the place where people are supposed to stand after climbing rescue ladders. Our project was 76 per cent complete and we never imagined a disaster of this scale. But NTPC has no thoughts of abandoning this project,” he added. The damage to Tapovan Vishnugad is to the extent of around ₹1,500 crore. Locals here also have polarised views on the impact of hydropower projects.“Not a single person from this village has benefitted from the hydropower projects. They haven’t given us any jobs. They have only pushed us towards disaster,” said Bharat Singh, a resident of Raini village, known for Goura Devi, a Chipko movement icon and Mahila Mangal Dal leader.But Bhimsingh Rawat, a cab driver in Joshimath who also does farming during lean tourist seasons, said such projects have helped. “Before hydropower projects came, people across this area were poverty-stricken. Let’s not be impractical. Hydropower has brought money to this state. Can’t they function with better warning systems?” he said.On Tuesday, at the Tapovan Vishnugad site, rescue workers were searching for bodies, and medical teams were collecting DNA samples from relatives to match body parts retrieved.“For the past eight days, we have been waiting here from morning to evening in the hope that my brother and four workers installing a machine in the NTPC tunnel are found. I can’t imagine the horror of a disaster like this burying them in a tunnel. How can NTPC have no early warning? Who will answer these questions?” asked Mukesh Dhiman from Saharanpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/activists-question-govt-s-move-to-push-on-with-uttarakhand-hydel-projects-101613503065025.html
17-02-2021||India||First joint commands to be launched by May||India is set to begin a formal roll-out of its long-awaited theaterisation plan to best utilise its military’s resources amid growing security threats, with the Air Defence Command and the Maritime Theatre Command set to be launched by May, people familiar with the developments said on Tuesday.The commands are being set up in the backdrop of border tensions with China on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh and Pakistani hostility along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu & Kashmir, with a joint threat from the two nuclear-armed neighbours being acknowledged as a reality by the country’s military leadership, and at a time when India is demonstrating a muscular stance in the Indo-Pacific region.“The final validation exercises to set up the two commands are in full swing. Aspects related to executing authority, command and control structures and budgeting are being fine-tuned,” said a senior official, one of the people cited above, who asked not to be named.Read more: India has not conceded any territory to China along LAC, says defence ministryThe Air Defence Command, which will come up in Prayagraj (Allahabad), will be the first to be set up in April. It will control the air defence resources of all the three services, and will be tasked with protecting military assets from airborne enemies. Its commander-in-chief will be a top three-star Indian Air Force officer. The Maritime Theatre Command, to be headquartered in Karwar on the west coast, will come up the following month and be responsible for securing India from seaborne threats and will have army and air force elements under it. Its commander-in-chief will be a top three-star Indian Navy officer.Theaterisation refers to placing specific units of the army, the navy and the air force under a theatre commander. Such commands are led by an officer from any of the three services, depending on the roles assigned to them.“The Air Defence Command will be rolled out first, in April. The Maritime Theatre Command will follow a month later. The commanders-in-chief of the commands will report to the chief of defence staff (CDS) in his role as permanent chairman of the chiefs of staff committee (COSC),” said a second official, also speaking on the condition of anonymity.Read more: India to get 5 military theatre commands, one each for China and PakImportance of jointmanshipIndia’s CDS General Bipin Rawat wears three hats — he is the permanent chairman of COSC, heads the department of military affairs (DMA), and is the single-point military adviser to the defence minister.The government expects Rawat, who took charge as India’s first CDS on January 1, 2020, to bring about jointness among the three services in a three-year time frame (by January 2023). One of the means to achieve jointness is the setting up of integrated theatre commands for the best use of military resources to fight future battles.Apart from the Air Defence and Maritime Theatre Commands, India is expected to have three other integrated commands to secure its western, northern and eastern fronts — these will be rolled out by December 2022, and several studies are currently on to finalise the structures of these commands. In addition, a logistics command is in the works to avoid duplication of efforts and resources. The CDS’s mandate includes bringing about jointness in operations, logistics, transport, training, support services and repairs and maintenance of the three services.Read more: Behind PM Modi’s stinging critique of the IAS, a Jan meeting holds the clueThe long-overdue integrated theatres will transform the Indian military from a military force to a military power, contributing to India’s stature as a global leader, said Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), who was heading the Centre for Joint Warfare Studies (CENJOWS) until last month and has worked extensively on aspects related to jointness. “On account of China’s aggressive behaviour along the LAC and the Covid-19 pandemic, the armed forces will be tasked, asked and expected to do more with less (resources). Hence, it is imperative that the armed forces roll out the integrated theatre commands fast,” said Bhatia, also a former director general of military operations.The Air Defence Command will bring about the much-needed synergy between air assets of the three services, with their optimal application providing seamless air defence cover, which will be critical to counter the Chinese threat, experts said.“While the aerospace domain is critical for deterrence, the maritime theatre too needs integration at the earliest as our locational/geographical advantages can deter China’s aggressiveness (in the Indian Ocean region). Synergy in application of combat power is essential in new age warfare, which is multi domain and waged in many key battle spaces simultaneously,” said Bhatia. India has finally demonstrated politico-military will to address the much-needed theaterisation, he said.Read more: India conducts 'Kavach' drill in Andaman Sea to fine-tune joint war-fighting skillsRestructuring in DMA?The operational control of all the theatre commands will eventually come under CDS, with the service chiefs being responsible for raising, training and sustaining their forces.“CDS will have operational control over all the integrated commands when they are fully functional. This will be in his role as CDS, and not as permanent chairman, COSC. And whenever that happens, some restructuring will have to be carried out in DMA,” said the first official.The restructuring, he said, could involve the chief of integrated defence staff to COSC, or CISC, being appointed as the secretary of DMA in due course to allow CDS to focus on the theatre commands.

The threat isn’t just something that is a part of some strategic paper or loud thought process, but it manifests itself on the ground, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said on January 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-joint-commands-to-be-launched-by-may-101613500932277.html
17-02-2021||India||Toolkit case: Some relief for activists as police defend action||Activists facing prosecution for allegedly creating and editing a social media toolkit on the farmers’ protests received some relief from the courts on Tuesday, even as Delhi Police defended its arrest of a 22-year-old woman in the case that has triggered widespread criticism from free speech advocates.The Aurangabad bench of the high court granted Beed resident Shantanu Muluk protection from arrest for 10 days on a personal bond and surety of ₹50,000. His co-accused, Mumbai-based lawyer Nikita Jacob, also asked for anticipatory bail and the high court will give its decision on Wednesday.In Delhi, a magistrate’s court allowed Disha Ravi, who was arrested Saturday night and is facing a sedition charge for allegedly helping edit the document, access to a copy of the FIR, remand application, meetings with her lawyer, calls with her family, warm clothes, books, masks and home-cooked food.Read more: Disha Ravi’s arrest in 'toolkit case' unprecedented attack on democracy: Arvind KejriwalPolice said it asked Zoom to share details of a virtual meeting in January where Jacob, Ravi, Muluk and roughly 70 people allegedly fixed details of the document and protest with pro-Khalistani members. Investigators sought help from WhatsApp over a group where the document was allegedly discussed.Jacob and Muluk, who face non-bailable warrants, said they were targets of political vendetta. “Such vendetta is the dark face of authoritarianism and the real tool kit for devastation of not only democracy but also basic human rights,” Muluk’s petition read.Delhi Police say the document, first publicised by Swedish Nobel laureate Greta Thunberg in support of the farmers’ agitating against three laws, aimed to spread misinformation, incite unrest and was linked to clashes that rocked the Capital on Republic Day.Read more: Toolkit case | Zoom meet held before Republic Day to create Twitter storm: ReportBut the police’s decision to charge Bengaluru-based Ravi, a member of Thunberg’s Fridays For Future movement, with sedition, criminal conspiracy and inciting to riot, stoked allegations of muzzling dissent and procedural lapses.On Tuesday, police commissioner SN Shrivastava denied any lapses. “Disha Ravi’s arrest has been made in accordance with the law which doesn’t differentiate between a 22-year-old or a 50-year-old,” he said.Police said their investigation revealed Muluk was in Delhi between January 20 and 27. Investigators focused on a WhatsApp group named “International Farmers Strike” allegedly created on December 6 by Ravi. Police said Jacob joined the group on December 11 while pro-Khalistani group Poetic Justice Foundation (PJF) members joined it the following day.Muluk was added on December 6 and the trio allegedly attended a virtual meeting by PJF on January 11. The modalities of a “Global Day Action” were allegedly worked out in the meeting attended by 70 people, police said. Police wrote to Zoom and WhatsApp seeking details on the identities of participants and administrators, apart from chats, videos and documents.Read more: Toolkit case: Disha Ravi first to be arrested, many others involved, say Delhi Police“These details will help us ascertain the sequence of events leading to the creation of the Google toolkit documents and the role each participant played in it,” said a senior police officer requesting anonymity.A second police officer, who did not want to be named, said PJF founder Mo Dhaliwal contacted Ravi, Jacob and Muluk through a Canada-based woman named Puneet.“Jacob was the first one to be contacted by Puneet in the first week of December and was intimated about the PJF’s ‘bigger plans’ pertaining to the farmers’ agitation. We have reason to believe that after Jacob agreed to be part of the plan, she roped in Muluk and Disha,” the officer said. He added that the first toolkit that Thunberg posted and deleted contained the name of a man identified as Pieter Friedrich, who police claimed was associated with Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).Read more: Disha Ravi can get warm clothes, masks and books in police custody, says Delhi courtThe activists rejected the charges. Senior counsel Mihir Desai, representing Jacob, said the toolkit meant to provide digital support for the farmers’ protest. “It does not talk about any violence or about the January 26 incident at the Red Fort,” Desai argued.Advocate Hiten Venegaonkar, who appeared for Delhi Police’s cyber crime unit, said Jacob was part of a larger group formed to support the protest and added the toolkit was prepared and authored by Jacob and Ravi.Muluk’s advocate said it would take him time to reach New Delhi and file an application for anticipatory bail. The petition states that he and others were only supporting the dissenters, who are farmers. The plea said the applicant was 34, had done well in his field, had a bright future, and that police action would be destructive for his life and family.In Delhi, chief metropolitan magistrate Pankaj Sharma allowed seven applications moved by Ravi. The judge allowed her to speak to her mother and family members for 15 minutes over telephone after her counsel told court that five minutes were not enough. The court also permitted Ravi’s counsel to meet her for 30 minutes every day. Besides the FIR, the court also directed the police to provide her copies of the arrest memo and remand documents used to seek her custodial interrogation.Read more: Delhi women's panel sends notice to police over Disha Ravi’s arrestPolice action in the case has come under sharp criticism from activists and experts, who argue that Delhi Police violated procedure by not informing Bengaluru police in time, producing Ravi in a local court or providing her with a lawyer. The toolkit first hit the headlines two weeks ago when Thunberg shared it on social media along with a post in support of the agitating farmers. Shortly afterwards, Delhi Police registered an FIR on charges of criminal conspiracy and sedition, but did not name any individual.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/toolkit-case-some-relief-for-activists-as-police-defend-action-101613501021410.html
17-02-2021||India||Army releases new visuals showing Pangong Tso disengagement in top gear||Fresh visuals released by the Indian Army on Tuesday showed that disengagement in eastern Ladakh’s Pangong Tso sector is in top gear, with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers dismantling their bunkers, tented camps and pillboxes, and retreating from barren heights on both banks of the lake to vehicles waiting at the nearest road-heads to carry them back to their bases.This forms part of the February 10 agreement on disengagement between India and China that makes it binding on the two sides to remove structures they constructed on the mountains after April 2020 when border tensions began.The new visuals showed PLA using earth-moving machinery to level structures built by it to support forward-deployed troops on heights. Disengagement between rival soldiers deployed on heights on the north and south banks of Pangong Tso began on February 10, and will be completed by the weekend, as previously reported by Hindustan Times.New images show disengagement in top gear in Pangong Tso sector. pic.twitter.com/6N5kYcVqaeThe images also captured what the areas looked like before and after the disengagement. One of the several images released showed a group of Chinese soldiers in battle fatigues lugging a portable generator from a bunker.Armoured and artillery elements of both armies retreated to their respective positions from heights on the south bank last week. The Army released some new images of rival tanks disengaging from heights on the south bank.The pictures give an idea of the scale and extent of the deployment, build-up and heavy equipment like tanks that were employed in the standoff, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd).“I have maintained that the start of the disengagement process is a positive step as it separates the two forces from an eyeball-to-eyeball situation that could trigger some local incident. We have a long way to go but at least the first step has been taken,” Hooda added.Also read: Karnataka imposes restrictions on travel from Kerala amid Covid spike in B'luruThe last three days saw the PLA remove a jetty near Finger 5 on the north bank of Pangong Tso, take down structures at a make-shift helipad and dismantle scores of observations towers, bunkers and shelters.“Both sides have pulled back a large number of their troops deployed on heights on the two banks. Some concrete structures are being dismantled. Disengagement is progressing smoothly and will be over in the next three to four days,” officials familiar with the developments said.Senior commanders of the two armies are likely to meet next week to discuss disengagement at other friction points in eastern Ladakh.Smooth disengagement in the Pangong Tso area augurs well for subsequent disengagement at other friction points, Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), a former director-general of military operations, said last week.The disengagement will be phased, coordinated and verified at all friction points, and could be a time-consuming process. “As long as disengagement is successful, time is not of the essence,” Bhatia had said then.The PLA is retreating to its base, east of Finger 8 on the north bank of Pangong Tso, while the Indian Army is moving back to its permanent position near Finger 3. Neither side will patrol the contested areas in between until an agreement is reached through future talks.Outstanding problems with the PLA at Depsang, Hot Springs and Gogra - friction points on the contested border - will be tackled after full disengagement in the Pangong Tso area.The outstanding issues relating to the deployment and patrolling at the three friction points will be taken up within 48 hours of the pullback of troops in the Pangong Tso area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-releases-new-visuals-showing-pangong-tso-disengagement-in-top-gear-101613485806619.html
