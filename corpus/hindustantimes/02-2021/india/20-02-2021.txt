We would request the central government to bring reform and handle Goa's case separately. We got Liberation in 1961 and we did not get a second renewal. It has impacted the state economy and employment,” Sawant told the meeting.Mining in Goa is shut since 2018 when the Supreme Court decreed that all of Goa’s 88 mining leases were renewed illegally and that they should in fact have been granted as fresh leases and not renewals.“Our major export was mining. Since mining is banned, our exports are banned. In the pharma sector there is export (but) all exports of pharma products are carried out through JNPT,” Sawant said.“We had requested for a medical device park to enhance pharma exports. We need infrastructure at Mormugao Port to facilitate this which will bring us relief,” Sawant said.Despite promises to help restart mining, the ‘cure’ sought by the Goa government in the form of an ‘amendment’ to the Act has not been acceded to by the Central government.Sawant also said that Goa being a small state with much of the area as eco-sensitive was ‘missing out’ on Central government projects owing to the large nature of such projects.“Goa is the smallest state, which has an area of only 3702 sq. km which is Western Ghats on the eastern side and the Arabian Sea to the west. We have maintained 66 per cent forest cover, private forests, eco sensitive zones, wetland zones and CRZ activity. Only 30 per cent land is available for development activities. We seek relief for smaller states and UTs by way of (an) amendment,” Sawant said without elaborating on what amendments he was seeking.Sawant also pitched for amendments to the CRZ regulation to allow for mining of Goa’s riverbeds for sand to help meet the state’s sand demand besides also asking the Centre to sanction those central projects for the state that do not require much space.“Central projects need huge land. We are requesting vertical mobility for such projects. This will bring relief for small states, which cannot spare a lot of land for central government projects,” he said at the meeting.Sawant also raised the Mahadayi issue before the council saying that the state needed ‘help’ as it needed the water of the Mahadayi for drinking while raising fears that with Karnataka having diverted the river, the salinity in Goa was bound to increase inland.“The salinity testing for it had been carried out by the WRD minister. If Mahadayi water level reduces and it is diverted, then salinity may increase, which may again cause problems. This is a sensitive issue in the state,” Sawant said.Sawant while thanking the Prime Minister for the ₹300 crore bonanza also pledged to help the Centre complete projects like the Mopa International Airport, the state’s second airport, highway and railway expansion and other projects that have been met with resistance in Goa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-cm-pramod-sawant-pitches-for-resumption-of-iron-ore-mining-at-pm-s-meet-101613844608050.html

During this period, the country's per capita income rose from ₹63,462 to ₹134,226, a growth of 111.51 per cent. The per capita income of Odisha in 2019-20 at current prices was higher than that of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Meghalaya, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.The survey found that the long-term increasing trend in per capita income was possible due to the adoption of new-age technology, implementation of new agricultural policy, boosting industrial investment and other such growth-promoting measures which led to higher GSDP growth in Odisha.Also read: India, Maldives sign 5 deals, EAM hands over 1 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccinesDue to the impact of Covid-19, the per-capita income of Odisha is expected to decline by 2.30 per cent as against the decline of 5.41 per cent at the national level."The Covid-19 surge took an unprecedented toll on the state’s economy by creating both supply and demand shocks. A contraction in economic activity and government measures to minimise the adverse impact stemming from the Covid-19 pandemic, with frequent lockdowns, weak demand conditions and the temporary suspension of company operations led to the shutdown of business, industries and services," the survey said.However, Odisha’s real per capita income has consistently remained below the national average and the gap between the country's and state's per capita income has widened over the years. It swelled from ₹14,963 in 2011-12 to ₹29,660 in 2019-20.As per a World Bank study (2016), consumption inequality in the state is lower than the national average. The study confirmed that poverty reduction is faster in Odisha in comparison to many low-income states. As per the Planning Commission’s report, Odisha reduced the poverty rate by 24.61 per cent since 2004-05 which is the second-highest across all the states and far ahead of the national rate of 15.28 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odishas-per-capita-income-to-decline-by-over-2-due-to-covid19-101613843215225.html

The inclusion will entitle them 15 per cent reservations in government jobs and education.Panchamashali Lingayat sect seers and leaders are demanding that their existing reservation category be changed from 3B to 2A in the State's Other Backward Community (OBC) list. They are currently on a 450-km padayatra which will culminate in the Bengaluru rally on February 21.People aware of the developments say that the BJP is trying to convince the seers leading the agitation to submit just a memorandum on 21 February but the other stakeholders, including from the opposition parties, want to keep the pressure on the government.Basavajaya Mrityunjaya Swami, an influential seer from the Koodalasangama Panchamasali Mahapeetha, had recently said that they would surround Vidhana Soudha, the seat of power in Karnataka, until their demands are met.Chief minister BS Yediyurappa had earlier this month ordered for a detailed assessment and report on the socio-economic conditions of the Panchamasali Lingayats.The state government is facing demands for revision of the existing quota from various communities too, including the dominant Vokkaliga and Veerashaiva-Lingayat.Also making the demands are the backward Kuruba community which is seeking the Scheduled Tribe (ST) tag, and the Valmikis who want ST quota to be hiked from three per cent to 7.5 per cent.Yediyurappa belongs to the Veerashaiva-Lingayat community. Amid these demands, he had said that his government would do whatever was possible within the ambit of the law and the Constitution.Karnataka at present provides 15 per cent reservation for SCs, 3 per cent for STs and 32 per cent for the other backward classes (OBC), which adds up to 50 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quota-crisis-in-karnataka-panchamasalis-to-hold-rally-in-bengaluru-on-sunday-101613841594541.html

Seven workers of a poultry farm in southern Russia, were found to be infected where an outbreak was recorded among the birds in December.What is H5N8?The H5N8 is a sub-type of the Influenza A virus that causes flu-like symptoms in birds and mammals. Before Russia reported its first case of human transmission H5N8 was largely believed to be restricted to birds and poultry. The more widely known strain of avian influenza is the H1N1, which is responsible for all the major flu outbreaks, like 1918 Spanish flu, the 2009 Swine flu outbreak et al. Reuters reported that in recent months outbreaks of the H5N8 strain have been reported in Russia, Europe, China, the Middle East and North Africa but only ever in poultry till Saturday.Is it lethal for humans?The H5N8 strain of avian influenza is not lethal for humans, a fact that Anna Popova, head of Russian consumer health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor, attested to. The seven Russian poultry farm workers who had been infected are doing okay, according to Reuters. Recently, an H5N8 outbreak was reported in Beed district of Maharashtra, reported news agency ANI.Properly cooked meat or poultry and boiled eggs are considered to be safe for human consumption by the ministry of fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying. "It is appealed to the citizens that they should not consume raw, half-cooked poultry meat or eggs. It is also urged not to spread misconceptions and rumors based on unscientific information about bird flu," said the ministry.During the budget season of the Parliament, minister of state for health Ashwini Choubey, told Lok Sabha that strains of H5N1, H5N8, and H5 have been detected in India so far. However, no laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza have been reported in the country. Reuters reported on February 3, in the midst of a similar outbreak in Germany, that risk to human beings is considered to be low and it mostly leads to massive culling of poultry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-you-need-to-know-about-h5n8-strain-of-avian-flu-101613840338836.html

20-02-2021||India||Military commanders discuss further disengagement in eastern Ladakh||Senior military commanders of the Indian and Chinese armies on Saturday met in eastern Ladakh to discuss the roadmap for further disengagement of their troops at friction points on the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC), with the talks taking place after the completion of the first round of disengagement in the Pangong Tso sector, people tracking the developments said on the condition of anonymity.The corps commander-ranked officers met at Moldo on the Chinese side of the LAC for the 10th round of military dialogue to ease tensions in the Ladakh sector. The talks began at 10 am and were in progress when this report was filed.Outstanding problems with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) at Depsang, Hot Springs and Gogra - friction points on the contested border - were on the agenda, said one of the persons cited above.“The proposals discussed during the talks to normalise the border situation will be put up by both sides before their higher authorities. The agreement on the next steps of disengagement will be finalised after that. We expect disengagement at the remaining friction points to proceed smoothly as it did in the main trouble area (Pangong Tso heights),” said a second person.Also read: Over 5,000 Covid-19 variants in India - Here are more transmissible onesThe India-China border standoff began last May and saw both sides deploy 50,000 troops each in the Ladakh theatre along with advanced weaponry.The PLA’s deployments in Depsang have hindered access of Indian soldiers to Patrolling Points (PP) 10, 11, 11-A, 12 and 13, as previously reported by Hindustan Times.The Indian Army’s patrolling activity has also been affected in Hot Springs and Gogra, where rival troops are forward deployed and where skeletal disengagement took place last year, but the gains could not be consolidated.The Pangong disengagement took place on strategic heights on both banks of the lake. It saw the two armies pull back their frontline troops, tanks, infantry combat vehicles (ICVs) and artillery guns under an agreement reached earlier this month. The disengagement began on February 10.“I think we should not expect very speedy results (in other areas). Depsang, in particular, is one area where discussions to arrive at a consensus could be protracted,” former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda said on the eve of the military talks.The disengagement will be phased, coordinated and verified at all friction points. The first round of disengagement at Pangong Tso involved the pulling back of troops deployed eyeball-to-eyeball on the Finger 4 ridgeline at heights of almost 18,000 feet as well as withdrawing soldiers holding positions on the Kailash range on the south bank.On the north bank, the PLA has retreated to its base east of Finger 8, while the Indian Army has moved back to its permanent position near Finger 3. Under the disengagement agreement, neither side will patrol the contested areas in between Fingers 4 and 8 until an agreement is reached through future talks.The Indian claim line extends to Finger 8, while the Chinese claim is up to Finger 4.India’s bold moves on the south bank of Pangong Tso last August boosted the army’s bargaining power during military talks and eventually led to an agreement on disengagement. The Indian Army occupied a series of key heights to prevent the PLA from grabbing Indian territory on the south bank in a stealthy midnight move on August 29, 2020.The Indian Army followed this up by rushing its front-line tanks and ICVs to strategic heights held by its soldiers.Northern Army commander Lieutenant General YK Joshi told media last week that India and China were on the brink of war after the actions on the south bank.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/military-commanders-discuss-further-disengagement-in-eastern-ladakh-101613837415070.html

20-02-2021||India||Over 5,000 Covid-19 variants prevalent in India, say scientists: Here are more transmissible ones||A group of scientists have said that more than 5,000 variants of the coronavirus are prevalent in India. The scientists, however, said that the novel variants that are worrying many countries globally have been identified with only a low prevalence in India so far.The study has been carried out by Hyderabad-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR).Presenting the exhaustive list of the 5,000 variants, the scientists said that some of these variants - like E484K mutation and the N501Y mutation - have higher transmission rate."However, their apparent low prevalence might be simply because not enough sequencing has been done. More coronavirus genomes need to be sequenced across the country to accurately identify the emergence of these and other new variants," said Dr Rakesh Mishra, Director, CCMB and corresponding author on the study.These variants have been discovered after the sudden spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra. All these strains are of A2 type of coronavirus, which is common in India.One of these mutations - the N440K - was found in a sample collected from Yavatmal in Maharashtra and is more prevalent in South India. N440K was a very small number in September and October last year. But now it is getting a much bigger proportion."Closer surveillance is needed to understand the spread of N440K properly. Accurate and timely detection of new variants that may show greater infectivity or worse clinical symptoms, including immune escape, will be extremely important to preempt disastrous consequences," said Dr Mishra.In their research, the authors explain how different coronavirus variants gained prevalence in India during the last year."One of the variants called the A3i had mutations that were predicted to make its spread slower. The study confirms that it was overtaken by the globally prevalent A2a variant, carrying the D614G mutation, by June 2020. The A2a variant has remained in global dominance for the major part of the year 2020. The recently discovered variants in many countries have raised concerns because of their mutations in the Spike protein, that makes the coat of the virus and come in contact with the human cells," said the research.Dr Surabhi Srivastava, the lead author of the study, said that the success in development and administration of vaccines is promising but other non-therapeutic prevention measures, such as masks and physical distancing, will still prove to be the most effective in curbing further spread of the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-5-000-covid-19-variants-prevalent-in-india-here-are-more-dangerous-ones-101613834000235.html

20-02-2021||India||Congress in Uttarakhand protests farm laws, soaring fuel prices||The opposition Congress on Saturday held state wide marches across Uttarakhand against the farm laws rising fuel prices and accusing the BJP governments at the Centre and in the state of doing nothing to give relief to the common man.The protests were held in the headquarters of all the 13 districts. In Dehradun, the march was attended by hundreds of party workers and was led by party state president Pritam Singh and leader of Opposition Indira Hridayesh. The state unit’s vice president Suryakant Dhasmana, general secretary Vijay Saraswat, Dehradun city unit president Lal Chand Sharma and other leaders were also among the protesters.Addressing the protesters, Pritam Singh launched a scathing attack on the BJP governments at the Centre and in the state of "not fulfilling their promises to the public of bringing down prices.""Before coming to power in 2017, the BJP had said a double engine government would boost development in the state by curbing prices of essential commodities. But now with the common man suffering due to high fuel prices, the promise is nowhere to be seen," said Singh."Today due to high inflation, a common man cannot buy both vegetables and lentils. The petrol price has touched ₹100 per litre for the first time in history while the price of LPG cylinder has touched ₹900 from ₹400. The poor and farmers are suffering but the government is absolutely paying no heed."Leader of Opposition, Hridayesh too attacked the BJP government saying it is doing nothing for the welfare of people."The government doesn't even care for the sufferings of the people. All it cares about is to safeguard the interests of a handful of crony capitalists. The only way to give relief to the public is the ousting of BJP from the state in 2022 assembly elections," said Hridayesh.In Haldwani, the march was led by party district president Satish Nainwal."The Congress is protesting against the anti-people governments in the Centre and state by coming out on the road. This protest will continue as we are raising the voice of people," said Nainwal.The BJP tried to brush away the protests saying "it is desperate to find any ground in the political scenario in the state before 2022 elections.""The Congress has been rejected by the public long ago. Hence it is showing its desperation with such events which have no support of the public which will again rule it out in the 2022 elections by supporting the BJP for its development works," said BJP state president Bansidhar Bhagat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-in-uttarakhand-protests-farm-laws-soaring-fuel-prices-101613832271597.html

The aircraft was halted and all the 64 passengers disembarked. Everybody is safe and there are no injuries to anybody,” the spokesperson said.Nineteen of the passengers were Vijayawada-bound, while the remaining 45 were supposed to continue up to Tiruchirappalli. “They have been taken to the airport lounge and alternative arrangements are being made to ferry them to their destination,” the spokesperson said.Though it is a minor accident, the airport authorities have ordered an inquiry into the incident as per protocol. “Whether the aircraft’s wing hit the lamp-post due to improper marking on the taxiway or for any other reason will be known during the investigations,” he said.An official at the Vijayawada airport, who pleaded anonymity, said the lamp-post was uprooted due to the impact of the wing of the aircraft that hit it and there was some damage to the wing as well.“The passengers received a jolt as the aircraft was brought to a halt suddenly. Luckily, it was moving very slowly,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ai-express-flight-hits-lamp-post-on-landing-at-vijayawada-s-gannavaram-airport-101613831506279.html

20-02-2021||India||Andhra govt won’t allow Vizag steel privatisation, says YSRC Rajya Sabha MP||In an attempt to wrest the political initiative from the opposition parties, YSR Congress party general secretary and Rajya Sabha member Vijay Sai Reddy on Saturday took out a 25-km long padayatra in protest against the proposed privatisation of Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL), better known as Visakhapatnam Steel Plant.Accompanied by a large number of YSRC leaders including ministers, MLAs and party activists, besides steel plant workers and other followers, Reddy began his padayatra at Mahatma Gandhi statue in the heart of Visakhapatnam city in the morning.It passed through the major streets of the port city and culminated in a public rally at Kurmannapalem gate of the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant at Gajuwaka in the evening.Addressing the rally, Reddy said the YSRC government in the state would make all out efforts to see that the steel plant was not privatised. “It will remain a public sector undertaking under any circumstances. Though it is a central government undertaking, the state government will not allow the plant to go into the hands of the private sector,” he said.The MP called upon all political parties to come together and continue the fight against the privatisation of the steel plant. “We shall take the fight to Delhi and convince the Centre to drop the privatisation proposal,” he said.Reddy took pot shots at Telugu Desam Party president N Chandrababu Naidu for “politicising” the Visakhapatnam steel plant privatisation issue. “If Naidu was so much concerned about the steel plant, why didn’t he write a letter to the Centre condemning the privatisation?” he asked.The TDP, however, accused the YSRC leader of adopting double standards. Former minister and senior TDP leader from Visakhapatnam Bandaru Satyanarayana Murthy said Sai Reddy' padayatra was an eyewash as the latter was playing a secret role in the efforts to sell the steel plant to South Korea’s POSCO.The TDP leader alleged that the Jagan Mohan Reddy government had already entered into an understanding with POSCO. “The YSRC MP should swear in front of the public that he did not know about this shady deal. In fact, it was Reddy who had held consultations with the representatives of POSCO several times,” he charged.He said the TDP would continue to expose the misdeeds of the ruling party and its attempts to grab the public properties in the port city.The party launched a 'missed call' campaign on Thursday to record people's voices of support for the 'Save Visakha Steel' agitation on the mobile number 80999 81981. Till now, more than 20,000 missed calls were received so far, a statement from the TDP headquarters in Guntur said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-govt-won-t-allow-vizag-steel-privatisation-says-ysrc-rajya-sabha-mp-101613829201003.html
20-02-2021||India||Maharashtra records 6,281 Covid-19 cases; highest spike in Mumbai since December||For the second consecutive day, Maharashtra reported more than 6,000 new Coronavirus cases — after a gap of more than three months — indicating a worrying situation for the state. The state on Saturday reported 6,281 fresh Covid-19 cases, a little higher than Friday. Mumbai, on the other hand, recorded 897 new covid-19 cases, the highest single-day spike in infections since December.On Friday, the number of fresh cases in Maharashtra was 6,112. On Thursday, it was 5,427 and on Wednesday, the single-day spike was at 4,787. Wednesday's tally put the state on an alert as that figure was the highest in the last 70 days. On December 9, Maharashtra had registered 4,981 cases following which the single-day number of cases started to come down. But as the upward trend is continuing for days and the trajectory is only moving upwards, the rise can't be dismissed as a stray occurrence.BMC seals more than 1,300 buildings as Covid-19 cases continue to surge in MumbaiWith 6,281 new cases on Saturday, the caseload in the state rose to 2,093,913, while 40 fatalities took the death toll to 51,753.Mumbai on Friday reported 823 new Covid-19 cases, which was the highest single-day spike since December. But Saturday's number broke that record as the city reported near 900 fresh cases on Saturday. At the beginning of the week, Mumbai's daily Covid-19 count was below 500. Since Wednesday, the count crossed the 700-mark.The sudden spike in fresh infections in Maharashtra is being primarily attributed to two factors: the reopening, including that of the Mumbai local trains, and the mutant strain found in districts like Akola, Satara, Amravati etc. While a weekend lockdown has been imposed in Amravati and Akola, Yavatmal is under a 10-day lockdown, which started last Thursday.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation had earlier ruled out any reimposition of restrictions in Mumbai, though the city has been brought under strong surveillance.The civic body on Saturday sealed 1,305 buildings from where 2,749 cases were reported in the last few days. Any buildings with more than five Covid-19 patients will be sealed, BMC said in its new guidelines.Though the resumption of Mumbai locals is being seen as a major contributor to the Covid-19 cases, the authorities have not yet taken any decision on whether to restrict its timing. Around 300 marshals have been deployed to keep an eye on the passengers.With the surge in Covid-19 cases, Maharashtra is once again reporting the highest number of daily cases, surpassing Kerala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-records-6-281-covid-19-cases-highest-spike-in-mumbai-since-december-101613828414452.html

20-02-2021||India||Ahead of polls, Assam cabinet hikes daily wage of tea garden workers||The Assam cabinet on Saturday decided to hike the daily wage of tea garden workers by ₹50 from ₹167 to ₹217 ahead of assembly polls in the state due in April-May.Parliamentary affairs minister Chandra Mohan Patowary informed after the meeting that tea garden workers would also get ₹101 daily for rations-- effectively taking their daily earnings to ₹318.Organisations of tea garden workers have been demanding an increase in their daily wages to ₹351 for a long time. In 2018, the state government had increased wages of tea garden workers by ₹30 taking it to ₹167.The cabinet also formed a one-member committee comprising principal secretary JB Ekka to look into ways in which a similar hike can be done in small tea gardens of the state.Saturday’s cabinet decision comes six days after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi announced at a poll rally in Assam that if the party comes to power in the state it would hike the wages from ₹167 to ₹365 daily.Nearly 1.1 million workers are employed in around 800 tea gardens in the state especially in upper Assam. These workers and their families have a significant role in the outcome of nearly 40 of the total 126 seats in the state assembly.Saturday’s wage hike is just one of the many schemes the BJP-led government has announced for this section of voters since coming to power for the first time in the state in 2016.They include the promise of scheduled tribe status to the tea-tribe community and cash transfers of ₹2500/ ₹3000 to bank accounts of nearly 8 lakh tea garden workers at a cost of ₹220 crore to the state exchequer.Other benefits include free rice, cash benefits to pregnant women, reservation of seats in educational institutions, setting up schools in tea gardens as well as providing mobile phones, bicycles, money to meritorious students and funds to young men to set up small businesses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-polls-assam-cabinet-hikes-daily-wage-of-tea-garden-workers-101613826415865.html

The worst is not over and unless we follow all precautions, unless we follow due diligence we will not be able to get over the pandemic so easily,” Dr Mande said.He said that the world has so far been ‘lucky’ that the Sars-CoV2 virus was not as deadly as some of the previous world pandemics but nonetheless has come as a huge reality check for countries across the world.Dr Mande also said that the mutations in the virus which he said is the natural course for any such spreading virus have so far also been minimal which allows the vaccines to remain effective.“We have been priding ourselves over the last 30-40 years that our healthcare systems can deal with any kind of situation or emergency that arises. The current pandemic is a grim reminder that it is not the case. We have been found to be wanting in all respects. In fact the most advanced nations, the nations that prided themselves on having the most advanced healthcare systems have been worst affected,” he said.“That's a grim reminder that such kinds of pandemics will continue hitting us, will continue hitting humanity and we better be prepared for them. There are much more serious problems staring at us….Climate change has the potential to throw up way worse pandemics than Covid,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-covid-spike-csir-chief-warns-against-complacency-says-worst-not-over-yet-101613827310203.html

20-02-2021||India||Punjab CM Amarinder Singh raises farm laws, Covid-19 vaccination, GST compensation in NITI Aayog meeting||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh Saturday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ensure urgent resolution to the ongoing farmers' "unrest", and an early release of the state's pending GST compensation.In his pre-recorded address for the sixth Governing Council virtual meeting of Niti Aayog, the Congress leader also proposed that states are consulted before deciding the priority list for Covid-19 vaccination.Singh, who could not attend the meeting as he was unwell, also expressed concerns over the threat to Punjab's agriculture sector as a result of the "disruptions caused by the three new farm laws", according to a state government release.Farmers have been protesting against the three new Central agricultural laws enacted in September last year, and demanding they be repealed.Singh also raised the issue of Covid-19 vaccine, urging the Centre to consult the state before fixing priorities for vaccination, as the exercise, he argued, involves the entire population.He also requested the Centre to release Punjab's pending GST compensation, amounting to ₹8,253 crore for the period between April 2020 and January 2021.Urging respect for the 'annadaata' (the farmer), the CM reiterated his government's stand that agriculture is a state subject it should be left to be legislated upon by states in the true spirit of "cooperative federalism" enshrined in the Constitution.He also pointed out that the state has already passed amendments to the Central legislations.The CM asserted in his speech that any reform in a sector affecting almost 60 per cent of the country's workforce must be brought only through a process of extensive consultation with all the stakeholders, of which Punjab is a key member being at the forefront of ensuring food security for the nation.He also raised the farmers' apprehension that the Minimum Support Price-based procurement through Food Corporation of India (or agencies on its behalf) may be discontinued in view of the Shanta Kumar Committee Report of 2015.The CM also stressed the need for the government of India to decisively dispel any such impression "to instil proper confidence in the farmers of the state".Singh also used the forum to once again reiterate the state government's demand for a bonus of ₹100 per quintal of paddy procured as straw management compensation.He requested the Centre to provide ₹5 crore per megawatt financial support for biomass power projects and ₹3.5 crore per MW for biomass solar hybrid projects to the state as Viability Gap Fund (VGF) to help alleviate the effects of paddy straw burning through ex-situ utilisation of available paddy straw with good returns to the farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-cm-raises-farm-laws-covid-19-vaccination-in-niti-aayog-meeting-101613823825434.html

20-02-2021||India||Order on Disha Ravi's bail plea reserved, judge asks for evidence linking toolkit to R-Day violence||A Delhi court on Saturday reserved its order on the bail plea of Disha Ravi, the climate activist who has been accused by the police of creating a toolkit to help farmers protesting against Centre's farm laws. She was arersted on February 13.The court will now pronounce its order on Tuesday, the judge said. While the Delhi Police vehemently opposed Ravi's bail plea, her lawyer rubbished all the charges against the 22-year-old activist.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) SV Raju, representing Delhi Police, linked the toolkit with the violence in Delhi on Repblic Day. The judge then asked about any evidence linking the two.On Saturday, additional sessions Judge Dharmendra Rana asked, "Is there is any evidence or are we acting on the basis of surmises and conjectures?" To this, Additional Solicitor General (ASG) SV Raju appearing on behalf of Delhi Police replied that the document will have to be read along with the hashtags and links it contained, which were meant to "instigate people asking them to come on streets thus resulting in public disorder".The police further said that they have arrested seven people and investigation is on."It is not a simple or innocent toolkit. This is not only one individual who have been involved and they are aware of the Khalistani movement," said ASG Raju.Swedish activist Greta Thunberg had briefly tweeted a link to the toolkit earlier this month that police are investigating before replacing it with an "updated" one."In garb of farmers' protest, they wanted to carry out anti-national activities. After the toolkit got leaked in the social media, a cover-up operation was done and many parts of the toolkit were deleted. They panicked. Had they not done anything wrong, they would not have destroyed the evidences," said the lawyer.He also pointed to the involvement of Poetic Justice Foundation (PJF), a Canada-based organisation headed by Mo Dhaliwal."Dhaliwal's object it to create a Khalistani state. He has stated on his social media about it. He was mobilising support for its creation. They wanted to take advantage of the farmer agitation and carry out their activities. They needed an Indian face. If they would have done it directly, then they would have been exposed," said Raju.Justice Rana then again asked him about incriminating material collected against Ravi. The lawyer replied that Ravi has been involved in evidence tampering. "Such persons cannot be enlarged on bail," the ASG said.Her lawyer Sidharth Agarwal denied the allegations and said that Ravi's cause is only environment and the farmers. He also said that Ravi's history has nothing to do with the Khalistan movement. "There is no disaffection being spread by the toolkit," said Agarwal.Rejecting the charge of incitement of violence, he further said, "The toolkit says that people should join the march of Republic Day. Police gave the permission for the march and if I call people to join the march, then can I be called seditious?"Ravi moved the bail please a day after she was sent to three-day judicial custody by a court in connection with the toolkit case. She was earlier sent to five-day police custody after the cops claimed that Ravi created the toolkit - a Google document - to help farmers protesting against government's three farm laws.The Delhi Police started investigation in the toolkit case after Thunberg's tweet in favour of farmers' protest.The farmers have been protesting near Delhi since late November, calling for the repeal of the three central laws. The government has held multiple rounds of talks with the protesters but the impasse continues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/order-on-disha-ravi-s-bail-plea-reserved-judge-asks-for-evidence-linking-toolkit-to-r-day-violence-101613820688658.html
20-02-2021||India||AIIMS chief Dr Guleria calls for public-private partnership for large scale Covid-19 vaccine rollout||Terming the recent drop in Covid-19 cases in the country as a "small window of opportunity", AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria on Saturday called for a public-private partnership (PPP) for rollout of the Covid-19 vaccination programme at a large scale.Speaking at an AIMA event here, Guleria said the vaccine is the only weapon available to gain immunity and help reduce mortality rate due to the infectious disease.He noted that there was a need to put healthcare at the centrestage and not consider it only as a service sector."As far as vaccination is concerned there is still a lot to do and I think there has to be more private public partnership," the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) director said.There is a need to gradually start opening up in order to cover large number of people, he noted."Vaccinating health care workers and front line workers is probably the easy part as far as Phase 1 is concerned as you know who needs to be vaccinated. The number is not that large."Once you start the process to vaccinate 27 crore individuals, in that scenario we must have a robust programme in place where you have the list of people to be vaccinated," Guleria said.He further said: "We need to develop a mechanism where public and private sector actually start rolling out the vaccine at a large scale."Guleria noted that there is an urgency to roll out the vaccine to a large number of people as there were dosages available due to some level of hesitancy in the healthcare and frontline workers."I personally feel we have a window of opportunity available now because our cases are down, but this window can change anytime as we have seen in various parts of the world, specially with new variants coming up from different countries."So we should not lose this moment and try to vaccinate a large number of our citizens which will be able to provide some level of protection as far as Covid-19 is concerned," he said.He added that the country still doesn't have an effective anti viral drug so the only weapon that can be actually utilised is the vaccine."We have this small window before things may worsen and therefore we should take whatever vaccine we get and immunise ourselves so that we are able to decrease mortality and really have another spike in cases in the country," Guleria emphasised.He noted that there has been lot of learning from the pandemic and there should be more emphasis on becoming self-reliant in the healthcare sector."What we realised during the initial days of pandemic is that you have to do with stuff which is available in your own country. We had shortage of PPEs, N95 masks and even ventilators because they were not available in the country. Even diagnostics became a challenge. So we have to become self-reliant in many ways and we have to put health at the centrestage," he noted.Guleria said that health is an important factor as it affects all areas including economy and livelihood.Rather than looking it only as a service sector, "healthcare should be looked as the centre which could be easily used to push the economy", he said.He added that the country should not only aspire to become a medical research hub but also the patient care hub for the world."I think India has the capacity to do that," he said.Earlier, speaking the event, Apollo Hospitals vice chairperson Preetha Reddy lauded the government efforts in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic in the country.She said the country has shown the way to the entire world in dealing with the infectious disease.

20-02-2021||India||Disha Ravi’s bail plea hearing: Key points made in court||A Delhi court on Saturday reserved its order on the bail plea moved by Bengaluru-based climate activist Disha Ravi, who was arrested by the Delhi Police on February 13 in connection with the toolkit controversy related to the farmers’ agitation. Ravi was sent to a three-day judicial custody on Friday after her five-day police custody had expired.During the hearing, the Delhi Police opposed Ravi’s bail plea. Representing the Police, Additional Solicitor General (ASG) SV Raju stated that the toolkit got leaked on social media platforms and several parts of the document got deleted. He also said that the toolkit - apart from giving details of the protest against the Centre’s three new farm laws - also had information that defamed the Indian Army.The lawyer added that there was an intention to make the agitation global as Ravi had been in contact with Mo Dhaliwal and Anita Lal. Dhaliwal is the founder of the Canada-based Poetic Justice Foundation (PJF) and has been using the farmers’ movement to fuel the Khalistani movement in India, according to a police official.Here are some of the major points that were made during the hearing:1. The ASG told the court that after the toolkit got leaked in social media platforms, a cover-up operation had been executed and several parts of the document got deleted. He questioned as to why the evidence was deleted if there was no wrongdoing. Ravi was later charged with sections 201 and 204 of the Indian penal Code (IPC) - that deal with the disappearance and destruction of evidence.2. He also pointed out that the toolkit had a cheat sheet, which had details that ‘defame the Indian Army and had nothing to do with the protest against the farm laws.’ He added that Ravi was part of a global conspiracy to defame India and further create unrest in the garb of protests.3. The 22-year-old climate activist from Bengaluru prepared and shared the toolkit with those who were advocating Khalistani movement and it was not a ‘simple or innocent toolkit’, the lawyer told the court.4. With regard to the other two accused in the tool kit case - Nikita Jacob and Shantanu Muluk - Raju said that Ravi was in touch with these people and since she and Nikita were women, Shantanu was sent to Delhi to check the execution of the toolkit.5. Reiterating on his previous point, Raju said that the purpose was to make the protest international, adding that Ravi, Shantanu and others had been in touch with Mo Dhaliwal and Anita Lal.6. Amid all these arguments, the judge questioned ASG Raju whether there was any evidence or statements were being made on the basis of conjectures.7. The judge further demanded what ‘incriminating material’ had the Police collected against Ravi to which Raju replied that the toolkit has emails, links which were removed and added that it was evident that she was aware about all this.8. The judge further sought evidence collected against Ravi in connection to the violence that broke out during the farmers’ tractor rally on Republic Day in Delhi.9. Meanwhile, Ravi’s counsel Sidharth Aggarwal told the court that she did not have any prior links with Poetic Justice Foundation (PJF) as it was founded only in 2020. He added that Ravi’s history and Geography was in no way connected to the Khalistani movement.10. Referring to the interim protection given to Shantanu, Aggarwal added that why should her client (Disha) be kept in custody and she could join the investigation as and when it is directed.(With inputs from Richa Banka)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disha-ravi-s-bail-plea-hearing-key-points-made-in-court-101613820872503.html

It is an anti-national speech; hate speech, which tried to create division among people of this country. Especially, he has talked about [ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's ideological fountainhead] RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh], which is one of the most patriotic organisations in the country," Bommai said.PFI general secretary Anis Ahmed appealed to the people not to donate money for the temple at the rally. “This is not Ram Mandir. It is RSS Mandir. Not one penny of Muslims should be used for a single brick to build the RSS temple,” he said.Bommai later told reporters that he has ordered the local police to “take cognisance” and “take action” against Ahmed.Police said they have filed the two cases against 13 people including under the Indian Penal Code's sections related to unlawful assembly, disobedience to order by a public servant, and promotion of enmity.Ahmed, who has not been named in the cases, said he has not received any information from the police about them.Police commissioner N Shashi Kumar said the PFI was given permission only for a stage programme, considering the prevailing pandemic and the law and situation.

The state government is not ready for it."Congress member Bahinipati said the speaker has not accepted their notice for a discussion on the paddy procurement issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalemate-continues-in-odisha-assembly-over-paddy-procurement-issues-101613819993518.html

At least 215 farmers died during this period, the electricity and water supplies to them were cut, and they were assaulted. They were protesting peacefully, but Delhi's borders were turned into international borders," she said while addressing a Kisan Panchayat in Muzaffarnagar.The Congress general secretary said that farmers, who send their sons to defend our borders, were called terrorists."The Prime Minister ridiculed the farmers, calling them 'andolan jivi'. When farmer leader Rakesh Tikait cries, our Prime Minister thinks it's funny" said Vadra.Alleging that PM Modi's brand of politics if for his big corporate friends, the Congress leader tore away the three laws. "One of the three laws says that private mandis (marketplace) will be organised where no tax will have to be paid. This means, government mandis will be finished. The second law talks about contract farming. Your compaints won't be heard in courts, you won't be able to fight for your rights," Vadra said while addressing the farmers.She once again claimed that the three new laws will finish the minimum support system (MSP).Farmers have been camping on the outskirts of Delhi since late November, and calling for the repeal of new agriculture laws.The Centre has offered to hold the laws in abeyance and water down some the provisions.But the farmers want Modi government to repeal the laws altogether and provide legal backing for MSP for their produce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-visited-so-many-countries-but-has-no-time-to-wipe-tears-of-farmers-priyanka-gandhi-vadra-101613819064690.html

Yadav also criticised Adityanath for a past comment on opposition parties possessing “division in their DNA” in the aftermath of the Hathras incident.Here are top quotes from the SP chief’s press conference:“In ancient Indian culture, there was no such thing as chanda (contribution), we have the culture of dakshina (offering). We are ready to give dakshina, will BJP accept?”“The kind of language he (Yogi Adityanath) uses, be it on stages or the House, a chief minister cannot speak like this.

20-02-2021||India||At Disha Ravi's bail plea hearing, Delhi Police says a cover-up was carried out||A Delhi court is hearing a bail application moved by climate activist Disha Ravi, who was arrested on February 13 for allegedly creating an online "toolkit" intended to help farmers protesting against government's three farm laws.Twenty-two-year-old Ravi has been accused of sedition by the Delhi Police. She was sent to three-day judicial custody on Friday after the expiry of her police custody.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) SV Raju, appearing for the Delhi Police, opposed the bail plea saying that after the toolkit got leaked in the social media, a cover-up operation was carried out and many of its parts were deleted. After this, sections 201 and 204 of the Indian penal Code (IPC) - which deal with destruction of evidence - were added against the activist.The ASG also said that the toolkit had a cheatsheet which contained information which defames the Army and had nothing to do with farmers' protest."Ravi had the right to edit the toolkit and she later deleted everything. This is the working of a guilty mind," said the lawyer, adding that the toolkit was part of a "sinister design".Twenty two-year-old Ravi is part of an organisation founded by Swedish climate change activist Greta Thunberg.Police allege that Ravi was involved in creating and sharing an online document containing advice for protesters. Police say this document stoked the violence that took place on Republic Day last month.Late on Friday, Thunberg posted two tweets with a hashtag supporting Disha."Freedom of speech and the right to peaceful protest and assembly are non-negotiable human rights. These must be a fundamental part of any democracy. #StandWithDishaRavi," Thunberg said in one of her tweets.During the hearing on Friday, additional public prosecutor (APP) Irfan Ahmed told the court Ravi had been “evasive” during interrogation and shifted the blame onto the co-accused Nikita Jacob and Muluk. Ahmed also said the police want to question her again and bring her face-to-face with the co-accused in this case.Ravi's lawyer Siddharth Agarwal countered the public prosecutor, saying the case diary was not properly given.Meanwhile, the Delhi high court directed the media and the police to exercise restraint while giving out the details of the case. The order came on a Ravi's plea. The high court, however, said that there should be a balance between the right to privacy and freedom of speech of people, and sovereignty and integrity of the country.Thunberg had briefly tweeted a link to the toolkit - a Google document - earlier this month that police are investigating before replacing it with an "updated" one.The Delhi Police have sought to link the toolkit with the January 26 violence in the national capital, and to pro-Khalistani organisations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-police-opposing-disha-ravi-s-bail-say-toolkit-part-of-sinister-design-101613810903803.html

20-02-2021||India||No difference between Siddaramaiah, PFI: Karnataka minister Eshwarappa over Ram Mandir donation||The contribution over the donations to the fund dedicated towards the construction of the grand Ram Temple in Ayodhya took centre stage in Karnataka once again on Saturday as Karnataka minister KS Eshwarappa targeted the opposition likening veteran Congress leader Siddaramaiah to the Popular Front of India (PFI).“PFI tells people to not contribute (for Ram Temple) as it is on disputed land. Siddaramaiah says the same. They have the same opinion. There is no difference between Siddaramaiah and PFI. They are one,” Eshwarappa was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.PFI was launched in Kerala in 2006 after the National Development Front of Kerala, Karnataka Forum for Dignity and Manitha Neethi Pasari of Tamil Nadu merged. The three organisations were floated after the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992. Law enforcement agencies have claimed that the outfit has been radicalising Muslim youth following a growing vacuum in the community donning the role of a saviour.Eshwarappa also said even the poor are contributing towards the temple's construction and criticised the Congress leader’s attitude. “Even the poor are giving ₹10 each (for Ram temple) out of devotion. Siddaramaiah says that it's disputed land, so he won't contribute,” he said.Siddaramaiah on February 16 had said that he will not donate to the cause if volunteers approached him. “If they come to me for funds, then I will not give donations for the disputed Ram temple in Ayodhya. I will donate to the Ram temple being built somewhere else. Even though the matter has been settled, the dispute will always remain,” Siddaramaiah was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The Karnataka minister also drew comparisons between Siddaramaiah, a former chief minister, and JD(S) leader HD Kumaraswamy, saying that both the leaders are destroying their parties. Kumaraswamy and Siddaramaiah had led the government in Karnataka until 2019 when several MLAs joined BJP and defeated the Congress-JD(S) in a floor test in the assembly.Kumaraswamy had compared the donation collection process to how Nazis used to target its dissidents of the Third Reich during the former German chancellor Adolf Hitler’s regime, who was responsible for the mass murder of several million Jews.“It appears that those collecting donations for the construction of Ram Mandir have been separately marking the houses of those who paid money and those who did not. This is similar to what Nazis did in Germany during the regime of Hitler when lakhs of people lost their lives,” Kumaraswamy had said on February 15.Shri Ramjanmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust’s general secretary, Champat Rai, had also criticised the former CM for his comments and said that the issue of construction of the Ram Temple should not be politicised.Shri Ramjanmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust has been given the responsibility to oversee the construction of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. The Supreme Court in a unanimous verdict cleared the way for the construction of a Ram Temple at the contested site at Ayodhya on November 9, 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-difference-between-siddaramaiah-pfi-karnataka-minister-eshwarappa-101613811818264.html

And thus it is collecting chanda (contributions) in this time of calamity (Covid-19 pandemic),” he said at a press conference.The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister who had attacked BJP by calling it 'chandajivi' in Parliament recently, reiterated that in ancient Indian culture, there was no such thing as chanda, “We have the culture of dakshina (offering). We are ready to give dakshina, if the BJP accepts it,” he said.He also attacked the Centre over spiraling fuel price. “To hide its failure on the economic front the BJP government hikes petrol and diesel prices and puts the burden on people, farmers and the youth. And it is sad and shameful that now the government is saying the price hike was for nation building.”He also attacked chief minister Adityanath and accused him of lying even in the legislature and warned that the BJP government’s days in the state are numbered.“The way CM is lying in the assembly… Those who lie in the legislature, who would punish them? People will punish them,” Akhilesh said“The way people are joining Samajwadi Party in droves; the BJP will be swept out and the people will ‘deploy’ SP in the 2022 UP Assembly polls to rescue the state.”Akhilesh also accused Adityanath of lying in the assembly on payment of minimum support price (MSP) to farmers.“CM lied in the assembly that MSP was given to farmers. All know that farmers did not get MSP for maize, or rice. He charged the SP government of selling sugar mills, if he is Yogi for real then he should tell which sugar mill was sold during the SP regime,” he said.The Samajwadi Party chief also alleged that the Adityanath government has no work of its own to showcase.“This government has completed four years and still has no work of its own to showcase. It continues to hijack SP government's work as shows-off as its own,” he said. “This CM is not from UP. He came from another state. If he became the CM here then he should have worked for the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ram-temple-fundraising-bjp-s-version-of-creating-opportunity-out-of-pandemic-101613811221490.html

In a five-mark question, students were asked to write a letter to the editor of a daily newspaper condemning the Republic Day violence on Delhi in 100-120 words. Students were also asked to suggest a few measures to "thwart such violent maniacs who act under external instigation".This is a sample fm a Class X English paper of a popular Chennai school.

The question was part of the second revision exams, reports said.Republic Day violence was not due to intel failure, says police commissioner"The diabolical violence that broke out in the national capital on Republic Day filled the hearts of the citizens with condemnation and abhorrence after the farm law protesters went on a rampage destroying public property and attacking police personnel in broad daylight. Write a letter to the Editor of a daily newspaper in your city, condemning such terrible, violent acts of miscreants who fail to realise that country comes before personal needs and gains. Destroying public property, disgracing the national flag, and attacking police personnel are few of the various illegal offences committed, that can never be justified for any reason whatsoever.

Many people were reported lying on roads while some complained of difficulty in breathing and rashes on their bodies.On the basis of the early media reports then, the Commission had observed that "though prima-facie, as of now, there are no reports regarding human error or negligence but the fact that so far at least 8 innocent citizens have lost their lives and thousands have fallen sick, is indeed a serious issue of violation of human rights. The right to life of the victims has been grossly violated. At a time when the human lives across the country are at stake due to the spread of the Covid-19 virus and everyone is forced to stay indoors, the gruesome tragedy has come as a bolt from the blue for the people."The Commission had issued a notice to the Chief Secretary, Government of Andhra Pradesh calling for a detailed report in the matter including the status of the rescue operation, the medical treatment provided to the people who fallen sick and relief and rehabilitation provided by the state authorities to the affected families."A notice had also been issued to the Director-General of Police, Andhra Pradesh to inform within four weeks about registration of FIRs in the matter and status of the investigation being conducted. A notice was also sent to the Union Ministry of Corporate Affairs, through its Secretary, to examine whether the norms laid down under relevant provisions of the law are being implemented at the particular industrial unit," it said.According to NHRC, pursuant to the directions of the Commission, the Director-General of Police, Andhra Pradesh, submitted a detailed report on relief measures including evacuation."With regard to the status investigation of the case registered by the police, it has been submitted that 437 witnesses were examined including the statement of 16 officials, security and technical persons who are working in LG Polymers Company," it added.During the further course of the investigation, based on the evidence, witnesses and other documentary and experts' opinions, 12 accused were arrested and produced before the AMM Court, Visakhapatnam. The Court granted them 15 days remand to judicial custody to all the 12 accused persons.The NHRC has observed that having considered the requisite reports received from the concerned authorities and also the fact and circumstances of the case, any further proposition from the end of this Commission is not required.It has further observed that "it was an unfortunate incident in which 12 people lost their lives due to gas leak, however, the State Government has compensated the bereaved families by paying ex gratia to the tune of ₹1 crore each to the next of kin of the deceased, adequate monetary compensation to more than 2000 victims, who fell sick and hospitalized besides taking legal action against the accused persons. The State Government has also deposited an amount of ₹50 crores with the Collector and District Magistrate, Vishakhapatnam as per the orders of NGT, New Delhi for the restoration of the environment and payment of interim compensation to victims of the gas leak."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/styrene-gas-leak-tragedy-nhrc-accepts-action-taken-in-andhra-pradesh-101613810872952.html

We oppose the government's wrong policies affecting the common man,” Kharge was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Kharge had said after his appointment as the Leader of Opposition that the Congress party will continue to focus on the ongoing farmers’ protest and will look forward to cornering the government over issues raised by the farmers’ unions representatives. “The farmers have been agitating against the new farm laws for the past few months and demanding that they be withdrawn as it abolishes the MSP and the Mandi system. We are all supporting their demand. The government has failed to satisfy the farmers, the major stakeholders while bringing in these laws and should withdraw them,” the septuagenarian leader from Karnataka said on February 20.He also said that the tractor rally against the three farm laws, which went violent on January 26, was a conspiracy planned by the government with the aim to dent the spirit of the protesting farmers’ unions representatives who have been protesting against the farm laws for almost three months at Delhi’s borders demanding their total repeal.On Saturday, Kharge also said the government was using terms like 'Khalistanis' and 'Pakistanis' with a motive to divide the protesting farmers’ unions. He also highlighted that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had asked him to highlight the issues of the poor. “We raise the issues (in Parliament) not to become famous. We take up the issues affecting the poor. Somebody should talk,” Kharge said.Kharge will lead the opposition in the Upper House following the retirement of another veteran Congressman Ghulam Nabi Azad. “The Chairman, Rajya Sabha, has accorded recognition to Shri Mallikarjun Kharge, leader of the Indian National Congress Party in the Rajya Sabha, as the leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha w.e.f February 16, 2021, in terms of Section 2 of the Salary and Allowances of Leaders of Opposition in Parliament Act, 1977 and rules made thereunder,” a statement released from the Parliament on Tuesday had said.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-just-for-sake-of-opposing-kharge-wants-to-corner-centre-on-farm-laws-101613810481101.html

On the other hand, the Congressmen are requesting us to keep the facility shut," an owner of a petrol pump told PTI."We are caught in the crosshairs," he said.State Congress chief Kamal Nath had on Friday urged the people to join in the 'bandh' in order to "wake up the government over the soaring prices of petrol, diesel and cooking gas".Meanwhile, MP Petrol Pump Owners' Association secretary Nakul Sharma said that additive-mixed petrol of a leading oil marketing company is now priced at ₹102.26 per litre, while regular per litre petrol is being sold at ₹98.58 and diesel at ₹89.21 in Bhopal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-workers-detained-during-half-day-bandh-over-fuel-price-101613809289726.html

Farmers have been camping at Delhi's borders seeking a repeal of the legislation."The CM's [chief minister] meeting with the farmer leaders will take place over lunch at the Delhi Assembly on Sunday. The three farm laws and other related concerns will be discussed in the meeting," said the official on condition of anonymity.In December last, during a one-day session of the Delhi Assembly, CM Kejriwal tore copies of the three farm laws to mark his protest against the controversial legislation even as the assembly passed a resolution tabled by revenue minister Kailash Gahlot demanding that the Central government should repeal the laws immediately.The Centre has maintained the three laws have been passed for the reform of the agriculture sector. But the protesting farmers fear that the laws will do away with agricultural markets, favour industrialists, affect prices of crops and bring down their income further.The farmers unions and the Centre have had 11 rounds of talks so far. The Centre has even offered to put the laws on hold for 1.5 years, but the farmers are pushing for repeal of the new agricultural laws.Replying in Lok Sabha to the discussion on the motion of thanks to the President's address to the joint sitting of Parliament, Prime Minister Narendra Modi strongly defended the laws and attacked the opposition for "misleading farmers". The PM again invited farmers for talks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arvind-kejriwal-to-meet-protesting-farmer-leaders-at-delhi-assembly-tomorrow-101613808479626.html

The institute will now hire the services of a private detective agency by March 15.“It is an open secret that some of our doctors are into private practice, which they are not supposed to. We want to put an end to this practice by taking stern action against those who indulge in it. This is a step in that direction. We need support from the government to enforce it so that the institute can develop as a medical centre of excellence in the state,” said Dr Nihar Ranjan Biswas, director of the IGIMS on deputation from AIIMS-Delhi since February 26, 2014.There are allegations that a majority of the 300-odd faculty members out of the nearly 550 doctors at the institute also practice privately, despite availing of non-practising allowance (NPA), which is 20% of their basic salary. Allegations have also been levelled against doctors of weaning away patients from the institute to private healthcare facilities.“We have assiduously built our reputation over the last few years and are now trying to consolidate it. We now have a choice, as we receive 10-20 applications against any position we advertise. The institute is not prepared to be blackmailed anymore. We will terminate the services of those indulging in private practice,” added Dr Biswas.Since its inception in November 1983, the IGIMS has not succeeded in penalising any such doctor.The institute last came close to penalising such offenders in 2014, when its flying squad caught six of its 29 doctors under scanner red handed. Despite assurance of stern action by the then principal secretary, health, the offenders managed to use their influence and were let off after a warning.Two senior professors at IGIMS — a urologist and gastroenterologist — took voluntary retirement in 2014 and 2017 after the IGIMS administration confronted them with evidence of their private practice.The Bihar government had banned private practice across its facilities and paid NPA to its doctors for a limited period of 11 months between March 1, 2000 and February 2001 before withdrawing it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihars-igims-to-hire-detectives-to-check-private-practice-of-its-doctors-101613807137200.html

20-02-2021||India||UP Police: Small cars to replace SUVs to reduce 112 emergency response time||Smaller cars will soon replace some bigger SUVs used by Uttar Pradesh police's 112 emergency service to improve response time to distress calls and enable teams to access congested areas and narrow lanes faster, a senior official said.There are times police response vehicles lose precious time in traffic snarls because of their size and there are also occasions when they themselves cause jams, said Additional Director General of Police (112 service) Asim Arun.The UP Police's 112 service (formerly the 100 service) currently has around 4,500 vehicles of which nearly 3,000 are four-wheeler SUVs and the remaining two-wheeler motorcycles.Arun said currently 15,000 to 16,000 events across the state are attended daily by the emergency responders, while the number of distress calls is even more."Many a time the calls come from incident spots located in busy markets, congested areas, narrow lanes and all such places where SUVs lose precious time in traffic snarls because of their size. Sometimes the police vehicles themselves lead to traffic disruption while responding to emergencies," Arun told PTI.Also read| PM Modi at NITI Aayog meet: Centre-state ties, Aatmanirbhar Bharat in focus"We will soon be adding into our fleet cars which are smaller in size than our SUVs so that they can easily navigate such areas and the response time can be improved further," he said, adding specifics like car type and number of vehicles are yet to be worked out.Arun said currently the UP police's average response time in urban areas stands 7 to 8 minutes, while in rural areas it is 15 to 20 minutes.On the difference in response time in urban and rural areas, he said there are more events from urban areas where deployment of PRVs is also higher, while the relatively longer response time in rural areas is because distress calls are not frequent and locations of villages is also isolated."We have a world-class response time," Arun said and added that during the pandemic and lockdown, the UP police's emergency responders tended to an average 35,000 distress calls daily."During the lockdown, the 112 utilised the state capacity following directions from the chief minister. Our PRVs were providing dry ration, cooked meals, milk for newborns and infants and what not. On many occasions, PRV personnel spent money from their own pockets to help distressed callers while the world was yet to come to grips with the situation," he added.On further utilization of 112 in diverse roles like lodging of FIR, he said it was more of a "policy question" that could be answered by the government."But as far as capacity is concerned, we are technically equipped for it," Arun said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-police-small-cars-to-replace-suvs-to-reduce-112-emergency-response-time-101613804115091.html

Until then, I cannot divulge any information about the governing body meeting,” said Dr Singh.Saxena and Das possess postgraduate (PG) degrees in zoology, a non-medical subject, whereas the December 2011 faculty recruitment advertisement for AIIMS required a PG degree recognised by the Medical Council of India or equivalent in the subject concerned.Ranjan had the qualification, but did not have a Ph.D degree at the time of joining the AIIMS.All these appointments date back to 2012-13.People familiar with the development said two faculty members still do not possess the basic qualification required to occupy the position they do. The other faculty member, however, fulfilled the requisite criteria nine months after his joining the AIIMS on September 7, 2012 after he submitted his PhD degree from a university in the US.One of the faculty members facing termination was even promoted during the August-September 2017 assessment promotion scheme of the AIIMS, despite not possessing the basic qualification.Efforts to reach the three doctors concerned proved futile as they did not respond to phone calls or text messages on Friday. Some of the 19 doctors who were initially under the scanner, had earlier said that they should not be penalised after eight years for the selection committee’s fault. A few of them had moved the court against the disciplinary action initiated by the institute.The appointments were initially red-flagged in 2013 by Anil Kishore Yadav, an IPS, the then deputy director (administration) of AIIMS-Patna.The Vikas Arya committee, constituted by the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoH&FW) in 2014, also found the appointments faulty. Finally, a five-member high-powered committee, comprising the director of AIIMS-Bhubaneswar and AIIMS-Patna, also held the appointments of the three doctors were erroneous.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unqualified-on-date-of-appointment-3-doctors-at-aiims-patna-face-termination-101613803858000.html

All you need to know||After Covishield and Covaxin, Sputnik V may become the third vaccine to be approved in India as Dr Reddy's Laboratories has approached the Drugs Controller General of India for emergency use approval. Pfizer too had sought approval in December but what keeps Sputnik V ahead of Pfizer is that it conducted trials in India whereas Pfizer's application was based on trials conducted elsewhere.Here is all you need to know about this Russian vaccine> The vaccine was developed by Moscow's Gamaleya National Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology. Russia registered the vaccine on Augst 11 becoming the first country to have a vaccine against Covid-19, which also led to suspicion about its efficacy. However, the vaccine maintained over 91 per cent efficacy.> Its trial in Russia also covered people above the age of 60 years. So, it has proven effectivity in older people who are more vulnerable to Covid-19.> British medical journal The Lancet reported Sputnik's efficacy to be 91.6 per cent.> In India, Dr Reddy's Laboratories conducted small human trials of the vaccine after it partnered with the Russian Direct Investment Fund in September. Phase 3 clinical trial is going on.> Dr Reddy's conducted a phase 2 study in India on 100 subjects and said that the study met the primary endpoints of safety.> European Medicines Agency has not yet approved the vaccine.> Brazil turned down the emergency use approval request of the vaccine as the local pharmaceutical company did not meet the minimum criteria.> Russian authorities say the vaccine has been registered in around 30 countries.> This vaccine can be stored at normal fridge temperature and does not require extreme cold temperature like Pfizer.> One dose of this vaccine will cost around ₹730, which is costlier than Covishield and Covaxin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sputnik-v-may-become-3rd-covid-19-vaccine-approved-in-india-all-you-need-to-know-101613802891175.html

The Prime Minister emphasised on the ease of living for Indians and ease of doing business to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) among other issues.Here are the highlights of his address:Competitive, cooperative federalismThe Prime Minister during his address said federalism is the foundation for India's development. The Centre and the states need to work together to make federalism more meaning. We should also try to bring competitive and cooperative federalism not only among states but districts as well, he added.Centre, states budgetsThe Centre began the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme to encourage manufacturing. States should take advantage of the reduced corporate tax rate. The capital expenditure for the infrastructure sector will take the nation forward as it will create greater employment opportunities. Centre and states need to synchronise their budgets to better achieve the targets, PM Modi said.Aatmanirbhar Bharat visionAatmanirbhar Bharat is a mission not only for self-reliance but also to produce for the world. India is a young nation and to achieve its aspiration we need to encourage innovation, develop greater technology, provide greater education. Startups, MSMEs need to be made stronger, PM Modi said while recognizing the individual talents of different states and districts. A healthy competition of exports of different products between the states needs to be developed. This competition should be inculcated at districts and block levels too, PM Modi said.United front against Covid-19 pandemicWhen the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country, the states and the centre worked together. This Governing council meeting becomes more significant as India heads towards completing its 75 years of independence, PM Modi said.Governing councilThe agendas have been set to get advice from all the states, give the states time to prepare and come up with resolutions. The governing council's agenda points are very specific this time, said PM Modi.Private sectorThe nation needs to develop, it does not want to waste time. The private sector is enthusiastically coming forward to aid the development of the nation. We need to give the private sector space in the Aatmanirbhar Bharat vision, said PM Modi.Bharat Net schemeFor internet connectivity, Bharat Net scheme is doing significant work to provide internet access to all. In all such schemes when centre and states will work together the country will develop more, said the Prime Minister.Rural housingSince 2014, 2.40 lakh crore houses have been built across the nation in all states and cities. More development work is being done to build more modern houses, ensure clean drinking water that does not cause malnutrition in form of Jal Jeevan mission.

The work of providing houses to the poor is also going at a good speed, some states need to increase their pace, he added.Liberalisation of geospatial mappingYouth should be given space to reflect their talent. OSP regulations were reformed a few time back, which provided the youngsters to work remotely that mostly benefited the tech sector. We need to stop every such restriction. We liberalized geospatial data too. It is the talent of our people but products are not ours, PM Modi said citing people working for and developing global tech giants like Google.Also Read | PM Modi hails budget at NITI Aayog meet, says country wants to progress fastReduced compliancePM Modi said we export raw fish products, we can also export processed fish products. Our coastal states need to take a united initiative to take over the global market for which reforms are very important. Reforms have been to reduce government intervention and regulation for decreased compliance to aid ease of living.Agro-climatic regional planningPanchayat Raj should be made more responsible for the district development and come together with the states and the Centre for greater results. Even though we are an agrarian economy, still various other edibles are imported by the country. Our farmers can grow all this at home and export them too. For this, it is important that all states do agro-climatic regional planning to help farmers. A holistic approach was taken in farming, poultry and husbandry that reaped greater results, PM Modi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-at-niti-aayog-meet-centre-state-ties-aatmanirbhar-bharat-in-focus-101613798670816.html

The country has made up its mind. The country wants to move fast, the country does not want to waste time now,” he said at the meeting. Modi renewed his pitch for a self-reliant nation that not fulfils its own needs but also caters to the requirements of the people across the world. “Self-reliant India campaign is the way to build an India that produces not only for its needs but also for the world, and these products also meet the test of world superiority,” he said at the virtual meet attended by chief ministers of states and Union territories (UTs), Union ministers, vice chairperson Rajiv Kumar, member and CEO of NITI Aayog Amitabh Kant, and other senior government officials.Here are top quotes from the Prime Minister’s address:* We have seen during the “corona period” that when the state and the central government worked together, the country succeeded.* The private sector of the country is coming forward with more enthusiasm in the development journey of the country. As a government, we have to respect this enthusiasm, the energy of the private sector and give it equal opportunity in the self-reliant India campaign.* The central government has introduced production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes for various sectors. This is an excellent opportunity to increase manufacturing in the country. States should also take full advantage of this scheme and attract maximum investment in themselves. * A holistic approach has been adopted over the years, from agriculture to animal husbandry and fisheries. As a result of this, in the era of corona, the country's agricultural exports have increased significantly. We have a lot of untapped potential in this sector. Wastage of our products should be as less as possible and we must thus concentrate on storage and processing.*For India's businesses, we must try and better ease of doing business. It will help us grab global opportunities. For India's citizens, we must try and better ease of living. It will help us in achieving the aspirations of Indians and make their lives better.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-hailing-budget-to-aatmanirbhar-push-pm-modi-s-top-quotes-from-niti-aayog-address-101613800813811.html

20-02-2021||India||Khajuraho dance festival begins today on temple premises after 44 years||The six-day Khajuraho Dance Festival will begin on Saturday at the UNESCO World Heritage site in Madhya Pradesh, known for its ancient Hindu and Jain temples. It is being held on the temple premises after 44 years following the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) permission. The ASI has also waived the fee for conducting the festival this year.“The dance festival was introduced 46 years ago on the premises to promote heritage and tourism. But ASI cancelled the permission after the reports of destruction of monuments and defacement of idols. For the past 44 years, the state government has been organising the festival in an open garden developed near Western Group of Temples," said a state culture department official, who did not wish to be named.The ASI gave the go-ahead to the state government to conduct the festival indoors following Union culture and tourism minister Prahlad Singh Patel's intervention.Patel said Khajuraho has been added to the list of 19 iconic world tourism sites and they want to make the festival more popular and attractive for national as well as international tourists. "Hence, the ASI granted permission to the state government.” He said the state government will ensure the safety and security of the monuments.Former ASI superintendent (Bhopal) Narayan Vyas said the permission for conducting the festival on the temple premises was cancelled to protect the monuments from thieves and anti-social elements as some idols were damaged during the event in 1976.“The performances are organised late at night and it is tough to keep a watch on spectators. There is a risk that idols at the monuments can be stolen or defaced by participants or spectators. To promote tourism at a popular site through dance festival is not a wise decision,” he said.Culture and tourism department principal secretary Sheo Shekhar Shukla said they will organise the festival for the promotion of heritage with utmost care. We will take care of both the safety and security of temples and idols,” he said. “We have designed the festival to attract tourists to boost the economy of the area. Khajuraho’s economy is mostly dependent upon international tourists. During Covid 19 pandemic, local guides, artisans and hoteliers are facing a tough time due to the decrease of the footfall of international and national tourists."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/khajuraho-dance-festival-begins-today-on-temple-premises-after-44-years-101613799722365.html

The announcement comes just days after West Bengal minister of state for labour Jakir Hossain was injured in a bomb attack in Murshidabad district. The poll dates for the state are to be announced anytime soon.“Usually, central forces are deployed after the election dates are announced and the Model Code of Conduct comes into force. But this year the first few batches of central forces are being deployed even before the dates have been announced,” said a senior official of the poll panel.With polls around the corner, clashes have been frequently breaking out between the ruling Trinamool Congress and its principal opponent and challenger the Bharatiya Janata Party.The opposition parties met the poll body officials in January and expressed their concerns over the alleged rise in political violence and deterioration of law and order in the state."We had an in-depth interaction with political parties.

Doval and Wang had a video conference on June 7, 2020, and have kept in touch, with external affairs minister S Jaishankar holding the diplomatic end of conversations with Beijing.Although both Indian and Chinese military commanders have been showcasing their role during the 10-month stand-off, the governments on both sides are taking a step forward to normalise relations on a reciprocal basis.It is understood that the Indian side has made it clear that it will stand up to any use of force but is willing to discuss and build a positive atmosphere for sorting out all outstanding issues related to the LAC.“We have conveyed that the two sides can sit together and work their way towards resolving differences in perception over the LAC after China has created positivity by restoring status quo ante on Pangong Tso. There can be no dialogue if PLA uses force but if China can persuade that India is wrong or vice versa on border perception, then the two sides can mutually adjust to the perception line,” said a senior official in the know of the developments.Also Read | Beijing on diplomatic charge amid pullbackAccording to national security planners, it is for China to create a positive atmosphere for forward movement in bilateral ties as India will respond in kind and more. “The trajectory that India and China ties take from Pangong Tso disengagement depends on Beijing but the PLA (People’s Liberation Army) withdrawal has been taken in the right spirit in New Delhi,” said a former Indian Army chief.After the disengagement from Pangong Tso, the military commanders on Saturday are expected to work out the modalities of withdrawal of armour and artillery from friction points at Gogra-Hot Springs and work out the modalities for restoring full patrolling rights to the two sides in the Depsang Bulge area, south of Daulet Beg Oldi sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/special-representatives-talks-on-cards-india-china-to-restore-status-quo-ante-on-lac-101613795388393.html
20-02-2021||India||Joe Biden's Indian-American nominee Neera Tanden to lead budget faces challenge to confirmation||Indian-American Neera Tanden, US President Joe Biden's nominee for the position of Director of White House Office of Management and Budget, is facing a challenge to her confirmation after Democratic Senator Joe Manchin announced that he would vote against her for her "overtly partisan statements".Manchin's announcement means that unless a Republican senator comes forward to support her nomination, it is unlikely that Tanden, 50, will be confirmed for the job.Manchin, a moderate Democrat from West Virginia, said: "I believe her overtly partisan statements will have a toxic and detrimental impact on the important working relationship between members of Congress and the next director of the Office of Management and Budget.""For this reason, I cannot support her nomination. As I have said before, we must take meaningful steps to end the political division and dysfunction that pervades our politics," he said.The 100-member Senate is evenly split between the Republicans and the Democrats. The vote of Vice-President Kamala Harris will tilt the balance in favour of the Democrats. As such the vote of Manchin gains significance, given that a majority of the Republicans are likely to oppose the nomination of Tanden.In the past, Tanden has referred to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell as "Voldemort," and has battled Senator Bernie Sanders and his supporters online.President Biden on Friday said that he has enough votes to get her confirmation.“I think we are going to find the votes and get her confirmed,” Biden told reporters at Joint Base Andrews following a trip to the Pfizer vaccine manufacturing plant in Michigan.Despite Manchin's opposition, Biden said he will not pull the nomination. “No” he told reporters.“Neera Tanden is an accomplished policy expert who would be an excellent Budget Director and we look forward to the committee votes next week and to continuing to work toward her confirmation through engagement with both parties," White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said.Tanden apologised to senators during her confirmation hearings this month.“I deeply regret and apologise for my language, and some of my past language,” she said.Tanden reportedly deleted more than 1,000 tweets before her confirmation process started.According to The New York Times, the announcement by Manchin underscored the fragility of the ambitions of the new Democratic majority in the Senate and the outsize power that any one senator holds over the success of Biden’s administration and agenda.“The fate of the nomination is now in the hands of a party that Ms Tanden has frequently criticized in the past, particularly moderate Republicans she has previously scorned. Ms Tanden would need the support of at least one Republican senator in order to be confirmed, with the vote of Vice President Kamala Harris needed to break a tie,” the daily said.If she fails to garner enough support, Tanden would be the first Biden administration pick not to win Senate confirmation. No Republicans have said they would vote for her yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/joe-biden-s-indian-american-nominee-neera-tanden-to-lead-budget-faces-challenge-to-confirmation-101613795010004.html

A jump of 6,112 cases in the western state was the highest in 83 days and its capital city of Mumbai reported 823 new infections for the first time in 77 days. The resurgence of cases in the western state has led to a gradual upward shift in the country’s infection Covid-19 curve. The state government, however, has not yet called the fresh spike a second wave of the pandemic. While Mumbai continues to report the maximum number of daily cases, its neighbouring cities – Thane, Navi Mumbai and Kalyan-Dombivli – have added 800, 663 and 748 new cases, respectively, in the same period. The rise in the number of cases in the city and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) is being attributed to the resumption of local trains for the general public since the beginning of February. The state health department and experts on the state-appointed panel have expressed confidence that the spread of the virus will be contained with stricter measures, higher testing and wider tracking.Also Read: India’s Covid-19 curve inches upwards amid fear of mutant strainsAs the state has been witnessing a steady spike for the past three days, Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said he has instructed administrations in the state to take strict action against people who are found without masks in public.

"I am going to chair a meeting on February 21 in Pune to discuss measures to contain the viral spread," he added. Meanwhile, in Mumbai, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has already re-imposed stringent measures to curb the spread of the viral disease. It has told contacts of high-risk patients to remain in home-quarantine or face imprisonment for up to six or a fine, or both. According to its fresh guidelines, BMC will also seal the buildings here five or more Covid-19 patients are found.

20-02-2021||India||India administers 10 million vaccine doses, second quickest drive in world||India has delivered more than 10 million doses of coronavirus vaccines, the government said on Friday, describing it as the second-quickest campaign in the world.India began inoculating people to fight the pandemic on January 16 and was administering doses at the fastest pace for weeks, before lingering hesitancy among some people and technical glitches meant the pace was overtaken by the United States. “India has administered over 1 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccine to its health workers and frontline workers. It has been done in 34 days, which is the second fastest in the whole world,” said union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan.As per the government’s provisional data, 10.44 million doses had been administered by Friday evening. But not all health workers who signed up having taken doses, prompting the government to renew appeals for them to come forward, a day before the window is meant to close for them. “Both the vaccines are safe and immunogenic. There have been no serious or sever acute events following immunisation in the whole country. No death has been attributed to the vaccination. I would like to appeal to the medical professionals to get the vaccine,” said Dr Harsh Vardhan.Twelve states and union territories have vaccinated over 75% of all the healthcare workers who had been registered on the government’s Co-WIN portal. Topping the list is Bihar with 84.7% coverage, followed by Tripura with 82.9%, and Odisha with 81.8%. The national capital, however, figures in the list of the seven states and union territories with less than 50% vaccine coverage. So far, only 46.5% of the registered healthcare workers in Delhi have received their first shots. The lowest coverage was reported in Puducherry where only 30.2% have been immunised, followed by Chandigarh where 34.3% have received the shot, and Punjab where 38.4% have received it.With 658,674 shot being administered, Thursday saw the highest ever vaccination in the country since the drive was rolled out on January 16.The vaccination drive aims to immunise 10 million healthcare workers, 20 million frontline workers, 260 million people above the age of 50, and 10 million people with severe co-morbidities. NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul had on Thursday said that the Centre finalised the norms for identifying the 10 million people with comorbidities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-administers-10-million-vaccine-doses-second-quickest-drive-in-world-101613780223276.html

His comments came a day after he announced that he was joining the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), months ahead of scheduled polls in the southern state.The 88-year-old man told reporters that his aim was to help the party come to power in Kerala and that he was open to the chief ministership. He also said the focus will be on developing infrastructure if the BJP won the assembly polls likely to be held in April-May this year.Responding to news channel NDTV on a question about “love jihad”, a term used by right-wing groups to describe relationships between Hindu women and Muslim men, Sreedharan said, “….Love Jihad, yes, I see what is happened in Kerala. How Hindus are being tricked in a marriage and how they suffer... not only Hindus, Muslim, the Christian girls are being tricked in a marriage. Now that sort of a thing I certainly will oppose.”ALSO WATCH | ‘States can’t interfere…’: Owaisi slams BJP over religious conversion laws﻿His comments came amid a fierce debate on “love jihad” and religious conversion, specially after Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh outlawed conversions by fraud, coercion or marriage.

20-02-2021||India||PM, Shah hail Tagore and Netaji’s legacies||Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday focused on West Bengal’s rich heritage and its “lost glory” in back-to-back addresses in the poll-bound state, in an effort to counter chief minister Mamata Banerjee branding the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leadership as “outsiders” in the state.Modi, while virtually addressing the convocation ceremony of Visva Bharati, the state’s only central university of which the Prime Minister is the chancellor, said its founder Rabindranath Tagore’s vision on education has contributed to the Centre’s new education policy.The Prime Minister spoke about Maratha warrior king Shivaji, whose birth anniversary was celebrated during the day, and recited in Bengali a few lines from Tagore’s poem Shivaji Utsav on the icon. “These lines draw inspiration from Shivaji and talk of fighting for one India. We must live the message Tagore sent. You are not part of a university but part of a living heritage. Tagore could have named this institution a global university but he chose to call it Visva Bharati. He wanted the students to see the world as Indians and uphold the nation’s heritage. This is what the nation expects of you,” said Modi.“Tagore wanted the education system to be free. Today, the nation’s new education policy gives you the freedom to choose your subjects, show your skills and develop entrepreneurship. It also focuses on gender equality in education… This will lead to an aatmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India),” Modi said.Union minister Shah, who was in Bengal on a two-day tour, attended a cultural event at Kolkata’s National Library as part of a programme on freedom fighter Subhas Chandra Bose, and paid tributes to Bengal’s martyrs.“Subhas Chandra Bose is remembered by millions despite the efforts made to make people forget him. The Centre has formed a committee to pay homage to him on his 125th birth anniversary not only in India but abroad as well. He topped the Indian civil service, something today’s youths aspire for, but quit the job to serve India... We may not die for the nation like the freedom fighters, but we can live for it,” Shah said.Trinamool Congress’s Lok Sabha MP Saugata Roy alleged that Modi and Shah both fall short of the secular idealism that Tagore and Bose stood for. “They build the Ram temple and differentiate between high-caste and low-caste Hindus. They are mentally and ideologically unfit to talk about such icons,” Roy said.Countering Shah and Modi, Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Sujan Chakraborty said: “Do Modi and Shah live the spirit of universal brotherhood that Tagore and Bose uphold?

20-02-2021||India||Rampant construction, Char Dham project may amplify ecological risk||The noise of stone crushers and earthmoving equipment mars the silence of the high Himalayas on the road from Rudraprayag to Joshimath at a height of over 1,000 metres, and then again, up from Joshimath, around 2,000 metres high.It’s the sound of hills being eaten into for the Char Dham road project; the rubble, including huge boulders from the blasted hill slopes are gathered all along the road, some perilously close to the edge. Geologists say this can’t be good for the high Himalayas.The Centre submitted to the Supreme Court on Wednesday there is no link between the February 7 glacier lake overflow flood that washed away two hydropower projects on the Rishi Ganga and possibly killed at least 150 people and the Char Dham project.But geologists and scientists say that together, the road construction and hydropower projects have increased the vulnerability of the region. They warn that many stretches of the Himalayas on the Char Dham route are now at risk of partial collapse.One of the contentious points in the road project is the width. The apex court on September 9 ruled that the road width shall not exceed the 5.5 metres specified in 2018 by the ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) for roads under construction in mountainous terrain. But a large part of the 900km project that promises to offer all-weather connectivity to four Hindu pilgrimage centres in Uttarakhand has already been constructed with 10 metre-width.Experts say it’s critical that the damage is stopped immediately owing to high seismic activity in the region and careless construction practices. “This road project is viable and there is a need for better connectivity and roads. But are ample precautions being taken to minimise damage? No. Have you conducted the study necessary to understand implications of this nature of construction?” said Navin Juyal, a retired geologist from the Physical Research Laboratory in Ahmedabad and member of the high-powered committee formed by the apex court to examine the environmental implications of the Char Dham project.“For Himalayan roads, three things are very important to consider: One is the slope. In Rishikesh for example there are lower slopes and as you go higher up, the slopes are steep which can be prone to erosion. The other important aspect is the nature of rocks. Are they inclined towards the road or the other side? The third is extent of vegetation and loose material on the hill being cut. One should never do a vertical scarp against the road.”“The government is saying it wants a 12-metre-wide two-lane road with paved shoulder. If you consider the right of way needed this means 24 metres. How will you get that much area in the high Himalayas? Then you have to cut the hills. No wonder over 50,000 trees had to be cut to make way for some of these stretches. But have we assessed what’s the collateral damage?” asked Juyal, giving the example of a 10km stretch, Totaghati, ahead of Rishikesh where rock composition in the hills change almost every 100 metres. The stretch includes limestone, quartzite and slate. “As you know some of them are very brittle while some just erode. These have to be studied very carefully but they weren’t.”Then there is the seismic risk.“Chamoli experienced a 6.8 magnitude earthquake in 1999 and Uttarkashi experienced a 6.6 magnitude earthquake in 1991. The main frontal thrust, main boundary thrust and the main central thrust (all geological faults in the Himalayas) are extremely active, which means they have the potential to generate a great earthquake. So, any construction in this region has to be carried out extremely carefully. The Himalayas are still evolving and hence seismologically active,” explained AP Pandey, a scientist at the National Center for Seismology.Even members of the 21-member majority panel of the SC’s high powered committee who supported double- laning of the Char Dham road project, in their report, say slopes are unstable in many areas.“Where there are hard rocks, hills have to be cut vertically. There is little option. But then slope stabilisation has to be carried out. Slopes are unstable in many places... Authorities have been asked to make a detailed project report of unstable slopes so that they can be stabilised,” said Vikram Gupta, scientist at the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology.The minority committee report, authored by the chairman of the panel, Ravi Chopra, underlined that higher Himalayan rocks are subjected to high erosion primarily due to focused rainfall, progressively high relief (slopes), high concentration of earthquakes and weak rock types. Correspondence in the Current Science journal by MPS Bisht of Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University and Piyoosh Rautela of Disaster Mitigation and Management Centre in 2010 highlighted that disaster looms over the Joshimath region.Situated in proximity of major tectonic discontinuities, Joshimath has been showing signs of distress due to burgeoning anthropogenic pressure, the paper said. “The Mishra Commission (1976) reported that Joshimath is situated on an old landslide zone and is sinking. The report recommended that heavy construction be banned in the area around Joshimath. Despite being fully aware of the geological/environmental vulnerability of the area, a number of hydroelectric schemes have been sanctioned around Joshimath and Tapovan,” it read. These warnings were not heeded to by the Char Dham project.“The problem is government doesn’t consult scientists when implementing a project. We are called to give our opinion and the matter ends there,” said senior geologist, professor YP Sundriyal of the Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University.Bharat Singh, a resident of Raini village, which was devastated by the February flood, was among the first to notice a cloud of debris and ice flowing down and destroying Rishi Ganga and Tapovan projects. He said: “Our hills have been destroyed. Tunnels have been dug up on the river. I wonder if these disasters are because of such projects? Only gods can help us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rampant-construction-char-dham-project-may-amplify-ecological-risk-101613768661744.html
20-02-2021||India||Controversy after govt pays tribute to MS Golwalkar||A tribute to Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) idealogue MS Golwalkar on his birth anniversary by the Union ministry of culture led to criticism from opposition leaders and activists, who slammed the move to celebrate a person whose views on Muslims have long been a subject of controversy.The culture ministry said it does not believe in silencing any ideology. “The ministry of culture represents the aspirations of every section of society and does not believe in silencing any ideologies or voices which are not the part of traditional narrative,” said Nitin Tripathi, media adviser to the ministry.Another official who asked not to be named said it was not the first time that the government was marking the birth anniversary of the Sangh’s second chief.“Lest anyone be inclined to take the Ministry of Culture seriously & really believe this gent was a great thinker and scholar, re-posting this extract from #WhyIAmAHindu that cites some of his views,” Congress’s member of Parliament Shashi Tharoor tweeted, along with a link to an article that referred to Golwalkar’s writings in A Bunch of Thoughts. One of the passages he quoted read: “Hindusthan is the land of the Hindus and is the terra firma for the Hindu nation alone to flourish upon…” Tharoor added in his tweet: “GOI hails a man who disrespected India’s flag&Constitution!”Golwalkar, born on February 19, 1906, took over from the first RSS chief KB Hedgewar in 1939. He went to jail in 1949 as part of the government’s crackdown on the RSS after Mahatma Gandhi’s assassination.The RSS was not indicted for the killing. Golwalkar’s writings in publications such as the Sangh’s own Organiser, however, have continued to divide opinion about his views.Alluding again to Golwalkar’s Bunch of Thoughts, activist Kavita Krishnan tweeted, “For Golwalkar, Hindu is equal to national. Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist, Dalit, OBC, feminist, Tamil, Kannada, Manipuri etc is equal to communal, separatist.’’The Centre ran into controversy last year when it decided to name a second campus for the Kerala-based Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology after Golwalkar.Rajya Sabha member of Parliament Rakesh Sinha, who is also associated with the Sangh, welcomed the ministry’s initiative to mark Golwalkar’s anniversary. “The ministry of culture has re-initiated an inclusive tradition to remember and to pay homage to all such great people of India who contributed in history, culture, society and the freedom movement,’’ he said, adding that some people were “groomed in Gandhi, Nehru-centric history which we must go beyond.”Gowalkar, he added, had been misunderstood. “They (critics) not only misquote Golwalkar but also do injustice to his philosophy. He represents an inclusive idea of India and advocated Indianisation of Islam and Christianity which is not the rejection of any religion or culture.’’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/controversy-after-govt-pays-tribute-to-msgolwalkar-101613768410833.html

One of them has been identified as Saqib, a local, and another FT (foreign terrorist), affiliated with LeT. Police have launched a manhunt to nab them.”Politicians from across party lines condemned the attack.“What makes this attack even more reprehensible is that SgCT Mohammad Yousuf of Zurhama and Ct Suhail Ahmad of Logripora were unarmed & shot in the back. Senseless & cowardly at the same time,” said former J&K chief minister and National Conference leader Omar Abdullah.People’s Democratic Party president and former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti condemned the attack, saying the “cycle of violence only begets misery”. Bharatiya Janata Party leader Altaf Thakur termed the attack an act of cowardice. “There is no place for such cowardly acts and the attackers must be brought to book,” he said.3 militants, one cop killed in separate encountersThree suspected militants and a policeman were killed in two separate encounters in south Kashmir’s Shopian and Central Kashmir’s Budgam districts on Thursday night and early Friday, the police said. The Shopian shoot-out started during a joint operation by the police and the CRPF in Badigam village on Thursday night, the police said.The other encounter took place early on Friday during a joint operation by the Budgam police and the CRPF in Zanigam Beerwah village on Friday.3 held for attack on restaurant owner’s sonMeanwhile, three men have been arrested for their alleged involvement in an attack on a restaurant owner’s son here two days ago, when a 24-member delegation of foreign envoys arrived on a two-day visit to J&K, the police said on Friday.Akash Mehra, son of the owner of Krishna Dhaba in Durganag area of the city, was shot at by unidentified men from a close range. “We have arrested three men, who were involved in the attack at Krishna Dhaba,” said IGP, Kashmir zone, Vijay Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/terrorist-guns-down-2-policemen-in-valley-101613767445163.html
20-02-2021||India||Meet Indian-American Mohan who announced Mars landing||Eleven minutes after touchdown, American scientist of Indian origin Dr Swati Mohan announced to her colleagues that Nasa’s rover, Perseverance, had landed successfully on planet Mars.“Touchdown confirmed! Perseverance is safely on the surface of Mars, ready to begin seeking the signs of past life,” Mohan announced on Thursday as scientists in the mission control room of the US space agency’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory erupted in cheers.By the time the Nasa scientist made the announcement at 02:29am IST (Friday), Perseverance was on the Martian surface for 11 minutes – the time it takes to receive a message from Mars to Earth. It was Mohan who was responsible for the descent and landing of the rover through the thin Martian atmosphere, described by Nasa scientists as “seven minutes of terror”. And it came through. The rover — which will for the next one Martian year (or 687 Earth days) look for proof of ancient microbial life -- successfully landed near the Jezero crater.Mohan, who was the Guidance, Navigation, and Controls (GN&C) Operations Lead for the mission, explained in a video from 2019: “If we didn’t have Terrain Relative Navigation, the probability of landing safely at Jezero Crater is about 80 to 85%. But with Mars 2020, we can actually bring that probability of success of landing safely at Jezero Crater all the way up to 99% safe every single time.”The Terrain Relative Navigation is a new technology used by the rover to photograph the Martian surface while descending through the atmosphere with a parachute and determining a safe landing site.Mohan has been working on the Mars mission for the last eight years. She has previously worked on Nasa’s Cassini mission to planet Saturn and the GRAIL mission to the moon.Mohan, born in Bengaluru, came to the US at the age of one and was raised in Northern Virginia and Washington DC. She studied mechanical engineering at Cornell University, and completed her masters and doctorate in aeronautics and astronautics from the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But it wasn’t always her dream to explore space. Till the age of 16, she wanted to be a paediatrician. It took a physics teacher and her love for Star Trek that triggered her interest in discoveries of the universe.“Actually, I wanted to be a paediatrician until I was about 16 years old. I was always interested in space, but I didn’t really know about opportunities to turn that interest into a job. I remember watching the first episode of Star Trek at 9, and seeing the beautiful depictions of the new regions of the universe that they were exploring. I remember thinking I want to do that. I want to find new and beautiful places in the universe,” she was quoted as saying by Nasa profile of Mars2020 scientists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meet-indian-american-mohan-who-announced-mars-landing-101613767124340.html
20-02-2021||India||21-year-old man, teen aid held for poisoning Dalit girls in Unnao||Police on Friday arrested a 21-year-old man and his teenage associate for allegedly poisoning three Dalit girls and killing two of them in Uttar Pradesh’s Unnao district, claiming that the duo tried to extract revenge from one of the girls after she rebuffed the man’s advances.The development came on a day the families laid to rest the two minor victims, aged 13 and 15, after resisting two attempts by the administration to bury the girls — a stand-off that brought back memories of the Hathras gang rape case last October where police and local administration forcibly cremated a Dalit victim.The three Dalit girls were found unconscious in a field near their home in Unnao district late on Wednesday by family members. Two of them died soon after, and the third, who is 16 years old, is in a critical condition in a Kanpur hospital.Inspector general of police Laxmi Singh said Vinay Kumar, a resident of a village neighbouring that of the victims’, and a 15-year-old boy were arrested on charges of murder and concealing evidence. They belong to the same caste as the victims, said local officials.“Vinay told the police he asked for her phone number, proposed to her but she always refused. He was angry with her and sought revenge for his insult…The accused gave some pesticide with water to the three girls,” said Singh. She said Kumar confessed to the crime.The victims’ families welcomed the arrests.”We have been telling the police right from the start that our daughters were murdered. We stand vindicated. The police must ensure that the investigation carries enough evidences against them and they are hanged,” said the father of one of the victims.Kishan Pal, Kumar’s father, said his son was being framed. “My son is not like this. He is being made a scapegoat under pressure,” he said.The father of the 15-year-old boy said his son was too young to commit such a crime. “How can a young boy of his age do something like this? This is beyond his capability,” he said.Police said Kumar was a farmer and owned a piece of land near the spot where girls were found on Wednesday night. According to police, Kumar said the girls used to go to the fields for fodder and became friends during the coronavirus lockdown, after which he started pursuing one of the girls but was rejected.“We used to play and eat together in the field…When I proposed her, she rejected. When I asked her this month to give me her phone number, she did not give due to which I was angry and decided to kill her,” Kumar was quoted as saying by UP Police.On Wednesday, Kumar allegedly mixed pesticide in a water bottle and met the girls in the field with the intention of poisoning them. “When they asked for water, I gave them the water bottle in which pesticide was mixed and they drank it,” Singh quoted Kumar as saying.It was not clear why Kumar tried to poison the other two girls and didn’t stop them when they were drinking from the same bottle. As the girls complained of vertigo and fainted, Kumar and his associate panicked, dragged them to their field from his and ran away, police added. “I left their bodies in the field,” the IG quoting Vinay’s alleged confession said.Police said they were told by other villagers that Kumar was present in his field at the time the girls were there.He was among six people picked up for questioning on Thursday noon.“Vinay broke down when his location was also found in the field at the time of the crime and a few eyewitnesses, who saw them running from one field to another field in a state of panic, came forward,” said a senior police official on condition of anonymity.Family members said the girls were close friends and left together to bring green fodder from a field around 1.5km from their house on Wednesday. They brought a packet of chips from a local shop around 3.30pm. It was the last anyone saw them. Their bodies were discovered by the families around 9.30pm.On Friday morning, bodies of the two minor girls were buried in their field in accordance with local customs, in the presence of scores of policemen and local officials. The bodies were kept in their respective houses, where they were shrouded and garlanded. According to local tradition, unmarried minor girls are not cremated.On Thursday, local administration had tried twice to bury the girls. In the morning, hundreds of angry local villagers confronted officials supervising the digging of graves in the field with earth moving machines and said they won’t let the administration bury the victims. In the evening, family members threw themselves before the machine in protest and said they would not allow the burial in the night because it violated local customs.But on Friday, the administration said the burials were conducted with the families’ consent. Unnao district magistrate Ravindra Kumar refuted reports of any pressure being exerted on the families and said the last rites were performed as per their wishes.Officials also announced ₹5 lakh each for the families of the two deceased girls. The family of the third girl, who is in a Kanpur hospital, was given ₹2 lakh and the government said it will bear the cost of her medical treatment.Specialists from Lucknow’s King George Medical University assisted the staff at the Kanpur hospital at the instruction of chief minister Yogi Adityanath, said officials. The hospital said the girl was responding to the treatment given by doctors and her condition was being monitored by specialists. “She could be taken off the ventilator,” the medical bulletin read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/21yearold-man-teen-aid-held-for-poisoning-dalit-girls-in-unnao-101613766720051.html
20-02-2021||India||Three-day judicial custody for Disha, bail may be heard today||A Delhi court on Friday sent climate activist Disha Ravi to jail for three days at the request of Delhi Police which will seek her custody again next week to confront her with the co-accused.Additional chief metropolitan magistrate (ACMM) Akash Jain sent 22-year-old Ravi to three days’ judicial custody after she was produced in court at the end of five days of police custody.The activist was arrested from Bengaluru on February 13 by Delhi Police for allegedly creating and sharing a protest toolkit backing the farmers’ agitation against the Centre’s new farm laws.Delhi Police claimed on Monday that Ravi, along with Mumbai-based lawyer Nikita Jacob and Pune engineer Shantanu Muluk, created the toolkit and shared it with others “to tarnish India’s image”.The two have already been granted transit anticipatory bail by the Bombay high court earlier this week.On Friday, Ravi was brought to the Delhi court amid high security by the investigating agency which sought that she be sent to judicial custody for three days.Additional public prosecutor (APP) Irfan Ahmed during the hearing told the court that the police had issued a notice to co-accused Shantanu Muluk for February 22 for joining the investigation and that’s when they would again question Ravi.He claimed Ravi had been “evasive” during interrogation and shifted the blame onto the co-accused Nikita Jacob and Muluk. Ahmed also said the police want to question her again and bring her face-to-face with the co-accused in this case.“She has shifted the blame on the co-accused Nikita Jacob and Muluk. All of them need to be confronted with each other.”Ravi has also filed a bail application which is likely to be taken up on Saturday.Countering the submissions by the APP, Siddharth Agarwal, representing Ravi, said that the case diary was not properly given and also not in accordance with the law. He pointed out that it was not even paginated.A case diary is a record of daily investigations in a case.The court, after hearing the arguments, sent Ravi to jail till February 22.Earlier in the day, the Delhi high court directed the media and the police to exercise restraint while giving out details of the case, which dates back to earlier this month, when Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg tweeted out a toolkit detailing how to organise a campaign to support the ongoing farmers’ protest in India.Delhi Police have sought to link the toolkit with the violence of January 26 in Delhi, and to pro-Khalistani organisations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/threeday-judicial-custody-for-disha-bail-may-be-heard-today-101613766214991.html
20-02-2021||India||The lessons to be drawn from Chamoli disaster||Scientists have debated the exact cause of the flash floods that devastated Chamoli district of Uttarakhand on February 7. But there is little doubt that such disasters are likely to become more frequent. This could be because of long-term effects — such as the climate crisis — of human activity as well as more recent developments, such as the construction of dams to generate electricity in the fragile mountain terrain.The effects of the climate crisis on Uttarakhand’s weather patterns and their impact on the environment’s capacity to sustain damage being done by the construction of dams makes the state particularly vulnerable. These factors definitely pose a threat to Chamoli, according to data on its weather analysed by HT. Here’s how:1) Uttarakhand has experienced one of the highest increases in temperature this decadeA report assessing impact of the climate crisis over the Indian region published by the ministry of earth sciences last year said the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region has experienced a temperature rise of about 1.3 degrees Celsius from 1951 to 2014. India, as a whole, warmed by only 0.7 degrees from 1901 to 2018, the report said. An analysis of grid-level temperature data set of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) shows that almost all of Uttarakhand – and Chamoli in particular – has experienced the highest increase in both minimum and maximum temperatures. According to the Uttarakhand Action Plan on Climate Change (UAPCC) 2014, these trends in temperature are likely to continue in the future. In the Himalayan region, thermal discomfort to individuals – measured by a temperature-humidity index – is likely to increase in the 2030s. It is likely that this trend in temperatures in Uttarakhand has increased the speed of glaciers melting in the region. Scientists also agree that glaciers in the Himalayas have been retreating faster since the beginning of this century, HT reported on February 8. According to a report of the expert body constituted under the direction of the Supreme Court after the June 2013 Uttarakhand floods, receding glaciers leave behind unstable moraine (rock and sediment deposits left by a glacier at its extremities) dams. When such natural dams breach, they can discharge large volumes of water and debris suddenly, causing floods.2) Upper reaches of Uttarakhand have also seen the highest increase in high and extreme intensity rainfallIt is not just the rise in temperature that makes Uttarakhand vulnerable to floods. IMD’s gridded rainfall data set also shows that heavy and extreme precipitation (greater than 35.5 mm of rainfall in a day in a grid or box bound by two latitudes and longitudes of 0.25° each) has increased in the state, particularly in the higher regions of the state, including Chamoli. While rainfall of higher intensity itself increases the threat of a flood, in a hilly state such as Uttarakhand, it can be twice as bad as in a state in the plains. Rainwater being warmer than snow and ice can accelerate glacial melting and add to the volume of water flowing in rivers, increasing the threat of a flood. The expert body constituted after the 2013 floods, for example, had this to say about those floods. “The warm rainwater of severe intensity (even upto 30 mm in an hour) in early June caused accelerated snow melt that along with large overland basin runoff from intense rain caused unusual flood havoc in most rivers of Uttarakhand upto Haridwar on the Ganga.” Moreover, according to a research paper by Professor Robert Wasson and others who have analysed large floods in the Upper Ganga catchment, rainfall also triggers landslides in the region. These again lead to natural dams which, when they breach, can amplify the effects of rainfall. Such amplification will only get worse as rainfall gets more intense because of the climate crisis.3) Dams in the state don’t account for the unique environment of the stateHydropower projects are one of the cleanest forms of energy, as far as carbon dioxide emissions are concerned. Using them as a source of energy can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to global warming and the effects of it discussed above. Still, developers of such projects in Uttarakhand need to take into account the unique environment of the state. According to Navin Juyal, a retired geologist from Ahmedabad’s Physical Research Laboratory, who is studying the Feb 7 glacier breach, policy makers should be extremely cautious about developing hydropower projects in Uttarakhand. This is because Himalayan rivers, being younger, carry many boulders and debris along in the event of a flood. “They are fed by glaciers from where debris flow into the rivers. Big boulders with sand and other debris often get mobilised and hydropower projects create an artificial obstruction in the flow of this material. When these boulders and sand are not able to flow freely, they also form dams holding water behind them. When hydrostatic pressure builds, these dams break and they cause floods,” Juyal said. So how much obstruction are we creating to the natural flow of rivers in Uttarakhand? According to a 2011 report prepared by the Alternate Hydro Energy Centre (AHEC) at the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, for the environment ministry, almost half of the length of rivers in the Bhagirathi and Alaknanda basins is either diverted or submerged because of allotted hydropower projects. This can only worsen any floods in the state.To be sure, there are contrarians. “Entire Rishikesh and Haridwar would have been washed away in the 2013 floods had the flood waters not got stored in Tehri dam after flowing down. I believe that hydroelectric projects are a victim and environmentalists take advantage of disasters to victimise them. There is nothing called higher reached of Himalayas. Hydroelectric projects can be located anywhere after the snowline. The two important factors needed for siting a hydropower project is height and volume of water. You will find height only in the Himalayas. Plus, water storage is extremely important for water security, so we need dams too,” said VK Kanjlia, former secretary of the Central Board of Irrigation & Power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-lessons-to-be-drawn-from-chamoli-disaster-101613765131618.html
20-02-2021||India||India’s Covid-19 curve inches upwards amid fear of mutant strains||India’s new Covid-19 curve continued to gradually inch upwards, driven largely by a resurgence of daily infections in Maharashtra, which for the second day in a row reported most infections in the country ahead of even Kerala where the first wave continues unabated.The seven-day average of new cases across the country has now gone up seven of the last eight days, highlighting the potential risk of a surge in cases amid fears of mutant strains gaining ground. HT reported on Friday that the Covid trajectory was rising again in four regions in the country – Maharashtra, Punjab, Haryana and Jammu & Kashmir – after the end of the first wave of the pandemic, an analysis by HT shows. Maharashtra and Kerala, meanwhile, were responsible for 75% of the 13,632 new cases recorded across the country on Friday.The increase in cases is being reported even as restrictions on several economic and social activities have eased across the country, and people and governments appear to be getting complacent, with almost no mask discipline, experts warned.This week, Maharashtra, India’s worst-hit state, has seen an increase of 73% in the number infections compared to the week before – the seven-day average of cases in the state currently stands at 4,437, against 2,564, last week. Kerala, meanwhile, continues to see an average of over 4,500 cases each day this week. It is the increase in the number of cases in Maharashtra has the experts worried.“There is a need to study the new infections that are being reported from Maharashtra, where a high proportion of people are likely to have been exposed already. We need to see whether the infections are happening in people who haven’t had it earlier or are these re-infections,” said Dr T Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College-Vellore.He said there was a need for increased surveillance to see whether the new variants of the virus have taken root. “If the new variant of the virus is infecting the people but the antibodies from a previous infection still protects a significant number of people, then the increase would just be a blip... If not, then we are in for trouble,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-covid-19-curve-inches-upwards-amid-fear-of-mutant-strains-101613764211272.html
20-02-2021||India||Dr Reddy’s applies for Sputnik authorisation||Dr Reddy’s on Friday applied for the emergency use approval of the Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine developed by Russia’s Gamaleya Institute, setting the ball rolling in what could lead to India getting access to a third shot to fight the pandemic.Sputnik V has shown an efficacy rate of 91.6% in preventing Covid-19 in Phase 3 trials. The vaccine uses a similar adenovirus vector as the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, whose Indian variant is Covishield. Apart from Covishield, India uses the domestically developed Covaxin, and has inoculated over 10 million people since kicking off the drive on January 16.“The efficacy of Sputnik V was reported to be 91.6% by The Lancet, which is an impressive development in the fight against Covid-19. The initiation of the EUA process will be a critical step forward for us in ensuring speedy access to the Sputnik V vaccine in India,” Dr Reddy’s laboratories co-chairman and managing director GV Prasad said.As part of the review process for emergency authorisation, the company will submit safety data from the Indian Phase 2 trial and interim data from Phase 3 – a regulatory filing process similar to the one adopted by the Serum Institute of India (SII).Vaccines developed outside of the country will need to also undergo a bridging trial. Dr Reddy’s is conducting a Phase 3 bridging trial to establish immunogenicity of the vaccine in about 1,500 participants. The Phase 2 trial in India on 100 participants showed “no safety concerns,” according to the company.In the global trials, the vaccine also maintained a consistent efficacy at 91.8% among group of 2,144 volunteers over 60 years, the company said. The company said that it was one of the three vaccines that had shown such high efficacy; the other two being Moderna and Pfizer. The efficacy rate of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine (whose data was used for Covshield’s approval) was 62%.In the case of Covaxin, efficacy data is awaited since Phase III trials have not progressed far enough. The vaccine had been approve by the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) in a “clinical trial mode”, where all those who are vaccinated will be followed-up on.The vaccine has been administered to more than two million people worldwide, the company said, listing Russia, Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Palestine, UAE, Paraguay, Hungary, Armenia, Algeria, Bosnian Serb Republic, Venezuela and Iran as countries where it is in use.The application for any vaccination is sent to a subject expert committee, which if satisfied with the data, recommends a vaccine for approval to the Drug Controller General of India.“The journey from the virus to vaccine has been very exciting. In just twelve months, we not just have a basket of vaccines, we also have different vaccine platforms... This gives us a lot of confidence that India will be a global hub for Covid-19 vaccines as well,” said Dr Renu Swarup, secretary, department of biotechnology at a webinar on Thursday.Sputnik V was initially met with some controversy after being rolled out before the final trial data had been released. But scientists, while releasing the final Phase III data, said its benefit has now been demonstrated.In a comment published alongside the Lancet paper, professors Ian Jones and Polly Roy said: “The development of the Sputnik V vaccine has been criticised for unseemly haste, corner cutting, and an absence of transparency.“But the outcome reported here is clear and the scientific principle of vaccination is demonstrated, which means another vaccine can now join the fight to reduce the incidence of Covid-19”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dr-reddy-s-applies-for-sputnik-authorisation-101613763833644.html
20-02-2021||India||200 farmers protesting against upcoming Goa airport arrested in fresh flare-up||More than 200 farmers who were protesting against the acquisition of their land for the construction of a link road between the upcoming International Airport at Mopa in North Goa were arrested after they disrupted government surveyors who had come to demarcate the land.The protesting farmers who included women blockaded the road leading to the site and refused to budge forcing the police, who had gathered in large numbers to bundle them into buses and place them under arrest.“The farmers had gone to oppose the survey being conducted for acquiring land for a eight kilometre long link road between the national highway and the upcoming airport. They have all been arrested,” Bharat Bagkar the convener of the Samiti formed to protect the farmers’ interests said.“How much more land should we part with? It is always we who have to pay the price of development. Is there no other area that you can choose to ‘develop’? Let other parts of Goa also see the benefits of ‘development’. It’s not like we are the only farmers,” he said.The proposed International Airport at Goa’s northern frontier is being built on 1-crore square metres of land that has been acquired after much opposition that lasted more than a decade and was challenged right up to the Supreme Court.Fresh protests erupted after the Goa government on December 31 published fresh acquisition notices this time for an eight kilometre long ‘link road’ that is to connect the airport with the national highway. The government proposes to acquire a width of 120 square metres to make way for the road.“Each farmer realised how much land he was going to lose. Prior to this they had no intimation and the notice came as a shocker -- one farmer is losing 36,000 square metres -- The people have already lost land for Sport City, Ayush Hospital, Cricket Stadium and the Tillari Canal,” Bagkar said.“We are not willing to part with our land. We are willing to fight till our last breath,” he added.Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant, however, said the Goa government is going out of its way to compensate the farmers whose lands are being acquired and that they should cooperate.“I have already met them twice and listened to their demands. I have told them that the government is committed to go out of the way to ensure compensation for them for their land,” Sawant told reporters late on Friday, after the protestors were detained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/200-farmers-protesting-against-upcoming-goa-airport-arrested-in-fresh-flareup-101613760614124.html
20-02-2021||India||Culture ministry to put draft bylaws on hold for 2 Bhubaneswar temples||Amid opposition from Biju Janata Dal and the priests of the Lingaraj temple in Bhubaneswar regarding the draft bylaws issued by the National Monuments Authority, Union culture minister Prahlad Singh Patel on Friday put the bylaws on hold.In a letter to Union minister of state for MSME, Pratap Sarangi, Patel wrote that he had asked the officials of the culture ministry to keep the proposal on hold. “The final decision on the same would be taken only after the matter is discussed and deliberated with all the stakeholders,” Patel wrote to Sarangi in reply to the latter's request urging the Centre to rethink the matter.Last month, the National Monument Authority under the Union culture ministry issued draft bylaws for the Jagannath Temple of Puri, and Ananta Basudeva and Brahmeswar Temples of Bhubaneswar under the provisions of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010. As per the draft bylaws, construction activities are prohibited within the first 100 metre radius of the monument and are regulated within the next 200 metres. Following protests by state government, the NMA had withdrawn the draft bylaw for Jagannath Temple on February 8.However, the NMA did not withdraw the draft bylaws for the 13th century Ananta Basudeva Temple and Brahmeswar Temple in Bhubaneswar. The draft bylaws for Ananta Basudeva Temple threatened to spoil the Odisha government’s plans of proposed beautification of the Lingaraj Temple as the latter came within the 100 metre radius, thereby ruling out any chances of new construction.Odisha chief secretary Suresh Mohapatra had written to the Union culture secretary demanding withdrawal of the draft bylaws of Ananta Basudeva Temple citing apprehensions of a widespread agitation leading to disturbance in religious rituals. “The kind of atmosphere in temples is bound to hurt the religious sentiments of lakhs of devotees. It is important to have a peaceful atmosphere for conducting the annual Maha Shivratri festival in which a large number of devotees from all over the state participate,” the chief secretary wrote.The priests of the 11th century Lingaraj Temple, backed by the BJD, claimed that the draft bylaw for the 13th century Ananta Basudeva Temple would hinder the Shivaratri festival at the Lingaraj temple.“The draft bylaws of the Ananta Basudeva Temple are an outcome of the difference of opinion between the BJP and the BJD. If the government doesn’t roll back the draft regulations with immediate effect, it may have an impact on the upcoming Shivaratri rituals. The political game over the matter is playing spoilsport in the development of the temple,” said Biranchi Pati, secretary of Brahmana Nijog, one of the most powerful bodies of priests of Lingaraj Temple.The draft bylaws triggered a fight between BJD and BJP with the Bhubaneswar MP and senior BJP leader Aparajita Sarangi saying the draft bylaws for Ananta Basudeva Temple were good. “Heritage areas must be developed. But the route to such development is not through withdrawal/abeyance of bylaws. Protest against the draft bylaw is politically motivated. As the AMSAR Act, 2010 still prevails, the Odisha government must seek permission from NMA/ASI before implementing projects in the prohibited/ regulated areas,” said Sarangi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/culture-ministry-to-put-draft-bylaws-on-hold-for-2-bhubaneswar-temples-101613758111479.html

Addressing a Kisan Mahapanchayat in Kotkhawada area of Chaksu (Jaipur), Pilot pointed out how farmers have been agitating for months now. “This crisis should help everyone realise that the three farm laws by the Centre are not just anti-farmer but against the middle class, youth, and true patriots,” he said.In the mahapanchayat, attended by over a dozen Congress MLAs, a resolution was also passed which sought to ask the Centre to repeal the three new farm laws; a law for purchase on MSP; and reduction in fuel and LPG prices.Calling the public the biggest power in a democracy, Pilot said, “Through this mahapanchayat, we want to warn the government that the youth and farmers are standing united. The people of 36 communities have taken an oath that all will stand united against the steps taken against farmers.Also Read | Farmers ready to sacrifice one crop for protest, BKU ups ante“Farmers don’t need sympathy, they need support. They aren’t begging but asking for their rights. The government assured them double their income but has that happened? Such laws will make our children run from pillar to post. They are misleading– there is no one to listen to farmers in the Central government,” he said.“They talk of caste and religion. The one who produces grain or the one who protects the border doesn’t have a caste. They want to divide us in the name of caste and religion,” said the former deputy CM. He appealed to the farmers to ask the public for support.Earlier this month, Pilot had addressed a mahapanchayat in Dausa and Bharatpur districts of Rajasthan, organised by MLAs who supported him during the political crisis in the state which had threatened to topple the government.In the mahapanchayat on Friday, organised by MLA Ved Prakash Solanki in Chaksu, over a dozen party MLAs were on the dais with Pilot. “An invite was sent to the CM and the state party chief but they chose not to attend. The presence of over a dozen MLAs is sending a clear political message that all’s still not well within the party,” said a senior party leader on the condition of anonymity.Reacting to the Congress mahapanchayat, BJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareek said farmers need to understand that the farm laws are in their interest. Majority of the farmers are in favour of the laws,e said. The protesting farmers should think about the government proposal, and call off the protest, he added. “The Congress leaders must stop misguiding the farmers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-don-t-need-sympathy-they-need-support-sachin-pilot-101613734970595.html

The council is of the view that unregulated circulation of the foreign content is not desirable. Hence, it advises the media to publish foreign extracts in Indian newspapers with due verification as the reporter, publisher and editor of such newspaper shall be responsible for the contents irrespective of the source from which it is received.”An official aware of the details said that the advisory fixes legal responsibility.“There were concerns about who will be held responsible in case of content that is published from foreign sources or from foreign authors. The PCI received submissions about this from the readers as well as the government so it was decided that the legal responsibility of what is published will rest with the Indian publication that prints the content,” the person said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pci-asks-newspapers-to-publish-foriegn-content-after-due-verification/story-7ldfBeyxEYOQ0q2FESlSEN.html
