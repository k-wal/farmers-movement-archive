Though Jaisalmer in Rajasthan was the hottest city in the country with 43.1°C, in Bhubaneswar the maximum temperature was its highest for the month of February since February 23, 1963 when the mercury had climbed to 42.7 degrees Celsius.On Wednesday, the capital city of Odisha recorded 38 degrees Celsius while on Thursday the maximum temperature recorded was 39.4 degrees Celsius, the highest in the country on both days.With other cities in the state recording a rise in daytime temperature, the school and mass education department announced that classes 9 and 11 would be held between 7 am and 9 am. Similarly, classes 10 and 12 will be held between 9 am and 11 am.Weather officials said the rise in maximum day time temperature in Bhubaneswar was due to several factors. “A high-pressure zone extending up to Jharkhand and West Bengal exists over Bhubaneswar. Due to the presence of the high-pressure zone, the air parcels sink downward (towards Earth’s surface), and as a result adiabatic warming takes place. Moreover, factors like solar radiation (Insolation) and lighter wind add up to the heat. These phenomena together are behind the rise in city temperature to around 40 degree Celsius,” said IMD Bhubaneswar director HR Biswas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/february-temperature-in-bhubaneswar-crosses-40-degree-mark-highest-in-58-years-101614362428714.html

It has only said that those who will get their shots at private hospitals will have to pay.Health ministry says over 1.37 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses administeredFor the first phase of vaccination, which began on January 16, India procured the Covishield vaccine, manufactured by Serum Institute, at the cost of ₹200, excluding taxes. It was a discounted offer for the government, as it was said. For other countries, the price is around ₹400 per dose. But the government may cap the price once it is available in the market. One dose of Covaxin, produced by Bharat Biotech, will also cost around ₹295.For the first time, vaccines will be available at private hospitals starting from March 1. Senior citizens, and people above the age of 45 years with co-morbidities will be able to register themselves to get the vaccine shots. The parallel process of inoculating frontline workers free of cost will also go on.The move to rope in private hospitals where vaccines will be available for priority groups gives a shot in the arm of the vaccination process, which has already covered 1.34 crore doses as on Friday evening.Not only in India, Serum Institute — the world's largest vaccine producer by the volume of doses produced, is playing a major role in global vaccine distribution. British-Swedish pharma giant AstraZeneca and US pharma company Novavax have said that they can scale up their vaccine production to over 300 million doses in partnership with Serum Institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/honour-to-meet-you-adar-poonawalla-briefs-amit-shah-on-vaccine-capacity-101614359395876.html
26-02-2021||India||Former CECs say decision to hold 8 phases of polling in WB must have been based on assessment of law and order situation||As the EC's decision to hold assembly elections in West Bengal in eight phases triggered sharp criticism from the state chief minister and others, two former chief election commissioners on Friday justified the move, saying that the decision must have been based on a law and order situation assessment while another CEC advocated single-phase election given that rumours fly thick and fast in this age of social media.Referring to seven-phase voting in West Bengal during 2016 assembly polls, former CECs --O P Rawat and N Gopalaswami-- noted that whenever the EC feels there is enhanced security requirements based on ground realities, it takes these precautions.Though he noted that the EC's decision must be based on its assessment of the law and order situation and availability of security forces, S Y Quraishi, who was the CEC from July 30, 2010 to June 10, 2012, said in the age of social media wherein all kinds of rumours fly thick and fast during elections, there should be an attempt to reduce the duration and number of phases."Ideally, it should be a single-phase election," he added.The Election Commission on Friday announced the poll schedule for five assemblies --Assam, West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry-- with West Bengal to have the maximum eight phases from March 27.Immediately after the announcement, TMC chief and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee criticised the EC decision and said she suspects that the dates were announced as per the suggestions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah for better management of the BJP's poll campaign.Senior Congress leader Tariq Anwar also attacked the EC, alleging that the poll panel has tried to help the BJP."I believe it has been done deliberately and in a way, the EC has tried to help the BJP. They (BJP) feel that it will help them, but it will not as far as I know about the people of Bengal. They are revolutionary in nature...they may deviate for some time but ultimately, Bengal is Bengal," Anwar said.Justifying the poll panel's decision, Rawat said,"the EC in its own wisdom might have felt this time it is more contentious and so more security measures required. Accordingly, it has decided to hold the elections in eight phases.”Rawat, who joined the poll panel in 2015 and retired as the CEC in December 2018, said, "whenever the Commission feels there is requirement of more security so that nobody faces any problem, it takes those precautions.”Asserting that it was for the EC, based on ground realities, to assess, Gopalaswami, who headed the poll panel from 30 June 2006 to 20 April 2009, said look at the number of polling stations (in West Bengal) which have been increased due to Covid (distancing norms), one will get the answer."You need forces. West Bengal is much bigger in size and needs a higher number of central forces. The total number of polling stations in West Bengal is 1,01,916 instead of 77,413 in 2016 polls -- an increase of 31.65 per cent. Due to COVID norms, the number of voters per polling station has been restricted to 1000 from 1500," he added.Quraishi said the commission's decision to hold the election in eight phases spread over a month must be based on its assessment of the law and order situation and availability of security forces."Bengal has the tradition of multi-phase elections," he said, adding that there is not much difference between seven and eight phases.Quraishi, however, advocated holding elections in a single phase. "In the age of social media wherein all kinds of rumours fly thick and fast, there will be an attempt to reduce the duration of elections and number of phases. With more paramilitary forces being available …, one hope as soon as possible the number of phases will be reduced. Ideally, it should be a single-phase election," he said.The EC said the assembly polls in 294 constituencies in West Bengal will be held in eight phases between March 27 and April 29. The counting of votes will take place on May 2, along with that of Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.Polling in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry will be held in one phase on April 6, while Assam will go to polls in three phases on March 27, April 1 and April 6.Reacting to the EC's decision, Banerjee said, "with all due respect to the Commission, I want to say that questions are being raised on why elections will be held in so many phases in Bengal while other states will be voting in one phase. If EC doesn't provide justice to the people, where will the people go."“I have information from my sources that the poll dates are similar to the ones BJP wanted. Have the dates been announced as per the suggestions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah? The PM and the home minister cannot misuse their power for the state elections," she claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-cecs-say-decision-to-hold-8-phases-of-polling-in-wb-must-have-been-based-on-assessment-of-law-and-order-situation-101614357638397.html

People of Chhattisgarh have caused loss to you (by electing Congress) so you will not give free vaccine here? We don't have a dearth of funds. We have kept (funds) for it," he said."If the Union government refuses (to provide free vaccine to all), then we would facilitate Covid vaccination of people in the state at our own expenses," Baghel said.Reiterating his government's decision to use Covaxin vaccine in the state only after its third phase of trial, the CM questioned why Covaxin had been administers to only one per cent of people inoculated in 11 states so far.Baghel said the Central government had earlier agreed to take 60 lakh tonnes of rice from Chhattisgarh in the central pool for the Kharif marketing year 2020-21, but, as of now, permission has been given to deposit only 24 lakh tonnes.He asked the opposition BJP to take up the matter with the Centre.The CM said his government's new industrial policy enacted in 2019 ensured the establishment of 1,249 units in the state, while 104 MoUs signed for mega industrial projects would lead to a capital investment of ₹42,417 crore."We have set a target to establish 200 food parks and locations for 111 have been identified," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cgarh-govt-will-bear-cost-of-covid-19-vaccination-says-chief-minister-101614357621569.html

26-02-2021||India||Workers block NH-16, call for bandh to protest privatisation of Vizag Steel||With the Centre beginning the exercise of privatising the Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL), better known as Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, workers and political parties have stepped up their three week-long agitation against the proposed privatisation.On Friday, thousands of steel plant workers held a “Rasta Roko” in the port city by blocking the national highway (NH-16) and demanding that the Centre drop the move to privatise the steel plant.Raising slogans “Visakha Ukku-Andhrula Hakku” (Visakha Steel is the right of Andhra people), the workers squatted on the highway at Kurmannapalem junction that leads to the steel plant’s main entrance.The vehicular traffic came to a grinding halt on the national highway for more than three hours between 11 am and 2 pm. The police, who made heavy security arrangements to prevent any untoward incident, later dispersed the agitating workers.“Similar protest demonstrations were held by various opposition parties in Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Krishna districts to express solidarity with us,” said J Ayodhya Ramu, president of the Centre for Indian Trade Unions (CITU), the leading trade union in the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant.The trade unions called for a Visakhapatnam shutdown on March 5 as part of intensifying the agitation against the steel plant privatisation. “We shall not give up our fight,” he said.Ramu pointed out that the steel plant had achieved a turnover of ₹1600 crore in the last 25 days, even after the announcement made by the Centre on the privatisation of the steel plant. “We are confident of achieving an annual turnover of ₹20,000 crore. Why should the Centre kill this golden goose?” he asked.Ignoring the continuous protests by the workers of the steel plant, the Centre has begun the exercise of disinvestment in the steel plant. “According to the information we received, the Centre has recently formed an inter-ministerial group comprising senior officials from steel, finance, industries and DIPAM (Department of Investment and Public Asset Management) to work out the modalities for disinvestment,” the trade union leader said.The committee, which also includes chairman and director (finance) of the RINL, would make an assessment of the assets and liabilities of the company, including the value of the machinery and the land and submit the details to the Centre to prepare the bid document before inviting private bidders.The outlawed Communist Party of India (Maoist) on Friday extended its wholehearted support to the agitating workers of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant against its privatisation.In a statement released to the media, Kailasam, official spokesman of CPI (Maoist) Andhra-Odisha Border Special Zonal Committee, alleged that the Narendra Modi government was completely surrendering the nation’s sovereignty to the corporate forces led by Ambanis and Adanis.He asked the steel plant workers to take up the struggle to fight against the undemocratic decision of the Modi government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/workers-block-nh-16-call-for-bandh-to-protest-privatisation-of-vizag-steel-101614345333111.html

However, Udaipur saw the highest amount of engagement in India on Facebook.Also read: Maharashtra records over 8,000 fresh Covid-19 cases again, 1,035 cases in MumbaiThe report states that Indians of all age groups have begun moving out of cities, filling flights to almost 100 per cent capacity across domestic destinations as international travel was mostly restricted to the UAE.India’s recovery was above 100 per cent for almost the whole of December. It was observed that Indians had made last-minute bookings mostly to travel during the end of December and the first week of January. Popular destinations included Goa, Shimla, and Jammu for the first month of 2021.“In the new normal, the Indian millennial traveller would play a critical role in the recovery of the region and therefore this recovery is not only encouraging the domestic hotel industry but also neighbouring Asian markets that rely on China and India to drive their tourism markets," Kamesh Shukla, executive vice president (EVP) and head of Asia Pacific Middle East Africa (APMEA), RateGain, said.“Inspired by travel taken by their family and friends, travellers continue to visit tourist destinations such as Goa, Shimla, and Jammu two weeks after the new year emphasising the role of social media in the recovery of the industry,” he added.Highlighting the top social media trends, the report stated that hotels in the Maldives were ten times more engaged on social media in the last quarter of 2020 after it opened its corridor with India.“Indian hotels saw their highest surge in engagement during November due to a surge experienced by hotels in Mumbai, as they received their guests during the long Diwali weekend for staycations. Hotels in Mumbai drove the most engagement on Facebook and Instagram, almost 150 per cent higher than the average engagement received by hotels in other cities. The Bangalore industry witnessed the least engagement from Indian travellers.

26-02-2021||India||'Bharat Vyapar Bandh' evokes lukewarm response||The day-long 'Bharat Vyapar Bandh' called by the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) evoked a lukewarm response with most shops and commercial establishments open through the day.The traders' body, however, claimed that shopkeepers supported its nationwide business shutdown call to protest against issues related to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and "unethical business practices of foreign e-commerce companies".Various markets in the national capital were open on Friday during the Bandh with many saying that despite supporting the cause, they did not want to suffer another day of losses.However, CAIT in a statement said the shutdown was a "grand success" as more than 8 crore small businesses belonging to about 40,000 trade associations across the country kept their shutters down and no trading activity took place in any commercial market.Brijesh Goyal, president of Chamber of Trade and Industry (CTI), said most of the markets in Delhi were open but the association extended its support to the nationwide business shutdown."Around 98 per cent markets, hotels, restaurants and industrial areas were open except in some parts of Chawri Bazaar and Karol Bagh. However, they have extended their support. We also held a protest at Kashmiri Gate around 12.30 pm," Goyal said.Although various market bodies said they support the cause for the Bandh, they could not shut down their shops or outlets due to multiple reasons.The Bandh was not enforced at Connaught Place market."We are completely in support of the cause. However, it was not practically feasible to enforce the 'Bandh' in the market this time. The traders are already reeling under the losses they incurred during the lockdown and they have heavy burden of rents. We completely support the cause and feel the demands are right," said Atul Bhargava, President, New Delhi Traders Association.Echoing similar views, Sanjeev Mehra, President, Khan Market Association, said the issue is very genuine but the traders are already suffering and did not want to add another day of losses. So they did not participate in the Bandh.However, traders across Odisha downed shutters and commercial vehicles remained off the roads in the state in solidarity with the nationwide 12-hour shutdown on Friday.The Bandh was observed for demanding simplification of the GST procedure and the e-way bill mechanism, among other issues.Around 20 lakh shops and business establishments were closed throughout the state, and there was no report of any untoward incident till afternoon.The impact of the shutdown was felt in several places, including Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Rourkela, Sambalpur, Balasore and Berhampur.On the other hand, business remained unaffected in Madhya Pradesh's business capital Indore.According to local traders, businesses had already incurred losses due to the Covid-19-induced lockdown and they didn't want to down their shutters.The nationwide shutdown impacted other parts of Madhya Pradesh barring Indore, where political reasons and pressure made the difference, CAIT district president Mohammed Peethawala said."We have been registering our opposition over the GST's anomalies since long. But we are not in support of a Bandh on this issue right now," said Ramesh Khandelwal, President of Ahilya Chambers of Commerce and Industries.Traders have suffered heavy losses due to the coronavirus outbreak since last year and they don't want to incur more damages by participating in the Bandh, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-vyapar-bandh-evokes-lukewarm-response-101614348679031.html

Sexual harassment allegations cannot be brushed under the carpet like this," the bench told senior advocate R Balasubramanium appearing for the judge and granted him liberty to withdraw the case here with liberty to participate in the inquiry.Earlier, the Bench had expressed its disinclination to quash the disciplinary proceedings initiated by the Madhya Pradesh High Court against Judge Shambhoo Singh Raghuvanshi, against whom a sexual harassment complaint was lodged after he sent inappropriate messages to a junior judicial officer.Counsel appearing for MP High Court contended that the accused judge had accepted that he had sent the WhatsApp messages and that such conduct would make the atmosphere inconducive for judicial work.The High Court's lawyer said that a senior judicial officer should have had been more appropriate with his conduct while dealing with a lady officer junior to him.The judge's counsel had earlier informed the apex court that the lady officer has withdrawn her complaint under the Prevention of Sexual Harassment Act, and therefore the disciplinary proceedings by the High Court are not maintainable.In 2018, the sexual harassment complaint against the judge, thereafter he approached the Supreme Court to quash the disciplinary proceedings initiated by the High Court, but the top court had declined to entertain the same, asking him to approach the High Court instead.After the High Court refused to entertain his plea, he again approached the top court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cannot-allow-sexual-harassment-cases-to-be-swept-under-the-carpet-sc-101614346779887.html

But for people with co-morbidities, who are also included in this phase starting from Monday, the option of self-registration had to be included.To include this, a new version of Co-win will be launched as the present version is only accessible by vaccinators, and beneficiaries once they are inoculated. After vaccination, beneficiaries can log into the app/website with their reference number to download their digital certificates.Vaccination for senior citizens, and 45+ with co-morbidities: How to register"On this Saturday and Sunday (27th and 28th Feb), the Co-Win digital platform will be transitioning from Co-Win1.0 to Co-Win 2.0. In view of this, COVID 19 Vaccination sessions will not be scheduled during these two days. The States and UTs have been already informed about this transition," the health ministry said, issuing a statement. Many states do not conduct vaccination drives on weekends in any case.The vaccination drive which started on January 16 with healthcare staff has covered over 1,37,56,940 doses as on February 26.The Centre will be announcing the price of vaccine shots in the coming two days as people getting inoculated in private hospitals will have to pay for their vaccines.Ahead of phase 2, the Centre held a consultation with states and union territories on Friday briefing them about the new phase, which will cover around 27 crore people.While senior citizens will not require any additional document apart from their photo identity card, a medical certificate is a must for 45+ who are getting priority for comorbidity issues.In this phase, the option of on-site registration will be there as it may not be possible for everyone to register themselves in advance through mobile apps. They can walk into a vaccination centre with the documents required and can get themselves registered on spot. But whatever the route be, Co-Win 2.0 will capture the details of all beneficiaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-covid-19-vaccination-on-february-27-28-as-co-win-gets-upgrade-101614346400447.html

"We will not run govt on basis of caste and religion but on basis of justice and humanity. 'Justice to all, appeasement of none' will be our principle.

The number of electors per booth will also be limited to 1,000. Covid-19 patients will continue to be allowed to cast their vote by postal ballot or vote in the last hour of the election. “Last year, the entire world, when confronted with the Covid 19 pandemic, was figuring out how to balance the rights of citizens while protecting their health and safety in the thick of this pandemic,” Arora said at the press briefing. “The Commission used the Rajya Sabha elections and Bihar elections last year as a litmus test to see how to conduct large-scale polls. Bihar was a watershed moment, there were more voters than the last assembly election and Lok Sabha election during the pandemic.”The Commission, comprising CEC Arora, ECs Sushil Chandra and Rajiv Kumar, has held extensive meetings across all five regions with stakeholders and poll officials. The Commission has also asked the government to consider poll officials as frontline health workers so that they can be vaccinated on priority.

26-02-2021||India||Sexual harassment complaints not to brushed under carpet: SC||The Supreme Court on Friday underlined that sexual harassment complaints cannot be brushed under the carpet while hearing a retired Madhya Pradesh district judge’s plea against an inquiry against him for allegedly harassing a judicial officer.A Gender Sensitization Internal Complaint Committee (GSICC) in April 2019 did not find substance in the officer’s complaint that he had sent her lewd messages on WhatsApp but recommended disciplinary proceedings against Shambhoo Singh Raghuvanshi, the judge.The court was not inclined to entertain Raghuvanshi’s petition as it did not wish to come in the way of the inquiry. A three-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, noted that soon after the allegation surfaced, a discreet inquiry conducted by the Madhya Pradesh high court had recorded an adverse finding against the petitioner.The bench told R Balasubramanian, who appeared for Raghuvanshi: “You are walking on very thin ice. As matters stand now, you are convicted. During the (disciplinary) enquiry, you may have a chance to be acquitted.” The bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, was willing to pass a short order to this effect. But acting on the advice of the court, the petitioner’s lawyer was allowed to withdraw the petition.The GSICC, in its final report, said, “There is nothing available on the record to hold that any of the charges levelled by the complainant against the respondent are made out.” During the proceedings, the complainant moved an application for conciliation and to end the inquiry without proceeding further. However, this application was dismissed by the Committee.The petitioner wondered how despite recording a finding of “no evidence”, the Committee did a volte-face by recommending disciplinary action. This mandate was not available to the Committee under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, his petition stated.The High Court, represented by senior advocate Ravindra Srivastava, informed the top court that the disciplinary proceedings are independent of the GSICC proceedings. He added the proceedings have been initiated to probe grounds of misconduct. Even if the complainant does not wish to pursue the complaint, the High Court is at liberty to conduct these proceedings, Srivastava added.On an earlier date when the case was taken up, Srivastava read portions of the WhatsApp messages. “This atmosphere of work is not conducive for judicial functioning,” Srivastava said. Even the bench agreed, saying, “Such conduct on part of a judge with a junior officer is not acceptable.”The petitioner claimed to have an unblemished service record of 32 years and argued that when he was due for elevation to the High Court, the sexual harassment allegation was levelled against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sexual-harassment-complaints-not-to-brushed-under-carpet-sc-101614343018831.html

26-02-2021||India||Congress, TRS spar over creation of govt jobs in Telangana in last six years||With elections to the legislative council in two constituencies scheduled to be held on March 14, the Congress and the Telangana Rashtra Samithi have been indulging in a war of words over the creation of jobs for unemployed youth in the last six years.The Telangana Congress challenged the TRS government in the state to hold an open debate at the Telangana Martyr’s Memorial at Gun Park in front of the state assembly complex in Hyderabad on the issue of recruitments made after the formation of Telangana in June 2014.On Friday, a large number of Congress leaders, along with unemployed youth, assembled at the Gun Park, for the debate, but the TRS leaders did not turn up at the venue to take up the challenge.All India Congress Committee spokesperson Dasoju Sravan strongly objected to a statement issued by TRS working president and state industries minister K T Rama Rao on Thursday night, reeling out statistics to show the state government had filled up over 1.32 lakh jobs in various departments in the last six years.Sravan said the minister’s statement was grossly misleading as the data was completely doctored. “KTR claims regularising 22,000-odd jobs in TS Genco, Transco employees as part of the new recruitments, which is quite deceptive,” he said.He pointed out that the recently submitted report of the Biswal Commission had projected as many as 1.91 lakh vacancies. “The government has not been able to protect the jobs of private employees who had lost their employment during the Coronavirus pandemic,” he criticised.Warning that the unemployed graduates would teach a fitting lesson to the TRS in the MLC elections, the Congress spokesperson demanded that the state government disclose the total number of vacancies as of 2014 and the new jobs created since then.The TRS strongly countered the allegations of the Congress spokesperson. “The opposition parties are carrying out a malicious propaganda on the job recruitments, despite the clarity given by our party working president. He has given the department-wise data. Let them go and verify the records, instead of throwing meaningless challenges,” TRS legislator and spokesman Balka Suman said.The TRS leader demanded that the Congress and the BJP leaders should first disclose how many government jobs were created in the states ruled by their parties. “The vacancies filled in Telangana are much more than in Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh,” he said.Suman called upon the graduates to defeat the Congress and the BJP candidates in the MLC elections as the parties were misleading the people by making false allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-trs-spar-over-creation-of-govt-jobs-in-telangana-in-last-six-years-101614341487127.html

My struggle is not against any person, but it is dedicated to the ideology of the Congress. I am ready to suffer any political damage for that,” he wrote. “Many big politicians say Nathuram Godse was the first terrorist of India, but why they are silent over the induction of admirer of Godse into the Congress.”Yadav questioned will the Congress accept lawmaker Pragya Thakur, who called Godse a patriot and prompted Prime Minister Narendra Modi to say he would not forgive her, if she joins the party.Also Read | Juvenile convict to be let off with fine in 22-year-old murder caseBabulal Chaurasiya was inducted into the Congress in the presence of former chief minister Kamal Nath on Thursday.“During his tenure...

This will be possible as the government has decided to unbundle certain services and make them chargeable on an opt-in basis, as per the feedback received from passengers.According to a circular issued by the aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), on Friday, “It is felt at many times that these services provided by the airlines may not be required by the passengers while travelling. Considering the fact that unbundling of services and charges thereto has the potential to make basic fare more affordable and provide consumers an option of paying for the services which he/ she wishes to avail, it has been decided by the government to allow check- in baggage charges separately.” Also Read | Bengaluru airport installs disabled aircraft recovery kitDGCA director general Arun Kumar said, “The aim is to bring in this unbundling rule, and is issued with immediate effect.”Elaborating on this rule, DGCA said, “As part of airline baggage policy, scheduled airlines will be allowed to offer free baggage allowance as well as zero baggage/ no check-in baggage fares”. This will be subject to the condition that the passengers booking tickets under such fare scheme are made aware of the charges that shall be applicable if they turned up with baggage check-in at the airline counter. These applicable charges will be reasonable, prominently displayed to the passenger at the time of booking of ticket and also to be printed on the ticket.” The government has also allowed services like seat preference, meal/ snack (except water), sports equipment, musical instrument carriage, free for a special declaration of valuable baggage, to be charged separately by the airlines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/flyers-to-soon-get-concession-on-fares-for-travelling-without-check-in-baggage-101614336478458.html
26-02-2021||India||The importance of caste census and its political implications||There have been growing demands for a caste census with the general census in 2022 since Justice G Rohini-led commission submitted a draft proposal recommending a sub-categorisation of the reservation for the Other Backward Classes (OBC). The OBC reservation has always been a touchy political issue and demands for giving the quota benefits to the “real” deprived among them have gained traction primarily as they are seen as a new vote bank. A low-down on the debate:Sub-categorisation of OBC reservationIt has been felt for years that only a few affluent communities, around 100, among the more than 2,633 on the central list of OBCs have gained most from the 27% OBC reservation. The reservation was implemented on the basis of the 1931 caste census, which found 52% of Indians were OBC and did not fall in the category of scheduled castes or tribes. The government adopted the Mandal Commission recommendation to provide the 27% reservation. In 2008, the OBC reservation was extended to admissions to institutes of higher education.There have been demands for creating categories within OBCs to ensure equitable distribution of the quota benefit to all. Some states such as Bihar have experimented with the sub-categorisation and carved the reservation for extremely backward classes within the OBC reservation. In October 2017, the Centre constituted the Rohini commission to examine the sub-categorisation and submit a report within 12 weeks. Since then, the commission has been given 10 extensions.What has the Rohini Commission recommended?Around 2,633 castes are covered under the OBC reservation. The states have the flexibility to add castes to the central list depending on local deprivation levels determined by local OBC commissions. In February 2021, the Rohini commission proposed to divide the 27% reservation for the castes on the Central list into four sub-categories.In 2018, the commission analysed the data of 13,00,00 central jobs and admissions to central higher education institutions under the OBC quota over the preceding five years. It found that 97% of all jobs and educational seats have gone to just 25% of all sub-castes classified. And 24.95% of these jobs and seats went to just 10 OBC communities. The commission also said that 983 OBC communities, one-third of the total, had almost had zero representation in jobs and admissions in educational institutions.Response to Rohini Commission draftChief ministers including Nitish Kumar of Bihar and Jagan Mohan Reddy of Andhra Pradesh have welcomed the idea. Kumar has been the original proponent of the sub-categorisation and has provided 18% of the OBC quota in Bihar to 113 extremely backward castes, who constitute about 30% of the state’s population. The Congress and Samajwadi Party have also welcomed the sub-categorisation but said they would provide a detailed response when the commission’s draft is made public. They have underlined the idea should be taken forward after a fresh caste census.The caste census demandExperts believe the idea of sub-categorisation would be a meaningless exercise without the caste census that could help the government understand the exact deprivation levels. They also say it would perpetuate the historical injustice as those deprived among OBCs can be left out because the present reservation is based on the 1931 caste census when India’s population was 270 million. The 1931 caste census included present-day Pakistan and Bangladesh also.India’s population has since increased three-fold to 1.21 billion in 2011. Experts believe the economic status of the dominant OBC castes have improved in the past 80 years and certain castes have not benefitted as much. So, they want a new caste census that also measures the economic and social well-being of all castes. Amid growing political pressure, then Union home minister Rajnath Singh in August 2018 announced that in census 2021, data of OBCs will also be collected. However, the government has been silent on the issue since then.2011 caste census statusThe Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government decided to conduct independent India’s first caste census in 2010 along with the socio-economic census to determine the deprivation levels. OBC leaders such as Lalu Prasad, Mulayam Singh Yadav, and Nitish Kumar supported the decision.While the socio-economic census details were publicly shared. The only information provided about the caste census was there were 46,00,00 castes, sub-castes, and gotras. The Registrar General of India, mandated to conduct the census, found a defect in caste data related to every fourth household – 80 million out of the total 330 million. About 67 million errors were rectified while another 14 million were pending.A committee headed by then Niti Aayog vice-chairman Arvind Panigariya was set up in July 2015 for sorting the vast database. The committee gave its initial report in 2017 before Panigariya left but it has not been made public. He had earlier told HT that formatting the data into a cohesive document was difficult as no thought was given on how the data could be used before the enumeration started. “There were no clear fields in the enumeration charts,” he had said.Experts believe that sharing the data could create more divide in the society and demands for reducing quota for certain castes and increasing for others. There is also fear that a repeat of the 1911 caste census can happen when the so-called upper castes were declared a social minority.Political implicationsThe 1931 census was conducted to identify the ways through which colonial power could strengthen control. The data was used to create a separate vote-bank in the 1980s by leaders, who emerged from Jai Prakash Narayan’s anti-corruption movement and led to the creation of Janata Dal. Something similar is being attempted now through the sub-categorisation of the OBC quota. Political parties know that the new caste census can help them to create a new vote-bank of socially and economically deprived sections among the OBCs. Nitish Kumar has been able to carve such a vote-bank for his party, the Janata Dal (United) in Bihar. Many believe that in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP has done well politically as it was able to bring the upper castes and socially deprived OBCs together. In Madhya Pradesh, a similar experiment has worked in Vindhya and Mahakoshal regions of the state, turning them into a BJP bastion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/importance-of-caste-census-and-its-political-implications-101614336418488.html
26-02-2021||India||India-Pak ceasefire agreement rekindles hope for peace among border residents||The announcement by India and Pakistan to strictly observe all agreements on ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) and other sectors has rekindled hope for a peaceful future among border residents in Jammu and Kashmir who have been living under constant fear of firing and shelling."We are joyous over the news of a fresh agreement between the two countries to observe complete ceasefire along the borderline. It has rekindled hope among us," Kalal-resident Mohmmad Isaaq said.Isaaq hoped that Pakistan would keep its promise of complete observance of the ceasefire agreement."We hope Pakistan keeps the promise of not firing on us. We do not feel that they will religiously observe ceasefire. They have made such promises in the past as well, only to violate them," he said.For the past few years, Pakistan has engaged in shelling and firing along the LoC and the International Border (IB) resulting in casualties, damage to houses, schools, health centres and religious places."We have suffered a lot to due Pakistani firing and shelling.... Education of kids was affected. Houses were damaged. There were casualties. The fresh agreement of maintaining complete ceasefire is a happy news for us. Hope it stays," Sarpanch Bhawani in Rajouri district Sunil Kumar said.Subash Chander, a Panch, said although they are very happy over the news, but it is difficult to trust Pakistan.Similar apprehension was raised by Kerni-resudent Mohmmad Ashraf who welcomed the fresh agreement but raised question over the intention of Pakistan.Kiran Kumar, a Kathua District Development Council (DDC) member, says that it is a happy news for border residents. "We thank the central government for this decision. We want Pakistan to behave as a good neighbour by ensuring zero firing from their side. Farmers will fearlessly cultivate their lands on border. Life will be better," he said.India and Pakistan on Thursday announced that they have agreed to strictly observe all agreements on ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir and other sectors.A joint statement issued in Islamabad and New Delhi said the Director Generals of Military Operations of the two countries held discussions over the established mechanism of hotline contact and reviewed the situation along the LoC and all other sectors in a "free, frank and cordial" atmosphere.India and Pakistan signed a ceasefire agreement in 2003, but it has hardly been followed in letter and spirit over past several years with more violations than observance of the pact.In written response to a question in Lok Sabha earlier this month, Union Minister of State for Home G Kishan Reddy said a total of 10,752 cases of ceasefire violations have taken place along India's border with Pakistan in the last three years, in which 72 security personnel and 70 civilians were killed.He said 364 security personnel and 341 civilians were injured in cross-border firings along the International Border and the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir in 2018, 2019 and 2020.India shares a 3,323-km border with Pakistan, of which 221 km of the IB and 740 km of the LoC fall in Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiapak-ceasefire-agreement-rekindles-hope-for-peace-among-border-residents-101614335305209.html

26-02-2021||India||Maoist violence on the decline in Chhattisgarh||There has been a significant decline in gunbattles between security forces and Maoists in Left-wing insurgency-hit Chhattisgarh over the last few years, according to the state police data. The number of gunbattles came down to 84 last year compared to 121 in 2019, 166 in 2018, 198 in 2017, and 211 in 2016 even as officials cautioned against reading too much into the data.Multiple officials said the decrease could also be because of less engagement of security forces in core areas with Maoists and defensive counter-insurgency strategy. “...tactically Maoists are also not engaging the police until they are in a very dominant position. There was hardly any engagement between the Maoists and the forces in 2019...,” said an official on condition of anonymity.A second official said the Maoists adopted a wait-and-watch strategy to understand the new government that was voted to power in the state in 2018. “Many Maoist leaders were of the opinion that a soft pro-tribal government has come in the state and they should not do anything to annoy it....but the killing of Bharatiya Janata Party lawmaker Bhima Mandavi [in 2019] led to change in the stance,” said the official posted in Maoist-hit Bastar region.A third officer said the Maoists also face a fund crunch because of the 2016 demonetisation of high-value currency notes and the Covid-19 pandemic. “....[They] thus want road construction and other activities to continue in lieu of levy...there is marked decrease in arson. Maoists are mainly depending on low-intensity conflict....biding time to consolidate themselves.”A decrease in infrastructure projects in South Bastar and more focus of the government on the social sector has also led to a marked decrease in Maoist funds.Also Read | Allegations cloud alleged suicide of surrendered woman ‘Maoist’Intelligence officials believe key Maoist leader Ramanna’s death due to illness has also left a vacuum in their top leadership. “Connectivity of senior leadership with the middle rung has become a major issue due to the strategic locations of security forces’ camps...[this has resulted] in less execution of big ambushes and brought down the violence graph. ...the opening of around 10 new camps at the strategic locations has also helped the government in reducing Maoist violence,” said a fourth official.The official added the Maoists seem confused as dedicated and disciplined people in their ranks have remarkably decreased. He added Maoists have killed many of their own on suspicion of being police informers. “Many middle-level cadres are surrendering due to fatigue and understanding of the misdirected fight.”In 2020, 215 Maoists surrendered compared to 315 in 2019, 465 in 2018, and 366 in 2017. “If surrenders decreased, it clearly suggests that Maoists have increased their hold in the core area,” said a fifth official.Jan Militia of the Maoists is also replacing their main force in many areas. “Jan Militia lacks planning experience and tactics...the militia is relying more on small...attacks.”A sixth official acknowledged they have not been very aggressive in the last two years and the Maoists have focussed on recruitment during this time.“If troops are deployed as planned, it will lead to a marked decrease in Maoist violence...”There has also been a decrease in civilian killing in 2019 (47) and 2020 (36). But over two months of 2021, 12 civilians have been killed. “...Everyone knows in the state that senior officers on the field are reluctant to send forces for anti-Naxal operations because they are afraid of political fallout.”Only 28 Maoist were killed in 2020 compared to 79 in 2019. “This shows that the Maoist themselves are not engaging with security forces. This could be for two reasons – forces are not entering their areas and lack of planning among the Maoists due to the pandemic.”Inspector general (Bastar range) Sunderaj P said they have improved the intelligence network and the public support for the Maoists has also gone down. He rejected the suggestion that they have been defensive and added police have raided over 140 hideouts and recovered arms and ammunition.“In 2020, we opened 14 new operational base camps in Bastar range...that have opened up few critical roads along... We are strongly marching forward in our mission to bring an end to the Left-wing insurgency...”Intelligence officials cited interrogation of surrendered Maoists and said they are more focused on the newly formed Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh zone. This is another reason for the decline in violence, they added.“Violence has gone down but still an area the size of a country like Israel remains under Maoist dominance in Chhattisgarh. Bastar is bigger than Kerala in size and around half of Bastar is still under direct Maoist control or they have significant presence there. Of course security forces have made some progress but we are hearing unconfirmed reports that Maoists have banned education for children above the age of 10 and many of them have now started working for Maoists,” said Shubhranshu Chaudhary, a peace activist working in Bastar region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoist-violence-on-the-decline-in-chhattisgarh-101614334438377.html
26-02-2021||India||India’s cyber crime hub Jamtara scripting new story with public library mission||Ajharuddin Ansari, 25, a daily-wage labourer, spends at least four hours daily in the panchayat’s public library, built by district administration, to prepare for competitive examinations to government services. Ansari, who lost his mother in 2005 and father in 2015, pays for the education of his two sisters with his income from the construction site. He counts the newly-built library as a blessing for him and his two sisters.“We are not economically sound enough to buy books for competitive examinations or pay for tuition of my sisters. The library is meeting all our learning needs. Now, I dream to crack examinations for government services,” said Ansari, a physics graduate.Ansari is not alone, hundreds of students, mostly from the weaker section, are benefitting from the public library movement launched by the administration in Jamtara, a Jharkhand district considered to be the Indian equivalent of the Romanian town Ramnicu Valcea, which was considered the global hotbed for cybercriminals in 1990s.Scale of phishing activities in the district could be assumed from the fact that more than 150 cyber fraudsters were arrested in 2020, while more than 90 cyber criminals are languishing in Jamtara jails, officials said. Police of more than 20 states have visited the district in connection with online fraud cases.In a bid to shed the negative image of the district, the administration conceptualized the idea of setting up a public library in each panchayat of the district, which could illuminate the path shown by legendary educationist and social reformer Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar in the district in the 19th century.Vidyasagar, who brought a revolution in the education system of Bengal, came to Karmatar, a sleepy hamlet in Jamtara, in early 1873 to recuperate from poor health and ended up spending more than 18 years in the village.Jamtara deputy commissioner (DC) Faiz Aq Ahmed Mumtaz said 88 libraries have been built so far and all are functional in 88 panchayats. The DC said all the 118 panchayats of the district would have a library in the next fortnight.“We wanted to change the negative image of the district and rehabilitate the youths involved in negative activities. Then, the concept of setting up public libraries came to our mind. We started working on it and it soon turned out to be a big success,” Mumtaz said.Funds and infrastructure were major challenges first. “We put in funds through convergence of various schemes. Besides, funds were also managed through contribution, donation, crowdsourcing and corporate social responsibility,” he said.Thereafter, abandoned buildings or community halls were identified, renovated and converted into libraries in each panchayat. Geo-tagging of all the libraries was done for identification and contact numbers of librarians were available on the website, he said.The libraries are getting a huge response from students. “There are 100 books in the library provided by the administration, and around 50 students from the village are preparing for exams,” said Ansari, a resident of Jiyajori village in the district. He said many youths, who were earlier engaged in phishing activities, were now joining the library to prepare for competitive examinations.Also Read: 10th century Buddha Vihar discovered in Jharkhand’s HazaribagBiswajit Gorai, 21, a resident of Mejhia panchayat of the district, said life was not the same when there was no library in and around his village. “A new library was built in November last year, which has changed the lives of the students. We, the senior students, are preparing for the competitive examinations in group, while junior students are preparing for school examinations in the library.”He said most of the residents in the village are poor. “They do not have money to buy books. However, the library has sorted out that problem. Now, the village has got a proper educational environment,” he said.Riya Gorai, an intermediate student of the same village, said, “My parents do not have enough money to get me tuition. However, the problem is now sorted out as I get help from my seniors in the library.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-cyber-crime-hub-jamtara-scripting-new-story-with-public-library-mission-101614333756456.html

26-02-2021||India||Indian coast guard rescue 81 Rohingya refugees adrift at sea, 8 dead||India's coast guard found 81 survivors and eight dead on a boat crammed with Muslim Rohingya refugees adrift in the Andaman Sea, and were repairing the vessel so that it can return safely to Bangladesh, Indian officials said on Friday.The Indian government was in discussions with Bangladesh to agree for the safe return of the vessel, which was found drifting in international waters, having left southern Bangladesh about two weeks ago with hopes of reaching Malaysia.Many of the survivors, according to Indian officials, were sick and suffering from extreme dehydration, having run out of food and water after the boat's engine failed four days after leaving Cox's Bazar, where refugee camps house hundreds of thousands of Rohingya who have fled neighbouring Myanmar."The engine of the boat broke down earlier this week and we received a SOS from some Rohingyas, " said an Indian coast guard official overseeing the search and rescue effort from New Delhi."It's a humanitarian crisis and we are doing the best we can to save their lives," he said, requesting anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media."The foreign ministry is working towards sending them back to Bangladesh and India will repair or replace the boat's engine to ensure they can travel back safely," he said.The survivors were being provided with food supplies and medicine, and women and children have been given fresh clothes. It was unclear what arrangements were being made for the funeral rites of the people who perished, he added.Giving news that the boat had been found, India's External Affairs Ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava said on Thursday two Indian coast guard ships were dispatched to search for the boat following urgent calls for help.The United Nations refugee agency had raised the alarm earlier this week over the missing boat, which had left Cox's Bazar on Feb. 11.Of the 90 people that had set out on the voyage, eight were found dead, and one was missing, Srivasta said. Talks were underway with Bangladesh for the safe return of the 81 survivors, he added."Bangladesh is respectful of its international obligations under the UNCLOS (The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea)," Bangladesh's foreign ministry said in a statement.On earlier occasions when other littoral countries of the region repeatedly denied access to Rohingya adrift at sea, it was the Bangladesh that came to the rescue, the ministry added.More than 1 million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar are living in crowded camps in Bangladesh, including tens of thousands who fled after Myanmar's military conducted a deadly crackdown in 2017.Human traffickers often lure Rohingya refugees, promising them work in Southeast Asian nations.The Bangladesh statement said the boat had been traced approximately 1,700 km (1,056 miles) away from Bangladesh and 147 km (91 miles) from India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands."Other states, particularly those on whose territorial water the vessel has been found, bear the primary responsibility and they should fulfil their obligation under international law and burden-sharing principle," the ministry said.India is not a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention, which spells out refugee rights and state responsibilities to protect them. Nor does it have a domestic law protecting refugees, though it currently hosts more than 200,000, including some Rohingya.While India diplomats sought ways to resolve the humanitarian crisis in the Andaman Sea, Indian President Ram Nath Kovind was set to visit islands there during coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-coast-guard-rescues-81-rohingya-refugees-adrift-at-sea-8-died-101614331929547.html

Never has this been more pronounced than the last few years… And we aren’t alone: every institution is experiencing a significant trust deficit,” he said to analysts, as reported by PTI.Centre announces rules for OTT, digital mediaTwitter ran into trouble in India following Republic Day violence than unfolded in the national Capital when farmers took out a tractor rally protesting three agriculture laws. The government flagged several Twitter accounts tweeting with hashtags 'farmer genocide', asking the platform to take action against them. Twitter took a series of staggered action but some accounts were restored after being briefly suspended, and Twitter defended its action citing its policy of freedom of expression.The new guidelines, released by the IT ministry, require social media intermediaries to appoint a resident grievance officer, who shall register complaints in 24 hours, and file monthly compliance reports. User grievances have to be resolved within 15 days.The new rules take effect immediately, though significant social-media providers (based on the number of users) will get three months before they need to start complying.CEO Dorsey on Friday said Twitter intends to make its content moderation practices more transparent, give people more control to moderate their interactions, enable a marketplace approach to relevance algorithms, and fund an open-source social media standard.Focus on metrics like transparency, accountability, reliability and choice will have a huge impact, he said.As part of its series of reform measures, the microblogging platform is planning to introduce a way for users to automatically block and mute abusive accounts.(With Agency Inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/many-people-don-t-trust-us-jack-dorsey-after-twitter-s-face-off-with-govt-101614329249008.html

It provides a framework for the decentralisation of democracy. It strengthens the democracy at the grass-root level through which citizens get an opportunity to become a stakeholder in the local self-government of their area," the speaker said."There are several provisions in our Constitution providing optimal opportunities for the development of all the areas in the country. North East India is quite distinct from the geographical and socio-cultural point of view, therefore keeping it in view; a special provision for three Autonomous District Council for these States has been made in the Sixth Schedule of our Constitution," Birla said.The prime objective of setting up these Councils is to protect the rights of the tribal communities of the North East, provide them equal rights in the decision-making process and to ensure that their administration is carried out in accordance with their traditions and conventions, he said."Mahatma Gandhi believed that the soul of India lives in villages. He believed in rural self-government and the development of the nation (Rashtrodaya) through the development of the villages (Gramodaya). He believed that every village should be self-reliant. The Government is formulating policies and schemes to make this very self-reliance a nationwide phenomenon. But, a self-reliant India can only be possible when we are Vocal for Local," he said.Highlighting the digital penetration in governance, he said that e-Panchyat has been introduced which has brought revolutionary changes in the working of local self-government.It is our responsibility to make a collective effort to make democracy strong, transparent and accountable, he added.Chief Minister of Meghalaya Conrad Sangma, Speaker of Meghalaya Legislative Assembly Metbah Lyngdoh, Union Minister of State, Ministry of Food Processing & Industries, Rameshwar Teli and a range of MPs from across the North Eastern region also took part in the event.The programme was organised by Parliamentary Research and Training Institute for Democracies (PRIDE), of the Lok Sabha Secretariat.The theme of the programme was 'Panchayati Raj System/Autonomous District Council- Strengthening Decentralised democracy'.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/local-self-government-symbol-of-democracy-development-says-lok-sabha-speaker-101614330117789.html

Accused Chintamani Patel alias Chintu, 20, who is a friend of the woman’s son, was arrested on Thursday.The incident took place on Wednesday night in a village under Basna police station area of the district.Station House Officer (SHO), Basna, Lekhram Thakur said that the victim was rushed to a nearby hospital where she died on Thursday.“Chintu and the victim’s son were friends and were from the same village. On Wednesday night, Chintu landed at his friend’s house to pick him up to watch his harvester, which was parked in a nearby field. The victim told the accused that his son was not at home. The woman then accompanied the accused as it was late and he was going alone,” said Thakur.While returning from the field, Chintu tried to molest the woman and she fought back.“The accused hit her with a stone on the head. Some villagers rushed to the spot hearing the alarm and found that the victim was on the ground. The woman narrated what happened to a bunch of villagers before she collapsed. Chintu fled from the spot,” the SHO added.Police said that she was rushed to a nearby hospital where she died during treatment.“On the basis of the statement by the victim, the police arrested the accused on Thursday,” Thakur said.Earlier this month, a 15-year-old girl was raped and bludgeoned to death before she was dumped in a forest in Korba district. The girl’s father and her four-year-old niece were also killed by the accused. Six people were arrested by Korba police in this connection.On February 2, a 16-year-old girl was raped by nine persons in the tribal dominated Jashpur district.On Wednesday, the opposition BJP attacked the Congress government over the alleged rise in crimes against women in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-beaten-to-death-by-son-s-friend-20-for-resisting-molestation-cops-101614330080706.html
26-02-2021||India||Govt has a clear vision for India’s financial sector’: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said his government has a clear vision regarding the financial sector in this country and that there are “no ifs and buts” as he reaffirmed its stance on strengthening the public sector. “To strengthen the public sector, equity capital infusion is being stressed on. A new ARC structure is also being made to take care of NPAs (non-performing assets),” PM Modi said while addressing a webinar on budget proposals.PM Modi insisted that not every decision taken by the government has bad intentions, adding that the country's financial and banking sector had been weakened due to aggressive lending in the past, which was brought in control by his government. “The country's financial and banking sector was weakened in the name of aggressive lending about 10 years ago,” he said.PM Modi stressed the steps taken to do away with non-transparent trading culture, adding that insolvency and bankruptcy codes brought by his government helped foster trust and belief for lenders and borrowers. Reinforcing his previous stance on promoting the private sector, he said, “Our endeavour is to promote private sector business but public sector banks and insurance sector have an important role in the country”.He talked at length about the recent privatisation bids for two public sector banks, raising the foreign direct investment ceiling in the insurance sector, and the Initial Public Offering of LIC. “There is still great scope for the banking and insurance sectors in our economy. Keeping this in mind, we have taken many steps in this budget -- be it our decision to privatise two PSBs, raising FDI limit to 74% in insurance or our decision to bring LIC IPO,” he said.PM Modi also outlined the role sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and insurance companies are expected to play in the country’s future and said that the government has made asset creation a priority in this year’s budget. “Sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, insurance companies are being encouraged to get involved in infrastructure projects,” he said.He reinstated his call for an Aatmanirbhar Bharat or self-reliant India. “Our start-ups and MSMEs would be the identity of Aatmanirbhar Bharat that is why special schemes were formulated for MSMEs during the time of Covid pandemic. Under these schemes, around 90 lakh enterprises have been given credit worth ₹2.4 trillion,” the PM said.The Prime Minister praised the role played by fintech in making financial services accessible during the pandemic last year and predicted that the sector “is likely to grow to ₹6 lakh crore”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-has-a-clear-vision-for-india-s-financial-sector-pm-modi-101614329962341.html

26-02-2021||India||'BJP, Congress 'perturbed and scared' after AAP's poll win: Kejriwal in Gujarat’s Surat||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said the Bharatiya Janata Party and Congress are afraid of his Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) after it breached the BJP’s citadel in Gujarat’s Surat. The AAP won 27 out of the 120 seats in Surat’s municipal corporation in the recently held polls in its first outing. The BJP secured 93 seats and the Congress and other parties failed to win any.Kejriwal held a roadshow in the city to thank voters after making inroads in the recently-held civic polls. Speaking during the rally, Kejriwal said he has been hearing the statements made by the opposition, including the BJP and Congress, after the AAP's success in the civic polls. "They are perturbed, a little scared. We have to understand that they're not scared of you or AAP. They are scared of people who voted for you," the AAP convenor told newly-elected corporators in Surat.Attacking the BJP, Kejriwal also said it keeps other parties under control in its bastion state Gujarat. "Why has the BJP been governing here for the last 25 years? It's not as if they are doing great. There are a lot of issues. Different parties come to power in states across the country but only one party is governing here," he said. "It is because they have kept other parties under control. There's no one to tell them anything, they are doing whatever they want," Kejriwal added. "For the first time when there came someone to look them in the eye -- you, people gave you respect," he also said while addressing the corporators.As the party emerged as the second largest in Gujarat, the BJP seems to be unfazed as it said AAP’s gains should worry the Congress more. “The BJP’s hold in Surat continues. there is no dent in the party’s support base. The AAP has moved into the space vacated by Congress. The leadership crisis in the Congress is forcing it out as the principal opposition,” it had said earlier.The AAP, which did not win any seats in its first electoral foray in Gujarat in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, chose to fight the elections at the grassroots level this time before graduating to the 2022 state polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-congress-perturbed-and-scared-after-aap-s-poll-win-kejriwal-in-gujarat-s-surat-101614328829820.html
26-02-2021||India||‘Need to stand up for MSMEs...people expect govt to bat for them’: Jaishankar||Minister of external affairs S Jaishankar called for support to domestic businesses, especially micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) on Friday. “This realisation is very sharp in India. We need to stand up for our business and that doesn't mean just big business, it means MSMEs,” Jaishankar said, according to news agency ANI.The minister asserted that it is the government’s responsibility to support domestic businesses and that India has so far not done enough in this regard. “People today expect the government to bat for them. It's not just the business of Indian diplomacy to do business, it's the business of the government to support businesses. Every government in the world does that, we in India haven't done that enough and I think that is changing,” he was quoted as saying by ANI. Jaishankar was addressing the fifth Asia Economic Dialogue (AED) 2021, the theme for which this year is 'Post Covid-19 Global Trade and Finance Dynamics'. The conference saw international participation from foreign ministers of a number of countries, senior bureaucrats, industry leaders and global financial experts, according to ANI. In a separate virtual event, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also spoke about the schemes meant to uplift small businesses in the country. “Self-reliant India will be made of our MSMEs, will be made of our startups. That is why special schemes were formulated for MSMEs during the Covid-19 pandemic under which around 90 lakh enterprises have been given credit worth ₹2.4 trillion,” he said while addressing a webinar on aspects relating to financial services in this year’s budget, presented by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman earlier this month. “Self-reliant India will not be made up of just big industries or big cities. In a self-reliant India village, small entrepreneurs in small towns will be made up of the hard work of ordinary Indians. It will be made up of farmers, units making agricultural products better,” Modi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-to-stand-up-for-msmes-people-expect-govt-to-bat-for-them-jaishankar-101614327652648.html
26-02-2021||India||SC refuses contempt plea, says tigress Avni killed in accordance with court order||The Supreme Court on Friday closed contempt proceedings it had initiated against Maharashtra government officials over the killing of Avni, a tigress, in November 2018.The court had issued a notice on February 10, based on a petition filed by wildlife enthusiast Sangeeta Dogra, to Maharashtra principal secretary Vikas Kharge, the principal chief conservator, forests (Nagpur), deputy conservator, forests (Nagpur), deputy conservator, forests (Pandharkawada), and member secretary, NTCA. The petition had questioned the assumption that the tigress was a man-eater. Dogra, in her petition, also pointed out that the forest officials violated the Supreme Court order of September 11, 2018, restraining any kind of celebration over the death of the tigress. Also Read | Changes in tiger habitat disrupting evolutionary processes, says studyOn Friday, the officials who were issued the notice filed a response claiming that no ground for contempt was made out. They said that the order to shoot the tigress was confirmed by the top court’s September 2018 order. Further, it was pointed out that the celebration was held by villagers and did not involve forest officials. Dogra, in her petition, pointed out that within days after the killing, the villagers arranged a felicitation function on November 14, 2018 and presented a silver statue of the tigress along with a cash reward to the shooter involved in the killing. The bench led by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, and comprising justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said, “If villagers believe that they will not be attacked again and decide to celebrate, how can the forest officials ensure that they don’t celebrate?”Further, the state officials pointed out that the order to kill the tigress was confirmed by the Supreme Court.The bench took these statements on record and said, “We can’t review our earlier decision and say she was not a man-eater. Also, they are stating that villagers and not they had celebrated... We cannot interfere in this case.”Dogra then sought permission to withdraw the petition and it was granted.On September 11, 2018, the Supreme Court, while permitting Avni (T-1) to be shot down, had said, “The efforts to tranquilise and capture T-1 tigress will be continued and if unsuccessful, it shall be eliminated by shooting to avoid any further loss of human life. The chief conservator of forests, Yavatmal, is authorised to carry out the above order. He shall not declare any prize or any similar incentive for the responsible person.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-refuses-contempt-plea-says-tigress-avni-killed-in-accordance-with-court-order-101614325738073.html
26-02-2021||India||In Jaishankar’s 75-minute phone call to China’s Wang Yi, one message stands out||After China put out its version of the telephonic conversation between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his counterpart Wang Yi, India on Friday reiterated that the way to improve bilateral ties only lies through peace and tranquillity at the border and the road to normalcy lies only through disengagement and de-escalation all along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).In his 75-minute conversation with China’s Wang Yi on Thursday, the external affairs ministry said S Jaishankar underlined the need to extend the disengagement of the armies near Pangong Tso to other friction points in the East Ladakh sector, asserting that prolonging the friction along the border does not serve either India or China.Jaishankar’s blunt message emphasised to Wang Yi during their conversation was that disengagement and de-escalation was the only way out.Also Read: ‘De-escalation in Ladakh is a long way off’: General Naravane“Normalcy and a border dispute cannot run parallelly as Beijing wants,” said a senior South Block official. “China has not told India why it attempted to change the status quo at Pangong Tso in May 2020 and why it withdrew 10 months later," he said.Jaishankar, the official said, presented his diagnosis of the hurdles to the normal resumption of bilateral ties in his conversation with Wang, and the steps needed to turn back the clock.Jaishankar noted, according to a readout of the statement, that bilateral relations between the two countries had already been impacted due to China’s unilateral attempts to alter status quo at the border and according to a readout of the phone conversation by the Indian side.The Indian statement, issued on Friday hours after the Chinese foreign ministry put out its version of the phone call between the foreign ministers, quoted Jaishankar stressing the need to disengage quickly from other friction points on more than one occasion during the phone call.The Indian Army and China’s People’s Liberation Army pulled back troops, armoured vehicles and artillery from strategic heights around Pangong Tso last week. The first part of the disengagement was completed last Friday.Military commanders of the two armies held a marathon 10th round of talks the following day (February 20) - it continued for 16 hours - to discuss disengagement at other friction points, Depsang, Hot Springs and Gogra. There has, however, not been an announcement on extending the disengagement to other sectors yet.Jaishankar’s stress on quick disengagement from other friction points came in this context, a contrast to the continuing Chinese thrust on treating the border dispute as a reality that Beijing wants to be placed at an appropriate position in bilateral ties. In diplomatic jargon, it is a suggestion that New Delhi shouldn’t let the border dispute stand in the way of the bilateral relations getting back on track, particularly economic relations.The Indian statement, quoting Jaishankar, said: “A prolongation of the existing situation was not in the interest of either side. It was, therefore, necessary that the two sides should work towards early resolution of remaining issues. It was necessary to disengage at all friction points in order to contemplate the de-escalation of forces in this sector. That alone will lead to the restoration of peace and tranquillity and provide conditions for progress of our bilateral relationship.”Jaishankar prefaced his outright emphasis on quick disengagement by recalling his September 2020 conversation with Wang Yi in Moscow where he expressed “concern on provocative behaviour and unilateral attempts of the Chinese side to alter status quo”. At this meeting held six months earlier, Jaishankar recalled that both sides agreed that the two militaries should disengage “quickly” and ease tensions.“Noting the completion of disengagement in Pangong Lake area, EAM emphasized that both sides should now quickly resolve the remaining issues along the LAC in Eastern Ladakh,” New Delhi said. Once disengagement is completed at all friction points, then the two sides could also look at broader de-escalation of troops in the area and work towards the restoration of peace and tranquillity.“EAM said that Boundary Question may take time to resolve but the disturbance of peace and tranquillity including by violence, will inevitably have a damaging impact on the relationship,” the external affairs ministry statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-jaishankar-s-75-minute-phone-call-to-china-s-wang-yi-one-message-stands-out-101614324066094.html

26-02-2021||India||Just a trailer: Letter in car carrying explosives near Mukesh Ambani's house||A handwritten letter in 'broken English' threatening Mukesh Ambani and his wife Neeta Ambani was found in the car laden with explosives found near the residence of the industrialist on Thursday, news agency ANI reported on Friday. The green Scorpio with around 20 gelatin sticks was found abandoned on Carmichael Road in Mumbai’s posh Pedder Road area late on Thursday. The SUV had a wrong number plate and was found about 600 metres away from Ambani’s house on Altamount Road."A letter was also found in the car with the explosives near Antilia. The handwritten letter was in broken English with grammatical mistakes and was addressed to Mukesh and Neeta Ambani. It is basically a threat letter calling the planted explosives a 'trailer' and a warning to return with more preparations to assassinate the whole family later," ANI quoted the source as saying.Mumbai Police deployed its personnel outside Ambani's house after the explosives were found in the area on Thursday. The police also called in the bomb squad after the police control room was informed about the vehicle.Also watch: Explosives found in car near Mukesh Ambani’s house, security increased“Two explosive detector Labrador dogs of BDDS - Oscar and Moti - detected suspicious explosives and alerted their handlers. The bomb squad personnel were then called in who scanned the articles found in the vehicle and identified them to be gelatin. The same was taken out safely and taken to a safe place following standard procedures. In all 20 gelatin sticks were found,” a police officer said on Thursday.Officials said that the person, who parked the car at the spot at around 1am on Thursday, has been captured on the closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera of a nearby general store. The police will enhance the quality of the CCTV footage to identify the suspect, the second officer said. He said the number plate may have been of a car that belongs to Ambani’s security detail. HT could not independently verify this.Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh released a statement on Thursday, saying the Mumbai Police’s crime branch will investigate the case. “It has been taken very seriously and the police will unearth the plot and nab the people behind it,” minister of state for home Shambhuraj Desai said. "Since the investigation is underway, it would not be appropriate to speak more on it. If need be, there will be additional security cover given to the Ambani family," Desai added.Mumbai Police later filed a first information report or an FIR in connection with the seizure of the vehicle.(With agency inputs))||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/just-a-trailer-letter-in-car-carrying-explosives-near-mukesh-ambani-s-house-101614324018118.html

However, violation of the rules has occurred in some banquet halls due to which, all of us are suffering," said another hotel owner.On the other hand, people who booked halls and lawns for their functions are disappointed with the guidelines."Cards have been printed and distributed to all the guests. Our relatives have applied for leaves to attend the wedding ceremony. Now we are worried that how their stay will be managed," said a patron.This comes after Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray asked authorities to put curbs on weddings and other such social functions because of the surge in Covid-19 cases in the state.Thackeray even warned that he would be forced to order another lockdown if people failed to comply with the Covid-19 guidelines.

26-02-2021||India||Meghalaya: Masked men attack labourers from Assam; 1 killed, 7 injured||Three persons were detained in connection with the Wednesday attack on Assamese construction workers, resulting in a death and injuries to seven others, police said on Friday.Eight workers engaged in construction activities at the St Xavier’s Girls Hostel in Meghalaya’s Southwest Khasi Hills district were attacked on Wednesday night around 11:30 pm by masked men, resulting in the death of Raju Mondal (20), a resident of Ujanghagrar Char in Assam’s South Salmara district.

26-02-2021||India||India beats China at its own game in Covid-19 vaccine diplomacy battle||India’s huge capacity to make coronavirus vaccines is helping the country take on China in the battle to gain political influence across the developing world.Competition among poorer nations to get cheap or free vaccines to fight the pandemic had given China a golden chance to strengthen ties in emerging markets it has been courting for years. And initially Beijing seemed in a strong position. It suppressed the domestic spread of Covid-19 last year and accelerated the production of shots.At the same time, India was struggling to contain one of the world’s worst outbreaks of the virus, with nearly 100,000 cases a day, while a nationwide lockdown sent its economy into recession for the first time in 25 years.But Chinese pharmaceutical companies have been reticent in sharing details of their pivotal vaccine trials crucial for building public trust around the world, and new domestic outbreaks reinforced the urgency of inoculating China’s own 1.4 billion population, a task that could take years. Meanwhile, India sent millions of doses to neighboring Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, allowing them to begin vaccinations earlier than if they had waited for Chinese doses.“Because of their gift, Sri Lanka has been able to start vaccination immediately,” said Eran Wickramaratne, a Sri Lankan opposition lawmaker who received one of the Indian shots. “Most Sri Lankans would be thankful for this.”So far, New Delhi has managed to ship nearly 6.8 million free vaccines around the world. China has pledged around 3.9 million, according to publicly available information compiled by Bloomberg, some of which have yet to arrive.Beijing and New Delhi have long competed for influence in Asia, and tensions between the two have risen since the pandemic struck, including their most violent border clash in decades. India has banned hundreds of Chinese apps, including ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok, sought to attract investors away from China and boosted security ties with Japan, Australia and the U.S.The rapid growth of China’s economy -- now roughly five times the size of India’s -- has allowed Beijing to forge ties with poorer countries by loaning tens of billions under its Belt and Road Initiative.But Covid has given India a diplomatic opportunity to pursue its aspirations of becoming a global power. Its pharmaceutical industry, especially the Serum Institute of India, had already made the South Asian nation the main supplier of essential medicines to the developing world. Now it’s allowing India to push back against China’s growing influence.A case in point is Myanmar, which has been rocked by a military coup and shares borders with both China and India. Beijing promised to send around 300,000 doses but has yet to deliver anything, while New Delhi quickly delivered 1.7 million shots.Indian VaccinesNew Delhi recognized early on that Indian production capacity would be crucial to beating the pandemic, said Ashok Malik, a policy adviser to the Ministry of External Affairs. Last year, when Indian manufacturers were exporting the anti-malaria drug Hydroxychloroquine -- hyped by then President Donald Trump -- Prime Minister Narendra Modi was already talking to world leaders about providing vaccines, he said.Not that India doesn’t need doses itself. It too has more than a billion people to protect, and while China swiftly suppressed Covid-19, India was unable to prevent the virus from spreading rapidly.New Delhi says it’s prioritizing its own population. But India’s ability to manufacture vaccines was always going to outstrip the nation’s ability to inoculate all of its own citizens. And the country’s leaders can now deploy those millions of surplus vaccines to win friends and influence abroad..“In Bangladesh, the process of vaccination has started and it’s going very well, at least in the cities,” said Meghna Guhathakurta, who is set to get the Indian dose in Dhaka this month. She said her relatives in the Indian city of Kolkata “haven’t been contacted and don’t know when they will get vaccinated.”Even as the Covid death toll in India passed 156,000, compared to less than 5,000 official deaths in China, New Delhi promised it wouldn’t engage in vaccine nationalism and block exports.Its domestic vaccine producers were free to sell to richer nations, but the government promised to buy supplies for smaller countries, as well as its own citizens. Officials organized trips for foreign ambassadors to visit pharmaceutical hubs in Pune and Hyderabad, and assured neighbors in South Asia, the Indian Ocean and even distant Dominica and Barbados they’d get affordable vaccines and would receive initial shipments for free.Since then, India has exported a total of more than 33 million shots -- three times as many doses as it has administered domestically, where the slow pace of vaccinations has prompted criticism and the new option for some of securing jabs at private clinics.“India, with all its problems, has been true to its word,” Malik said.India’s vaccine diplomacy has helped soothe some prickly relationships with neighbors in South Asia, “where it has been fighting an increasingly sharp diplomatic battle with China,” said Nicholas Thomas, an associate professor at the City University of Hong Kong, who has edited books on health challenges and foreign policy. New Delhi is “pushing back.”Even on China’s borders, Indian shots are showing up. Mongolia’s prime minister received one of 150,000 free doses delivered by India. On the other hand, Indonesia’s Joko Widodo, Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the president of Seychelles have taken Chinese vaccines.India’s vaccine industry -- which is delivering shipments to both developing and developed economies -- has even helped ties with some industrialized nations suffering hold ups in deliveries of western doses. Canada, whose prime minister irked Modi’s administration by expressing support for protesting Indian farmers, asked the Serum Institute to expedite shipments.Both the Indian-produced shots and the Chinese ones have been criticized for being potentially less effective than the vaccines of Pfizer Inc. and Moderna.India is currently shipping Covishield, a locally-produced Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, and exporting Bharat Biotech International Ltd.’s home-grown Covaxin shots for clinical trials. Demand for Indian shots is expected to jump once Covaxin wins regulatory approvals, and Hyderabad-based Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories begins shipping the Russian vaccine Sputnik V. China’s Sinopharm Group Co. Ltd., Sinovac Biotech Ltd., CanSino Biologics Inc. and Chongqing Zhifei Biological Products Co. Ltd. have exported doses to countries including the UAE, Morocco, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey and Brazil for clinical trials, and Beijing has promised to provide vaccine aid to more than a dozen other countries.For developing nations hammered by the pandemic, being able to begin inoculations for high risk groups with cheap and plentiful shots that have a 60% or 70% efficacy rate in trials is better that having small amounts of a more expensive vaccine that may not be available for months.“People were a bit wary of the vaccines, as they came from India. Now the mistrust is largely gone,” said Rashidul Mannan, after getting a dose of the Indian vaccine at a booth in Dhaka. “I think people will look more positively to India now than before.”Developing nations will also have access to millions of shots from the Covax initiative, a program led by the World Health Organization designed to acquire doses for poorer countries. Covax aims to deliver nearly 150 million doses in the first quarter of 2021, and 2 billion by the end of the year.Still, with western pharmaceutical firms largely focusing on rich nations struggling to contain their own outbreaks, many poorer countries will rely for at least part of their inoculation program on donations and purchases from China and India.For China, free vaccines could help soften some of the ill will it’s generated through recent geopolitical spats, such as its territorial claims in the South China Sea.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s pledge to donate 500,000 doses to the Philippines was scrutinized in a congressional inquiry in the Southeast Asian nation. The country’s vaccine procurement chief Carlito Galvez told lawmakers that Manila should “set aside” differences with Beijing on competing maritime claims, prompting shocked responses from an opposition lawmaker. Galvez later told the Senate: “We will not compromise our stake.”One place where China’s influence still dominates is India’s arch-rival Pakistan, recipient of some $70 billion of Chinese financing for infrastructure. Like Brazil, Pakistan gave China’s vaccine makers the chance to carry out clinical trials they had been unable to complete at home when the number of domestic cases subsided. Pakistan’s health chief Faisal Sultan called it “banking on an old relationship.”“We lent a hand on the science part, making sure that we would have credible data for its efficacy,” Sultan said in an interview.China is also having success in Africa and Latin America -- major investment regions for Beijing. By early February, Beijing had sent vaccine aid to more than a dozen countries including Zimbabwe and Equatorial Guinea.In the end, the competition between China and India to provide vaccines, especially to nations where their strategic interests overlap, are likely to help not only those nations but the rest of the world.“China is facing formidable competition” in its vaccine diplomacy, said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. “For countries on the receiving end, that’s a good thing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-beats-china-at-its-own-game-in-covid-19-vaccine-diplomacy-battle-101614317737720.html

The MEA statement said that foreign minister Jaishankar highlighted that India and China had "always agreed that maintenance of peace and tranquility in border areas was essential basis for development of bilateral relations"."A prolongation of the existing situation was not in the interest of either side. It was, therefore, necessary that the two sides should work towards early resolution of remaining issues. It was necessary to disengage at all friction points in order to contemplate de-escalation of forces in this sector. That alone will lead to the restoration of peace and tranquility and provide conditions for progress of our bilateral relationship," it said.Also read | Border dispute objective reality, should be put at right position in ties: China"EAM referred to the meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister in September 2020 in Moscow where Indian side had expressed its concern on provocative behavior and unilateral attempts of the Chinese side to alter status quo. He noted that the bilateral relations have been impacted severely over last year. EAM said that Boundary Question may take time to resolve but disturbance of peace and tranquility including by violence, will inevitably have a damaging impact on the relationship," MEA said in a statement.The 75-minute call between Jaishankar and Wang came after India and China pulled back frontline troops from strategic heights around Pangong Lake along with armoured vehicles and artillery and also after meeting on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) event in Moscow on September 10 last year. Jaishankar had in a tweet mentioned that had "discussed the implementation of our Moscow Agreement and reviewed the status of disengagement" with Wang.Also read | 'No bearing on LAC situation': Army officials on LoC ceasefireThe MEA statement also mentioned the meeting between Jaishankar and Wang in Moscow last year. "Both Ministers had agreed that the situation in the border areas was not in the interest of either side and decided that the border troops of both sides should continue their dialogue, quickly disengage and ease tensions. EAM noted that the two sides had maintained continuous communication since then through both the diplomatic and military channels. This had led to progress as both sides had successfully disengaged in the Pangong Tso Lake area earlier this month," it said.The “Moscow Agreement” was a five-point agreement that the two sides had concluded during the meeting of the foreign ministers in the Russian capital. A joint statement issued after that meeting had said the two sides would be guided by the consensus of the leaders of India and China, including not allowing differences to become disputes.Jaishankar, the statement, said emphasised that India and China should now quickly resolve the remaining issues along the LAC in eastern Ladakh. "EAM said that once disengagement is completed at all friction points, then the two sides could also look at broader de-escalation of troops in the area and work towards restoration of peace and tranquility," it added.The two sides had on February 20 held the 10th round of talks between senior military commanders within 48 hours of the completion of the disengagement at Pangong Lake. At the meeting held on the Chinese side of the LAC, the military commanders had focused on disengagement at other friction points such as Gogra, Hot Springs and Depsang Plains though there were no immediate signs of a breakthrough.The statement said that Wang, on his part, expressed satisfaction at the progress made so far. "It was an important step forward for restoration of peace and tranquility in border areas. He felt that both sides should make efforts to consolidate outcomes. It was also necessary to sincerely implement the common understanding reached at various levels. He spoke about the need to improve management and control in the border areas," it said.Also read | Special representatives’ talks on cards, India, China to restore status quo anteWang, the statement said, noted that the Indian side had proposed ‘three mutuals’ (mutual respect, mutual sensitivity and mutual interests) as the approach to the relationship and also agreed on the importance of taking "the long view of our ties". The two ministers agreed to remain in touch and establish a hotline, it added.The Chinese foreign ministry also released a statement on the phone conversation early on Friday and said that Wang had said the border dispute between India and China is a reality and should be taken seriously but should also be placed at an appropriate position in bilateral ties. The statement also added that the two sides have agreed to set up a hotline for better communication in a timely manner.Both sides must cherish the current hard-won situation, jointly consolidate the existing results, maintain the momentum of consultation and further ease the situation, Wang told Jaishankar, according to the Chinese foreign ministry's statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/necessary-to-disengage-at-all-friction-points-jaishankar-to-wang-in-75-min-call-101614317192809.html
26-02-2021||India||Binge-watching Netflix? Scrolling Twitter? Check new rules for online platforms||The Union ministry of information and broadcasting on Thursday notified a set of rules to monitor the content on digital media, over-the-top (OTT) and social media platforms amid “growing concerns around lack of transparency, accountability and rights of users.”The ministry asserted that the proposed framework is progressive, liberal and contemporaneous and the rules focus more on in-house and self-regulation mechanisms. “A robust grievance redressal mechanism has been provided while upholding journalistic and creative freedom,” it added.The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021 has been framed in exercise of powers under section 87 (2) of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and in supersession of the earlier Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules 2011, the Centre said in a statement.The guidelines have been framed keeping in mind the difference between viewership in a theatre and television as compared to watching it on the internet, the ministry said.Here’s a look at the new set of guidelines digital media, OTT platforms need to follow:*The rules establish a “soft-touch self-regulatory architecture” and a Code of Ethics and three-tier grievance redressal mechanism for news publishers and OTT platforms and digital media.*The OTT platforms, named as the publishers of online curated content in the rules, would self-classify the content into five age-based categories- U (Universal), U/A 7+, U/A 13+, U/A 16+, and A (Adult).*Platforms would be required to implement parental locks for content classified as U/A 13+ or higher, and reliable age verification mechanisms for content classified as “A”. The publisher of online curated content shall prominently display the classification rating specific to each content or programme together with a content descriptor informing the user about the nature of the content, and advising on viewer description (if applicable) at the beginning of every programme.*Publishers of news on digital media would be required to observe ‘Norms of Journalistic Conduct of the Press Council of India’ and the ‘Programme Code under the Cable Television Networks Regulation Act’ thereby providing a level playing field between the offline (Print, TV) and digital media.*A three-level grievance redressal mechanism has been established under the rules with different levels of self-regulation—Level-I: Self-regulation by the publishers; Level-II: Self-regulation by the self-regulating bodies of the publishers; Level-III: Oversight mechanism.Here are the guidelines related to social media:*Due diligence must be followed by intermediaries. In case of violation by the intermediary, safe harbour provisions will not apply to them.*According to new rules, intermediaries need to appoint a grievance officer to deal with complaints and share the name and contact details of the officer. The officer will acknowledge the complaint within 24 hours and resolve it within 15 from its receipt. The aim is to empower the users by mandating the intermediaries, including social media intermediaries, to establish a grievance redressal mechanism for receiving resolving complaints from the users or victims.*Ensuring online safety and dignity of users, especially women users: Intermediaries shall remove or disable access within 24 hours of receipt of complaints of contents that expose the private areas of individuals, show such individuals in full or partial nudity or in a sexual act or is in the nature of impersonation including morphed images etc. Such a complaint can be filed either by the individual or by any other person on his/her behalf.*Removal of unlawful information: An intermediary upon receiving actual knowledge in the form of an order by a court or being notified by the appropriate government or its agencies through an authorised officer should not host or publish any information which is prohibited under any law in relation to the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India, public order, friendly relations with foreign countries etc.*The Rules will come in effect from the date of their publication in the gazette, except for the additional due diligence for significant social media intermediaries, which shall come in effect three months after publication.*Two categories of social media intermediaries: According to the ministry, to encourage innovations and enable the growth of new social media intermediaries without subjecting smaller platforms to significant compliance requirement, the rules make a distinction between social media intermediaries and significant social media intermediaries. This distinction is based on the number of users on the social media platform. The government is empowered to notify the threshold of the user base that will distinguish between social media intermediaries and significant social media intermediaries. The rules require significant social media intermediaries to follow certain additional due diligence.What additional due diligence needs to be followed by social media intermediary?-Appoint a chief compliance officer who shall be responsible for ensuring compliance with the Act and Rules. Such a person should be a resident of India.-Appoint a nodal contact person for 24x7 coordination with law enforcement agencies.-Appoint a resident grievance officer who shall perform the functions mentioned under the grievance redressal mechanism.-Publish a monthly compliance report mentioning the details of complaints received and action taken as well as details of contents removed proactively by the significant social media intermediary.-Significant social media intermediaries providing services primarily in the nature of messaging shall enable identification of the first originator of the information that is required only for the purposes of prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution or punishment of an offence related to sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign states, or public order or of incitement to an offence relating to the above or in relation with rape, sexually explicit material or child sexual abuse material punishable with imprisonment for a term of not less than five years. The intermediary shall not be required to disclose the contents of any message or any other information to the first originator.-Significant social media intermediary shall have a physical contact address in India published on its website or mobile app or both.-Voluntary user verification mechanism: Users who wish to verify their accounts voluntarily shall be provided with an appropriate mechanism to verify their accounts and provided with a demonstrable and visible mark of verification.-Giving users an opportunity to be heard: In cases where significant social media intermediaries remove or disable access to any information on their own accord, then a prior intimation for the same shall be communicated to the user who has shared that information with a notice explaining the grounds and reasons for such action. Users must be provided an adequate and reasonable opportunity to dispute the action taken by the intermediary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bingewatching-netflix-scrolling-twitter-check-new-rules-for-online-platforms-101614312276010.html

26-02-2021||India||Are you willing to create more courts for cheque bounce cases: SC asks Centre||The Supreme Court on Thursday contemplated guidelines to streamline disposal of cheque bounce cases clogging the judicial docket and sought Centre’s response on establishing additional courts with judicial officers to exclusively try these cases.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde remarked, “Tell us whether the Union of India is willing to create additional courts for Section 138 Negotiable Instruments Act cases (commonly referred to as cheque bounce cases) using power under Article 247.” This power provided under the Constitution allows Parliament to create additional courts for better administration of laws.The observation came in a suo moto case pending since March 2020 where the Court is considering guidelines to be issued for expeditious disposal of cheque bounce cases punishable under Section 138 Negotiable Instruments Act. A preliminary report prepared by Court-appointed amici curiae, senior advocate Sidharth Luthra and advocate K Parameshwar, in October 2020 highlighted the urgent directions needed in this regard, one of them being creation of separate exclusive courts.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Vikramjeet Banerjee, representing Centre, sought time to take instructions in this regard. According to him, on creation of exclusive courts under Article 247, the Centre would require some time. However, on the other suggestions given by the amici curiae in their report, the Centre can give its inputs by the next date of hearing. The Court fixed the matter for hearing on March 3.The extent of the problem could be gauged by its sheer numbers. The total criminal cases pending in the country as on January 1, 2020 were over 2.31 crore (over 20 million) of which cheque bounce cases were over 35.16 lakh (over 3.5 million), occupying almost 15% of the total criminal case pendency.The Court was keen to consider establishing special courts and asked Luthra whether Article 247 was a power coupled with duty where Union was required to have a judicial impact assessment while enacting a law. “Whether there are additional courts or not, we will have to streamline the procedure,” observed the bench, also comprising justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhatt.The amici curiae report threw light on the need for a comprehensive overhaul of the manner in which Section 138 cases are heard and tried by courts. “Unless the idea of exclusive courts is backed by a comprehensive plan from the Union to fund setting up of exclusive courts and an action plan is worked out to appoint Magistrates (for trial) and judges (for hearing appeals) for such courts, diverting existing resources would burden the system.”Some states have established exclusive courts but they lack uniform and reasonable standards. For instance, West Bengal has one exclusive court to try Section 138 NI Act offences across the state. In Maharashtra, Pune district where more than 50,000 cheque bounce cases are pending, there is no exclusive court, while Amravati district with a pendency of 10,966 cases has five such courts. Similar is the case for Madhya Pradesh with Indore having no exclusive court despite pendency of over 54,000 cases while Bhopal having five such courts despite pendency being below 20,000.The Negotiable Instruments Act prescribes a six-month deadline for trial to complete but an analysis in the report showed that on an average, a case under Section 138 NI Act remained for three years and eight months in the judicial system. This backlog was on account of two reasons – increase in institution of cheque bounce complaints and the failure to serve summons on the accused, who are often beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the court where the case gets instituted.Luthra submitted an additional note to the Court stressing on the need for electronic service of summons. “Nowadays everything is linked with Aadhaar.

26-02-2021||India||Supreme Court to hear contempt plea on tigress Avni killing today||The Supreme Court on Friday will take up a contempt petition filed by a wildlife enthusiast seeking contempt of court proceedings against officials of Maharashtra government over the manner of killing tigress Avni in November 2018.Earlier this month, the top court had issued notices on the contempt petition filed by one Sangeeta Dogra. The petition claimed that Maharashtra government officials violated the SC order to declare no reward for killing the man-eater tigress Avni. A three-judge bench headed by CJI SA Bobde will take up the petition on Friday. Maharashtra government officials are expected to appear in person through videoconferencing. The court had issued contempt notices to principal secretary, Maharashtra, Vikas Kharge, principal chief conservator forests (Nagpur), deputy conservator of forests, Pandharkawada district, and member secretary, National Tiger Conservation Authority.Raising questions over the procedure followed in shooting down the tigress, Dogra pointed out that the big cat’s post-mortem report revealed that she was not a man-eater.Also Read | Juvenile convict to be let off with fine in 22-years old murder caseDogra stated in her petition that on September 11, 2018, the Supreme Court while permitting Avni (T-1) to be shot down, had said, “The efforts to tranquillise and capture T-1 tigress will be continued and if unsuccessful, it shall be eliminated by shooting to avoid any further loss of human life. The chief conservator of forests, Yavatmal, is authorised to carry out the above order. He shall not declare any prize or any similar incentive for the responsible person.”Despite the clear instruction by the court, Dogra pointed out that within days after the killing, the villagers arranged a felicitation function on November 14, 2018, and presented a silver statue of tigress along with a cash reward to the shooter involved in the killing.“First, we need to examine your plea that the dead tigress was not a man-eater. Second, they (contemnors) flouted our order that they shall not celebrate or reward anyone for killing the tigress. We will issue notice as our order is clearly violated,” said the bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, on the previous date of hearing.Dogra claimed that the post-mortem report did not indicate presence of nail, hair or teeth of human beings in the stomach. According to her, if the dead tigress was a man-eater, the presence of hair, nail of humans will remain for about six months. The bench asked Dogra to submit proof to this effect and adjourned the matter after two weeks.The tigress had allegedly killed at least 13 villagers in Maharashtra’s Pandharkawda and Ralegoan regions of Yavatmal district for over one-and-a-half years. The six-year-old tigress was shot dead after a massive hunt, and her two cubs relocated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-hear-contempt-plea-on-tigress-avni-killing-today-101614312236845.html

The investigators provided transcriptions of audio conversations showing Modi threatening to kill a witness if he did not follow his instructions.The government offered a sovereign assurance about the facilities at Mumbai’s Arthur Road Jail, where Modi will be kept if extradited, and presented a video of the prison. The court observed that Modi will have better space in the Indian jail than where he is now – the Wandsworth prison near London.Nirav Modi fled India in January 2018 before the CBI registered its first case against him. An Interpol red notice was issued against him in June 2018. The first extradition request to the UK was sent in August that year. Modi, who was arrested in March 2019, filed seven pleas seeking bail and contested India’s extradition request calling it a political witch-hunt. He claimed that if extradited, his rights will be violated. A CBI officer associated with the probe said Modi made every effort to avoid jail. “He was so desperate that he even told the court he was ready to wear electronic ankle monitors. He once even offered to pay 4 million pounds as security for bail. We produced strong evidence showing how he has destroyed evidence and intimidated the witnesses in the past, which was accepted by the court and his bail was rejected every single time.”An ED officer said this was the longest extradition trial India has fought as the accused remained in jail for two years.Joint directors of CBI and ED, Anurag and Satyabrata Kumar, monitored the proceedings on daily basis in association with Crown Prosecution Service and visited London to assist the prosecutors.Praveen Sinha, who is now CBI’s interim director, also visited London to coordinate the trial as Modi hired a battery of lawyers in India and the UK to defend himself.India last year secured extradition of Mallya.

26-02-2021||India||IAF strengthened capabilities after Balakot, deployed new acquisitions in Ladakh||The Indian Air Force has strengthened its offensive capabilities significantly since the bombing of Jaish-e-Mohammed targets in Pakistan’s Balakot exactly two years ago, and the months-long border standoff with China saw IAF flex its muscle in the Ladakh theatre where it deployed cutting-edge weaponry inducted after the unprecedented, peace time cross-border strikes on February 26, 2019. IAF’s Mirage-2000s struck targets in Balakot in response to the Pakistan-backed Pulwama suicide attack in Kashmir in which 40 Central Reserve Police Force troopers were killed on February 14. Front-line platforms, inducted over the last two years, form a critical part of IAF’s force projection in eastern Ladakh, and have demonstrated its capability to carry out day-and-night, all-weather combat missions in the sensitive theatre, said people familiar with the developments. Also Read | Armies of India, Pakistan agree to ceasefire along LoC from Feb 24 midnightThe platforms inducted after the Balakot raid include Rafale fighter jets, missiles, smart air-to-ground weapons, AH-64E Apache attack helicopters and CH-47F (I) Chinook multi-mission helicopters. To be sure, these acquisitions were planned years before the Balakot strikes but were inducted during the last two years. Referring to some of the new acquisitions, experts said the IAF’s fighter, helicopter and transport fleets played a crucial during the standoff that began last May. A disengagement process underway in the sector has raised hopes for the resolution of the border row, but de-escalation of the conflict is still a long way off. IAF’s fighter fleet - reinforced with new Rafale jets - and the Apache attack helicopters sent a strong message to the Chinese, while Indian transport aircraft played a crucial role in the swift mobilisation of troops and equipment to forward areas, said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies. He made a special mention of the capability brought to the table by the Rafale jets armed with ultra-modern armament like the Meteor beyond-visual-range missiles and Hammer air-to-ground munition, capabilities that were not available during Balakot. The need for Rafale jets with its superior weapons was felt during the dogfight with the Pakistan Air Force on February 27, a day after the Balakot raid. A professional force learns from every engagement and the Balakot strike was no different, said Bahadur. “While ‘Balakot’ was only a strike mission, the long-drawn-out faceoff with China brought to fore the massive airlift capability of the IAF. The investment of planners more than a decade back proved its worth as the Indian Army inducted almost three divisions into Ladakh, along with heavy armour, using the transport fleet of the IAF,” said Bahadur. The air force’s C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft were used to move soldiers, tanks and infantry combat vehicles to the Ladakh sector, while C-130J Super Hercules aircraft undertook sorties to the advanced landing ground in the strategic Daulat Beg Oldie sector to support the military’s deployments. The deployment of the Apache attack helicopters made it clear that Chinese mechanised formations would face a formidable foe, he said. Armed with fire-and-forget Hellfire missiles, an Apache can track up to 128 targets a minute and prioritise threats. The missiles equip the gunships with anti-armour capabilities. The induction of the Chinook multi-mission helicopters enhanced the IAF’s capabilities to transport troops and artillery to forward areas. “Some capability gaps still remain, especially of combat enablers like AWACS (airborne warning and control systems) and flight refuelling aircraft -- deficiencies that the government must look into urgently,” Bahadur added. If the Balakot air strikes showed there was scope to use fighter jets for taking out targets in Pakistan below the threshold of conventional war, India’s firm actions in Ladakh have made it clear to the Chinese that the salami-slicing tactics in their playbook will not work against India, the people cited above said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-strengthened-capabilities-after-balakot-deployed-new-acquisitions-in-ladakh-101614310076669.html
26-02-2021||India||Early onset of summer in NW India despite La Nina’s cooling effect?||Summer seems to have arrived in many parts of northwest India. The maximum temperatures have started nearing and, in some cases, breaching the 35 degree C (°C)mark, 6 to 7 degrees higher than normal.On Thursday, Delhi recorded 33.2°C, 8 degrees above normal; Narnaul recorded 34.5°C, 8 degrees above normal; Hisar 32.3°C, 6 degrees above normal; Churu 35.3°C, 6 degrees above normal; Narnaul 34.5°C, 8 degrees above normal; Ambala 31.1°C, 7 degrees above normal and Bikaner 34.6°C, 6 degrees above normal. According to the Thursday bulletin of India Meteorological Department (IMD), above normal temperatures will prevail across the country for the next 2-3 days.On Wednesday, Phalodi, for example, recorded 35.8 degree C (°C), 6.8 degrees above normal; Bikaner 34.2°C, 7.2 degrees above normal; Churu 35.6°C, 7.6 degrees above normal; Pilani 34.5°C, 8.5 degrees above normal; Narnaul 34.5°C, 9.5 degrees above normal; Delhi recorded 32.5°C, 7.5 degrees above normal. Also Read | Delhi’s temperature to rise further, air quality continues to remain poorAccording to an IMD statement, higher temperatures over the north-western plains is mainly attributed to absence of any weather system, and prevalence of south-westerly surface winds which is causing advection of heat from West Rajasthan towards the region.Interestingly, earlier meteorologists had projected that winter conditions could be prolonged this year because of La Nina, a global weather phenomenon. El Niño and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a periodic fluctuation in sea surface temperature and the air pressure of the overlying atmosphere across the equatorial Pacific Ocean according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).ENSO has a major influence on weather and climate patterns such as heavy rains, floods and drought. El Niño has a warming influence on global temperatures, while La Niña has the opposite effect. In India for example, El Nino is associated with drought or weak monsoon while La Nina is associated with strong monsoon and above average rains and colder winters. “La Nina conditions are still moderate. But I think temperatures have gone up in northwest India due to south-westerly winds. Northerly winds bring cool air. The maximum temperatures can drop again marginally and temporarily when the wind direction changes,” said DS Pai, senior climate scientist at IMD, Pune.“Yes, there seems to be early onset of summer this year. The La Nina’s cooling effect has started diminishing. We have seen 30°C+ temperatures in the last week of February in the past also but this time the average maximum temperature is definitely higher. Normally, there are six Western Disturbances in January and February but this time, there was one Western Disturbance which affected between January 3 and 6 and another around February 4 which also impacted the northern plains. The impact of the rest of the WDs has been limited to upper reaches of Western Himalayas. There are clear skies and low wind speed which is leading to rapid heating in the day,” explained Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.“We are almost in summer. IMD considers March, April and May to be pre-monsoon season. The reason we are seeing a sudden shift to hot weather is because there is no weather system bringing rain. There is rain and snowfall only in the Western Himalayas. The wind direction is variable but mostly easterly. Whenever there is abundant sunshine there will be heating. We are preparing to issue our outlook for summer season next week,” said K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/early-onset-of-summer-in-nw-india-despite-la-nina-s-cooling-effect-101614310016479.html

26-02-2021||India||Transport, trade unions call for ‘Bharat Bandh’; farmers' unions to join||The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) has called for a nationwide strike on Friday to protest against the spike in fuel prices and the new e-way bill. They have also demanded a review of the provisions of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). The traders’ body has said that all commercial markets across the country will remain shut following their ‘Bharat Bandh’ call.The All India Transporters Welfare Association (AITWA) has extended support to the nationwide strike and has said that it will hold a road blockade. Farm unions protesting against the Centre's agricultural laws will also participate in the strike peacefully, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) said in a statement.Apart from agitating against the rising fuel price, transporters have demanded the scrapping of e-way bill laws. It is the permit that they are required to carry while moving goods from one place to another. Following a recent amendment in the GST laws, the validity of the bill has narrowed and increased to 200km per day from 100km earlier. Penalties for a truck carrying a consignment with an expired e-way bill, or with an erroneous e-way bill amount to 200% of the tax value, or 100% of the invoice value under Section 129 of CGST act, 2017.The participants will stage sit-in demonstrations in more than 1,500 towns and cities across states. Several services across the country are likely to be affected as more than 40,000 traders' associations are taking part in the bandh. Private transport facilities may also be hit as the AITWA has asked all transport companies to park their vehicles between 6am and 8pm as a mark of protest. Booking and movement of bill-oriented goods will also be hit. Also, as a symbol of protest, no traders will log in to the GST portal.Chartered accountants and tax advocates’ associations have also backed the strike. Women entrepreneurs, small industries, hawkers, among others, will also join the bandh, CAIT secretary general Praveen Khandelwal has said.

In May 1999, the trial court at Neemach, MP, sentenced the three accused to life imprisonment for murder and under various provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Following this, the Madhya Pradesh high court in September 2006 upheld this ruling.The trio appealed in the Supreme Court in 2007 but the plea of juvenility of one of the accused was raised for the first time a decade later in 2017. The top court in October 2018, directed the sessions Judge, Neemuch to hold an inquiry into this aspect. Based on the inquiry, the accused was found to be aged 16 years and 11 months on the date of the incident, i.e. July 19, 1998.The question before the Supreme Court was whether the accused should be tried as a juvenile as under the Juvenile Justice Act, 1986 as it then prevailed when the crime was committed as those under 16 years were termed juvenile under the act. The accused did not fall in this category as he exceeded the age limit. In the year 2000, this bar was lifted to 18 years.Section 20 of the modified act provided, “all proceedings in respect of a juvenile pending in any court in any area on the date on which this act comes into force in that area, shall be continued in that court as if this act had not been passed and if the court finds that the juvenile has committed an offence, it shall record such finding and instead of passing any sentence in respect of the juvenile, forward the juvenile to the board which shall pass orders in respect of that juvenile in accordance with the provisions of this act.”Also Read: UK Court terms Markandey Katju’s testimony in Nirav Modi trial unreliableFollowing this law, the bench of justices UU Lalit, Indira Banerjee and KM Joseph held, “Even while holding the appellant to be juvenile in terms of the 2000 act and guilty of the offence with which he was charged, we set aside the sentence of life imprisonment imposed upon him and remit the matter to the jurisdictional Juvenile Justice Board for determining appropriate quantum of fine that should be levied on appellant.”As regards the other two accused, the Supreme Court upheld the life sentence confirmed by the high court. Since they were released on bail by the top court in April 2009, the bench directed them to surrender before the concerned police station within two weeks and undergo the sentence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/juvenile-convict-to-be-let-off-with-fine-in-22-years-old-murder-case-101614306433059.html

The UK court had ordered Modi to be extradited to India to stand trial after dismissing arguments of his "mental health concerns," saying they are not unusual in a man in his circumstances."Now since the Magistrates' Court has recommended Nirav Modi's extradition to the UK Home Secretary, the government of India would liaise with UK authorities for his early extradition to India," Anurag Srivastava, MEA spokesperson, said on Thursday according to news agency ANI.Also read | Refurbished cell at Arthur Road jail awaits high-profile inmate like Nirav ModiThe district judge at the Westminster Magistrates' Court Samuel Goozee said that there is no evidence to suggest he would not receive a fair trial in India. Nirav Modi, who is wanted in India on charges of fraud and money laundering in the estimated $2-billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud case, lost his nearly two-year-long legal battle against extradition on all grounds as Goozee also said that there are no human rights concerns that the medical needs of the 49-year-old would not be addressed as per several Indian government assurances.Also watch | 'Nirav Modi can be extradited to India': What UK Judge said & what happens nextThe UK court's ruling comes after a nearly two-year-long legal battle for Modi's extradition, who is wanted for money laundering in the PNB scam. Under the UK Extradition Act, 2003, the judge will now send his findings to the UK secretary of state for home affairs, Priti Patel. The UK cabinet minister is authorised to order extradition under the India-UK extradition treaty and has two months within which to make that decision. The home secretary's order rarely goes against the court’s conclusions, as she has to consider only some very narrow bars to extradition which are unlikely to apply in this case, including the possible imposition of a death penalty.Also read | ‘Personal agenda’: UK court on Markandey Katju’s testimony in Nirav Modi trialModi has up to 14 days to approach the high court and seek leave to appeal after Patel has made her decision known. Any appeal, if granted, will be heard at the administrative division of the high court in London. For now, he will remain on remand at Wandsworth Prison until the home secretary decides to sign off on the extradition order.Modi was arrested on an extradition warrant on March 19, 2019, and has appeared via videolink from Wandsworth Prison for a series of court hearings in the extradition case. His multiple attempts at seeking bail have been repeatedly turned down, both at the magistrates’ and high court level, as he was deemed a flight risk.Modi also faces charges of money laundering, destruction of evidence and witness intimidation apart from those relating to defrauding PNB through the use of fraudulent loan agreements to the tune of $2 billion.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nirav-modi-s-extradition-to-india-cleared-what-next-101614305934685.html

The status report on the three FIRs said he was lodged in Sonepat jail on February 2. Three FIRs were registered -- one on December 28 and two on January 12 -- against various activists including Kaur and Shiv Kumar for extortion among other charges. Kaur was arrested for allegedly gheraoing an industrial unit and demanding money from a company on January 12.According to the hospital report, all the injuries were more than two weeks old. “There is a fracture [of] distal phalanx of the second digit of left hand. Fracture of base of 5th Metatarsal bone of right foot,” the report said. “Right foot swelling present and tender to touch... Swelling and tenderness on left foot. Nail beds of right 2nd and 3rd toe are broken and underlying skin is reddish in colour and showing healing changes. Left big toe shows blackish discolouration.

Discussed the implementation of our Moscow Agreement and reviewed the status of disengagement,” Jaishankar tweeted, without giving details.There was no official word on the contact from the Chinese side.The “Moscow Agreement” that Jaishankar referred to was a five-point agreement that the two sides had concluded during the meeting of the foreign ministers in the Russian capital. A joint statement issued after that meeting had said the two sides would be guided by the consensus of the leaders of India and China, including not allowing differences to become disputes.Jaishankar and Wang had also agreed that border troops would “continue their dialogue, quickly disengage, maintain proper distance and ease tensions”, and that the two sides would abide by all existing agreements and protocols on border management and “avoid any action that could escalate matters”.The two sides further agreed to continue dialogue through the Special Representatives’ mechanism and through meetings of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs. Once the situation eases, the two sides would work on new confidence-building measures for enhancing peace and tranquillity in border areas.Asked about the situation on the LAC at a regular news briefing, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said: “Both sides view the smooth and successful completion of disengagement in the north and south bank [of Pangong Lake] as a significant first step as this forms a basis for resolution of remaining issues so as to achieve the eventual goal of complete disengagement in all friction areas.”“The two sides have agreed to work towards a mutually acceptable resolution of the remaining issues,” he said.Within 48 hours of the completion of the disengagement at Pangong Lake, the 10th round of talks between senior military commanders of the two sides was held on February 20. Srivastava said the two sides had “candid and in-depth exchange of views on the remaining issues along the LAC in the western sector” at this meeting.The meeting of the military commanders had focused on disengagement at other friction points such as Gogra, Hot Springs and Depsang Plains though there were no immediate signs of a breakthrough.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/s-jaishankar-china-counterpart-review-disengagement-at-lac-101614304642713.html

26-02-2021||India||‘Bandar mara gaya’: 15 min after missiles struck Balakot, a phone call in Delhi||At 3.45am on February 26, 2019, the then Air Chief BS Dhanoa made a telephone call to National Security Adviser Ajit Doval on a special RAX number. RAX is an ultra-secure fixed-line network.“The monkey has been killed,” he said in Hindi. “Bandar mara gaya.”The message meant that the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorist training camp at Balakot in hinterland Pakistan had been taken down by Indian fighter jets in a daring pre-dawn operation across the border.Dhanoa made similar calls to then Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Secretary (Research and Analysis Wing) Anil Dhasmana.NSA Doval, in turn, informed Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Also Watch | 'Big mistake': PM Modi's stern warning to terror outfitsThe Indian response to the February 14, 2019 Pulwama suicide attack engineered by JeM, in which 40 CRPF troopers were killed was complete. Now two years later, more granular details of the operation, including its name, and the failure of one missile with optical guidance have emerged.Top officials and functionaries involved in Balakot strike told HT that the code name Bandar was deliberately chosen in order to confuse Pakistani intelligence, which, the Indian side hoped, would think the reference was to the JeM HQ at Bhawalpur with the terror group’s ailing chief Masood Azhar living securely within the compound.Also Read | NSA Doval led secret back-channels talks with Pak for months before DGMO pactAhead of the strike, and in keeping with this deception, a posse of Indian fighters was scrambled in the Rajasthan sector to force the Pakistan Air Force to move all its assets to intercept the Indians over the skies of Bhawalpur. As a result, when IAF’s upgraded Mirage 2000 fighters released their Spice 2000 penetrator bombs which are packed with 90 kg explosives, the closest Pakistani aircraft was 150 kilometres away. IAF deliberately chose February 26 as D-day; it was the last quarter of the full moon; and the fighters successfully evaded Pakistani radars flying below the Pir Panjal ranges. According to the officials, all five bombs struck home at 330 am IST or 300 am Pakistani time.The sixth bomb carrying optical guidance making did not fire due to a software snag. The only place left untouched in Balakot was the mosque, which had already started preparation of the Fajr namaz.After the strike was completed, a cabinet meeting was summoned by PM Narendra Modi with all senior ministers, top PMO officials, Cabinet Secretary, Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary, Secretary (RAW), Director Intelligence Bureau and then Air Chief present. It was at this meeting that PM Modi openly thanked Indian intelligence, particularly RAW for its actionable intelligence and the intrepid IAF chief for a daring operation. A beaming Finance Minister Arun Jaitley patted both the leaders on their backs and Doval shook hands with Dhanoa and Dhasmana.However, national security planners were concerned about the last missile not being fired as the job of optical guidance was to get proof of the strike and counter any Pakistani or western propaganda about the strike. Sure enough, the Pakistani propaganda machine swung into action immediately by showing images of high explosive ordnance in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir to suggest that the strike had failed. The officials said IAF deliberately chose penetrator bombs so that there was minimal collateral damage; they added that images from within the Balakot camp showed at least 300 jihadists present a day before the strike. According to the officials, much of the actionable intelligence for IAF was routed through then RAW deputy chief Samant Goel (now the chief of the agency), and at least some of it came from a source within the camp.It is still not clear whether the Indian mole inside the Balakot camp survived the Indian missiles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bandar-mara-gaya-the-3-45am-phone-call-in-delhi-after-air-strike-in-balakot-101614301091538.html
26-02-2021||India||Fresh plea seeks legalisation of same-sex unions||Three gay men and a lesbian woman filed a petition on Thursday urging the Delhi high court to declare a marriage between any two persons, irrespective of their sex, legal under the 1954 Special Marriage Act.The plea asked the court to declare that SMA applied regardless of sex to any two persons who wish to marry, by reading down gender or sexuality-based restrictions in the act. This is the third petition in the HC seeking legalisation of same-sex unions. “We pray that this hon’ble court recognize us, and other members of the LGBTQ+ community, as people, and uphold non-discriminatory access to the act,” the plea read.A bench of justices Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and Amit Bansal – who are hearing the other petitions — sought the Centre’s response and posted the matter for further hearing on April 20.The first petitioner, lawyer Udit Sood, did not return to the country after higher studies, seeing the liberty given to the couples abroad. The second petitioner, Saattvic, lives in Vancouver and said he was forced to relocate to stay with his partner.The third petitioner, Lakshmi Manoharan, is a scientist in California. She said she experienced frustration and helplessness about being unable to care for her aging parents.The fourth petitioner, Gagandeep Paul, is considering moving to Canada so that he and his partner may marry. The plea was filed by advocates Megha Mishra and Tahira from law firm Karanjawala and company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fresh-plea-seeks-legalisation-of-same-sex-unions-101614302399453.html
26-02-2021||India||Centre opposes petitions for same-sex marriage||The Centre told the Delhi high court on Thursday that a marriage in India can be recognised only if it is between a “biological man” and a “biological woman” capable of producing children, strongly opposing the validation of same-sex marital unions.The government said any interference by a court in the marital statute based on personal laws will create “havoc” in society and will run afoul of the intent of Parliament in framing the laws. It said a fundamental right cannot be an “untrammelled right” and can’t override other constitutional principles.In an affidavit filed before a bench comprising justices Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and Amit Bansal, the government opposed pleas seeking legalisation of same-sex marriages and said the laws mandate that “marriage is a bond between a biological man and a biological woman”.The institution of marriage has a sanctity attached to it and in major parts of the country it is regarded as a “sacrament”, the government argued. It said that in India, despite statutory recognition of the relationship of marriage between a biological man and a biological woman, marriage depends on age-old customs, rituals, practices, cultural ethos and societal values.In a plea filed before the court, Abhijit Iyer Mitra, Gopi Shankar, Giti Thadani and G Oorvasi noted that a marriage between people of the same gender wasn’t still possible despite the Supreme Court decriminalising consensual homosexual acts in 2018 and sought a declaration recognising such unions under the Hindu Marriage Act (HMA).Through counsel Raghav Awasthi, the petition contended that the HMA does not distinguish between heterosexual and homosexual marriages if one were to go by how it is worded. The act very clearly states that marriage can be solemnised between “any two Hindus,” the petition argued.The second petition was filed by two mental health professionals — Kavita Arora, 47, and Ankita Khanna, 36 — seeking legal recognition of their marriages under two different civil laws, the Special Marriage Act and the Foreign Marriage Act.The third plea was filed by two men — Vaibhav Jain, an Indian citizen, and Parag Vijay Mehta, an overseas citizen of India — who got married in the United States, where same-sex marriage is legal, in 2017. They also sought the same relief as Arora and Khanna, stating that an Indian consulate had refused to register their union this year under the FMA.The government said Western ideas cannot be imported to the Indian context, citing the Indian constitutional law and jurisprudence. It said that seeking the registration of such marriages has more ramifications than simple legal recognition, including family issues and “public significance”.“Family issues are far beyond mere recognition and registration of marriage between persons belonging to the same gender. Living together as partners and having sexual relationship by same-sex individuals {which is decriminalised now] is not comparable with the Indian family unit concept of a husband, a wife and children which necessarily presuppose a biological man as a ‘husband’, a biological woman as a ‘wife’ and the children born out of the union between the two,” the Centre told the high court.Expressing disappointment, Mitra said: “The government’s position is curious given the Act itself wiped out several recorded Hindu traditions that existed prior to codification. Whoever drafted the response also seems clueless about the 60-odd genders recognised in Hindu historical texts not to mention it has failed to provide any textual basis prohibiting the marriage of these 60-odd genders.”“The progeny argument is particularly ridiculous because it implies any marriage shorn of biological offspring is not a marriage. In short this is a shoddy and poorly drafted response,” he added.In its affidavit, the Centre said the “celebration of a marriage gives rise to not just legal but moral and social obligations, particularly the reciprocal duty of support placed upon spouses and their joint responsibility for supporting and raising children born of the marriage and to ensure their proper mental and psychological growth in the most natural way possible”.“Relationship in marriage has more than personal significance at least in part because human beings are social beings whose humanity is expressed through their relationships with other. Entering into marriage therefore is to enter into a relationship that has public significance as well.”“The institution of marriage and family are important social institutions that provide for the security, support and companionship of members of our society and bear an important role in the rearing of child and their mental and psychological upbringing,” the affidavit read.It said the concept of marriage cannot be relegated to merely a concept within the domain of privacy of an individual. The government said that considering the larger statutory framework, it is clear that “there exists a legitimate state interest in limiting the legal recognition of marriage to persons of opposite sexes only”.“In same sex marriage, it is neither possible nor feasible to term one a husband and the other one a wife... Resultantly the statutory scheme of many statutory enactments will become otiose,” it asserted.Advocate Raghav Awasthi, who represented one of the petitioners, said: “With utmost respect, one is unable to bring oneself to agree with the point of view that has been put forth in the counter affidavit. Not only does the Hindu Marriage Act per se does not mention biological ‘sex’ or ‘gender’, Hindu religious texts are also rife with references to non-binary individuals and their conjugal rights.“That marriage and/or sexual companionship must exist between heterosexual persons is an Abrahamic conception and has little to do with Hinduism. If our religion is to survive and thrive in the 21st century, we must not reduce ourselves to a pale imitation of the Abrahamic religious traditions and should reclaim our ancient tradition of tolerance as well as celebration of sexual diversity,” he said.On Thursday, the court allowed the Delhi government to be impleaded as a party to the case and posted the matter for further hearing on April 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-opposes-petitions-for-same-sex-marriage-101614301498359.html

Obviously, Pakistan has an important role to play when it comes to Afghanistan and what takes place across its other border. So clearly, we will be paying close attention, and we urge the Pakistanis to play a constructive role in all of these areas of mutual interests including in Afghanistan, including with Kashmir including with our other shared interest," Price said.The joint statement issued in Islamabad and New Delhi said the Director Generals of Military Operations (DGMOs) of the two countries held discussions over the established mechanism of hotline contact and reviewed the situation along the LoC and all other sectors in a "free, frank and cordial" atmosphere."In the interest of achieving mutually beneficial and sustainable peace along the borders, the two DGMOs agreed to address each other's core issues and concerns which have propensity to disturb peace and lead to violence."Both sides agreed for strict observance of all agreements, understandings and cease firing along the Line of Control and all other sectors with effect from midnight of February 24/25," the joint statement said.The two sides also reiterated that existing mechanisms of hotline contact and border flag meetings will be utilised to resolve any unforeseen situation or misunderstanding, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-welcomes-india-pakistan-joint-statement-on-ceasefire-101614297986470.html
26-02-2021||India||FIR registered after vehicle with explosives found near Mukesh Ambani's house||An FIR has been registered in connection with the seizure of a vehicle, which had explosive material inside it, from near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's residence in South Mumbai, police said on Friday.The vehicle with gelatin sticks and apparently a fake number plate was found parked on Thursday on Carmichael Road near 'Antilia', the multi-storey residence of Ambani, the chairman of Reliance Industries.The FIR has been registered at the Gamdevi Police Station against unidentified persons, a Mumbai Police spokesperson said.Police have registered the case under Indian Penal Code sections 286 (negligent conduct with respect to explosive substance), 465 (punishment for forgery), 473 (making or possessing counterfeit seal), 506(2) (criminal intimidation, if threat be to cause death or grievous hurt), 120(B) (criminal conspiracy), the spokesperson said.Section four of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908, (punishment for attempt to cause explosion, or for making or keeping explosive with intent to endanger life or property) has also been included in the FIR, the official said, adding that the vehicle has been seized.The registration number on the vehicle's number plate was the same as that of an SUV in Ambani's security detail, police had said.A letter was also found inside the car, the spokesperson said, without revealing its contents.Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh had tweeted, "Twenty gelatin explosives sticks were found in a Scorpio van in the vicinity of industrialist Mukesh Ambani''s residence in Mumbai. The Mumbai Crime Branch police is investigating the matter and the findings will be out soon."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fir-registered-after-vehicle-with-explosives-found-near-mukesh-ambani-s-house-101614297642901.html
26-02-2021||India||India, Pakistan agree on ceasefire along LoC||The Indian and Pakistani armies announced on Thursday that they had begun strictly adhering to a ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir from the midnight of February 24 – the apparent outcome of behind-the-scenes contacts between senior security officials of the two countries.A joint statement issued by the two armies said the move followed a discussion between India’s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO), Lt Gen Paramjit Singh Sangha, and his Pakistani counterpart, Maj Gen Nauman Zakaria, over their established telephone hotline. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the DGMOs spoke on February 22.Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s key adviser on security affairs, Moeed Yusuf, said in an audio statement issued to journalists in Islamabad that the agreement on the ceasefire was the outcome of “behind-the-scenes” contacts and “more roads will open” in the future. Yusuf didn’t elaborate on the nature of these contacts.The move comes at a time when the Indian military is largely focused on the standoff with China in the Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which emerged in the open in May last year, though there has been no let-up in counterterrorism operations in Jammu and Kashmir.During their discussion on the hotline, the two DGMOs “reviewed the situation along the Line of Control and all other sectors in a free, frank and cordial atmosphere”, the joint statement said.India and Pakistan had agreed to a ceasefire on the LoC in November 2003. Though the truce largely held over the years, it came under strain after bilateral ties hit a low following the Pulwama suicide attack in February 2019 and India’s decision to scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status in August 2019, and troops from the two sides regularly traded fire.The DGMOs also “agreed to address each other’s core issues and concerns which have propensity to disturb peace and lead to violence” in the interest of “achieving mutually beneficial and sustainable peace along the borders”. The two sides added that existing mechanisms of hotline contact and border flag meetings will be used to “resolve any unforeseen situation or misunderstanding”.External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a regular news briefing that the ceasefire agreement didn’t amount to a change of India’s position on key issues related to Pakistan. He didn’t respond to questions on back-channel contacts or the possibility of talks. “India desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan. We have always maintained that we are committed to addressing issues, if any, in a peaceful and bilateral manner,” he said.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the established convention of weekly contacts between officials of the Directorate General of Military Operations of the two countries had continued in recent months despite periodic flare-ups along the LoC. The DGMOs speak on the hotline when there is a specific request from either side, the people added.The people said that while the Indian side had agreed to the ceasefire, there was no question of lowering the guard when it came to operations to counter infiltration along the LoC or terrorism within Jammu and Kashmir. There will also be no reduction of forces along the LoC and troops will remain prepared to deal with all contingencies, the people said.“The main idea is to have peace along the LoC so that the local population doesn’t suffer,” said one of the people cited above.The people expressed cautious optimism about the development but said the cross-border infiltration of terrorists and attacks by Pakistan-based terror groups such as Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba continued to be key concerns.Moeed Yusuf, who holds the post of special assistant to the Pakistan premier on national security and strategic policy planning, said in his audio statement that the ceasefire agreement was a positive development that should be welcomed.“So when people ask what is the [Pakistan] government’s policy and what is it doing on Kashmir, and nothing is happening, they should realise that such things are done behind the scenes. Lots of effort is being made,” Yusuf said, speaking in Urdu.“This is our success and the success of diplomacy and, God willing, more roads will open in the future,” he said.Yusuf contended that the joint statement was a “victory for Pakistan” as India was not agreeing to a ceasefire. Pakistan, he said, was “repeatedly saying that we want peace and we want that there should be a ceasefire at the LoC” so that innocent civilians aren’t killed.“Today’s development is very solid and positive and it should be welcomed and it is the success of our policy that is being seen in this development,” Yusuf said. He added: “The problem of Kashmir that we want to resolve, and the way we want to resolve it, it will happen.”People familiar with developments in Islamabad said Yusuf has been playing a key role in efforts to foster a rapprochement with India and his work has the backing of the powerful military, including Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa.Data accessed by HT shows that 2018 witnessed 1,629 ceasefire violations by Pakistan, 3,168 the following year and a high of 4,645 in 2020. This year the figure stands at 591, as of February 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-pakistan-agree-on-ceasefire-along-loc-101614297442498.html
26-02-2021||India||Centre announces rules for OTT, digital media||The Centre on Thursday notified rules that will govern online content, which includes allowing users to dispute action taken against them by social media intermediaries such as Facebook and Twitter, and setting up a three-tier self-regulatory framework for so-called over the top (OTT) platforms such as Amazon Prime, Netflix and Hotstar, and online news media entities.HT reported details of the rules governing OTTs and intermediaries on Wednesday, and the rules governing online news media on Thursday.“The rules establish a soft-touch. self-regulatory architecture and a Code of Ethics and a three-tier grievance redressal mechanism for news publishers and OTT Platforms and digital media,” minister for electronics and information technology (MeitY) Ravi Shankar Prasad said in a Thursday briefing.Prasad added that social media intermediaries are welcome to do business in India, and while the government welcomes dissent, abuse of social media has to be curbed.His colleague, minister of information and broadcasting (I&B) Prakash Javadekar, said a free press symbolises the spirit of democracy, but no one should be allowed to spread fake news. He added that while legacy media was governed by Press Council of India rules, there has been no such regulation for online media, stressing the need for a level playing field.The government said the moves would create a level playing field for traditional and new media. MeitY and the ministry of I&B have been working to come up with a comprehensive framework to regulate content on OTTs and social media intermediaries. OTT platforms such as Amazon Prime have come under fire for airing content that some claimed “hurt religious sentiments” . Social media companies such as WhatsApp and Twitter, meanwhile, have sparred with the state over an update in usage policy in the case of the former, and non-compliance with take down orders in the case of the latter.The government said the rules would create a level playing field for traditional and new media.The policy — notified on Thursday evening — also includes bringing digital news publishers under the ambit of Section 69(A) of the Information Technology Act, which empowers the government to order the blocking of access to content that is considered a threat to public order. An authorised officer from the I&B ministry who will head an interministerial committee at the apex of the self-regulatory system can also issue this order under emergency circumstances where the companies will not be given a chance to offer an explanation. The committee will have to meet within 48 hours to ratify the emergency block.The Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), whose members include Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hotstar, Facebook and Twitter, welcomed the announcement of the framework.“IAMAI has welcomed the much awaited Intermediary Guidelines 2021. The guidelines, focused primarily on consumer complaints, will help users of online content and social media resolve their complaints in a process oriented manner,” the association said in a statement.A Facebook spokesperson said: “We have always been clear as a company that we welcome regulations that set guidelines for addressing today’s toughest challenges on the Internet. Facebook is committed to people’s ability to freely and safely express themselves on our platforms.”The spokesperson added: “The details of rules like these matter and we will carefully study the new rules that were just published. We acknowledge and appreciate the recognition from the Minister on the positive contributions of social media to the country. Facebook is an ally for India and the agenda of user safety and security is a critical one for our platforms. We will continue to work to ensure that our platforms play an enabling role in fuelling the exciting digital transformation of India.”When asked about the absence of consultation with digital news media entities, Javadekar said no list of such entities existed.Prasad stressed that the platforms cannot follow double standards when it comes to different countries. “There can’t be a double standard for Capitol Hill and Red Fort violence,” he said.In a statement, the ministry of information and broadcasting said that it held consultations in Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai over the past one-and-a- half years wherein OTT operators had been urged to develop a “self-regulatory mechanism”.“The government also studied the regulatory models followed in other countries, including Singapore, Australia, EU and UK and has gathered that most of them either have an institutional mechanism to regulate digital content or are in the process of setting-up one,” it added.The rules seek to empower users by mandating the intermediaries, including social media ones, to establish a grievance redressal mechanism. A Grievance Officer shall acknowledge the complaint within 24 hours and resolve it within fifteen days.“The rules will come in effect from the date of their publication in the gazette except for the additional due diligence for significant social media intermediaries, which shall come in effect three months after publication of these rules,” the government said.HT on Wednesday reported that social media companies need to appoint officers who will be responsible for complying with content moderation orders, and both they and streaming service providers will be brought under a three-tier regulatory framework, according to the proposed new rules that will cover media companies such as Facebook and OTTs such as Netflix. In addition, shows on these platforms will have to carry ratings such as U(universal) or (Adult) —something they are not required to do currently.Countries including India have felt the need to regulate social media companies, which, under the current rules, are not responsible for content, unlike traditional media entities; demands have been made to regulate content on OTT platforms, with some shows on these, such as Amazon Prime’s Tandav, running into trouble for offending religious sentiments.In the document, titled Information Technology (Guidelines for Intermediaries and Digital Media Ethics code) Rules, 2021, the government cited powers provided to it under section 87 of the Information Technology Act, 2000. This section allows the government to make rules to carry out the provisions of the law by notification in the Official Gazette and in the Electronic Gazette.Political parties were divided over the new policy. Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate welcomed provisions against paedophilia and child pornography, but added: “Ravi Shankar Prasad has presided over the death of Indian telecom, is now presiding over the death of freedom of speech and expression and he needs to be reminded that this country takes its roots back to Mahatma Gandhi, who fought non-violently, who fought for the freedom of speech and expression and eventually did win, so anything that has been done in the garb of curbing the freedom of speech and expression must and shall not be tolerated.”CPI(M) politburo member Nilotpal Basu said, “Social media has been misused to the hilt by the BJP and its IT cell. International studies show India is home to maximum fake news and distorted content. Now, that citizen groups and individuals are opposed to government’s assault on human and constitutional rights, the government is out to stifle that opinion through the new framework.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-announces-rules-for-ott-digital-media-101614297147033.html
26-02-2021||India||Behind India-Pak breakthrough, months of secret back channel talks led by Doval||The joint statement issued by India and Pakistan on Thursday on the ceasefire agreement between their top military commanders may have surprised many but it comes months after National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval and his counterpart in Islamabad initiated back-channel conversations to ensure peace along the tense border, people aware of the matter said on condition of anonymity.NSA Doval and Moeed W Yusuf, Prime Minister Imran Khan’s special assistant on National Security Division and Strategic Policy Planning, have been in touch directly and via interlocutors from the intelligence community, one of these people confirmed.The joint statement is the first outcome of these conversations that included at least one face-to-face meeting in a third country, the person cited above said, without naming the location. He added that only a small group of top government leaders including the Prime Minister, home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh and external affairs minister S Jaishankar were aware of the details of the talks.ALSO WATCH | India-Pakistan ceasefire: The Ajit Doval factor & Islamabad’s reaction﻿Late on Thursday evening, however, Yusuf tried to distance himself from the talks in a series of tweets. “No such talks have taken place between me and Mr. Doval...The welcome development on the LoC is a result of discussions through the established channel of DGMOs,” he said.Thursday’s joint statement, issued in New Delhi by the defence ministry, said the director generals of military operations (DGMO) of the two armies had agreed to “strict observance of all agreements, understandings and cease firing along the Line of Control” from Wednesday midnight.The two top commanders also “agreed to address each other’s core issues and concerns which have a propensity to disturb the peace and lead to violence”.To be sure, this is not the first time that the two top army officers have agreed to hold peace along the border. They signed off on a similar pact in 2018 when they pledged to strictly adhere to the terms of the ceasefire understanding of 2003 in letter and spirit. That wasn’t to be, though. Officials said Thursday’s joint statement could be the first of the many steps that the two countries take over the next few months to normalise relations, one step at a time.National security planners said there were five developments over the last month or so that indicated a nuanced shift.The first sign that the back-channel conversations were on track came earlier this month. Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa, in a departure from his strident pitch against India after the Balakot air strike in 2019, on February 2 spoke of Islamabad’s commitment to what he called the ideal of mutual respect and peaceful co-existence and said: “it is time to extend a hand of peace in all directions”.The second was the toned-down statements that emerged from Islamabad three days later, on February 5, which is observed by the Pakistani establishment as Kashmir Solidarity Day. “I found it unusual,” said a counter-terror official who wasn’t in the loop on the secret talks and who asked not to be named.The third was a decline in the ceasefire violations along the border in Jammu and Kashmir in recent weeks.A top government functionary said Gen Bajwa’s much-publicised peace proposal, a decline in ceasefire violations and Pakistan’s toned-down rhetoric were clearly linked to the quiet conversations taking place.The fourth sign of a possible thaw in the relations was Pakistan steering clear of the Kashmir issue at last week’s South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation (Saarc) meeting convened by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the Covid-19 pandemic.Dr Faisal Sultan, special assistant to Prime Minister Imran Khan on Health restricted himself to the issue at hand, a sharp contrast to Pakistan’s previous attempt to raise the Kashmir issue at the Saarc meeting held in March last year.The fifth indicator, an official said, was New Delhi’s gesture of allowing Imran Khan’s special aircraft to use Indian airspace en route to Sri Lanka on Tuesday. PM Khan’s Pakistan Air Force jet flew along India’s coastline and over the Lakshadweep archipelago before landing in Colombo.India’s decision to allow the special flight to use its airspace was in marked contrast to Pakistan’s action in 2019, when Islamabad denied permission for the use of Pakistani airspace by three Indian VVIP flights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/behind-india-pak-breakthrough-months-of-secret-back-channel-talks-led-by-doval-101614296272990.html
26-02-2021||India||UK Court terms Markandey Katju’s testimony in Nirav Modi trial unreliable||While ordering the extradition of Nirav Modi on Thursday, the District Judge at Westminster Magistrates’ Court Sam Goozee said that the testimony of former Supreme Court judge Markandey Katju was not reliable and had “hallmarks of an outspoken critic with his own personal agenda”.Katju last year appeared in the Westminster court as an expert defending Nirav Modi saying the fugitive jeweller would not receive a fair trial in India.In his judgment, a copy of which has been reviewed by HT, Judge Sam Goozee said: “I attach little weight to Justice Katju’s expert opinion. Despite having been a former Supreme Court judge in India until his retirement in 2011, his evidence was in my assessment less than objective and reliable. His evidence in Court appeared tinged with resentment towards former senior judicial colleagues. It had hallmarks of an outspoken critic with his own personal agenda.”The Judge further said that he found Katju’s “evidence and behaviour in engaging the media the day before giving evidence to be questionable”.In his testimony, Katju said in the court that India was in a poor economic condition, that Nirav Modi was a scapegoat being blamed for causing a financial crisis in India. He added that the Indian Supreme Court had become subservient to the Indian government.The former Supreme Court judge could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-court-terms-markandey-katju-s-testimony-in-nirav-modi-trial-unreliable-101614296082121.html
26-02-2021||India||Refurbished cell at Arthur Road jail awaits high-profile inmate like Nirav Modi||For almost two years, Arthur Road jail authorities have tried to make sure that cell number 2, barrack number 12 remain in prime condition after having it refurbished in June 2019, in anticipation that it would one day be occupied by a high-profile inmate, may be a fugitive businessman like Nirav Modi or Vijay Mallya.On Thursday, Modi lost his bid to avoid extradition from the UK to India to face charges that he was involved in a ₹13,600 crore fraud at Punjab National Bank when district judge Samuel Goozee ruled in London that the jeweller has a case to answer before Indian courts.Jail authorities said the 300sq feet cell has been made to provide its inmate the facilities of a well-equipped apartment with French windows for ventilation and a view of the exterior. It has an attached toilet and a shower with round-the-clock water supply. Walls of the cell have been painted a soothing white.According to Surendra Pandey, who retired as director general of prisons two days ago, the cell has been maintained in its refurbished condition since 2019.“The cell had been renovated also keeping in mind the security of the inmate,” said a jail official.Barrack 12 of the prison is located in a high-security area of the jail, in a two-storey building. It has two cells each on the ground and first floors. Each cell is meant to be shared by three inmates, but people familiar with the matter said cell no. 2 on the first floor was meant only to house a high-profile inmate like Modi or Mallya.Jail officials said that each cell in barrack 12 has an attached toilet and an isolated courtyard for the inmates to take a stroll, keeping in mind the perceived threat to the occupant of the cell. A cushion and pillow — luxury items in Indian jails — will be provided to the inmate, said jail officers.The ceiling fan is placed high on the ceiling to ensure the inmate cannot reach it. The cell is under 24/7 CCTV surveillance with guards posted inside and outside the barrack.A video conferencing facility has also been provided in the barrack to produce inmates before the courts through a video link whenever required.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/refurbished-cell-at-arthur-road-jail-awaits-high-profile-inmate-like-nirav-modi-101614295770430.html
26-02-2021||India||‘Pay for news’: Indian Newspaper Society in a letter to Google||The Indian Newspaper Society (INS) has written to Google to “properly share advertising revenues” for content published by newspapers, a move that comes following a deal struck by Google in Australia with Rupert Murdoch’s Newscorp to do just this.President of INS, L Adimoolam, said in a letter addressed to Google India’s country manager Sanjay Gupta that Google should “pay for news generated by newspapers which employ thousands of journalists on the ground at considerable expense”, the body said in a statement, adding that it is in discussions with the tech giant.INS noted that there is a huge distinction between editorial content from quality publications and fake news that is spreading on other information platforms. “The Society noted that over the past year publishers across the world have been raising the issue of fair payment for content and of proper sharing of advertising revenue with Google. It has also noted that Google has recently agreed to better compensate and pay publishers in France, the European Union and Australia.”HT reached out to Google but did not receive a response.On Thursday, the two houses of Australia’s parliament passed the “News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code” that requires companies such as Google and Facebook, whose primary source of revenue is advertising, to pay local publishers for content.INS added that advertising has been the financial backbone of the news industry but that “newspaper publishers are seeing their share of the advertising pie shrinking in the digital space, even as Google is taking a giant share, leaving publishers with a small share”.Raising an issue that has been a sticking point with traditional media companies around the world, the INS statement referred to Google’s role as a search engine, an ad-tech company, and also an analytics firm. It said publishers face an opaque advertising system, as they are unable to get details of Google’s advertising value chain. It has insisted that Google increase the publisher share of advertising revenue to 85%, and also ensure transparency in revenue reports provided by it. Alphabet’s Google last year said it would pay some media groups in Australia, Brazil and Germany for high-quality content. The tech giant has for years tried to fend off such demands worldwide in return for using their content, with European media groups among its fiercest critics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pay-for-news-indian-newspaper-society-in-a-letter-to-google-101614293033038.html
26-02-2021||India||Car with explosives found near Mukesh Ambani’s residence||There was high drama in south Mumbai on Thursday evening after an abandoned SUV with explosives was found parked on Carmichael Road in the tony Pedder Road area. Police said the vehicle — a green Scorpio with a wrong number plate had around 20 Gelatin sticks in it — was about 600 metres away from the house of Reliance Industries Limited chairman Mukesh Ambani on Altamount Road.There are several other prominent spots in the vicinity, including Jaslok Hospital, the Russian Centre, and multiple apartment buildings. Police clarified that the material found was not an assembled explosive device. “A suspicious vehicle was found on Carmichael Road today evening under limits of Gamdevi Police Station. Police was alerted. Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad (BDDS) team and other Police teams reached the spot immediately, examined the vehicle and found some explosive material Gelatin inside. It is not an assembled explosive device. Further investigation is going on,” Mumbai police spokesperson, deputy commissioner of police Chaitanya Siriprolu said.A second police officer who asked not to be named said the car was suspiciously abandoned on Carmichael Road since the previous night . After the police control room was informed on Thursday, cops called in the bomb squad. “Two explosive detector Labrador dogs of BDDS - Oscar and Moti - detected suspicious explosives and alerted their handlers. The bomb squad personnel were then called in who scanned the articles found in the vehicle and identified it to be gelatin. The same was taken out safely and taken to a safe place following standard procedures. In all 20 gelatin sticks were found,” said a third officer.The person who parked the car at the spot at around 1 am on Thursday has been captured in the CCTV of a nearby general store. The police will enhance the quality of the CCTV footage to identify the suspect, the second officer said. He said the number plate may have been of a car that belongs to Ambani’s security detail. HT could not independently verify this.Home minister Anil Deshmukh released a statement on Thursday, saying a car with gelatin sticks was found near Mukesh Ambani’s house, and that the Mumbai crime branch will investigate the case. “It has been taken very seriously and the police will unearth the plot and nab the people behind it. Since the investigation is underway, it would not be appropriate to speak more on it. If need be, there will be additional security cover given to the Ambani family,” minister of state for home Shambhuraj Desai said.With inputs from Surendra Gangan||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/car-with-explosives-found-near-mukesh-ambani-s-residence-101614291972779.html
26-02-2021||India||BJP has stopped entry of illegal immigrants, says Amit Shah in Assam||Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday slammed the Congress, its ally All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) and newly formed regional parties and asserted that only the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its partner Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) can ensure peace and development in an Assam that’s free of illegal migrants.“There was a time when Assam was known for agitations and violence. The biggest contribution of the Narendra Modi government at the Centre is to establish peace in Assam, ensure development, give corruption-free administration, rid the state of agitations and put the brakes on the entry of illegal immigrants,” Shah said at a rally in Batadrava Than, the birthplace of 15th-16th century Vaishnavite saint-scholar and social reformer Srimanta Sankardev.Launching an ₹188 crore project for the development of Batadrava Than, Shah slammed the Congress for not doing anything for Sankardev’s birthplace.Without naming them, Shah also targeted the new regional parties in the state. “Congress is seen only when election comes. At other times they indulge in merriment in Delhi. They are doing the same thing this time.”“Congress was responsible for firing at those who took part in the Assam Agitation (to oust illegal immigrants). Now in order to bring Congress to power and cut BJP’s vote share, organizations that were part of that agitation have now come out with different names,” he added.Shah’s remarks were aimed at the Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP), formed last year by the All Assam Students Union (AASU) and Assam Jatiyatabadi Yuva Chatra Parishad (AJYCP), two prominent student bodies at the forefront of the Assam Agitation of 1979-85 that ended with signing of the Assam Accord in 1985.He also indicated Raijor Dal, a new party formed by Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), a farmers’ rights body. The three organizations — AASU, AJYCP and KMSS — had spearheaded the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests in December 2019. AJP and Raijor Dal are contesting the state polls together.“Everyone knows they (those parties) won’t win... The people of the state know that only a BJP and Asom Gana Parishad government can ensure a developed, peaceful and illegal immigrant-free Assam,” said Shah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-has-stopped-entry-of-illegal-immigrants-says-amit-shah-in-assam-101614290858496.html
26-02-2021||India||Farm unions, traders to join Bharat Bandh today||Several farm organisations protesting the new farm laws decided on Thursday to extend support to the ‘Bharat Bandh’ call given by transport and trade unions on February 26.Issuing a statement, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) — the umbrella body which has called for the strike — said that all commercial markets across the country will remain closed on February 26 against rising fuel prices, the new e-way bill and the goods and services tax (GST). Around 40,000 trade associations have extended their support to the call for the bandh.“We highly regret such a dismal attitude and picture of the GST which has compelled the trade union leaders attending the conference to call for a Bharat Trade Bandh,” the statement read.Extending support to the call, the SKM appealed to all farmers to join the bandh peacefully. Farm leader Dr Darshan Pal said farmers’ bodies support the traders facing hardships due to GST and rising fuel prices.In a separate statement, the All India Transport Welfare Association (AITWA), which is the apex body of the organised road transportation companies, also extended support to the CAIT’s call, saying transporters “should not be subjected to various penalties issued by the government for any time-based compliance target of transit”.“The nature of the movement is to reject booking and movement of all e-way bill oriented goods for one day,” said AITWA president Mahendra Arya.As per the e-way laws, truckers must carry the bill to transport goods from one place to another after online sale of the goods is shown on the GST portal. They have also demanded reduction in fuel prices, saying it was making the transport business inviable.Calling the GST one of the “most complex taxation systems”, which has resulted in “misery to traders”, the CAIT said: “The GST needs to be simplified to the extent that even a small trader operating his from remote area/s should also be able to comply with GST without any external help.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-unions-traders-to-join-bharat-bandh-today-101614289729676.html
26-02-2021||India||Officials targeted in new phishing bid via govt IDs||A new phishing email using compromised government accounts targeted groups of officials this week, attempting to lure them into sharing their passwords on a page that mirrored the government’s official mail server sign-on website, an attack that could let the attackers gain access to sensitive credentials and files.The attack, which took place on Monday, prompted the government’s IT departments to send out an alert the following day to large groups of officials, according to emails seen by HT. The incident is the latest in a series of such cyber attacks that leverage compromised @gov.in or @nic.in email addresses issued by the National Informatics Centre (NIC), which may be more successful in luring the targets into sharing sensitive information.“There has been another phishing attempt using the same MO [modus operandi] but this time it also provided the link to a fake email log-in page. Many officials fell for it as it mirrored the same log-in page and clicked on the link in the phishing email and tried logging in to their government email accounts. The link to that page is still live. Several ministries and departments were alerted about the phishing attack on Tuesday,” an official said, asking not to be named.An alert issued by one of the IT departments of the government said that phishing attack “...entices email users to authorize email ID for kavach by clicking on a web-link... When email user clicks on the web-link to verify his/her email ID, a login page similar to www.email.gov.in opens. This is to inform that the login page is malicious/phishing in nature”.Altogether, HT is aware of five NIC domain addresses – four with @gov.in suffixes and the fifth an @nic.in one – that have been used to launch cyber attacks. HT is not disclosing these addresses in order to protect any investigations there may be.“It is being observed that you did not AUTH your account til deadline of KAVACH, its intimated to you that please AUTH your account now otherwise your account will be locked permanently,” the latest phishing mail said.In response to queries from HT on these attacks, an NIC official said: “In phishing attacks End User awareness is a very critical component and NIC is focusing on this through routine advisories and workshops. In addition to this, based on the evolving threat landscape, security posture of the Government email setup and networks are continuously reviewed and steps are taken to mitigate emerging cyber-attacks.”The NIC, on February 19, had said phishing attempts are among common email-based threat vectors to target users of any email service. Such phishing attacks intend to harvest user details/credentials.According to cybersecurity experts, the address mentioned in the latest phishing email is a redirection page. “The attack is phishing with the intent of credential harvesting. Once these credentials are stolen, more such attacks will continue from these stolen identities. There is no malware in the link but redirection, which is bad and not transparent,” said a security researcher at Sequretek, a cybersecurity firm. This person requested not to be identified.The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (Cert-IN), which investigates incidents of cyber breaches, did not respond to requests for a comment.On February 21, HT also reported that the devices of multiple former defence personnel may have been compromised in a phishing attack launched through similar attacks carried out by government domain email addresses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/officials-targeted-in-new-phishing-bid-via-govt-ids-101614282608264.html
26-02-2021||India||Tandav controversy: Amazon Prime executive’s bail plea rejected by Allahabad HC||The Allahabad high court on Thursday rejected anticipatory bail to a top Amazon Prime Video executive in a case against web series Tandav, saying that the Hindi film industry’s tendency of insulting Hindu gods could have disastrous consequences for India.A single-judge bench of justice Siddharth rejected the application of Amazon Prime Video’s Aparna Purohit in connection with the ongoing investigation against Tandav for allegedly outraging religious feelings and showing Hindu gods in poor light. The court held that Purohit was granted protection from arrest on February 11, but failed to cooperate with the investigation.Tandav is facing at least 10 FIRs for hurting religious sentiments, intending to disturb caste and communal amity – charges punishable under Sections 153A and 295 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) with a maximum jail term of three years.“Western filmmakers have refrained from ridiculing Lord Jesus or the Prophet but Hindi filmmakers have done this repeatedly and are still doing this most unabashedly with the Hindu Gods and Goddesses,” the court observed. “This tendency on the part of the Hindi film industry is growing and if not curbed in time, it may have disastrous consequences for the Indian social, religious and communal order. There appears to be a design behind such acts on the part of the people who just give a disclaimer in all the films and depict things in the movies which are really religiously, socially and communally offensive in nature,” the court added.The judge further observed that the young generation has started believing what is shown in movies. “It destroys the basic concept of the survival of this country having tremendous diversity of all kinds as a united nation. Film industry in south has not indulged in such acts like the Hindi film industry,” the court said.The political thriller starring Bollywood actors Saif Ali Khan, Dimple Kapadia and Ayyub, started streaming earlier this year but quickly ran into controversy. On January 19, an FIR was lodged in Greater Noida that alleged the series depicted Uttar Pradesh and its police in poor light and deliberately denigrated Hindu deities. The complaint further alleged the Prime Minister was depicted in the series as opposing democratic norms and comments were used to disturb caste and communal amity. The show’s creators and actors said they didn’t intend to hurt any sentiments and that the depictions were fictional.The makers, producers and actors of the show approached the Supreme Court but were denied relief on January 27, with the court holding that freedom to speech was not an absolute right and that no actor could hide behind a script and a role to escape culpability under the law. On February 4, the Allahabad high court granted interim protection from arrest to Purohit.But on Thursday, justice Siddharth came down heavily on the streaming platform and the show’s creators. “Whenever such crimes are committed by some citizens of the country, forces inimical to the interest of this country become active and they make it an issue and raise it before different national and international forums alleging that the Indian citizens have become intolerant and India has become an unsafe place to live,” the judge said in his order.The state government argued in court the filing of 10 FIRs across the country showed that a number of persons felt that the web series was offensive. “It is not a stray case...” added the government’s counsel. Purohit’s lawyers said the series was a work of fiction and there was no intention to outrage religious feelings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tandav-controversy-amazon-prime-executive-s-bail-plea-rejected-by-allahabad-hc-101614280865441.html

26-02-2021||India||CM Yediyurappa, the recalcitrant conformist, turns 78||Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa turns 78-years-old on Friday but there is little to suggest that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has any alternative to letting the Lingayat leader continue in the lead role despite the BJP’s thumb rule against letting those above 75 hold public office.Few other leaders in Karnataka--or India--can claim to have encountered the challenges that Yediyurappa has endured throughout his four-decade-old political career, which is only likely to get more intense in the days ahead, analysts and party leaders said.The chief minister, despite the threat to his own chair, has taken it upon himself to bring the BJP back to power with an absolute majority in 2023 assembly elections that would cement his legacy and open the doors wider for him to placate his second son (B Y Vijayendra) and other loyalists to retain some control over the party.“As of now all indications point toward the possibility that he will remain the face of the next elections,” said a person aware of the developments, requesting not to be named.A Bengaluru-based political analyst said that Yediyurappa's supporters may want to go in for low-key birthday celebrations even though detractors may post as many ads as possible to remind everyone of his age.“The BJP is looking for a replacement but have not yet found any. Yediyurappa's continuation is linked to being a Lingayat leader but there are desperate efforts to separate the two,” A Narayana, political analyst and faculty at Azim Premji University said.Narayana refers to the economic term, derived demand to make his point on Karnataka politics. “This is a derived situation where what you see as the future of the BJP depends on how you see the Congress,” he said.The BJP has tried to develop a second rung of leadership but with little success so far and “para-dropping” of leaders by high command is unlikely to sit well with the polity in Karnataka, analysts said.Moreover, BJP's problem in Karnataka is its inability to take power on its own, leaving it at the mercy of borrowed strength.In 2008, the BJP had to seek the support of independents and later resort to engineering defections for power. The same strategy was used in 2019 to topple the HD Kumaraswamy-led Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S)-Congress coalition government.The turncoats have since been besotted by Yediyurappa who has gone out of his way to keep his promise of inducting them into the cabinet even if at the threat of his antagonising his own core-party workers and legislators.The turncoats have no real connection with the BJP or its core ideology and have shown inclinations to keep all their support groups happy as against targeting any particular community.While dissent and disgruntlement have a deep impact on the government, analysts said that Yediyurappa is one of the few politicians tactful enough “to make his opponents and detractors do what he wants them to do”.One analyst, on condition of anonymity, said that Yediyurappa is reviving reservation-based politics as against the BJPs plans to further penetrate its Hindutva-backed politics.“Reservation and Hindutva do not go hand-in-hand,” the analyst said.Yediyurappa has rarely identified with Hindutva politics and is better known for his reservation-based and coalition building abilities that gets support from other stalwarts like H.D Deve Gowda and Siddaramaiah, who both share cordial and functional relations with the 78-year-old.Nor does Yediyurappa fit in well with BJPs plans for the rest of the southern states like Tamil Nadu and Kerala where the saffron outfit has little or no presence on its own.The likes of Basanagouda Ramangouda Patil (Yatnal) have tried to push a firebrand image but this was diluted as soon as the former got sucked into the reservation demands of the Panchamasalis, a subsect of the dominant and politically influential Lingayats. Bracketing Yediyurappa to his sub-sect is a move that will be resisted by the Lingayat community, analysts said, which threatens the combined bargaining power of one of the biggest and politically influential communities in the state.The juggernaut of various caste-groups demanding better reservation opportunities is also likely to work in favour of Yediyurappa who has an option to reorganize the structure and not to be seen as favouring any one community.The BJP may also gain from moving some communities one step higher as it would free up opportunities for Brahmins in their existing reservation and play into the party's "upper-caste" political narrative.The internal bickering within his party and government, analysts said, could pose as a bigger irritant to the chief minister and his uncertain tenure at the top chair.Yediyurappa, possibly the oldest person to be chief minister in Karnataka, is one of just a handful of politicians who can ensure victory beyond his own constituency as against legislators and leaders who have strongholds limited to assembly constituencies at best.Yediyurappa has also delivered an unprecedented 25 out of the 29 Lok Sabha seats in 2019--an achievement that is unlikely to be repeated.But Yediyurappa's overt expression of helplessness and reluctance to fight the centre over reduction of revenues to the state, devolution of taxes or even getting adequate flood relief has forced him on the back foot. He has limited options to make a splash in the upcoming state budget as funds continue to dry up and may not be able to provide any big-bang schemes to deflect public and political gaze away from the non-performance of his two-year-old government.For now, it’s just another birthday. Whether it will be a happy one is still to be seen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-yediyurappa-the-recalcitrant-conformist-turns-78-on-friday-101614277123757.html

26-02-2021||India||Properly share advertising revenues with publishers: Indian Newspaper Society to Google||The Indian Newspaper Society (INS) has written to Google to “properly share advertising revenues” for content published by newspapers, a move that comes following a deal struck by Google in Australia with Rupert Murdoch’s Newscorp to do just this.President of INS, L Adimoolam, said in a letter addressed to Google India’s country manager Sanjay Gupta that Google should “pay for news generated by newspapers which employ thousands of journalists on the ground at considerable expense”, the body said in a statement, adding that it is in discussions with the tech giant. INS noted that there is a huge distinction between editorial content from quality publications and fake news that is spreading on other information platforms. “The Society noted that over the past year publishers across the world have been raising the issue of fair payment for content and of proper sharing of advertising revenue with Google. It has also noted that Google has recently agreed to better compensate and pay publishers in France, the European Union and Australia.”On Thursday, the two houses of Australia’s parliament passed the “News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code” that requires companies such as Google and Facebook, whose primary source of revenue is advertising, to pay local publishers for news content.INS added that advertising has been the financial backbone of the news industry but that “newspaper publishers are seeing their share of the advertising pie shrinking in the digital space, even as Google is taking a giant share, leaving publishers with a small share”.Raising an issue that has been a sticking point with traditional media companies around the world, the INS statement referred to Google’s role as a search engine, an ad-tech company, and also an analytics firm. It said publishers face an opaque advertising system, as they are unable to get details of Google’s advertising value chain. It has insisted that Google increase the publisher share of advertising revenue to 85%, and also ensure transparency in revenue reports provided by it.Alphabet’s Google last year said it would pay some media groups in Australia, Brazil and Germany for high-quality content, and expects to do more deals with others.The tech giant has for years tried to fend off such demands worldwide in return for using their content, with European media groups among its fiercest critics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-newspaper-society-writes-to-google-to-pay-for-news-101614262491268.html
