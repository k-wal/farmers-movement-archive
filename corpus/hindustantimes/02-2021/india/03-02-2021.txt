His petition seeks quashing of the nine first information reports (FIRs) pending against him in Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka. Along with him, journalist Rajdeep Sardesai has also petitioned the top court for quashing of criminal cases. The petition was filed on Wednesday and the Supreme Court is yet to number the case for listing. In the petition, Tharoor and Sardesai have sought protection of their fundamental right to free speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. The genesis of the cases against them ate tweets in which Tharoor and Sardesai attributed the death of a protestor during the tractor rally in the Capital to police firing. Tharoor later deleted the tweet after coming to know that the protestor died after he rammed his tractor into police barricades, causing it to flip over.. On January 30, the Delhi Police lodged a case against Tharoor, Sardesai and several others for alleged misreporting and spreading disharmony. Simultaneously, cases were lodged at Gurugram in Haryana and in Madhya Pradesh under serious charges of sedition (IPC Section 124A) besides provisions of promoting enmity (IPC Section 153A), making assertions prejudicial to national integration (IPC Section 153B), and some provisions under the Information Technology Act. Tharoor and Sardesai have further stated that the multiple FIRs against them were a mala fide exercise that was politically motivated as the contents of the FIRs were identical. The other persons who have been named in these FIRs are also believed to have approached the top court for relief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tharoor-and-sardesai-move-sc-against-firs-over-tweet-on-farmer-s-death-101612376875950.html

He was speaking at the conclusion of a three-day global virtual conclave organised by the State Planning Board to chart Kerala's future in a post-Covid scenario. Prof Sen said a look at the successes and failures of Kerala would pin the focus on labour. "I would be personally very optimistic about Kerala looking to the future, he noted, citing not just its track record, but unique historical reasons that contributed to the states success."He recalled that Kerala's first government in 1957 triggered animated discussions when the Communist regime saw movements related to labour, anti-untouchability and education as a major means of progress. "Kerala was one of India's three poorest economies when the state was incepted six-and-a-half decades ago. In a couple of decades, the state not only moved away from that position, but was competing for being one of the top three in terms of per capita expenditure," he said. The 'Kerala Looks Ahead' conclave gave a call on Wednesday for continued social security and highlighted the need for public discussion that relied heavily on humanity and reasoning,the release said. "The 22 sessions on nine key sectors got an overwhelming response from experts across the world,"Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan noted in the valedictory session. He said KLA stimulated national and international discussion between scholars and experts in areas that were part of the conference and many suggestions had emerged. "There are issues of long-term and strategic interest to the state and also recommendations regarding policies that can be implemented in the short run. The government would study these suggestions, which have from all over the world, to look at ways they can be incorporated into policy," he said. State Planning Board Vice Chairperson Prof V K Ramachandran said Kerala "is poised for a new leap into its economic future. He said the conference succeeded in its efforts to learn about the best practices and achievements all over the world and their relevance to Kerala in a diversity of fields.

03-02-2021||India||Vitriolic slogans, sarcastic songs go viral in poll-bound Bengal||Be it vitriolic slogans comprising only a couple of words or complete sentences or songs composed with sarcastic lyrics, the rising political tension in poll-bound West Bengal is being marked by myriad expressions, some of which have gone viral.Soon after joining the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on December 19, Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief Mamata Banerjee’s aide-turned-adversary Suvendu Adhikari picked up the most sacred chant of the Vaishnav community and turned it into his signature slogan.“Hare Krishna Hare Hare, BJP ghare ghare,” shouted Adhikari at his first rally as BJP leader, implying that his party had entered every home with the holy chant that Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, the 15th century Hindu saint had composed for disciples of Lord Krishna.“Sri Chaitanya spread the message of universal love, hence this slogan. We are paying homage to Purushottam Ram and Sri Chaitanya at the same time,” Adhikari explained at the rally in East Midnapore, his home turf. The slogan has become so popular that these days he only chants “Hare Krishna Hare Hare” and the crowds complete the sentence.Not willing to be quoted, some TMC leaders admit in private that in the districts Adhikari’s catchy lines have become almost as popular as the one the ruling party’s students’ wing raised before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls when Banerjee was projected as a contender for the Prime Minister’s chair.The TMC slogan, “Delhi jabe Hawaii choti,” implied that Banerjee’s signature blue and white sandals would go to Delhi. It went viral and led to counter slogans from the CPI (M)’s youth wing. The slogan, however, lost relevance once the BJP returned to power with a thumping majority.This year, TMC’s Birbhum district president Anubrata Mondal, a mass organiser known for triggering debates with almost anything he utters, is making news with just two words: “khela hobe” or let's play.The slogan Mondal raised at a rally in Birbhum on January 31 is being heard everywhere, be it picnics by college students or TMC rallies. On Tuesday, it was heard at a roadshow of TMC secretary general Partha Chatterjee in the southern fringes of Kolkata. The BJP has alleged that “play,” hints at poll violence since Mondal has spoken of using force against the opposition several times in the past.“Slogans being raised at TMC rallies are unhealthy for a democratic setup. At Chatterjee’s rally, a slogan was also raised against BJP state president Dilip Ghosh. It talked of attacking him,” said Samik Bhattacharya, Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson. The viral slogan he referred to talks of skinning Ghosh.“Our party does not subscribe to such slogans. We do not support these,” Chatterjee said in reaction to the allegation.Nachiketa Chakraborty, a very popular singer and composer of modern Bengali songs and who is known to be close to Mamata Banerjee, raised a storm on social media on Monday by singing one of his compositions that target political turncoats. He was performing at a cultural event held by the Burdwan town municipality in East Burdwan district where the local Lok Sabha MP joined the BJP alongside Adhikari.A video, showing the singer stopping in the middle of the song and mouthing an invective while explaining the context, has gone viral.On January 19, a year after Union minister Anurag Thakur triggered strong reactions by raising the Hindi slogan, “Desh ki gaddaron ko, goli maaro…” (Shoot the traitors in India), the same slogan, with the word India replaced by “Bangal” (Bengal in Hindi), was heard from a section of the crowd who took part in a TMC roadshow in south Kolkata. The ruling party quickly distanced itself from the slogan, calling its chanting “uncalled for”.However, the very next day, Thakur’s original slogan was heard at a BJP roadshow at Chandannagar in Hooghly district and three party workers were arrested.On Tuesday, former forest minister Rajib Banerjee, who joined the BJP at Union home minister’s Amit Shah’s Delhi residence on January 30, raised eyebrows by dishing out his adaptation of the chief minister’s most popular slogan on the eve of the historic 2011 assembly polls that ended the Left’s 34-year-long regime.“Chup chap padde chhap” (silently vote for the lotus), Rajib Banerjee said at a rally in Baruipur in South 24 Parganas district.In 2011, the TMC’s most popular slogan was “chup chap phule chhap” or, silently vote for the flower, the TMC’s election symbol.Kolkata-based economics professor and political commentator Sarthak Roychowdhury said, “These slogans are the only entertainment the polls can offer. The rest is just a horror story.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vitriolic-slogans-sarcastic-songs-go-viral-in-poll-bound-bengal-101612373364524.html
03-02-2021||India||SC may lay protocol for widening projects which require cutting of trees||The Supreme Court Wednesday observed that it would consider laying down a protocol to be followed for projects like road widening which require cutting of trees so that there is minimum damage to the environment.The apex court also said it did not consider it tenable that if road is less than 100 km then Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) is not necessary.The observations came while hearing a plea relating felling of over 350 trees for construction of railway over bridges (ROB) and widening of National Highway-112 from Barasat to Petrapole on the Indo-Bangladesh border in West Bengal.A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde said the protocol would make sure that alternatives adopted for the project are less damaging to the environment.A four-member committee constituted by the top court informed it that before implementing a project of national importance environmental impact assessment is desired and this has not been done in the project under consideration.The committee said that the State authorities are considering project under consideration as an independent project which is affecting a distance of 59.2 km only."According to a circular issued by MoEF, if a road project have length less than 100 km, in that case there is no need to get EIA from any government agency. Such argument, in present case, is an attempt to circumvent the law of the land."We feel deriving such conclusion is erroneous and needs rethinking on the part of the state of the West Bengal.. According to the committee members EIA should be taken up before starting the project related work," the panel said.Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for the petitioner, referred to the MoEF notification and said that in Char Dham project roads were divided in smaller segments in order to avoid EIA.The court said," Prima facie, we don't consider it tenable that if road is less than 100 km then EIA is not necesaary. The whole environment is our land of everybody. There is no question of this government and that government."The bench has now posted the matter for hearing on February 18.The apex court had earlier formed a committee of environment experts to suggest an alternative to felling of over 350 trees for construction of railway over bridges (ROB) and widening of National Highway-112 from Barasat to Petrapole on the Indo-Bangladesh border in West Bengal.The five-member committee is headed by Dr Soham Pandya of the Centre of Science For Village, Wardha.Bhushan, appearing for petitioner Association for Protection of Democratic Rights (APDR) had earlier said that no alternatives were explored and permission was granted to fell the trees, which are heritage ones aged around 80-100 years.He had said everyone knows about global warming and there is study which says if the vegetation is not protected then in next 10-20 years the human species will be in danger.The Calcutta High Court on August 31, 2018, had paved the way for widening of the national highway and allowed felling of over 350 trees for widening of Jessore Road, which connects the city to Petrapole on the Indo-Bangladesh border, on the condition that five trees will be planted for each tree cut.The NH-112 or Jessore Road is an important link between India and Bangladesh and the state government had undertaken a project to widen it. Hundreds of old trees line both sides of the road, some of which were decided to be felled for the purpose of widening of the road.A PIL was moved before the high court challenging the state''s plan to fell the trees. After arguments for several months, the high court allowed felling of 356 trees at five places from Barasat to Petrapole border along the Jessore Road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-may-lay-protocol-for-widening-projects-which-require-cutting-of-trees-101612372724237.html

A passenger aircraft generally flies at a height of around 30,000 feet."The airspace below 1,000 feet is lower airspace and it would be the main playground of drones. For that, we may have a system of private ATCs, which would be managed by private operators," Dubey said at a session organised by industry body FICCI at Aero India 2021."It could be a government agency or a private agency, it is something that would evolve," he added. The AAI cannot handle drones because they would be flying at 5 feet to take care of crops to about 1,000 feet in the airspace, Dubey mentioned.Drone technology is moving way faster than the regulations so we have decided that we need to start a parallel activity, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-may-allow-private-air-traffic-controllers-to-manage-drones-in-lower-airspace-101612372877667.html

These attempts were invariably met with an appropriate response from us,” he said while replying to a question from BJP lawmaker Sangam Lal Gupta.To address issues arising from attempts to transgress the LAC, India and China have engaged in discussions through established military and diplomatic channels, Muraleedharan said.Senior military commanders from both sides held eight meetings last year, on June 6, June 22, June 30, July 14, August 2, September 21, October 12, November 6, and one meeting this year, on January 24.The Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs (WMCC) held six meetings last year, on June 24, July 10, July 24, August 20, September 30 and December 18.Muraleedharan also outlined the contacts between top leaders of India and China to address the border standoff.

They also agreed “therefore that the border troops of both sides should continue their dialogue, quickly disengage, maintain proper distance and ease tensions”, Muraleedharan said.Despite several rounds of talks through diplomatic and military channels, the two sides are yet to make any headway on disengagement and de-escalation at friction points in Ladakh sector of the LAC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/attempts-by-chinese-to-transgress-lac-met-apt-response-mea-tells-parliament-101612369113739.html

03-02-2021||India||PM's niece seeks BJP ticket to contest Ahmedabad civic polls||Prime Minister Narendra Modi's niece Sonal Modi has sought a ticket from the ruling BJP in Gujarat to fight the upcoming civic body polls in Ahmedabad city.Talking to reporters on Tuesday, Sonal Modi said she has sought the ticket, from Bodakdev ward of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, in her capacity as a BJP worker, not as a relative of the PM, and claimed she fulfills criteria for nomination.Sonal Modi, a homemaker in her late 30s, is the daughter of PM Modi's brother Prahlad Modi, who owns a fair price shop in the city and is also the president of the Gujarat Fair Price Shops Association.The Gujarat BJP recently announced that relatives of party leaders and workers will not be considered for ticket allocation for the upcoming polls."I have sought ticket from reserved women seat in Bodakdev ward. I was active as a BJP worker in the past but took a break to raise my children."Now, since my children have grown up, I can dedicate more time for people. That is the reason I have decided to jump into electoral fray," Sonal Modi said.She said she qualifies to get party nomination to contest the polls."Though the BJP has set some criteria, I believe I qualify for the ticket. I have sought the ticket in my capacity as a BJP worker, not as a relative of the PM."Even if I am not given the ticket, I will remain active in the party as a dedicated worker," she said.Meanwhile, Prahlad Modi backed his daughter's decision to seek party nod to fight polls, saying all his family members are free to take their own decisions."This is not a case of nepotism. My family never used Narendra Modi's name for our own benefit. We all earn our own bread and butter. Even I run a ration shop."I have not visited Narendra Modi's bungalow after he became the PM, let alone my children," said Prahlad Modi.Notably, BJP's state parliamentary board is still in the process of finalising candidates for local body elections in Gujarat.On February 1, the BJP had said it will not give poll tickets to relatives of party leaders.Also, the ruling party had said it will not consider BJP workers who are above the age of 60 and those who have finished three terms as councillors for ticket allocation.Elections to six municipal corporations in Gujarat, including Ahmedabad, will take place on February 21, while voting in 81 municipalities, 31 district panchayats and 231 taluka panchayats will be held on February 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pms-niece-seeks-bjp-ticket-to-contest-ahmedabad-civic-polls-101612366301299.html

The new curb is effective from Wednesday. The country’s interior ministry announced that the "temporary suspension" would be effective from local time 9pm (1800 GMT) on Wednesday, according to the official Saudi Press Agency.People who have a history of travel to any of the 20 countries 14 days prior to their travel to Saudi Arabia are not allowed to enter the country, said news agency ANI quoting sources.The list of banned countries includes India, the US, Egypt, Pakistan, Argentina, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, France, Italy, Portugal, Indonesia, Japan, South Africa, United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Lebanon, UAE, and Turkey.However, there are some exceptions. Saudi citizens, diplomats, and health workers coming from these countries will be allowed to enter the kingdom "in accordance with the precautionary measures". Indian cargo flights operating with clearance from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) do not fall under the purview of the ban either.Saudi Arabia had been ramping up domestic measures to contain the surge of coronavirus cases. Saudi health minister Tawfiq al-Rabiah has been urging people to be on their guard, not become complacent, and adhere strictly to Covid-19 preventative measures."Lack of compliance will force us to take measures to protect society," he said in televised remarks. "I ask you to help us preserve the gains we made in combating coronavirus ... This is a very difficult stage," the minister said, as quoted by Reuters.As of Wednesday, the Gulf nation has reported a total of 368,639 cases of coronavirus, and 6,383 deaths.

03-02-2021||India||India can act as net security provider in Indian Ocean Region: Defence minister||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday said India can take on the role of being the net security provider in the Indian Ocean Region as geopolitically it is a reliable partner in the IOR. "We live in a challenging geo-political landscape where countries not only have to face the threat of military aggression, but natural calamities which include pandemics like COVID-19 which has wreaked havoc in the last one year," Singh said. Therefore, when faced with threats across multiple dimensions, it is imperative for the nation to strengthen relations with countries with whom it shared converging views on key global issues, he said,addressing the inaugural session of Chiefs of the Air Staff Conclave at Aero India here. "Geopolitically India is a reliable partner in the Indian Ocean Region and can take on the role of being the net security provider in the region," he added. Noting that air power has and would continue to play a critical role in maintaining regional stability and peace in the region, Singh said freedom of manoeuvre provided by air and space capabilities enables the nation to influence in a sustainable and clearly escalable manner.The Indian Air force is at the very forefront of offensive capabilities with its reach, speed and precision, he said. Indias unique disposition in the IOR, complimented by a potent airlift capability of IAF, enables it to contribute significantly in Humanitarian Aid and Disaster Relief (HADR) missions, he said. Singh noted that India has been regularly conducting exercises to deepen HADR cooperation and coordination among its neighbours with a focus on sharing expertise and assisting building capabilities. He also said that the recent conflicts had shown the potency of emerging technologies and India is heavily focused on building these capabilities. "We are keen to cooperate with our defence partners in these niche technologies with focus on knowledge sharing and co-production," he added. The Chiefs of the Air Staff Conclave today had physical representation from 26 countries, while 14 were in attendance virtually, officials said. The Conclave has been planned with three sessions to address the themes of disruptive technologies and innovations, air power in Indo-Pacific region and air power and airspace strategies, they said. Air Chief Marshal Rakesh Kumar Singh Bhadauria, in his keynote address, said "we have witnessed a paradigm change in the Geo-political landscape in recent years and globally, we are facing unprecedented levels of uncertainty, volatility and interconnected threats." While the world was grappling with complications and control of the pandemic, the worsening inter-state relations, rising mistrust and geopolitical tensions have only reinforced the importance of mature and balanced cooperation at international level, he said. "We need to strengthen our mutual understanding and existing security frameworks based on the principles of Cooperation, Collaboration and Coexistence," he said, adding that for India, the security challenges are as varied as its geography and as unpredictable as the nation's threats. Noting that the nature of warfare has changed significantly in the last few years, the air chief said advent of new technologies and cross linking of 'Physical', 'Digital' and 'Cognitive' domains has complicated the art of war fighting considerably. "Our understanding of national boundaries has shifted well beyond the classical definitions of airspaces, land borders and shorelines. An attack may originate without warning, several time zones away, and its effect may proliferate rapidly across several domains." Also, the exponential technological progress made in the last few years has made the realm of sub-con warfare more complex, Bhadauria said. The low cost and easy availability of simple disruptive technology like drones with small state and non-state actors have made them more lethal, agile and capable of generating disproportionate effects, he said. "We are closely observing these developments and are focusing on developing capabilities in unmanned, and optionally manned platforms, manned-unmanned teaming, and anti-drone technologies," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-can-act-as-net-security-provider-in-indian-ocean-region-defence-minister-101612365053505.html

Two years later, he had joined the Sharad Pawar-led NCP. However, in June last year, he had resigned from the NCP due to some differences and floated the PSDP.In his statement, Vaghela claimed that many Congress workers urged him "with tears in their eyes" to rejoin the party when he was at Piraman village in Bharuch district last year to attend Congress leader Ahmed Patel's funeral."Apart from these workers, many Congress leaders have been insisting that I should join Congress. I am ready to join the Congress without any pre-conditions to fight the BJP. I have no problem in joining Congress. I will take an appropriate decision after meeting madam Sonia jee and Rahul Gandhi in Delhi," the senior leader said.Before Vaghela's statement, state Congress spokesperson Jayrajsinh Parmar said, "I have learned from the media that Vaghela is joining the Congress. I want to clarify that there is no such thing as of now. As far as I know, Vaghela has not contacted any of our leaders for the comeback. I think only Vaghela can shed light on these rumours."Vaghela's party has already announced that it will not field its candidates in the upcoming local body polls in Gujarat in order to stop the anti-BJP vote division.Vaghela had started his political career with the BJP. After the BJP came to power in the state in 1995 and chose to make Keshubhai Patel the chief minister instead of him, Vaghela engineered a split in the saffron outfit and became the CM in 1996 with outside support of the Congress.Later, he joined the Congress and served as Textile Minister in the Manmohan Singh government.While in the Congress, he had also served as its state unit president and Leader of Opposition in the Gujarat Assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-ex-cm-shankersinh-vaghela-says-ready-to-rejoin-congress-101612365044083.html

The other six assembly segments in the Ghatal seat are in West Midnapore.Dev’s invitation to the Haldia event sparked a controversy on Wednesday afternoon when Saumitra Khan, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Lok Sabha MP from Bankura district, tweeted a report of a Bengali online magazine which carried a photo of Modi and Dev and said the two will share the same dais.“This has created a sensation in state politics” Khan tweeted in Bangla, tagging the Prime Minister and Dev.Dev reacted quickly to stop the story from gaining any traction.“Dear Saumitra, I still feel very proud to see your journey & achievements. My sincere apologies, as I won't be able to make it to this event, but I’m touched to have received this invite. U will always hold a special place of love n respect irrespective of our political ideologies,” tweeted Dev.“Irrespective of our political ideologies, as I still cherish the good old times we spent together, when you represented the same party as me. All the very best for this and my best wishes are always with you & your Party. Take care,” Dev wrote in a second tweet.Dev (39), who was born in Keshpur in West Midnapore, won the Ghatal seat twice since 2014. In 2019, he defeated BJP's Bharati Ghosh, a former Indian Police Service officer, by more than one lakh votes.East Midnapore district has been in the headlines ever since TMC’s Nandigram legislator Suvendu Adhikari quit the assembly seat and the cabinet and joined the BJP on December 19. Tapasi Mandal, the CPI(M) legislator from Haldia also joined the BJP the same day under his leadership. TMC chief Mamata Banerjee has declared that she will contest the Nandigram seat in the elections due in March-April.Suvendu Adhikari’s father, Sisir Adhikari, is the TMC’s Lok Sabha member from East Midnapore’s Kanthi constituency and the latter’s elder son Dibyendu is the Lok Sabha MP from Tamluk. Both have been invited to the Prime Minister’s programme.Modi is also scheduled to attend a BJP rally after the government event. There are speculations that Suvendu Adhikari’s father and brother may join the BJP. His youngest brother Soumendu, who headed the Kanthi municipality, has already joined the saffron camp.Sisir Adhikari has been Mamata Banerjee’s close associate since the party’s birth in 1998. He has been representing the Kanthi seat since 2009.Ever since Suvendu Adhikari joined the BJP, ruling party leaders are targeting him at election rallies, often calling him Mir Zafar, the general who betrayed Shiraj-ud-Daulah, Bengal's last independent nawab who was defeated by the East India Company in the Battle of Plassey in 1757. The battle marked the beginning of British rule in India.On December 19, Adhikari and six sitting TMC legislators, a TMC Lok Sabha member, three MLAs from the Left and Congress and at least 20 other district-level leaders of the ruling party joined the BJP at Union home minister Amit Shah’s rally in Midnapore town. This marked the biggest defection of elected TMC leaders in the run-up to the assembly polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-mp-movie-star-dev-says-he-won-t-attend-pm-modi-s-programme-in-bengal-101612364434608.html

If there is no adverse impact, it will be continued," CC Patil, Karnataka's minister for information and public relations, said.The decision was taken after a delegation of senior actors, directors, producers and others from the Kannada film industry met senior ministers of the government on Wednesday in Bengaluru.A detailed set of guidelines will be issued on Thursday, Patil said.The decision of the Karnataka government comes almost a month after neighbouring Tamil Nadu had to reverse its order allowing 100% occupancy in cinema halls.The Edapaddi Palaniswamy-led government had to revoke its decision four days after it received criticism for lifting restrictions in enclosed spaces like cinema halls where air conditioning and other factors are likely to contribute to help spread the virus.Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa had relaxed lockdown measures to revive economic activity and bring in some much needed revenues to the state coffers.The state has so far reported 9,40,170 positive cases from March 8 last year, of which at least 5924 are active currently.Over 12223 people have lost their lives in the state so far and 148 are currently in the intensive care unit, according to government data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-after-limiting-it-to-50-karnataka-allows-100-seating-in-cinema-halls-101612364940708.html

03-02-2021||India||House republicans face identity dilemma in fight over Marjorie Taylor Greene||Republicans in the US Congress on Wednesday face questions about whether to discipline a pair of strikingly different Representatives Liz Cheney and Marjorie Taylor Greene, decisions that will send a strong signal about the party's future.Cheney, the No. 3 House of Representatives Republican, is facing heat for her vote to impeach former President Donald Trump on a charge of inciting insurrection in a speech to his followers before they attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, leaving five dead.Greene is in the hotseat for having supported conspiracy theories and online calls for violence against Democrats - views that have drawn sharp criticism from Senate Republicans including leader Mitch McConnell, who warned against "looney lies and conspiracy theories."In choosing to strip Cheney of her leadership role or remove Greene from committees, Republicans will also telegraph a message about the future of their party.The 211 House Republicans who have been invited to a closed-door meeting also are expected to weigh both, though it is unclear if they will act on Wednesday.An outspoken Trump supporter, Greene before coming to Congress this year has voiced support for unfounded conspiracy theories. Last week, CNN reported that she had also approved of calls for violence against Democratic lawmakers, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is being pulled in opposite directions from members of his rank-and-file, who have been riven for months over Trump's insistence, without evidence, that the 2020 election was "stolen" from him and by the increasingly violent rhetoric among members of the Republican Party.House Democrats, who hold a slim majority, were preparing to advance legislation on Wednesday relieving Greene of her committee assignments if House Republicans did not act promptly. Some Democrats called for her to be expelled from Congress."I'm the Democrat mob's public enemy number one," Greene said in a tweet on Tuesday.Some high-profile Republican senators have injected themselves into the House controversies."We should have nothing to do with Marjorie Taylor Greene. I think we should repudiate the things she said and move away from her," Senator Mitt Romney told reporters on Tuesday.On Monday, McConnell weighed in with a statement saying that Greene's "looney lies and conspiracy theories are a cancer for the Republican Party and our country."Greene is a political newcomer who took office just last month while Cheney, the daughter of former Republican Vice President Dick Cheney, served in Republican administrations before first winning election to Congress in 2016.In early 2019, then-Representative Steve King was stripped of his committee assignments after the long-time Republican lawmaker was found to have uttered racist comments.

That being so, present application cannot be allowed for want of sanction,” the court said.The application had sought registration of an FIR claiming that on December 15, 2019 police officials committed various atrocities, including “vandalizing public/university property and unnecessary use of force against hapless students who were only exercising their democratic right to protest peacefully.”In an Action Taken Report field in response to court's direction, the police said that a protesting crowd set several vehicles on fire and then went inside the university campus and started pelting stones on the police and raised provocative slogans.“In order to maintain law and order situation, police had to enter the university campus and contain the mob by detaining some persons,” the report said.Advocates Asghar khan and Tariq Nasir, who represented the university, said that they will file a revision petition before a superior court against the order.The court said in its order that it was clear from the factual background of the matter that some of the protests had become violent and that police personnel were acting to control the said protests at the relevant point of time, so as to prevent violence and prevent law and order situation from further deterioration. “Though it could be argued that while so acting, the police/respondents had allegedly exceeded their jurisdiction and used more force than necessary in some instances, it cannot be said, by any stretch of imagination, that the said acts allegedly committed by the respondents were wholly unconnected to their official duty.“Likewise, it could also be argued that the situation perhaps could have been handled by the respondents in a better way and that some restraint should have been shown by the police/respondents in order to differentiate between peaceful student protesters and anti­-social elements who had attempted to hijack the entire movement,” the judge said.The judge said that “however, the lack of such restraint exhibited by the police/respondents and excesses committed in trying to control the situation are very much related to official duties of the respondents.” “This court has no hesitation in holding that acts allegedly committed by the respondents fall within the purview of section 197 Cr.P.C., being acts committed in discharge of official duties,” the court further said.The application had claimed that on December 15, 2019 civil society members decided to call a peaceful protest near the university area against CAA. “In pursuit of clearing the crowd, police officials broke into the campus without seeking any sanction and used excessive and arbitrary force and thrashed several security guards of the university and also students.“The said police officials caused destruction of university property and fired tear gas shells and conducted lathi charge. They also hurt religious sentiments of locals of the area by entering into the university mosque,” it said.It added that the complainant gave a complaint to the SHO of Jamia Nagar police station and ACP and DCP concerned in this regard on the next day of the incident but no action was taken, therefore, the university approached the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anticaa-protest-court-dismisses-jamia-s-plea-seeking-fir-against-police-for-assaulting-students-101612361569023.html

Sharing the statement of the ministry of external affairs in which the ministry termed international support to farmers' protest as irresponsible, Amit Shah said propaganda can neither disrupt India's unity nor can decide India's fate. "India stands united and together to achieve progress," he wrote with hashtags IndiaAgainstPropaganda and #IndiaTogether. Many ministers and BJP leaders tweeted using these hashtags, first used by the MEA in its statement, committing to India's unity.No propaganda can deter India’s unity!No propaganda can stop India to attain new heights!Propaganda can not decide India’s fate only ‘Progress’ can.India stands united and together to achieve progress.#IndiaAgainstPropaganda#IndiaTogether https://t.co/ZJXYzGieCtThough the tweets, MEA's statement do not mention Rihanna, the action from the government stems from American pop singer Rihanna's tweet on Tuesday in which she raised the issue of the farmers' protest and triggered huge international support for the ongoing farmers' protest.why aren’t we talking about this?! #FarmersProtest https://t.co/obmIlXhK9SThe CNN article that Rihanna shared talked about how internet access in several districts in the national Capital was disrupted following the clashes between the Delhi police and farmers on January 26.The article also voiced "concerns over democracy" and said, "Although India is the world's most populous democracy, it also topped the world in terms of internet shutdowns in 2019, according to Access Now, an advocacy group which tracks internet freedom."The Centre claimed that this is a part of a concerted effort to hurt India's democracy and the ministry, in its statement, linked this with the recent incidents of desecration of Mahatma Gandhi's statues. "This is extremely disturbing for India and for civilised society everywhere... We would like to emphasise that these protests must be seen in the context of India's democratic ethos and polity, and the efforts of the government and the concerned farmer groups to resolve the impasse," the statement said.It also sai that facts need to be ascertained before rushing to comment on such matters. "The temptation of sensationalist social media hashtags and comments, especially when resorted to be celebrities and others, is neither accurate nor responsible," the statement said, denouncing the comments of international celebrities. After Rihanna, climate activist Greta Thunberg too tweeted in support of the farmers.Not only ministers or BJP leaders, but several Indian celebrities also took to Twitter on Wednesday rallying behind India's commitment to unity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/progress-not-propaganda-amit-shah-s-stern-message-on-farmers-protest-101612361980104.html

03-02-2021||India||Ahead of polls, TMC woos ST voters with demand for recognition of Sarna dharma||With an eye on the crucial assembly elections due in two months, the ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal has raised the demand of giving recognition to Sarna dharma as a separate religious code in a bid to woo the state’s tribal voters.“I have kept all my promises. You had started a movement for Sarna Dharma. I have also written a letter (to the Centre) for (the recognition) of Sarna Dharma,” chief minister and TMC boss Mamata Banerjee said on Tuesday while addressing a rally at Alipurduar on the third day of a four-day visit to north Bengal.She did not mention when she had written the letter.Followers of Sarna usually are nature worshippers who have their own gods and goddesses. They have been demanding recognition of it as a distinct religion for decades. At present, under the census, there are codes for only six religions: Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism, Buddhism and Jainism.“We have formed laws so that none could take away the land from adivasis. I have also written a letter for giving recognition to Sarna Dharma. I have done everything for you,” Banerjee said.The tribal vote bank becomes crucial for any political party aiming to win the state’s assembly elections. Scheduled Tribes form around six per cent of the state’s population.Out of the 294 assembly states in the legislative assembly, while 68 seats are reserved for scheduled castes, 16 assembly constituencies are reserved for scheduled tribes. According to the 2019 Lok Sabha election trends, BJP was leading over TMC in 13 of the reserved seats. The BJP won both the Lok Sabha seats reserved for STs - Alipurduar and Jhargram.The tribal population in West Bengal is mostly concentrated in north Bengal and in the Jangalmahal (western districts). The BJP had made deep inroads in both these areas. While in north Bengal they had won seven out of the eight Lok Sabha seats, in Jangalmahal they had won all four seats.“It is a very good move by Mamata Banerjee and we welcome it. It has been a long term demand by the tribals to give recognition to Sarna and include it as a separate code in the census. This would enable tribals to mention their religion as Sarna while filling up forms. As of now they have to mention their religion as others as they can’t choose among Hinduism, Islam, Christianity and others,” said PC Hembram, general secretary of All India Adivasi Socio Educational and Cultural Association in Delhi.Back in November 2020, the Jharkhand assembly had passed a house resolution on Sarna Adivasi code for granting separate religious identity of the tribes in census 2021. In December 2020 at least 10 adivasi organisations submitted a memorandum to the state government demanding that it ask the Centre to recognise Sarna.That the TMC was desperate to win over the tribal votes was evident from the chief minister’s statements during her trip to north Bengal.“I have lost all seats in 2019. I am not ashamed. I feel that this time you will compensate me. Please compensate,” Banerjee urged the people of north Bengal as she listed out the sops which the state has showered on the tribal communities.On Tuesday, the TMC supremo went on a public relations overdrive as she danced with tribals at a mass wedding ceremony, organized by the state government in Alipurduar district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-polls-tmc-woos-st-voters-with-demand-for-recognition-of-sarna-dharma-101612360880135.html

Calling the Centre's refusal to opposition's request for a debate in Parliament "undemocratic", the Thiruvananthapuram MP said, "If a debate were allowed to happen, MPs could voice the concerns of their constituents, the farmers, and propose solutions to the crisis.

And most of all, it needs a powerful societal commitment, he said. "In these critical times, the youth should assist by providing the right information about the vaccination drive and other related policy actions of the government regarding Covid-19," he was quoted as saying in the statement.Applauding the efforts of scientists and health professionals, Vardhan observed, “Indian scientists and healthcare professionals have stood the test of time. While our Covid warriors have sacrificed themselves to ensure the safety of all of us, our scientists have done a laudable job by developing the Covid-19 vaccine. I can assure you that the government is working overtime to meet the challenge of vaccinating 1.35 billion people.”Lauding the college on its achievements, Vardhan appreciated the unwavering determination of the institute, its faculty members and all stakeholders in contributing towards nation building by churning out globally responsible citizens, conscientious of their community, society and the country as a whole, it said.He congratulated SRCC for being one of the best colleges for commerce in the continent and for producing notable alumni in every fieldlike corporate affairs, law, and politics, the statement said.Emphasising on the vision of seeing India as a 'Vishwa Guru' and the potential of the youth of the country which serves as its bedrock, Vardhan said the government places maximum emphasis on the youth of the nation, the statement said.The New Education Policy introduced by the government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi will surely change the quality of education services in the country for generations to come, he asserted."In fact, ensuring the highest standards of education is a top priority for our government because education forms the apex of the social pyramid. India is a country which has huge untapped potential of our youth," Vardhan said."Our beloved prime minister has given a clarion call for building a strong and self-reliant India, an 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' that is already rubbing shoulders with global superpowers. The dream of a self-reliant India can only be met if we encourage our youth to 'innovate, patent, produce and prosper' and lead our country towards faster development," he was quoted as saying in the statement.

The school is about 12 km away from Ramnathpur police station.Senior district and police officials including deputy commissioner Megh Nidhi Dahal and superintendent of police, Pabindra Kumar Nath visited the blast site and took stock of the situation.“The twin blasts have badly damaged the school building as well as the drinking water reservoir and boy's toilet which were under construction. Though the situation is tense, it is under control. Security has been beefed up following the incident,” the district administration said in a statement.Authorities did not say anything about any suspects in the case.In October last year, several persons from both states were injured in violence along the Assam-Mizoram border after some residents of Vairengte in Kolasib district of Mizoram set on fire temporary huts made by residents of Lailapur in Cachar district of Assam on a stretch of disputed land.Mizoram said the huts were built on ‘no man’s land’ while Assam claimed the area as theirs.Following the incident, residents on the Assam side blocked the highway going to Mizoram for several days and hundreds of goods-laden trucks on the way to the neighbouring state were stranded.The blockade was lifted in November after several rounds of talks between both states and following intervention of the Union home ministry.Assam and Mizoram share a 164-km boundary and there have been territorial disputes between two states for many years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bomb-blasts-damage-school-in-assam-s-hailakandi-district-near-mizoram-border-101612358228678.html
03-02-2021||India||'Matter of pride': Farmers' union on support from Rihanna, Greta Thunberg||The umbrella body of the protesting farmers' unions has acknowledged the international support towards its protest with pride even as the ministry of external affairs dismissed their tweets terming them as "neither accurate nor responsible".A Twitter storm was kicked up on Tuesday after Americal pop singer Rihanna shares a CNN article on farmers protests and wrote, "Why aren't we talking about this?" Swedish activist Greta Thunberg too extended her support as she wrote, "We stand in solidarity with the #farmersprotest in India."The tweets met strong reaction from Indian Twitter users. Claims and counter-claims were made over how international celebrities have been roped in. As the international influencers have a massive following on Twitter, it soon snowballed into a Twitter storm, prompting the ministry of external affairs to issue a statement.The farmers' leaders, on the other hand, are happy over international acknowledgement. Samyukta Kisan Morcha's Darshan Pal said it was a matter of pride that international personalities have shown sensitivity towards the cause of farmers. "On the other hand, it is unfortunate that the government is not understanding the pain of the farmers and some people are even calling peaceful farmers as terrorists," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/matter-of-pride-farmers-union-on-support-from-rihanna-greta-thunberg-101612357779116.html

A retro-fitment incentive at 15 per cent of the cost, capped at ₹15,000, will also be given to the first 5,000 existing three-wheelers, which convert their diesel or petrol engines to battery-run engines.The transport principal secretary said this tax exemption, being offered as part of the Telangana electric vehicles and energy storage policy announced on October 29 last year, would be given only on the vehicles purchased and registered within Telangana state.State transport minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar said the state government had introduced the electric vehicles and energy storage policy to bring down automobile pollution. He appealed to the private entrepreneurs and green energy producers to make use of the incentives being given by the state government.According to the policy, which will be in force till 2030, the government would also extend support to the private sector for establishing charging infrastructure for the electric vehicles. It calls for setting up charging or swapping stations at every 50 km on national and state highways within the state and encourages existing residential townships with 1,000 plus families to develop charging stations lots.The policy also proposes that the Telangana State Electricity Regulatory Commission shall provide a special power tariff category for electric vehicle charging stations. The Telangana State Renewable Energy Development Corporation will act as a nodal agency to establish public charging stations directly or under the licensee/franchise/PPP model.Various public places such as airports, railway/ metro stations, parking lots, bus depots, markets, petrol stations, malls and electric poles shall be examined for the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-road-tax-registration-fee-on-electric-vehicles-in-telangana-from-today-101612357508046.html

Aggravating the issue further, many mainstream media channels are determined to change their names from 'Farmers' or “'Ann-daatas' to 'Terrorists' or 'Khalistanis', “ it said.The farmers are protesting at three Delhi borders for almost two months seeking repeal of three laws. They are: the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act.On January 12, the apex court had already stayed the implementation of the contentious new farm laws till further orders and had constituted a committee to make recommendations to resolve the impasse over them between the Centre and farmers' unions protesting at Delhi borders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lawyers-urge-cji-to-take-cognizance-of-internet-shutdown-order-at-delhi-borders-101612356805843.html

03-02-2021||India||BJP leader responds to Rahul Gandhi, Rihanna on farmers' protest||Smarting from the criticism by opposition leaders and international celebrities over its handling of farmers’ protest, the Bharatiya Janata party on Wednesday accused former Congress president Rahul Gandhi of instigating farm leaders and alleged that he is using the protest for his own political gains.“He is trying to incite people. He is the one who earlier said that there will be fire in the cities and it will go to the slums. Today, he has again threatened that no one will step back. This is an agitation of the farmers and they are saying they are not associated with any political party and this is not a political movement. So why are you speaking on their behalf,” BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said addressing the media.Defending the government’s outreach towards the protesting farmers, Patra said those such as singer Rihanna who are commenting on the issue are not familiar with Indian democracy.“There have been 11 rounds of talks with the farmers where ministers were present. The Prime Minister at the all-party meeting has assured that the agriculture minister is a phone call away, this is democracy,” Patra said.“Both Rihanna and Rahul know nothing about agriculture; they know nothing about Rabi or kharif crops. Where were these people when Mahatma Gandhi’s statue in California was desecrated; he’s an apostle of peace across the globe none of these people tweeted about it then,” Patra added.Global pop star Rihanna on Tuesday extended her support to the farmers by sharing a news report highlighting the internet shutdown aimed at crippling the protest movement. "Why aren't we talking about this?", she tweeted.At a press conference today, Rahul Gandhi said the national capital was being converted into a fortress and questioned why the government was "threatening, beating and killing farmers". He urged the government to have a dialogue and resolve the problem.The Delhi police have used concrete barricades, barbed wire, spikes, trenches to cut off access to farmer protest sites at its border. There is massive deployment of security personnel around the protest sites.“He should remember what happened on January 26. The whole world saw how the country dealt with it. The Congress then wanted to know why the Delhi police did not take steps. Why did the Delhi police allow people to reach the Red Fort is what the Congress and Rahul Gandhi had asked. Today when the Delhi police is making arrangements; the same Delhi police that showed patience and restraint, the Congress is again asking questions,” Patra said.Watch: ‘Rahul, Rihanna & racket’: BJP attacks Congress over farmer protestsThe BJP also accused the Congress of seeking the release of those who have been arrested for violence on January 26 even as these people had earlier been dubbed as BJP workers and sympathisers.On Republic Day, the tractor parade to highlight the demands of the farmer unions to repeal the three new agriculture laws turned violent as protesters deviated from routes, attacked police, overturned vehicles and hoisted a religious flag on the ramparts of the iconic Red Fort.“The Congress party in Punjab said those who have been arrested for inciting violence should be released immediately and they should be given legal aid from the Congress. The question is are these people from the Congress who scaled Red Fort and hoisted a religious flag? Earlier all the leaders of the Congress had said that these are BJP workers and their agents who were sent to the Red Fort to create unrest and create violence to defame the agitation,” Patra alleged.To a question on Gandhi’s comment about the lack of leadership in the country, Patra said, what the Wayanad MP wanted to say was that the Congress lacks leadership.Delving into the past, Patra said In 1998 the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh had fired bullets at a farmers rally in the state and 28 farmers had been killed.“Today Rahul Gandhi is trying to question us on what grounds? And Gandhi is accusing the government of killing farmers,” the BJP spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-leader-s-counterpunch-to-rahul-gandhi-rihanna-on-farmers-protest-101612357016117.html

Central agencies hound political leaders & businessmen, FIRs & UAPA against journalists are methods adopted to choke dissent."Mehbooba Mufti said that she could understand the pain and humiliation of the farmers."We understand the pain & humiliation inflicted on our farmers & stand in solidarity with them.

He further added that the country was safe in the hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“The country is safe in the hands of PM Modi and the common man knows that. As far as tweets are concerned, the ministry of external affairs has issued a statement on it. It’s our internal issue that we’re going to resolve,” said Nadda who is on a two-day visit to Kerala to review the party’s preparation ahead of the upcoming state assembly elections.Amid recent tweets made by prominent foreign personalities such as Rihanna, Greta Thunberg on the protest against the farm laws, the external affairs ministry said on Wednesday that facts needed to be ascertained before commenting on such issues. “Before rushing to comment on such matters, we would urge that the facts be ascertained, and a proper understanding of the issues at hand be undertaken. The temptation of sensationalist social media hashtags and comments, especially when resorted to by celebrities and others, is neither accurate nor responsible,” the ministry had said in a statement.The country is safe in hands of PM Modi & the common man knows that.

Talking about the violence which erupted during the tractor rally on Republic Day, he said that it was the Centre’s sympathetic attitude that Police didn’t take any action against any of the protesters as ‘they’re our people’. “What happened on Jan 26, it was our sympathetic attitude that Police didn’t take action as they’re our people. Govt dealt with it while trying to see no untoward incident takes place.” Nadda added.The Delhi Police have arrested 122 people in connection with the Republic Day rally and said that nearly 400 of its personnel were injured in the clashes and 30 police vehicles were damaged. The Police also clarified that it had not illegally detained farmers or any other people post the incident and urged people to not pay attention to such rumours.Also Watch| Modi govt slams Rihanna, Greta Thunberg & other celebs’ tweets on farmers﻿﻿Earlier in the day, the Supreme Court refused to entertain petitions seeking its intervention into the January 26 mayhem and allowed petitioners to withdraw their petitions.

03-02-2021||India||China steps up Covid vaccine diplomacy as competition with India heats up||China on Wednesday said it would provide 10 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine to the global COVAX initiative as it seeks to step-up its vaccine diplomacy amid projections from experts that India could become the "engine" for the distribution of the jabs to the world.China offered to supply vaccines to COVAX even as it awaited emergency approval for its shots from the World Health Organisation (WHO).COVAX, formally known as the Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility, is a global initiative, which aims at ensuring that middle and lower-income countries get timely access to coronavirus vaccines.China has decided to provide 10 million Covid-19 vaccine doses to COVAX to meet the urgent needs of developing countries, at the request of the WHO, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a media briefing here.China last year joined COVAX, which is co-led by Gavi, an international vaccine alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the WHO.Chinese officials said the country is currently conducting field trials for 16 vaccines, while it has so far granted conditional approval to one of its jabs -- Sinopharm, even as it began supplying the shot to a number of countries, including Pakistan.Recently, over 80 people were arrested in China in a crackdown against smuggling of spurious vaccines filled with saline water. Some of the counterfeit vaccines reportedly were being sent to African countries.China's announcement to provide vaccines to COVAX came as India has already begun providing the jabs to a number of countries.Beijing had announced that it would supply three lakh vaccines to Sri Lanka after New Delhi dispatched five lakh doses to Colombo. China has also offered its vaccine supplies to Nepal, Maldives and Brazil, which has already received the first batch of supplies from India.South Africa has received one million doses of Covishield vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India in Pune as India moved to use its vaccine diplomacy to shore up its global image, putting it in direct competition with China, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Wednesday.South African President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that his country expects another 500,000 doses from India later this month.Lawrence Gostin, director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, told SCMP that "India, and especially the Serum Institute, was likely to be the engine for vaccine distribution to the world, especially for low- and middle-income countries".Gostin said India and China had been locked in a geopolitical struggle for many years now, and the rivalry was only intensifying.He said China had a long history of seeking political, commercial or diplomatic gains for its various projects. "For example, China has used the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) for its economic and military advantage. China is using its vaccines for similar geostrategic advantage,” Gostin said.However, “India does not have a history of seeking special benefits from its health assistance,” he said."India has long been seen as a helpful partner in ensuring affordable drugs and vaccines to lower-income countries. I expect that to continue,” the Post quoted him as saying.Known as the 'pharmacy of the world', India produces 60 per cent of vaccines globally||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-steps-up-covid-vaccine-diplomacy-as-competition-with-india-heats-up-101612355993470.html

But the survey, whose findings are much more conservative than a private one from last week, indicates India's actual cases may have crossed 300 million.The state-run Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which conducted the survey, said it would only share the findings at a news conference on Thursday. The source declined to be named ahead of the official announcement.It was not immediately clear how many people participated in the latest survey.Following another survey done in August and September using blood samples of more than 29,000 people older than 10, ICMR had concluded that one in 15 Indians had Covid-19 antibodies. The figure jumped to one in six in densely-populated urban slums.A survey released by the government of the capital New Delhi this week found that more than half of its 20 million inhabitants may have been infected with the coronavirus.Separate tests done on more than 700,000 people across India by diagnostics company Thyrocare Technologies showed 55% of the population may have already been infected, its chief told Reuters last week.The World Health Organization says at least 60% to 70% of a population needs to have immunity to break the chain of transmission.India reported 11,039 new cases on Wednesday. Deaths rose by 110 to 154,596. Infections and fatalities have come down significantly since a mid-September peak of nearly 100,000 a day.Its vaccination programme, touted by the government as the world's biggest, has covered more than 4 million people in 18 days, with the aim to reach 300 million by August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-300-million-indians-may-have-contracted-covid-19-report-101612352760358.html

03-02-2021||India||Bengal govt to probe corruption charges against former minister who joined BJP||The Mamata Banerjee-led administration is probing corruption charges against former Bengal minister and ex-Trinamool Congress leader Rajib Banerjee, who recently joined the Bharatiya Janata Party.“The man, who was with us but has now left, had done some anomalies in the recruitment process of Bon Sahayaks. He committed theft and then shifted to the BJP,” she alleged, without naming anyone.The TMC chief was speaking at a convention of party workers cum public rally at Alipurduar in north Bengal on Wednesday.“I have received complaints from many people. We are investigating the matter. The investigation will continue even if elections are likely to be announced in the next three to four days,” she said.Rajib Banerjee joined the BJP on January 30, a day after he quit the TMC and resigned as an MLA of the ruling party. Earlier in January, he had resigned as the forest minister.Even though Rajib Banerjee could not be contacted, the BJP hit back saying that if the chief minister knew that the forest minister was corrupt why did she send her emissaries to stop him from joining the BJP?“Rajib was a blue-eyed boy for the TMC when he was with them. We know Rajib and he comes from a good family. If the chief minister knew that Rajib was corrupt why did she send TMC MP Saugata Roy and state minister Partha Chatterjee to retain him in the party? Why did her police not take any action? People understand everything. Those leaders, who are not being able to stay with the TMC with respect and are deserting the party, are being branded as corrupt,” said Jai Prakash Majumdar, BJP’s state vice president.Mamata attacked the BJP saying that the party is a washing machine where corrupt people join to come out clean.“All the thieves, goons and dacoits are joining the BJP and the party says that they will defeat the TMC. You can never defeat the TMC,” she alleged.Rajib Banerjee said at a public rally later in the day: “Today she brought charges of corruption against me. I had handed over the recruitment process to the board. On October 8, I informed the chief minister that a TMC leader from Birbhum had demanded that all the posts should be handed over to him so that he could make appointments. She, however, said that the jobs of Bon Sahayaks should be distributed among TMC leaders and workers in the districts. I have documents to prove that recommendations had come from various leaders including those from Kalighat (chief minister’s residence).”He also said that the chief minister should investigate all contractual jobs till date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-govt-to-probe-corruption-charges-against-former-minister-who-joined-bjp-101612350372328.html

(If that happens) those winning elections using EVMs will get defeated," NCP's Maharashtra chief spokesperson Mahesh Tapase said in a statement without naming any party or individual.His comments came a day after Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Nana Patole asked the state legislature to frame a law to make available to the electors the option of casting votes using ballot papers too besides EVMs.Several Opposition parties, including the Congress, had in the past demanded the Election Commission to revert to the ballot paper system while alleging the EVM tampering in polls.On the other hand, the BJP had previously hit out at the Opposition for raising doubts over the credibility of the EVMs.Tapase also referred to political parties in the past flagging several concerns before the Election Commission over technical glitches in and tampering of EVMs."It is natural that Patole's instruction to the state legislature on framing such a law will rankle some people, but it is an important step of the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) in the state towards strengthening democracy," he added.The Shiv Sena, NCP and the Congress are the key constituents of the MVA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/use-of-paper-ballots-will-defeat-parties-who-owe-their-win-to-evms-ncp-101612348917292.html
03-02-2021||India||2-day police remand for IPS officer in Rajasthan arrested for alleged extortion||An anti-corruption bureau (ACB) court in Jaipur on Wednesday sent Indian Police Service (IPS) officer and former Dausa superintendent of police (SP) Manish Agarwal to two days of police remand after his arrest on Tuesday for alleged involvement in an extortion racket, the bureau’s director general Bhagwan Lal Soni said.Agarwal who had taken charge as Commandant of the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) in Jaipur last month was arrested from his office on Tuesday.“We will quiz him for two days to obtain details related to the case,” said Soni.ACB officials said that the role of Agarwal’s family members is also under the scanner“One family member of Agarwal was also in touch with the middleman who has been arrested. The family member used to demand money from the subordinates of Agarwal when he was posted in Dausa in lieu of transfers and other professional favours. We are obtaining the call records of the particular family member,” said an ACB official familiar with the development of the case.The anti-graft agency officials claim that they have enough evidence against the accused IPS officer and two state services officers and one of his middlemen who were arrested on January 14 to prove that they worked in tandem to extort money from a road construction company owner and contractor.“Sub-divisional magistrates (SDMs) Pinky Meena (Bandikui) and Pushkar Mittal (Dausa), Neeraj Meena, alleged middleman of the then Dausa superintendent of police (SP) Manish Agarwal, and the IPS officer targeted the complainant to extort money,” said another ACB official.The official added that some chats from the mobile phone and locations of Mittal also prove that they were working in an organized manner to extort money.Earlier on January 14, two sub-divisional magistrates (SDMs) Pinky Meena (Bandikui) and Pushkar Mittal (Dausa) and one Neeraj Meena, an alleged middleman employed by Manish Agarwal, were arrested in the same case.During investigation, it was found that the IPS officer was involved in the extortion bid on the contractor in connivance with other government officials and a middleman. The lid was blown off the racket after a complaint was filed against some of the accused officers, according to an ACB officer.Agarwal, a 2010 batch IPS officer of Jammu and Kashmir cadre, has a history of controversies.In 2015, a case of corruption was registered against him and his reader by J&K ACB . The officer had allegedly demand bribe of ₹five lakh to release two suspects in a suicide case of a 21-year-old woman in Jammu. However, the case is pending due to lack of prosecution sanction.His cadre was transferred from Jammu and Kashmir to the IPS cadre of Rajasthan on the ground of marriage with an IPS officer of Rajasthan.In six-years of service in Rajasthan, he has been posted only twice as SP of districts. He served as Barmer SP for four months and then as Dausa’s police chief for six months. He was removed after complaints of corruption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2day-police-remand-for-ips-officer-in-rajasthan-arrested-for-alleged-extortion-101612351191401.html

The proposed reforms should be discussed with engineers and employees to see whether they will address challenges or aggravate them," Gupta said in the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/power-engineers-employees-stage-nationwide-protest-against-privatisation-101612348871101.html

This year Ash Wednesday falls on February 17.The festival is said to represent one last swig of the bottle and a steak of beef before 40 days of abstinence kick-in. While not celebrated at the scale of those parades in Europe or Brazil, Goa’s carnival parades represent the only surviving such parades in Asia where the Portuguese once had many colonies and trading posts.At a meeting, Goa’s tourism department and the municipal corporation of Panaji agreed to tone down celebrations although the parade will be held.“The government has decided that we shall go ahead with the carnival. People have been stuck at home for a long time now and no events also have taken place. So this is an opportunity to come out and enjoy a bit and people have also begun taking precautions. People now know the measures to be taken to avoid Covid. So I don't expect that there will be a big problem,” mayor of Panaji Uday Madkaikar said.“Corona hasn't ended, the cases may have come down compared to earlier. All measures will be taken. We will also appeal to people to take care,” he added.The floats are led by King Momo, a mascot who is figuratively symbolically given the keys to the city and reads out a decree declaring three days of fun and merrymaking urging people to ‘Eat, drink and make merry!”Besides the float parades involving decorated floats representing various facets of Goa’s life and culture, the festival is also celebrated through dances and community events, all of which will be toned down this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-to-tone-down-carnival-celebrations-amid-covid-19-pandemic-101612347259853.html

The forest department officials say their “bigger challenge” is to find a place to keep these animals.The vehicle carrying camels was coming from Haryana and was en route to Malda in West Bengal from where the animals were to be sent to Bangladesh, officials said.A total of nine persons - including three people who were traveling in the camel laden vehicle, while six other persons who had come to bribe the forest official, who rescued the camel - have been arrested, officials said.Divisional forest officer (DFO), Pakur, Rajnish Kumar, said, “Fifteen camels were rescued in the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday. Now, we have a bigger challenge to keep these animals, as we neither have a dedicated shelter for these animals nor trained people to handle them.”The forest range officer, Pakur, Anil Kumar Singh, said, “I received a tip off about the illegal transportation of camels around midnight. I, along with my team, rushed to the spot and rescued the animals.”He said the driver, helper and a labourer, who were in the vehicle, were arrested. “During the investigation, they said the heavy vehicle containing the camels was coming from Haryana. The driver and helper, who drove the vehicle from Haryana, got down at Fatehpur Sikri in Uttar Pradesh and handed over the vehicle to another driver and helper. The driver said his duty was to drive the vehicle to Malda in West Bengal,” Singh said.Singh further said, “In the early hours on Wednesday, I received a call that requested me to leave the vehicle in lieu of money. Six persons in an SUV came to bribe me and offered ₹20,000. We arrested all six persons and seized the SUV and bribe amount. The process of lodging FIR is on.”Earlier, on January 12, the forest division had seized a truck containing 14 camels. Two camels had already died in the truck, while two others died two days after the rescue due to inhuman transportation of the camels. The animals were being smuggled from Mewat in Rajasthan and transported to Bangladesh, forest officials said.Since Jharkhand doesn’t have proper climate and shelter to keep these rescued camels, People for Animals (PFA), an NGO, has expressed willingness to take back the animals to Rajasthan, as it has a camel rehabilitation shelter in Rajasthan’s Sirohi area.PFA officer, Rana Ghosh said, “As per the animal transportation rule, these animals need to be vaccinated before taking them to Rajasthan. Once it is completed, we will take them to our rehabilitation centre.”Ghosh said, “Camels are transported from Rajasthan to Haryana. From there, they are transported to Bangladesh through Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand. Generally, it is the job of police to track such illegal transportation. However, the forest department is doing police’s job in Jharkhand.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jharkhand-rescues-15-camels-says-lacks-trained-staff-to-handle-them-101612346819255.html
03-02-2021||India||SC notice on transfer petition to settle uniform age of marriage for men, women||The Supreme Court issued notice on a petition seeking 21 years to be fixed as the uniform marriageable age for both men and women during the hearing on a transfer petition moved by a lawyer and BJP leader Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay.The notice was issued to the petitioners in two similar cases pending in Delhi and Rajasthan high courts.Upadhyay, in his petition, stated that the present legal framework, that allows girls to marry at 18 years of age and boys at 21 years of age, aggravates the gender inequality that exists within a marital relationship.“While men are permitted to get married at the age of 21, women are married when they are just 18. The distinction is based on patriarchal stereotypes, has no scientific backing, perpetrates de jure and de facto inequality against women, and goes completely against the global trends,” the petition stated.Upadhyay had raised this issue before the Delhi high court in August 2019 where the issue is still being examined. He later came across a similar petition filed in the Rajasthan high court by one Abdul Mannan. Both petitions argued that the different ages for marriage violated the fundamental rights of equality (Article 14), protection against discrimination (Article 15), and dignity of life (Article 21) of citizens and went against India’s commitment under the convention on elimination of all forms of discrimination against women (CEDAW).The Supreme Court has power under Article 139A to transfer to itself, cases involving the same or substantially the same questions of law pending before two or more high courts. Upadhyay decided to approach the top court for a common determination of the question of law arising in both petitions.His petition claimed that 125 countries have uniform minimum age of marriage for boys and girls and by ending the discrimination in age, women will have equal opportunities as men to pursue their education, employment opportunities without being hindered by family compulsion to get married.Also Read: SC refuses to entertain pleas seeking intervention into R-Day violenceUpadhyay argued that women in a married relationship are expected to perform a subordinate role vis-à-vis the husband. “This power imbalance is deeply aggravated by the age differential, because age itself constitutes a hierarchy of power. A younger spouse is therefore expected to respect and be servile to her elder partner, which aggravates the pre-existing gender-based hierarchy in the marital relationship,” his petition stated.Across religions, whether it is the Hindu Marriage Act, Special Marriage Act, Indian Christian Marriage Act or the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, the marriageable age for men and women is 21 and 18 years respectively, the petition claims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-notice-on-transfer-petition-to-settle-uniform-age-of-marriage-for-men-women-101612347102439.html

Rahul Gandhi questions Govt's defence allocation||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday slammed the Centre over the Union Budget and said the amount allocated towards the defence sector failed to challenge China.Addressing a press briefing, Gandhi alleged that the Centre through its budget conveyed a message to China that it won't increase the expenditure on defence.

A video of farmers' leaders, including Bharatiya Kisan Union national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait, falling as the stage caves in has surfaced.#WATCH | The stage on which Bharatiya Kisan Union (Arajnaitik) leader Rakesh Tikait & other farmer leaders were standing, collapses in Jind, Haryana.A 'Mahapanchayat' is underway in Jind. pic.twitter.com/rBwbfo0Mm1The Mahapanchayat, one in the series that have been taking place in the last few days, was organised at Kandela village sports stadium. It was organised by Haryana khap leaders to discuss the future of the ongoing farmers' protests.This is the first Kisan mahapanchayat in Haryana.Get your facts right: India responds to barbs from celebrities on farm protestAfter farmers' so-far peaceful protest ran into trouble following tractor march fiasco, the protest has been garnering support from panchayats. There have been mahapanchayats at Muzaffarnagar, Mathura and Baghpat in the past few days. But the Jind one was the first one to be attended by Rakesh Tikait.Organisers earlier said that they made arrangement for 50,000 people. But the presence of Rakesh Tikait has apparently been a crowd-puller and more people than what could be accommodated at the venue reached the spot, possibly leading to the collapsing of the stage. It was not immediately known whether there were any injuries.After farmers' tractor march on Republic Day deviated from its pre-decided route and resulted in a stand-off with the Delhi Police at ITO and the Red Fort, the Capital Police have launched a severe crackdown on farmers' leaders. Ghaziabad administration reportedly asked protesters to vacate Ghazipur protest site to which Rakesh Tikait said he would rather end his life but not withdraw the protest. His appeal is believed to have infused fresh enthusiasm in the protest and as many farmers headed towards Delhi after his emotional appeal, Kisan mahapanchayats are being held. In the panchayats held so far, khap leaders, in a show of strength, have decided to throw their weight behind the protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jind-mahapanchayat-rakesh-tikait-farmer-leaders-fall-as-stage-collapses-101612345216364.html

Instead of the word Hindu, he should have used the word ‘manuwadi’ or ‘brahminwadi’,” said the former judge.Kolse Patil also criticised the BJP for demanding action against the AMU leader. “BJP is making an issue out of this, purely to defame Elgar Parishad. Those who are now talking about Hindus, we appeal to them for a discussion.” Usmani did not respond to calls and text messages.Following his remarks, Swargate police filed an FIR against Usmani on Tuesday, based on the complaint by advocate and the general secretary of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), Padeep Gawade. The FIR was filed under section 153a (promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc.) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).Also Read: FIR against AMU leader Usmani over speech at second Elgar Parishad eventUproar broke out following Sharjil’s video going viral on social media, followed by the demand for action against Usmani, by the Maharashtra BJP, accusing him of hurting religious sentiments of the Hindu community.Saturday’s event was organised by the Bhima Koregaon Shaurya Din Prerna Abhiyan, an umbrella body of 250 Dalit, Left and other social organisations.

The first target identified by the global community is for establishing an action plan for road safety .... reducing the road fatalities to half by 2030 aligned to the Sustainable Development Goals,” said K K Kapila, President Emeritus, IRF.Road, Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari will inaugurate the webinar series on February 9, IRF said.The webinar series is designed for all stakeholders of road safety in central and state governments, industries, corporates, all skilled professionals and the general public to participate and contribute by giving ideas and information for the development of an all-encompassing and sustainable action plan for road safety in India, it said."This action plan will then be recommended to the central and state governments for their adoption for the decade (2021-2030) with a systematic execution plan, pursued consistently with necessary funding support, to realise the target of reducing the road deaths by half by 2030,” said S Gangopadhyay, President, India chapter of IRF.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitin-gadkari-to-inaugurate-webinar-series-on-road-safety-on-feb-9-101612344604349.html

"They (BJP) want to instil fear among the people in the name of National Register of Citizens. I will never allow the implementation of NRC in West Bengal," the chief minister said in Alipurduar.In Assam, where NRC was published in 2019, people whose names have been excluded from the NRC will be considered eligible for voting if their names figure on the voters' list, the Election Commission has recently said. Out of 3.3 crore people in Assam who had applied to be included in the list, 19 lakh did not find a place in the final list, which has not been notified by the Registrar General of India.The NRC issue is going to be a poll plank ahead of the election in Bengal and Assam — both scheduled to be held in April, May. The Centre on Tuesday told Parliament that it has not taken any decision on a nationwide roll-out of the National Register of Citizens.

03-02-2021||India||Govt puts Twitter on notice for unblocking 250 accounts, threatens prosecution||The government has cited the unblocking of over 250 accounts and posts that talked about “farmer genocide” and issued a notice to Twitter saying the social media company was violating the Information Technology Act’s Section 69 that provides for seven-year imprisonment.“This a is motivated campaign to abuse, inflame and create tension in society on unsubstantiated grounds. Incitement to Genocide is Not Freedom of Speech; It is Threat to Law & Order,” said the notice issued on Tuesday, a copy of which HT has seen.The notice said the government has considered the submissions of Twitter but has found that it is necessary to take down the accounts in the public interest. “Having considered in totality, the contents of the interim order, the oral submissions of the advocate/representative of Twitter at the Committee meeting, and also the mail from Twitter expressing its disobedience of the legal blocking orders, the competent authority is satisfied that it is necessary and also expedient in the interest of public order and also for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence relating to public order that Twitter, as an intermediary under section 2[1][w] of the act is once again directed to block for access by the public, the said Twitter handles and also the said hashtag with immediate effect...”The notice added Twitter is bound by the Indian laws. “You are aware of the prevailing situation, which not only has the potential, but has in fact, resulted into a major public order issue [violence] on 26.01.2021 [during the farmer tractor rally on Republic Day]. The statutory authorities are doing everything possible to ensure that no adverse public order situation takes place and no cognizable offences are committed,” the notice said.It added Twitter has no “constitutional, statutory or any legal basis whatsoever to comment upon the interplay of statutory provisions with constitutional principles or to unilaterally read down the scope of statutory provisions as per its own limited private understanding of the constitutional and statutory laws of India”.The notice has also cited over half a dozen Supreme Court judgements including that of the constitutional bench as to what is public order and what are the rights of the authorities. “Twitter being an intermediary is obliged to obey the directions as per satisfaction of authorities as to which information content will arouse passion and impact public order,” the notice said.HT reached out to Twitter for a comment but did not receive one immediately.The government wrote to Twitter to take down posts and accounts that ran the controversial hashtag last week.“This [unblocking] is a clear violation of the Indian law that Twitter is supposed to follow,” said an official. “The farmers’ protest has been going on for months, but the government did not block a single account earlier,” said a second official familiar with the matter. “If such a decision was taken, it would have factored in the consequences of running a hashtag that alludes to senior people in the government being involved in some sort of conspiracy.”Also Read | Delhi Police announce cash rewards for info on R-Day violence suspectsTwitter temporarily withheld from Indian users nearly 250 accounts that allegedly used the controversial hashtag after the government asked the social media company to block access to the handles “to prevent an escalation of violence” in the backdrop of the farmers’ agitation, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.The local ban was imposed in the morning. By evening, the accounts were restored, and Twitter said the content constituted free speech and was newsworthy. At least one of the handles restricted said it deleted a tweet that used the controversial hashtag.Among the handles temporarily withdrawn was that of Kisan Ekta Morcha, a farm organisation linked to the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, which is an umbrella group leading the ongoing farmers’ protest on Delhi’s borders.The action was also taken against Twitter accounts of media outlet Caravan, Prasar Bharati CEO Shashi Shekhar, activist Hansraj Meena, former Lok Sabha member Mohammed Salim, and actor Sushant Singh, among others. All accounts were restored by evening.The electronics and information technology ministry issued the directions under Section 69 (A) of the Information Technology Act after the Union home ministry stepped in. “The home ministry said that the tweets could lead to an adverse law and order situation. The accounts have been withheld to prevent an escalation of violence,” a government official familiar with the matter said.The action was criticised by activists and free speech advocates, who said the temporary suspension of the accounts violated constitutional rights to freedom of speech. They alleged Twitter had different standards of moderation and complying with government orders in different countries.Under Section 69 (A), the government can suspend accounts that pose a threat to public order.“...Section 69A [3] provides for specific penal consequences in case of non-compliance of the directions issued under section 69 A of the Act,” the notice said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-sends-notice-to-twitter-for-violating-indian-law-by-unblocking-accounts-101612343691100.html

It does not, however, negate the need for such legislation especially when DNA technology is already in use,” the Committee noted in its report which was tabled in the Parliament on Wednesday. “In fact, its use in recent months has exposed a false encounter in which innocents were killed contradicting initial claims made that they were militants. The Committee is of the strong opinion that an enabling ecosystem must be created soon to ensure that DNA profiling is done in a manner that is fully consistent with the letter and spirit of various Supreme Court judgments and with of the Constitution of India,” the report added.Also Read | Parliament proceedings halted amid protest over farm laws: All you need to knowThe Committee has consulted legal and forensic science experts including members of Internet Freedom Foundation, National Law University, Centre for Internet and Society, Gujarat Forensic Sciences University among others.The main purpose of the bill as per the Department of Biotechnology is to enable identification of missing children and of unidentified deceased individuals including disaster victims; apprehend repeat offenders for heinous crimes (rape, murder, etc.); develop stringent standards, and quality assurance system to grant approval and accreditation to the laboratories undertaking DNA profiling; regulate the use of DNA profiles in establishing identity in criminal and civil proceedings. The bill aims to establish a DNA regulatory board which will advise the Centre and the state governments on establishing of DNA laboratories, DNA data banks and laying down guidelines, standards and procedures for establishment and functioning of such laboratories and data banks.The Department of Biotechnology suggests that the DNA profiles to be stored are not for the entire population but for specified categories of individuals such as convicts and suspects of major crimes, relatives of missing persons (so that their DNA profiles can be compared with profiles of unidentified deceased individuals).The Parliamentary standing committee has recommended that the DNA regulatory board should be independent and not comprise wholly of serving government officials. It has also recommended independent and impartial checks and balances at every stage of the process: each of the police, prosecution and judicial service is independent, which means that there is a clear qualitative check at every stage so that only those cases, where there is a good chance of conviction is taken forward to arrest, charge sheet and then to trial. It also recommends that there should be careful watch on whether DNA evidence collected is legally obtained and no person is forced to provide evidence that may incriminate him/her in any crime.Binoy Viswam, leader of Communist Party of India and member of the standing committee, and Asaduddin Owaisi, member of Parliament and president of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, have raised concerns that provisions of the bill will lead to violation of the right to privacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/address-fears-over-dna-technology-bill-in-parliament-and-outside-panel-to-govt-101612340870918.html

Earlier in the day, the central government and the Opposition arrived at a consensus to allot 15 hours to discussion in the Rajya Sabha on the farmers’ movement.Last month, farmers’ leaders and the Opposition had claimed that the NIA, the country's premier anti-terror probe agency, had issued summons to 40 activists from Punjab in a bid to “intimidate” them into withdrawing their support to the protests. The summons were reportedly in connection with a sedition case against Gurpatwant Singh Pannu, the legal adviser of the US-based Sikhs For Justice (SFJ), a pro-Khalistan outfit. Baldev Singh Sirsa, who heads the Lok Bhalai Insaf Welfare Society, is among those who accused the NIA of sending summons.Also Read | NIA summons farm union leader Baldev Singh Sirsa, Sikh activists for questioning in sedition caseSirsa, whose organisation is among those leading protests against the farm laws, is among the farmers’ leaders who have held 11 rounds of talks with the Centre thus far, demanding a complete repeal of the legislations. In the 10th round of talks, on January 20, the leaders had raised the issue of the NIA summons with the Centre. Earlier, Sirsa himself had called the summons an “attempt to terrorise the people of Punjab with the sole motive to derail the farmers’ agitation.”The MHA had banned the SFJ in July 2019, under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). In January, the Delhi Police announced that it had, earlier that month, booked the group under the UAPA for advocating “Referendum 2020,” a movement for a separate Sikh state of Khalistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-summons-issued-mha-denies-sending-notices-over-farmers-stir-101612338303259.html
03-02-2021||India||Get your facts right: India responds to barbs from celebrities on farm protest||India on Wednesday said criticism of the government’s handling of the farmers’ protests against three farm laws by foreign individuals was “neither accurate nor responsible” in a response to comments by musician Rihanna and environmental activist Greta Thunberg.A statement issued by the external affairs ministry contended “vested interest groups” are trying to enforce their agenda on the protests to derail them and said these groups have tried to mobilise global support against India. The statement also referred to “sensationalist social media hashtags and comments” by “celebrities and others” but didn’t name anyone.It is rare for the external affairs ministry to respond to tweets by foreign celebrities criticising events within the country though it has, in recent weeks, pushed back against comments by leaders such as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and lawmakers in other countries supporting the farmers’ protest.“We would like to emphasise that these protests must be seen in the context of India’s democratic ethos and polity, and the efforts of the government and the concerned farmer groups to resolve the impasse,” the statement said.Also Read | SC refuses to entertain pleas seeking intervention into R-Day violence“Before rushing to comment on such matters, we would urge that the facts be ascertained, and a proper understanding of the issues at hand be undertaken. The temptation of sensationalist social media hashtags and comments, especially when resorted to by celebrities and others, is neither accurate nor responsible,” it said.On Wednesday, 18-year-old environmental activist Greta Thunberg, who was the youngest person of the year named by Time magazine, tweeted: “We stand in solidarity with the #FarmersProtest in India.” The tweet was both supported and criticised by sections within the country.A day earlier, singer Rihanna triggered a storm by tweeting “Why aren’t we talking about this?! #FarmersProtest,” along with a link to the same CNN article about the farmers’ protest that was included in Thunberg’s tweet. Author Meena Harris, niece of US vice-president Kamala Harris, also tweeted about the farmers’ protest. “We ALL should be outraged by India’s internet shutdowns and paramilitary violence against farmer protesters,” she wrote.It’s no coincidence that the world’s oldest democracy was attacked not even a month ago, and as we speak, the most populous democracy is under assault. This is related. We ALL should be outraged by India’s internet shutdowns and paramilitary violence against farmer protesters. https://t.co/yIvCWYQDD1 pic.twitter.com/DxWWhkemxWUnusually, the external affairs ministry’s statement included two hashtags - #IndiaTogether and #IndiaAgainstPropaganda. This is the first time hashtags were included in a statement.The farmers’ protest began on November 26, and after several rounds of negotiations with the government failed to end the impasse over three central farm laws, farmers’ unions backing the agitation planned to intensify their protest.They organised a tractor rally to New Delhi on Republic Day that turned violent. Many protesters and policemen were injured. Authorities responded by shutting down the internet, digging ditches, driving nails into roads and topping barricades with razor wire to prevent farmers from entering the capital again.Farmers have been protesting against the three laws – the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 – and the external affairs ministry said these “reformist legislation” were passed by Parliament after a “full debate and discussion”.“These reforms give expanded market access and provided greater flexibility to farmers. They also pave the way for economically and ecologically sustainable farming,” it said, explaining the government’s position on the laws.It said “a very small section of farmers in parts of India” had reservations about the reforms and the government initiated a series of talks with their representatives. Union ministers were part of the negotiations in 11 rounds of talks. “The government has even offered to keep the laws on hold, an offer iterated by no less than the Prime Minister of India,” it said.“Yet, it is unfortunate to see vested interest groups trying to enforce their agenda on these protests, and derail them. This was egregiously witnessed on January 26, India’s Republic Day. A cherished national commemoration, the anniversary of the inauguration of the Constitution of India, was besmirched, and violence and vandalism took place in the Indian capital,” the statement said.The ministry said, “Some of these vested interest groups have also tried to mobilise international support against India”. Instigated by such “fringe elements”, Mahatma Gandhi statues were desecrated in parts of the world, and this is “extremely disturbing for India and for civilised society everywhere”.It added that Indian police had handled these protests with “utmost restraint”, and that “hundreds of men and women serving in the police have been physically attacked, and in some cases stabbed and seriously wounded”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-dismisses-support-of-farmers-protest-by-rihanna-greta-thunberg-101612338830933.html

Talking about Republic Day violence, the MEA further said that "vested interest groups are trying to enforce their agenda on these protests"."Parliament of India, after a full debate and discussion, passed reformist legislation relating to the agricultural sector.

The central government has projected the laws as "historic reforms" in the agriculture sector that will work in favour of farmers by removing middlemen and giving them the freedom to sell their produce anywhere in the country. However, farmers fear that it will put them at the mercy of the big corporates and will remove the Minimum Support Price (MSP).The stir received support from American singer Rihanna and Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. "Why aren’t we talking about this?! #FarmersProtest," Rihanna tweeted to her more than 100 million followers along with an article that talked about suspension of the internet in areas where these farmers are protesting.Taking it further, Thunberg tweeted, "We stand in solidarity with the farmers' protest in India."Apart from Thunberg, UK Member of Parliament Claudia Webbe also expressed solidarity with the Indian farmers. Author and niece of US Vice President Kamala Harris, Meena also showed her support on social media towards the agitating farmers as well.

He was directed to furnish a bond of ₹2 lakh, two sureties for the like amount and appear before the investigating officers in Kochi every Monday.Opposing the bail plea, customs had contended, "Sivasankar's influence posed the danger of intimidation of witnesses, as he was stationed at Thiruvananthapuram. The dubious conduct of the petitioner extended beyond the borders of the country, where too he appeared to command tremendous influence," according to new agency ANI.The dollar case relates to alleged smuggling of $1,90,000 (equivalent to ₹1.30 crore) by a former finance head of the UAE Consulate in Thiruvananthapuram to Muscat in Oman. The senior IAS officer, who was arrested in October last year for his alleged liaison with some of the other accused, was granted bail by a Kochi court dealing with economic offences. He will be released from the Kakkanad sub jail later today after remaining in judicial custody for more than 90 days.Earlier, he was given bail in two cases and the dollar case was the only one pending against him. On January 25, additional chief Judicial magistrate's (economic offences) court approved his bail in the case registered by the Customs Department on the grounds that customs didn't file charge sheet in the case.Following his alleged involvement in the case came to the fore, Sivasankar was suspended from service and the government disowned him.The Kerala gold smuggling case, which pertains to the smuggling of gold in the state through diplomatic channels, came to the light after 30 kg gold worth ₹14.82 crore smuggled in a consignment camouflaged as diplomatic baggage was busted by the customs department Thiruvananthapuram on July 5, 2019.Three federal agencies - Enforcement Directorate (ED), National Investigative Agency (NIA) and Customs department -are probing the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-cm-s-former-principal-secretary-m-sivasankar-gets-bail-in-gold-smuggling-101612337232361.html

The fresh appointments would be the highest number of people appointed at a time,” Sarma told media persons while addressing a press conference.Of the new appointments, 16,484 would be teachers and non-teaching staff in schools, junior colleges and colleges, whose services would be provincialised, meaning the state government would start paying them salaries and other benefits.Besides the teachers whose services would get provincialised, another 13,217 new teachers would be appointed in government schools across the state.“This process would continue and towards the end of this month, another 5,000 teachers could get appointed if formalities regarding their appointments are sorted out,” said Sarma.The minister informed that since coming to power in 2016, the BJP-led government has appointed nearly 36,000 teachers in the state. Sarma said another 43,000 new teachers could be appointed next year after implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP).Sarma said that on Saturday, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharama would be present at a ceremony to transfer ₹3,000 each to bank accounts of nearly 800,000 tea garden workers in the state.The state government had earlier transferred sums of ₹2,500 twice to these accounts in the past two years since demonetization.Sarma informed that on Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi would be present in the state-- 2nd time in a fortnight-- to flag off construction of two new medical colleges and also to inaugurate Asom Mala—the scheme to improve state highways and major district roads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-assembly-polls-assam-to-appoint-29-700-teachers-on-friday-101612336423430.html
03-02-2021||India||Indian companies targeted by everyone in the world, says Bharat Biotech chairman||A year ago, Krishna Ella was simply known for running a small Indian pharmaceutical company with a reputation for scientific rigor. Then came the pandemic that put the scientist and his family at the center of one of the world’s loudest furors over a coronavirus vaccine.In June last year, India’s drug regulator permitted Ella’s firm -- Bharat Biotech International Ltd. -- to develop a homegrown vaccine in record time. Since then the company has been buffeted by controversies ranging from unrealistic government schedules to sporadic reports of adverse reactions. Matters came to a head last month after the government approved its shot before the completion of final human trials.That fueled a revolt across the breadth of India with many at the frontlines of the pandemic -- particularly health-care workers -- refusing the company’s injection. Two weeks in, India’s national vaccine rollout has fallen flat with little over half the targeted number of people coming forward for shots -- hesitation that’s largely being blamed on the hasty approval of Bharat Biotech’s shot, which is still deep in Phase III trials.From the US to the Norway, vociferous debates over the efficacy and safety of Covid-19 vaccines have beset pharmaceutical giants like Pfizer Inc. and AstraZeneca Plc and governments the world over are battling anti-vaccine sentiment. Yet, experts say India never registered significant resistance to inoculations until now. The stakes are particularly high because the South Asian country is racing to inoculate 1.3 billion people across villages and crowded slums while grappling with the world’s second highest number of infections.“There are many unanswered questions because of the total opaqueness and lack of accountability,” said Dinesh Thakur, a former pharmaceutical executive known for exposing fraud at the Indian drugmaker Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. “One thing is abundantly clear: They have successfully now created a significant anti-vaccine movement in India.”The use of the Bharat Biotech shot -- called Covaxin -- has drawn particular ire because Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has distributed it alongside AstraZeneca’s inoculation, which completed final tests. Luck of the draw and location determine which shot India’s frontline workers get, leaving many fearful they could end up taking an injection yet to be fully vetted.“They have compelled them to take Covaxin,” said Dayanand Sagar, the Bengaluru-based president of a resident doctors’ body that represents 5,000 medical workers across the state of Karnataka. “Health workers should be given a choice.” Both New Delhi and Bharat Biotech have vigorously defended the vaccine’s safety, with health officials taking Covaxin injections on camera. In a December interview, Suchitra Ella, the company’s co-founder and Krishna’s wife, said they have acted “within the law of the land.” A spokesperson for Bharat Biotech and Indian government officials didn’t respond to requests for comment.Many believe the speed of its vaccine has been driven by nationalistic political forces pushing for a “swadeshi” -- or locally made -- shot, along with the firm’s own ambitions to be a frontrunner.“Both things are aligning here, government pressure and the company’s internal competitive drive,” said Prashant Yadav, a healthcare supply-chain expert at the Center for Global Development in Washington.In a January press conference, Krishna Ella, the 65-year-old chairman, angrily argued the criticism had become “political” and used a 41-page slide-show with early and mid-stage data to prove his vaccine is safe and effective.His bigger rival, Serum Institute of India Ltd., is churning out a billion doses of AstraZeneca’s shot, and Ella bristled with indignation at the idea that a U.K.-sponsored vaccine wasn’t being questioned as deeply.“Indian companies are targeted by everyone in the world,” said Ella, who has a Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “It hurts us as scientists -- we don’t deserve that type of bashing.”Last year, as rich nations showed signs of snapping up scarce supplies of leading vaccine candidates, India sought its own local champion. Besides Serum, only a handful of domestic manufacturers have the capacity to pump out hundreds of millions of doses, making Bharat Biotech an obvious choice as others tied up with foreign developers.The company has supplied the Indian government and the World Health Organization with billions of life-saving vaccines for diseases ranging from polio to rotavirus and typhoid -- its three main revenue earners. Bharat Biotech threw itself into work on Covaxin, a two-dose shot based on well-trodden technology that uses part of a dead virus.The Ella’s son Raches -- a US-trained scientist -- was given responsibility for early trials. During an expert seminar at the end of October the younger Ella said he didn’t condone emergency licenses to push out inoculations before final trials were complete. “I don’t believe in that personally and even Bharat Biotech doesn’t believe in that either.”So the company raised eyebrows when it filed Covaxin for Indian emergency authorization in December without completing enrollment for Phase III trials joining the first set of applicants, including AstraZeneca and Pfizer, which both of which already had preliminary final-stage efficacy data.Minutes from January meetings showed that India’s drug regulatory agency at first insisted on seeing efficacy data for Covaxin, before relenting and approving it for a vaguely defined restricted use in “clinical trial mode.” While it’s unclear who or what caused regulators to relent, the chain of events flummoxed scientists. It also jarred with the account of a company that had always played by the book previously, according to Bloomberg’s interviews with more than a dozen investors, ex-employees and industry experts.“In all that they have done so far they’ve always gone by following protocols, building the right partnerships, having the right kind of science available to them,” said Gagandeep Kang, a professor at Vellore’s Christian Medical College, who worked on clinical trials for Bharat Biotech’s rotavirus vaccine, which was hailed by Modi in 2015 as a prime example of Indian innovation. “I really don’t understand what the need was to jump the gun for this vaccine.”It wasn’t the first controversy around the shot. India’s medical research body promised Covaxin would be ready by August 15 last year: The anniversary of national independence from British colonial rule. Suchitra told Bloomberg that was a communication “slip.”Then reports emerged of some adverse reactions. Residents in the town of Bhopal -- one of the trial sites -- said they took the injections in return for 750 rupees ($10) and that some couldn’t read consent forms because they were illiterate. One participant also died on Dec. 21, nine days after a Covaxin shot.In a statement last month, Bharat Biotech said the death was due to cardiac arrest from suspected poisoning, which is under police investigation. Initial reviews suggest the death wasn’t related to the shot, the company said, adding that the payments were in line with Indian trial reimbursement rules and that nobody was induced.The vaccine’s advocates have pointed to a peer-reviewed study published in The Lancet medical journal in January that said Covaxin’s first human test covering 375 people showed “tolerable safety outcomes and enhanced immune responses.”Many remain to be convinced. At Mumbai’s Sir J.J. Hospital, the only facility in the city administering Covaxin, around 35% to 40% of the 100 people called in daily are showing up, according to Lalit Sankhe, the doctor heading up the vaccination efforts there. Most senior doctors there have since taken the shot, Sankhe said, adding that he has also been injected and suffered no side effects.The debate now has the potential to fuel wider vaccine skepticism as the Ellas sign global supply deals. Bharat Biotech has agreed to ship Covaxin to Brazil and work with a company for approval in the US Whatever Covaxin’s ultimate legacy, it will leave an indelible mark on Krishna Ella’s reputation as a scientist.“I’m 65,” he said in a December interview with Bloomberg TV. “Before I die I want to make some impact on the public health of the world.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/controversy-swirls-around-india-s-homegrown-covid-vaccine-101612334958732.html

Slamming the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) IT cell for allegedly spinning a narrative that discredits the agitation, an editorial in party mouthpiece Saamana said CCTV footage also showed that the tricolour was left untouched when farmers stormed Red Fort on Republic Day. It went on to point out that if security arrangements at the border were anything like the ones made in the national Capital to prevent agitating farmers from entering Delhi, the Chinese army would not have entered Ladakh.

Sena delegation of MPs led by Sanjay Raut met Rajesh Tikait, the farm leader, at Ghazipur border on Tuesday.

We also read the statement of the Prime Minister in the press that law will take its own course. We are confident that law will take its own course.

03-02-2021||India||Govt should restore statehood in J&K, repeal farm laws: Ghulam Nabi Azad||Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha and Congress MP Ghulam Nabi Azad on Wednesday said the government should bring a bill to restore statehood in Jammu and Kashmir and repeal the farm laws that a section of farmers are agitating against. Speaking during the discussion on the motion of thanks to the President’s address, Azad said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the only person who can find a solution to both the problems—Jammu and Kashmir and the farmers’ agitation. “The Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan slogan is as relevant today as it was then. Without these two sections of our society we are incomplete,” he said. He went on to pay tributes to the soldiers who live in treacherous weather conditions to serve the nation and said, “I also pay tribute to those farmers who lost their lives in the last few months demanding their rights.” “The logjam between the farmers and the government is not for the first time; it has been going on for hundreds of year... Farmers have had to struggle for their rights sometimes against feudalism and zamindari system and sometimes against the government,” Azad said. Also Read | Parliament proceedings halted amid protest over farm laws: All you need to knowHe referred to the agitations that took place in pre-Independent India when the farmers’ took on the British government, forcing it to recall laws. “I have been reading about farmers’ protests during British rule. The result was the government had to bend and I have reached the conclusion that the might of the farmers is the biggest force in the country. And we cannot reach any conclusion by fighting with them,” Azad said. Apart from the Champaran movement and various other movement for land rights, Azad also referred to the 1988 rally when Mahender Singh Tikait laid seize to the Boat Club forcing the Congress that was then in power at the Centre to move its rally from Boat Club to Red Fort. “I was sitting with the then Prime Minister (Rajiv Gandhi) and the government people came and said let’s remove them (farmers). We said we cannot fight with farmers we will change the venue. We went to the Red Fort instead and did not announce it. Two days later the agitation was withdrawn,” he said. Pointing out that the government cannot open a front against its own people, Azad said the country should be united in fighting against its enemies. While condemning the January 26 incident when a section of farmers raised a religious flag at the Red Fort, Azad said, “The whole Opposition and the Congress party condemned the incident that happened at Red Fort... it should have never happened; it is against democracy; it is against law and order. We cannot support such incidents and those who were involved in this should be given strict punishment; but at the same time those who are innocent should not be implicated.” He urged the Prime Minister to set up a committee to find people who went missing on January 26. “The efforts made to implicate them should not be made because then it will lead to another agitation. A man who has been a minister of state for foreign affairs has been charged with sedition along with a few journalists; if he is anti-national then we are all anti-national,” he said in reference to the sedition cases filed against Shashi Tharoor and some journalists. Urging the Prime Minister to bring a bill to restore statehood in J&K, Azad said he fails to understand the rationale for bifurcating the state into union territories. “I have heard Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s speeches, the then home minister’s and several BJP MPs, but I have never heard them demand that the state should be bifurcated. I can understand and I support a UT status for Leh. The government could have done that, but the state should be left untouched,” he said. While the government has been claiming that the law and order has improved and terror activities in the Valley have come down, the Congress leader said it was a wrong claim. “Law and order in the in the state was much better before, militancy was at its lowest and developmental works were very good when there was a state government, no matter which government was in power,” he said. He, however, congratulated the government for conducting the DDC elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-should-restore-statehood-in-j-k-repeal-farm-laws-ghulam-nabi-azad-101612335170520.html

The state officials have termed it a worrying development which could threaten the big cat population in the reserve.The worrying findings were the result of a scientific study to analyze the dietary patterns of tigers and leopards, reintroduced into the wild at the Sariska Tiger Reserve (STR), conducted jointly by Govind Sagar Bhardwaj-- former field director of STR and the member secretary of the pollution board-- and Hemant Shekhawat, former deputy field director of STR.The study, conducted between 2016 and 2018 and published recently, highlighted some alarming facts including very high anthropogenic pressure in the reserve, leading to drastic dietary changes among the big cats, when compared to previous such studies.Among the reported tiger kills, 77% were livestock, especially buffaloes, which is a manifold increase over 10.4% a decade ago and 19.4% in 2012. This has led to an increasing number of human-wildlife conflicts, which induced further resentment among the local communities, further denting both law and order and conservation efforts in Sariska. The diet of Leopards also consisted of an alarming proportion of 84.2% livestock prey as compared to 7.1% in 2012.As per the survey, a meagre 548 sq km of actual inviolate area is available for tigers out of the total 1213 sq km area of STR due to immense anthropogenic pressure. Around 175 villages are located in and around STR, out of which 26 are lying within the critical tiger habitat.The human population residing in the villages inside the reserve is over 1700 and the livestock population is more than 10 thousand, mainly buffaloes and goats. Apart from this, there is a large human and cattle population in villages around STR. Villagers often take their livestock to graze and drink water well within the reserve.Leopards, on the other hand, being smaller in size prefer smaller prey, and their natural primary diet is Cheetals. When tigers were poached out of STR around 2005, leopards occupied the core areas within the reserve but after the tigers were reintroduced and their population flourished, leopards were pushed to the peripheral areas of the reserve.The change in the dwelling areas resulted in them preying on smaller livestock like goats and buffalo fawns, available in the peripheral villages. Their diet included an overwhelming 84.2% livestock as compared to 7.1% in 2012, as per the study.Sariska had lost all its Tigers to poaching in 2004-05. Tigers were brought to the STR from Ranthambore Tiger Reserve in world's first Tiger reintroduction program in 2008. However, owing to high anthropogenic pressure, the tiger population at Sariska did not flourish till 2012. Currently, Sariska is home to 22 tigers including 11 adults, 5 sub adults and 6 cubs.Attacks from tigers and leopards are often met with violent retaliation by the village folks. Killing of their livestock results in serious outrage and unrest among local communities, which induces human attacks against the big cats.The first ever reintroduced Tiger, the male ST-1, was poisoned by the villagers, in 2010. In 2018, tigress ST-5 went missing and a young male ST-11 got strangled in a wire snare.Also Read: Rajasthan IPS officer Manish Agarwal linked to extortion racket, arrestedLately, retaliatory killings have become an even bigger threat than poaching to the already sparse tiger population in the reserve. In 2017-18, seven people were killed by leopards in the nearby villages and an angry mob not only manhandled the staffers of the STR but also burnt a leopard alive at Madhavgarh area near Sariska.A leopard was found dead as recently as last week in Tehla range and unconfirmed reports suggested that it was poisoned from a goat carcass. Village relocation and effective law enforcement in STR are the only viable solutions which can prevent the depletion of the big cat population in the reserve.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sariska-tigers-preference-for-cattle-over-wild-prey-poses-danger-to-big-cats-101612333540944.html

The chairman also adjourned Rajya Sabha proceedings briefly."We expressed our dissent in the house, we want repeal of three farm laws because talks won't help," Singh said after the suspension, according to news agency ANI.This happened as the government and opposition members reached a consensus to discuss farm laws stir in Parliament. According to the arrangement agreed upon, the opposition parties will be allowed to raise questions regarding three farm legislation and the farmer protests at Delhi borders from Thursday. The discussion on the motion of thanks to President's address will last for 15 hours and Question Hour suspended to make time for it.Follow latest updates on farmers click hereThousands of protesters are agitating against the three farm legislation enacted by Parliament in September last year. The central government has projected the laws as "historic reforms" in the agriculture sector that will work in favour of farmers by removing middlemen and giving them the freedom to sell their produce anywhere in the country. However, farmers fear that it will put them at the mercy of the big corporates and will remove the Minimum Support Price (MSP).The agitation is continuing for more than two months now and has been supported by various opposition parties including Aam Aadmi Party.Last month, AAP leader Raghav Chadha asked Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh to deploy police personnel from his state on camps around the borders of Delhi where the farmers are protesting. "The Punjab Police must provide protection to our farmers brothers and sisters so no harm is done to them and they can continue to protest against the black laws in a peaceful manner," wrote Chadha in the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-stir-three-aap-members-suspended-from-parliament-for-sloganeering-101612333432239.html

It also directed the heads of department and the chief secretary to check attendance register and take action within two months. With the verdict, employees who availed leave or payment on these days will have to return their two days’ salaries.A nationwide two-day strike was called by trade unions in January 2019 to protest against the economic policies of the Union government and it turned into a forced shutdown in Communist-ruled Kerala. Later, the government issued an order granting permission to convert these two days into leave to avoid loss of pay. This was challenged in the high court.“We do not think the government is at liberty to take any policy decision in absolute violation of the rules. Even if it is a policy decision, the court can look into the legality, correctness or arbitrariness by exercising the power under Article 226 of the Constitution, if such a policy is against the statutory provisions,” the court ruled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-quashes-government-order-to-pay-employees-missing-on-strike-days-101612329866723.html

A team of archaeologists has visited Telhara to review the status of the site and to chalk out the excavation plan. The digging was likely to begin in the next few days, the officials said.The remains of the university have remained buried under a 35-feet high mound at Telhara village, which is located in Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar’s constituency. The state archaeology department started excavations there in 2009 but they were stopped five years later.The digging earlier led to the remains of the ancient university and over half-a-dozen terracotta sealing, similar to the sealing found at ancient Nalanda University. One terracotta sealing has a Chakra flanked by two deer and carried the inscription, Sri Prathamshivpur Mahavihariyaye Bhikshu Sangha in Pali language, which is believed to be the original name of the university.Also Read | Ram Setu exploration given nod by ASI, govt tells Parliament“Things have been cleared now and the ASI has allowed resumption of digging at Telhara.

Even Hiuen Tsang, the Chinese traveller visited Telhara and has given detailed descriptions in his travel account of the Viharas, the university, and of the buildings and their architectural designs located there,” he said.Atul Kumar, a former state archaeology director who earlier led Telhara excavations, said Hiuen Tsang called Telhara a seat of learning, where the monks studied the Mahayan Buddhism along with other subjects. “Importantly the sealing found there and the size and shape of the bricks used in the structure indicate that it was set up in 1st Century AD while the Nalanda University was set up in 4th Century AD and Vikramshila University was set up in 7th Century AD,” he said. Kumar added the structure is believed to have been destroyed in the 12th Century and a layer of ashes was discovered over the remains during the digging conducted earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/excavation-at-ancient-buddhist-university-site-in-bihar-s-telhara-set-to-resume-101612327729438.html

But the Opposition remained adamant. • There was no formal meeting between Naidu and Opposition leaders, but back-channel negotiations were likely to start in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday.• Protests erupted in the Rajya Sabha at 9.25am after Naidu rejected the Opposition’s notice saying as they were going to discuss the President’s address on Wednesday as the first item, members can avail themselves of this opportunity and then participate and express their viewpoints.

The distinction is based on patriarchal stereotypes, has no scientific backing, perpetrates de jure and de facto inequality against women, and goes completely against the global trends,” the petition stated.Upadhyay had earlier raised the issue before the Delhi high court in August 2019. He later came across a similar petition filed by one Abdul Mannan which is being considered by the Rajasthan high court.Both petitions stated that the different age for marriage violated fundamental rights of equality (Article 14), protection against discrimination (Article 15), and dignity of life (Article 21) of citizens and went against India’s commitment under the Convention on Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW).

The spokesperson pointed to a decision by Sri Lanka’s cabinet three months ago to implement the project with foreign investors.“All sides should continue to abide by the existing understandings and commitment,” the commission said in a statement.The spokesperson added: “I would like to reiterate the expectation of government of India for expeditious implementation of the trilateral Memorandum of Cooperation (MOC) signed in May 2019 among the governments of India, Japan and Sri Lanka for the development of ECT with participation from these three countries.Sri Lanka’s industries minister Wimal Weerawansa said the ten parties in the ruling coalition that are against handing over the ECT to an Indian investor would not oppose the development of the WCT by foreign firms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sri-lanka-opts-out-of-port-deal-with-india-101612313770333.html

The reports should be submitted once every two months to the Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas, the body set up by the Union government to curb pollution.This was stated by the ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC) in an affidavit submitted before the Supreme Court, which was hearing a clutch of petitions about the air pollution in Delhi.Also read: Maximum temperature rises up to 28.1°C, rain likely this weekThe affidavit highlighted steps taken by the Commission having representatives from states adjoining Delhi, as well as representatives from central ministries, and representatives of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and state pollution control authorities.The Commission, which was appointed in November 2020, has identified five focus areas to tackle pollution in Delhi-NCR. These are: industrial pollution, agricultural stubble burning, municipal solid waste management and biomass burning, construction and demolition activities, and vehicular pollution.During interactions with representatives from Delhi and neighbouring states, the panel noticed a lack of enforcement against old polluting vehicles not just in Delhi but in adjoining cities as well. The neighbouring states also did not have a traffic management plan in place to tackle vehicular pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-will-file-regular-reports-on-polluting-vehicles-centre-to-sc-101612307346162.html

The Oxford Hindi word of the year is a word or expression that is chosen to reflect the ethos, mood, or preoccupations of the passing year, and have lasting potential as a term of cultural significance.In a statement, Oxford Languages said in the early months of the pandemic when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced India’s Covid-19 recovery package, he emphasised the need to become self-reliant as a country, in a bid to navigate the perils of the pandemic.There was a massive increase in the usage of ‘aatmanirbharta’ highlighting its increased prominence as a phrase and concept in the public lexicon, it said.“In an unprecedented year, ‘aatmanirbharta’ found resonance with a wide cross-section of people as it is seen to be an answer to the revival of a Covid-impacted economy,” said Oxford University Press India managing director Sivaramarkrishnan Venkateswaran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oxford-names-aatmanirbharta-as-hindi-word-of-the-year-for-2020-101612305401914.html
03-02-2021||India||CBSE sets ball rolling with exams schedule||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) announced the schedule for final examinations of classes 10 and 12 on Tuesday, three months before the commencement of theory papers on May 4, taking a step towards normalcy that could leave a key imprint on this year’s academic session in the shadow of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).According to the CBSE date sheet, Class 10 board exams will end on June 7 and Class 12 board exams on June 11. The board said authorities will have to follow guidelines against Covid-19 such as wearing masks, following physical distancing and using sanitisers.Officials at the Council for the Indian School Certificate (CISC), another national-level board, said they too were working on board exam schedules. While some state boards have already announced the dates, others are in the process of finalising the modalities. The commencement of board exams, especially CBSE — the biggest national board — would have a bearing on college admission dates and, in turn, the entire academic session that was upended by the pandemic last year, experts said.“The practical priority for schools is to deliver exams. This is the first thing they will try to deliver in order to move towards normalcy. For regular learning, the schools might continue hybrid learning (online and offline) for some more months. It all depends on the Covid-19 positivity rate at that exact time,” educationist Meeta Sengupta said.The CBSE schedule detailed that while most of the Class 12 exams will be held in the morning shift (10.30am-12.30/ 1.30pm), some of them have been slated for the afternoon shift (2.30pm- 4.30/5.30pm) with an aim to reduce the total exam days in view of the pandemic. To be sure, this does not mean that Class 12 students will have to write two papers a day. The four days (May 6, 15, 21, and 27) when they will write their papers in the afternoon, only Class 10 exams will be held in the morning.Also read: Over 50% exposure to Sars-Cov-2 in 10 of 11 city districts“Class 12 examinations will be conducted in two shifts to reduce the number of days of conducting examinations,” Sanyam Bhardwaj, CBSE controller of examinations, said. Bhardwaj added that exams for subjects not offered by schools abroad will be conducted in the afternoon shift on the four specified days.Classes 10 and 12 theory examinations (for all streams) will be completed in 39 days, as compared with the 45 days planned in 2020. However, 12 papers of Class 12 were eventually cancelled due to the Covid-19 outbreak, which also impacted college admissions that were pushed back by at least three months.Authorities also announced that around 340,000 students will take the Class 10 and Class 12 board exams this year. While the Class 10 exams involve a total of 75 subjects, including optionals, Class 12 exams involve 111 subjects across science commerce and arts streams. Practical tests will begin on March 1, as announced in December.Usually, the practicals are conducted in January while written exams begin in February and conclude in March.Officials at the Delhi University (DU) said the college admission process may again get delayed, but the situation would be better compared to the last year. The admission process was delayed by around three months (from July to October) due to the pandemic, said Suman Kumar, a member of the DU admission committee last year. “According to the CBSE schedule (this year), the results are likely to be announced by July 15. However, our academic session normally begins in mid-July. It means the admission process will again get delayed this year.”On Tuesday, Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ announced the CBSE exam schedule and wished students luck. “When the entire world was fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, students showed everyone that they were capable of taking care of both their health and future. Now that the vaccines are here, we don’t need to be afraid and just take the necessary precaution,” he said in a video address. He added that adequate intervals had been given between two important papers. The board has already announced that its 2021 exams will be conducted in written mode, and not online. Owing to the disruptions due to Covid-19, the board has also reduced its syllabus for classes 9-12 for the 2020-2021 academic session by up to 30% as a “one-time measure”.Schools were closed across the country in March-end, and then a 68-day nationwide hard lockdown followed prohibiting all businesses and activities, excluding essential services. Though the Centre allowed states to take a call on the graded reopening of educational institutes after October 15, many of them took a wait and watch approach before allowing students to return to their classrooms. Meanwhile, schools conducted online classes.Also read: CBSE class 12 date sheet 2021 released, here's direct linkJyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in Delhi’s Rohini, welcomed the move to announce the schedule three months in advance and said it will help students. “Schools will be following Covid-19 protocols such as physical distancing, masks and sanitisation. CBSE has prepared the date sheet in a meticulous way and even reduced the number of days of the examination.”Darshan Ram, a Class 12 student at Bluebells School International in Delhi, agreed. “Adequate time has been given... between two examinations. There won’t be any issue since we still have three months left for the exams,” he said.Some state boards such as those in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh have already announced their board exam dates, while states such as Rajasthan are likely to make public their schedule soon. Class 12 board exams in Bihar have commenced and will conclude on February 13. The Tamil Nadu government is holding consultations to decide on the dates for state board exams. Karnataka has announced a tentative time table Class 10 exams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbse-sets-ball-rolling-with-exams-schedule-101612301563410.html
03-02-2021||India||House stalled as Opposition parties demands farm debate||Several opposition parties protesting the farm bills brought Parliament proceedings to a halt on Tuesday by pushing suspension of business motions in the Rajya Sabha and adjournment motions in the Lok Sabha to demand a separate debate on the farm protests before the customary discussion on the President’s speech during the Budget Session.The parties forced repeated suspension of proceedings in both Houses, trooped into the Well, raised slogans and flashed placards, walked out, and continued protests whenever they returned — mirroring scenes of agitation that have played out across northern India and Delhi over the past two months.Rajya Sabha was adjourned three times before it was adjourned for the day, and Lok Sabha three times before it was adjourned just minutes after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Locket Chatterjee initiated the debate on the motion of thanks to the President.There is some hint that normal proceedings may resume on Wednesday since a section of the Opposition feels that it provides opportunity for them to nail the government on the farm issue, as it featured extensively in the January 29 speech by President Ram Nath Kovind.Also read: Over 50% exposure to Sars-Cov-2 in 10 of 11 city districtsCongress floor leader in Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, said, “We have some issues that we will discuss with Speaker Om Birla. But we want the debate to take place.”Even if there’s a debate, the farm issue is set to dominate the Opposition agenda. The Opposition wants a separate debate on the farm issue but government managers want it covered under the discussion on the President’s speech. As things stand, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to reply on the debate in Lok Sabha on Friday and Rajya Sabha on Monday.A few opposition parties may move notices under Rule 267 in the Rajya Sabha, and adjournment motions in the Lower House, to set aside scheduled business and discuss the farm issue.The agitation against the three farm bills started soon after they were passed by Parliament in September. The farmers think the laws will put them at the mercy of corporate firms and gut government-backed support systems. The Centre has assured farmers that the minimum support price regime will not be touched and offered to put the laws on hold for 18 months, but the protesters are pushing for a repeal of the laws.The protests took a violent turn on Republic Day, when agitators broke through barricades on tractors, ran riot on Delhi’s streets and stormed the Red Fort, hoisting the Sikh flag from its ramparts. Since then, protest sites on the outskirts of the Capital have turned into fortresses, with police digging trenches, putting up barbed wire fences, concrete barricades and hammering beds of nails on roads.On Tuesday, farm leader Rakesh Tikait, whose emotional appeal for support last week inspired thousands of farmers from western Uttar Pradesh to join the stir, told agitators to be ready to continue the stir until November. “‘Kanoon wapsi nahi to ghar wapsi nahi (no returning home until the laws are repealed),” he added.Some opposition parties, including the Congress, the Trinamool Congress (TMC), the Left, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), which met on Tuesday morning to strategise, also objected allotment of 10 hours for the entire debate on the President’s speech, and argued that since the PM speaks for about an hour, he should get a separate slot.The Opposition parties will again meet on Wednesday morning to review and renew their strategy.Throughout the day, Lok Sabha Speaker Birla spoke to leaders across parties to run the House but the Opposition remained adamant. There was no formal meeting between Naidu and opposition leaders, according to his officials, but back-channel negotiations are likely to start in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday.Protests erupted in the Rajya Sabha at 9.25am after Naidu rejected the Opposition’s notice and said, “As we are going to discuss the President’s address tomorrow as the first item, members can avail themselves of this opportunity and then participate and express their viewpoints. That is why I am not able to accept the notice given to suspend the Business of the House.”The opposition members from the TMC, Left, Congress and the DMK, who had given suspension notices, raised slogans and trooped into the Well of the House. But Naidu did not relent, and some Opposition MPs walked out as soon as the question hour began.When they reassembled after some later, the protests grew louder, forcing Naidu to adjourn the House for about 40 minutes. As soon as it resumed, opposition members continued to raise slogans, forcing a second adjournment till 11.30am. The House was finally adjourned for the whole day a third time when opposition MPs did not heed deputy chairperson Harivansh’s appeals to allow the House to take up bills listed for the day.Parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi said, “The Opposition can raise any issue during the debate on President speech. And the government will also give a reply to all their questions.” RJD’s Manoj Jha and Communist Party of India’s Binoy Viswam demanded a discussion while BSP’s Satish Misra said that this was an issue that every parliamentarian wanted to discuss so that a solution could come out.In the Lok Sabha, right from the start, the Opposition pushed for an adjournment motion. Question hour, which had a query on minimum support prices — one of the key bones of contention between the government and the farm unions — could not continue after a brief start as the House got adjourned.The House met after an hour but protests followed. Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said that had the Opposition allowed the question hour, their issue would have been resolved. Birla tried to convince the protesting MPs and said he will allow everyone to speak if they return to their seats but no one was in a mood to comply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/house-stalled-as-opposition-parties-demands-farm-debate-101612300800173.html

The 15th Finance Commission, set up by the government, has recommended an outlay of ₹8,000 crore for developing eight new cities in eight states, a senior official of the ministry of housing and urban affairs said on Tuesday.The ministry of housing and urban affairs will soon come out with a detailed framework to execute the greenfield project. According to the ministry, ₹1,000 crore will be available for each city.Also read: CAA rules are under preparation - Govt tells Lok Sabha"We will create a system on how to develop these new cities... The government will work out the framework that may take six months or even a year... no new cities have come up for many years, the Finance Commission has granted ₹8,000 crore to incubate new cities," said Durga Shankar Mishra, housing ministry secretary.Mishra said that a census town is an area with a population of more than 5,000 and a population density of over 400 per square kilometres, and wherein more than 75 per cent of the male population is engaged in non-agriculture work.Census towns may be considered for the new project. However, there is no clarity yet as the project is in its initial stage, a source said."The country needs new cities... unless we get planned cities, there would then be outgrowth," he said. While the framework for developing the new cities will be worked out later, Mishra pointed out that there are such areas that exist just outside the jurisdiction of a city administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-to-develop-8-new-cities-to-meet-urbanisation-demand-101612290668029.html

Where is that money? After collecting donations for Ram Temple in the daytime, the BJP leaders use that money to pay for alcohol in the evening,” veteran Congress MLA Kantilal Bhuria told reporters in Petlawad, Jhabua.He had earlier made similar allegations at a rally.He went on to say that he had only repeated what people were already saying.The BJP government hit back with home minister Narottam Mishra saying Bhuria’s statement was a reflection of his devilish mindset. “He didn’t say anything new. He is saying what his mentor taught him,” Mishra said.But Bhuria found support in Congress MLA PC Sharma who said, “Bhuria spoke about the reality. BJP leaders should deposit the fund directly into the account of Ram Janambhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust but they are collecting cash and misusing the fund.”“The fake collection drive was exposed on Tuesday evening after a man was booked for such a fraud in Bhopal,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-leaders-buy-alcohol-with-ram-temple-funds-says-congress-mla-in-mp-101612290645198.html
03-02-2021||India||Fix timeline for call on pleas by life convicts: SC||The Supreme Court on Tuesday directed all states and Union territories to fix a timeline to decide on requests for early release by life convicts, noting with regret that a total of 1,649 such applications were pending across 21 states.Contemplating a uniform policy across the country, the top court said that there must be a regime in place to ensure that convicts undergoing a life term are apprised of their legal right to seek remission after completing 14 years behind bars.According to the law, people sentenced to life imprisonment are supposed to be inside the prison until they die. However, the law entitles the state government and jail authorities to consider the early release of convicts if they are is found to have good conduct throughout a minimum jail term of 14 years.On Monday, the Supreme Court bench of justices Sanjay K Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy noted that the best practice would be to ensure that jail superintendents send applications for early release within a month of the convicts completing 14 years in jail, and the state’s home department then takes a decision within three months.Legal aid to those who are unable to pay for lawyers cannot be a mere formality, but must always be about providing proper assistance, the bench underlined, while noting that some legal aid lawyers indiscriminately filed appeals in the life term cases without even considering if the convicts had filed requests for early release after completing 14 years in prison.Also read: Centre says states will file regular reports on polluting vehiclesThe bench was hearing a petition by a murder convict who filed an appeal in the apex court after he spent more than 14 years in a Chhattisgarh jail. Appointed as amicus curiae to assist the court, advocate Liz Mathew pointed out that although the Chhattisgarh government has a rule to enable filing of applications for early release, it took almost four years for the prison authorities and the home department to take a decision in this case and order the release.Appearing for the National Legal Services Authority (Nalsa), advocate Gaurav Agrawal presented a chart that showed 1,649 applications of convicts seeking premature release pending across 21 states, 431 prisoners not having moved such pleas despite spending 14 years in jail.The court, in light of this, said that it intended to put in place a uniform mechanism with respect to processing of applications for early release after ensuring proper legal assistance to the life term convicts.“It is a valuable right under the law. And we think if the law provides for it, the convicts should be made aware of their right. Legal aid cannot just be a mere formality which is to get over by filing appeals,” remarked the bench as it asked all the states to respond on fixing a timeline for remission decisions.The court asked Nalsa to circulate the copy of its order to all states and union territories and fixed the matter for hearing next on March 1.The bench has considered at least 10 cases where convicts either completed 14 years in jail or were nearing the 14-year mark. But there was no information on whether the convicts had been given any legal assistance to file their pleas for early release.In one of these cases that the court heard last week, it issued a notice to the Supreme Court Legal Services Cell, asking it to look into such cases and to ensure the provision of proper legal assistance to the convicts.Senior Advocate and former Additional Solicitor General KV Viswanathan told HT: “This is a salutary order, having Article 21 (right to life and dignity) overtone. This order will go a long way in bringing uniformity in jail rules and ensuring speedy decisions in such cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fix-timeline-for-call-on-pleas-by-life-convicts-sc-101612289984757.html
03-02-2021||India||Farm leaders tell protesters to ensure peace during Feb 6 ‘chakka jam’||Farmers leaders on Tuesday appealed to the protesters to maintain peace during the Feburary 6 nationwide ‘chakka jam’ announced on Monday against the three farm laws. This comes a week after violence during the tractor parade by farmers on Republic Day.Protesters and security volunteers have also been asked to keep a “tight vigil” to ensure that anti-social elements do not become part of the agitation on February 6 and “disrupt” the movement.Karan Singh Brar, a farmer leader and a member of Samyukt Kisan Morcha, said, “We will have to successfully execute the call of ‘chakka jam’ on February 6 between 12-3 pm and it will only be successful if we do it peacefully. We will have to ensure that emergency vehicles such as ambulance or fire tenders should be given way during the agitation and that there is no non-violence,” he said at Tikri border.Also read: Rakesh Tikait coins new slogan at Ghazipur protest siteAnother farm leader, Chaudhary Rajveer Singh said, “To execute our chakka jam peacefully, we also need to be vigilant and keep an eye out for anti-social elements who may try to infiltrate and try to defame farmers. The government may resort to these tactics, but we will have to be extra cautious.”Following the Republic Day violence, farmer leaders have maintained that the incident was a government conspiracy. Police have blamed farmer leaders for betraying their trust by letting protesters indulge in violence and drive on routes other than the ones approved by the police.Meanwhile, Delhi Police continued to bolster its security arrangements at the agitation spot across the three borders. While police installed at least three more layers of obstructions beyond the iron spikes at Tikri on Tuesday, fresh trenches were dug up at Ghazipur, and another layer of concrete barricade was installed a few metres away from the main stage at Singhu border. The police have made these arrangements to discourage any movement of agitating farmers towards the capital.At Singhu, the barricades were installed after a mob, claiming to be locals, entered the protest site last week leading to clash with farmers in which 15 farmers and 6 police personnel were injured. On Monday, the government had poured concrete mixture between two barricades and fixed iron rods on the road. On Tuesday, another layer of barricades were installed at the spot and no one except police personnel were allowed at that point. Security volunteers at the spot had also tied ropes on the concrete barricades disallowing protesters to come near it.Gurpreet Singh, 28, a security volunteer and a farmer from Moga district, said, “Yesterday, too many people had crowded here when police officials were supervising pouring of cement mixture between concrete barricades. If anyone managed to infiltrate that group and cause any problems, our movement would get defamed. So, we decided to guard the area and ensure no one reaches close to police barricades.”However, despite restrictions, farmers from Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh were joining the protests in large numbers. At Singhu, where crowd had thinned after January 26, more farmers had arrived at the protest site in the past couple of days adding to the movement.Pritam Singh, 62, a farmer from Devinagar village of Patiala district in Punjab, said, “Around 2,500 people from our village have been coming per day since last week. While some stay back for a week or two, others return in a couple of days once more people come. Though the Republic Day incident had left us worried, we now understand that it was a ploy to scare the farmers and weaken the movement. The government’s decision to repeal laws and suspend internet just shows that.”Hundreds of farmers from Haryana were also travelling from Sonipat and other districts to join the movement albeit for a day. Rajesh Malik, 47, a farmer from Bhainswal Kalan village in Sonipat district of Haryana, who has been camped at Singhu border, said, “Our women want to join the movement in large numbers, so they come every day in different batches. They leave the next day only once another batch arrives. We want to let the government know that protesters are not leaving the agitation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farm-leaders-tell-protesters-to-ensure-peace-during-feb-6-chakka-jam-101612289745173.html
03-02-2021||India||No proposal for transgender reservation: Govt||The Centre is working on a scheme to ensure access to health, education and livelihood for transgender persons but there is no proposal to enforce reservations for the community, the government told Parliament on Tuesday. The response by the Union social justice minister Thaawarchand Gehlot was to a question by Congress MP Revanth Reddy and it came roughly a year after the government enacted the transgender rights act.In its response, the government said the Transgender Persons (Protection Of Rights) Act 2019 and rules under the legislation mandated the central and state governments to take up schemes that address access to health, education, welfare, shelter and economic support for livelihoods. “A scheme is being formulated for addressing the above, which includes skill upgradation. As of now there is no proposal for providing reservations to the transgender persons in education or jobs,” the written answer read. In response to another question by the same parliamentarian, minister of state for social justice and empowerment Rattan Lal Kataria said the government spent ₹98.50 lakhs in supporting 6,940 transgender persons from 33 states and union territories during the Covid-19 pandemic. The National Backward Class Finance and Development Corporation (NBCFDC) gave Rs1,500 each to transgender persons through direct benefit transfer and also provided ration supplies, the Centre declared.The transgender community was among the worst hit when India imposed a lockdown last March to arrest the spread of Covid-19. Many members also appealed to the government in May for basic provisions because they struggled to access livelihood, food, medication and housing. Data furnished by the ministry showed that the maximum beneficiaries were in Tamil Nadu (1036) followed by Delhi (876) and West Bengal (814). “Free helpline assistance was setup to provide psycho-social support to transgender community during Covid period,” the answer, furnished in the Lok Sabha, read. But the help may have been inadequate. “The transgender community was badly hit by the virus and the lockdown. Many were on the streets. We needed more help from the government, including reservation in jobs and education,” said Shameena, a transgender activist. In 2016, the transgender rights bill was drafted by the government in response to the Supreme Court’s 2014 judgment that confirmed the rights of the community, and a 2015 private member’s bill passed in the Rajya Sabha. But almost immediately, activists and transgender groups criticised the draft legislation for confused definitions, focus on medical screening and criminalization of traditional occupations such as begging. The bill was then sent to a select committee and underwent several modifications before being passed by Parliament in November 2019. But many activists still say the law still has inadequate penal provisions for crimes and discrimination against transgender persons and no reservations for the community. The medical screening clause, for authorities to provide a transgender certificate, has also not been done away.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-working-on-scheme-for-welfare-of-transpeople-101612289565059.html
03-02-2021||India||No plans to bring national anti-conversion law: Govt||The Centre has no plans to bring a nationwide anti conversion law to regulate interfaith marriages in the country, the ministry of home affairs (MHA) told Parliament on Tuesday.The government’s response comes at a time anti-conversion laws in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, which outlaw religious conversions by marriage, have stoked controversy, especially over the issue of love jihad, a term used by right-wing groups to describe relationships between Muslim men and Hindu women.Himachal Pradesh has a similar law. Assam, Karnataka and Haryana have announced they plan to bring similar legislation.Responding to a query by five members of parliament (MPs) on whether the government intends to propose a central anti-conversion law , Union minister of state of home affairs G Kishan Reddy said in a written reply in the Lok Sabha – “No, Sir”.Also read: Speaker tells Maharashtra to mull possibility of ballot paper lawAsked if the government was of the view that interfaith marriages were happening due to forceful conversions, Reddy said issues related to religious conversions are primarily the concern of state governments. He added that law enforcement agencies take action whenever such instances of violation come to the fore.“Public order and police are state subjects as per the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. Hence, prevention, detection, registration, investigation and prosecution of offences related to religious conversions are primarily the concerns of state governments and Union Territory administrations. Action is taken as per existing laws by law enforcing agencies whenever instances of violation come to notice,” Reddy said.Punishments under the anti-conversion law currently range between one to 10 years of imprisonment in case of forced conversion for marriage. Several cases have already been registered in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, both ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Human right activists have spoken out against the laws, which they allege are persecuting minorities.”Interfaith marriages are as old as the institution of marriage. Love jihad is nothing but an anti-minority political idea to interfere in an individual’s life and choices. It can make people targets of vigilante groups,” said civil rights activist Sanam Sutirath Wazir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-plans-to-bring-national-anti-conversion-law-govt-101612289446965.html
03-02-2021||India||Government to sign ₹48,000 crore Tejas deal with HAL||The government will on Wednesday, the opening day of Aero India-2021, award Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) a ₹48,000-crore contract to supply 83 LCA (light combat aircraft) Mk-1A jets to the Indian Air Force, which is grappling with a shortage of fighter planes, officials familiar with the development said.India’s Cabinet Committee on Security, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on January 13 approved the proposal to buy the advanced Tejas jets, the biggest indigenous defence purchase so far, to bolster IAF’s combat potential.HAL chief R Madhavan said the first Mk-1A aircraft will be delivered to the air force in three years, with the rest being supplied by 2030. The deal involves the supply of 73 Mk-1A fighter jets and 10 LCA Mk-1 trainer aircraft.The state-owned aircraft maker is taking steps to accelerate deliveries of the fighter jet. On Tuesday, defence minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated HAL’s second LCA plant in the city to increase the yearly production rate of the fighter jet from eight to 16.'Message to world': Defence minister on HAL's new fighter jet production unit“HAL’s new LCA facility is an example of how Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India; a campaign of the government aimed at strengthening local manufacturing) is shaping [up], and HAL deserves the largest indigenous order of 83 LCA Mk-IA…The fighter is superior in many ways when compared to other fighters in its category besides being cost effective,” Singh said, on the eve of Asia’s biggest air show.The show is being held at the Yelahanka airbase from February 3 to 5. At least 600 exhibitors are taking part in the biennial show, including 78 foreign exhibitors.The deal for the 83 Mk-1A jets will take the total number of Tejas variants ordered to 123. The 40 LCAs already ordered by IAF are in the initial operational clearance (IOC) and the more advanced final operational clearance (FOC) configurations. The LCA Mk-1A will come with additional improvements over the FOC aircraft, making it the most advanced Tejas variant so far.The signing of the deal for 83 Tejas Mk-1A is an important event in Indian aviation, not so much because of the aircraft numbers and monies involved but because it is a renewal of faith in Indian R&D and manufacturing, said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.“HAL now has to perform since the stakes involved are very high -- IAF’s potency is dependent on it. HAL’s work culture and ethos have to turn a new leaf to ensure that aircraft production timelines are met in letter and spirit. Rigid adherence to quality in production and timely provisioning of spares would define successful contract implementation,” Bahadur said.The Mk-1A variant is expected to come with digital radar warning receivers, external self-protection jammer pods, active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, advanced beyond-visual-range (BVR) missiles and significantly improved maintainability. The fighter’s indigenous content is expected to be 60%, compared to 50% in the existing variants.The Mk-1A programme is expected to generate thousands of jobs and will involve the participation of more than 500 Indian companies.The project will involve infrastructure development by IAF to enable it to handle repairs and servicing at its base depots so that the turnaround time for mission critical systems is reduced, leading to increased availability of aircraft for operational exploitation.“Tejas is not only indigenous, but it is also better than its foreign equivalents on several parameters and also comparatively cheaper. Many countries have shown interest in Tejas…,” Singh said on Twitter.Exporting weapons and systems is a top priority for the government. On December 30, the Union Cabinet gave its go-ahead for the sale of Akash surface-to-air missile systems to friendly foreign countries and created a high-powered panel for swifter approval of exports of military hardware. India has set a target of clocking defence exports worth $5 billion by 2024.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-sign-48k-cr-tejas-deal-with-hal-101612289445706.html
03-02-2021||India||PM Modi to inaugurate Chauri Chaura event in UP tomorrow||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the Chauri Chaura centenary celebrations at Chauri Chaura in Uttar Pradesh on February 4 via video conferencing.The Uttar Pradesh government is preparing to create a world record during the Chauri Chaura centenary celebrations, when tens of thousands of children from all districts of the state will recite the Vande Mataram from 10am on February 3 to 12 noon on February 4.Around 50,000 students will recite the national song in a bid to enter the Guinness Book of World Records. Currently, this record is held by a gathering of 20,000 who sang it together, said Vinay Kumar Pandey, Uttar Pradesh’s director of secondary education.The most people singing live on a radio broadcast is 10,793, achieved by Jingying Group (China) in Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China, on 1 October 2018, said Amit Kumar Agnihotri, assistant director of the UP cultural directorate.“The state government has set a target of 50,000 to be on the safer side to avoid any last-minute glitch,” he said.Also read: Self-reliance is at the heart of budget exercise, says PM ModiFebruary 4 marks the centenary of a landmark event in the freedom struggle that took place at Chauri Chaura village in Gorakhpur district of Uttar Pradesh, known as United Province in British India, when a large group of protesters participating in Mahatma Gandhi’s non-cooperation movement clashed with the police, who opened fire. In retaliation, the protestors set fire to a police station. The incident left three civilians and 22 policemen dead. Days later, a saddened Gandhi halted the non-cooperation movement.As part of their preparations for the centenary, thousands of students are making videos of themselves singing the first stanza of Vande Mataram, with a hand raised in salute. They are required to send these clips to their schools, after which these videos will be uploaded on a link that will be opened by the Guinness Book of World Records.Aradhya Singh of Class 11 at City Montessori School (CMS, Aliganj campus 1) was among the first to send a clip of her video. Principal Jyoti Kashyap said it was sent to other students to replicate. A large number of students from all CMS campuses will recite Vande Mataram on Chauri Chaura Diwas, said Jagdish Gandhi, CMS founder.“The Guinness world record team will share a link at 10am on February 3 for the schools to upload all videos by February 4 till 12 noon.

03-02-2021||India||No J&K MPs in RS after Feb 15 as four members’ terms end||The Rajya Sabha will have no representatives from Jammu and Kashmir by the middle of February, when the four Upper House member from the Union territory (UT) carved out of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019 complete their stints.Because the UT does not have an elected assembly at present, there will be no representatives in the upper chamber of Parliament until elections are held in J&K. Members of the Rajya Sabha are chosen by an electoral college of state legislators with a system of proportional representation through a single transferable vote.The election itself will be held after the delimitation exercise to redraw the boundaries of the electoral constituencies is completed. According to people aware of the details, the delimitation process is expected to be completed by March.Also read: House stalled as Opposition parties demands farm debateIn August 2019, the Centre pushed through constitutional changes divesting the erstwhile state of its special status under Article 370 of the Constitution and bifurcating it into two UTs -- J&K and Ladakh.Two MPs from the People’s Democratic Party, Nazir Ahmed Laway and Mir Mohammed Fayaz, will see their terms end on February 10 and 15 respectively. Congress leader and leader of the opposition in the House Ghulam Nabi Azad will see his end on February 15 and the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Shamsher Singh Manhas, on February 10. While Azad has been a member of the Upper House for five terms since 1996, Laway, Mir and Manhas are first time MPs.To be sure, this is not the first time that the Upper House will be without any representative from J&K. Between 1991 and 1996, when the state had no assembly, there were no MPs from J&K in the Upper House for the duration between April 1994 and October 1996.Former CM and PDP leader Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, who was then with the Congress, was a member of the Upper House from 1986 to 1992; his party colleagues Rajendra Prasad Jain and Dharam Pal retired in 1994. Ghulam Rasool Mattoo, an independent, was a member of the House from 1988 to 1994 Shabir Ahmad Salaria of the National Conference retired in 1992.After elections were held in 1996, Saifuddin Soz, Sharifuddin Shariq, Ghulam Nabi Azad and Karan Singh were elected to the Upper House.“This has happened before when assembly elections were not held in 1991. But now the process of delimitation is underway and once that is completed we are hopeful that assembly elections will be held and the due processes will be followed,” Laway said.Constitutional expert and former Lok Sabha secretary general secretary PDT Achary said: “Ideally, such a situation should not have arisen, but because of the circumstances, the House will go without representation from the UT. Since the process of delimitation and holding polls to elect a new assembly has not been carried out, this is fait accompli,” he said.After the state lost its special status, the UT of J&K was to have its own elected assembly; Ladakh was designated as a UT without an assembly. The Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019Act also called for the setting up of a delimitation commission to redraw the boundaries of the electoral constituencies of J&K.The delimitation commission headed by former Supreme Court judge Ranjana Desai was notified in March 2020 and was given a year until March 2021 to draw up the new constituencies.The last delimitation exercise was carried out in J&K in 1995. In 2002, the J&K assembly passed a law putting a freeze on fresh delimitation of seats until 2026.“Work to complete the process of delimitation is underway. There were some delays because of the corona pandemic, but work has resumed and the process is expected to be complete by March 2021,” said an official aware of the details, who requested anonymity.According to the Act, the number of seats in the assembly will increase from 107 to 114. The 24 seats that are reserved in the J&K Assembly for areas under Pakistan’s occupation will remain untouched and due reservation will be given to representatives from the schedule castes and schedule tribes.There is also speculation that more seats are likely to be added to the Jammu division.In his Independence Day address last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that elections will be held in Jammu and Kashmir after the delimitation process is completed.“The delimitation exercise is going on in Jammu and Kashmir under the chairmanship of a retired Supreme Court judge. As soon as the delimitation process is over, there will be elections in the future so that the Union Territory has its own government, which will undertake development work with renewed vigour,” Modi said.In the Lok Sabha, there are five representatives from Jammu and Kashmir, which includes two BJP MPs from Jammu, minister of state in the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) Jitendra Singh and Jugal Kishore Sharma; and three MPs from Kashmir, National Conference’s Farooq Abdullah, Mohammad Akbar Lone and Hasnain Masoodi. Ladakh, which was a part of the erstwhile state and is now a separate Union Territory, is represented by BJP MP Jamyang Tsering Namgayal.Ends||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-j-k-mps-in-rs-after-feb-15-as-four-members-terms-end-101612289146049.html
