DGP Singh made these revelations in a news conference over the arrest of self-styled chief commanders Hidayatullah Malik and Zahoor Ahmad Rather, respectively of terror outfits Lashkar-e-Mustafa (LeM) and The Resistance Front (TRF).Malik was arrested on February 6 by the Anantnag police from Kunjwani in Jammu district while Rather was apprehended on February 13 from Bari Brahmana area of Samba district.The UT’s police chief said these two groups, LeM and TRF, are frontal organisations of Pakistan-based JeM and Lashker-e-Toiba (LeT) to give “Kashmiri name' to their terror activities. “Malik has been leading LeM floated last August although he had been an active militant for a long time. He had worked as an overground worker and floated the group on the directions of JeM,” said Singh.Malik was also planning to set up a base in Jammu to carry forward terror activities in the region besides receiving arms and ammunition, being smuggled from Pakistan through underground tunnels on the border or being dropped by drones before being smuggled to Kashmir, he said. Singh said JeM was involved in various terror activities in 2018 and Malik’s interrogation revealed that he was also a close associate of JeM commander Ashiq Nengroo who used to receive arms consignments from Pakistan in Jammu before escaping to the neighbouring country along with his family through an underground tunnel on the international border.The BSF has detected six underground tunnels along the IB in Jammu region over the past six months. After escaping to Pakistan, Nengroo alias doctor has been directing terror activities in Kashmir at the behest of Pakistani agencies, said the DGP, adding that Malik visited Delhi on Nengroo’s orders and forwarded him a video the NSA's office after recceing it, said the DGP.That means JeM is planning attacks on targets in Delhi as well, he said, adding Malik’s arrest is a big breakthrough for police as it has exposed the terrorist group’s plan.Malik, a resident of south Kashmir, had also set up a network to get weapons from Bihar and soured seven pistols from there till now and got them distributed among militants, the DGP said.“He had also roped in some students from Kashmir, studying in Punjab, and had been using them for any action in Kashmir or Jammu or transporting weapons from outside,” said Singh.In this context, the DGP also cited the example of a Kashmir-based nursing student in Chandigarh college who was arrested along with a seven-kg improvised explosive device from Jammu’s general bus stand area.The DGP said Malik was also involved in looting of ₹60 lakh from a bank’s cash van last November.This was established after the arrest of his four accomplices, including his wife, in this crime, he added.Terming TRF chief Rather’s arrest as another “major achievement”, Singh said he is a Pakistan-trained terrorist and is known by aliases “Sahil” and “Khalid” among militants. “He was also an active overground worker before crossing into Pakistan in 2002, where he underwent arms training and returned with five foreign terrorists through Rajouri route,” DGP Singh said “He, however, had surrendered in 2006 and remained inactive before resuming his activities in 2019,” the police chief said, adding his handlers in Pakistan know his potential and that is why made him the TRF’s chief. The DGP said he had set up a vast network in Kashmir and so far eight members of the group have been identified at his disclosure and some have also been arrested whose interrogation is on in Kashmir. Being a terrorist, who had surrendered earlier, helped Rather escape security agencies’ suspicion, said the DGP, adding the TRF chief was directly involved in the killing of three BJP workers in Kulgam and a policeman in Kokernag areas of south Kashmir last year.Rather is being questioned at present and his interrogation is likely to reveal new things, the DGP said.The Union Territory’s police chief also complimented his men for three major successful operations which led to the arrest of two self-styled commanders and recovery of IED to avert a major tragedy besides attempts by Pakistan to revive Al-Badr group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jem-planned-terror-attacks-in-delhi-says-j-k-dgp-101613323597867.html

Only those outside containment zones will be allowed to open up, it further mentioned.The guidelines said that mandatory hand hygiene and thermal screening should be ensured at the entrance and only asymptomatic staff and visitors should be allowed entry.The ministry further said that these measures need to be observed by all employees and visitors at all times. These include maintaining a minimum distance of 6 feet in common places, use of face covers or masks at all times and practising frequent hand washing.Meetings, as far as feasible should be done through video conferencing, it added.In case any covid case is reported despite taking the appropriate action, the management has to place the ill person in a room or area where they are isolated from others at the workplace, the guidelines mentioned"A risk assessment will be undertaken by the designated public health authority and accordingly further advice shall be made regarding the management of the case, his/her contacts and need for disinfection.

Here’s what you need to know||As India’s coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases are declining consistently and people are slowly transitioning from ‘work from home’ (WFH) to reporting to their offices, the Union ministry of health (MoHFW) has issued fresh guidelines for workplaces.The MoHFW said that offices could resume work after a disinfection process is carried out, in case infections were reported in the workplace. They would not be required to close or seal the premises if the disinfection is carried out properly, the ministry added.Listing out the guidelines, the ministry highlighted offices with relatively closer settings with shared spaces and the virus could spread faster. Therefore, there was a need to prevent the spread and respond “in a timely and effective manner in case suspect cases of Covid-19 is detected in these settings, so as to limit the spread of infection,” it said.Here is a look at the guidelines offices will be required to follow as they resume work:1. If an office premise records one or two coronavirus disease cases, then the disinfection process will be only limited to the areas or spots occupied by the infected person in the last 48 hours and work can restart post disinfection.2. In case the workplace is witnessing a greater number of infections, the whole block or building should be disinfected.3. Offices located in containment zones will remain closed except for any essential or medical services, the ministry said adding that only those outside such zones will be allowed to open.4. Compulsory thermal screening and sanitisation should be ensured at the entrance of the office and entry should only be permitted for asymptomatic staff and visitors.5.

He did not use the word house-arrest. They didn’t trouble me but it was curtailing my movement. When I went for my morning walk at 7 on Sunday, the two cops followed me.”The policemen left by noon, he said. PM Modi arrived in Chennai at 11 am to inaugurate a slew of infrastructure projects and left for Kochi from the city.Balakrishnan said that he was in discussion with his associates about agitation in Chennai and had approached the commissioner’s office for permission which was denied and they had dropped their plans for other reasons. “We have a cordial relationship with the commissioner’ office," said Balakrishnan. “This seems pre-emptive and this usually doesn’t happen in Tamil Nadu.”A senior official belonging to the Pazhavanthangal police station, that covers the limit of Balakrishnan’s home, said, “I received instructions from higher officials to keep a watch on him.” The official did not wish to be named. “We didn’t ask for any reasons but we got to know that he may plan some agitation when the Prime Minister is visiting.”When asked about the incident, commissioner of police Mahesh Agarwal said that he wasn’t aware of it and his office hadn’t sent any instruction to keep him under vigil.During the prime minister's previous visits to Tamil Nadu in 2018 and 2019, several groups protested waving black flags led by pro-Tamil parties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cops-keep-vigil-on-aikscc-tn-unit-head-during-pm-modi-s-chennai-visit-101613318297738.html
14-02-2021||India||PM Modi has no time for farmers, 'hopping' to poll-bound states, says D Raja||CPI National General Secretary D Raja on Sunday slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi of "hopping" to poll-bound states,but not finding time to meet representatives of farmers who have been agitating for over two months, demanding repeal of the three contentious agri laws. The attack against Modi came on a day when he was in the city for inaugurating a slew of development projects,including the ₹6000 crore petrochemical complex of oil major Bharat Petroleum,hours after his visit to Tamil Nadu for inaugurating the Chennai Metro Rail phase-I extension and laying the foundation stones of various other schemes. Raja also attacked the opposition Congress led UDF for raking up the Sabarimala women's entry issue ahead of the assembly polls, due to be held in April-May. Addressing CPI(M)-LDF workers here after inaugurating the southern leg of the left rally, being led by CPI leader Binoy Vishwam, Raja said the Prime Minister was in Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Assam and in Kerala. "Why is the PM hopping allover to states where elections are due?.... But Modi has no time to address farmers' concerns and has not met their representatives so far," he said. Lakhs of farmers have been staying put on the Delhi borders for over two months, demanding repeal of the three contentious farm laws, which, he said, are not in the interest of the country or the farmers. The states had not been consulted and this was an attack on the federal structure, he said. "Modiji aap kya Kisan ke sath hain?" (Modiji are you with the farmers?), he asked. Farmers create wealth and they should be protected. "Modi protects crony capitalists and he thinks serving their interests is serving the country", he alleged. The BJP and UDF cannot "hoodwink" people by raising religious issues, he said. "The Sabarimala issue is before the Supreme court. Let thecourt give its verdict. The LDF government will act appropriately. Politics and religion should remain separate. Why is UDF making it an election issue?, he asked. Kerala should emerge as a role model of the country to fight communal elements and corporates, he said. Hitting out at the BJP-RSS combine for posing a "grave threat" to the constitution of the country, he alleged that they have "unleashed aggressive campaigns against minorities, dalits adivasis We are seeing this from Karnataka to Uttar Pradesh". The Prime minister also came under attack for privatising public sector companies, which, Raja said, was the 'backbone' of the country's economy. He said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had stood up against the Centre over the privatisation of airports. "But the Modi government is determined to hand over airports and Air India and ports to private players,"Raja said. The CM had on Saturday inaugurated the northern part of the rally, being led by LDF convenorA Vijayaraghavan, at Kasaragod district. Vijayan had lashed out at the Opposition Congress and BJP, saying both the parties lost their moorings in Kerala and that the people were looking forward to the continuation of Left rule in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-has-no-time-for-farmers-hopping-to-poll-bound-states-says-d-raja-101613318030717.html

That is why the traffic on road during convoy movement is controlled, convoy limit has also been contained,” he said.Adil Dar, a resident of Pulwama, had blown himself up when he rammed an explosive-laden car into the CRPF convoy at Lethpora Pulwama killing 40 personnel. Terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed had claimed responsibility for the suicide attack prompting the security forces to launch rigorous operations against militants in Kashmir.The attack had brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war.Ratan said that a lot of movement of jawans now happens by air courier service. “Mostly the movement of ‘stores’ happens through convoys. Enough precautions are being taken on roads, bunkers have been installed and deployment has been made so that such an incident does not happen again, its possibility has been minimized,” he said.The forces are also making use of modern technology. “CCTVs have been installed at many points on the highway, drones are also being used. The movement of our vehicles generally takes places in bulletproof bunkers. Enough precautions, as well as equipment, have been installed to avoid such type of an incident,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/many-changes-made-after-pulwama-attack-inspector-general-crpf-101613316290603.html

Booths were captured in Mukatsar, Rajpura, Samana, Sultanpur Lodhi, Dinanagar, Ferozepur, Bhikiwind."An FIR was registered against Gauravdeep Singh Valtoha, son of senior SAD leader Virsa Singh Valtoha, and five others," Cheema said.Similarly, police raided the house of SAD candidates, Jaswinder Kaur, in ward number 26 in Khanna and registered a case against 13 members of the family including her husband. He said that same was done with Tej Chand Batra, the SAD candidate from ward number 18 in Mukatsar who was booked in an abduction case, as per the statement.The SAD leader also added that Congress goons openly tossed turbans of SAD workers and let loose a reign of terror but cases were registered against the victims. The police also opposed permission for videography in polling booths and no one was allowed to depute videography teams."The SEC also failed to ensure videography at sensitive places which resulted in large scale booth capturing," the leader alleged.The Congress party had repeated what it had done in the Zila Parishad and Panchayat Samiti elections because it knew it had lost the confidence of the people after failing to fulfill any of the promises made to them. The party was even jitterier in the municipal elections because it knew that all facilities were in shambles and people were suffering due to a thirty per cent increase in power tariff and other taxes, he added.Cheema said that the SAD had filed a complaint with all details with SEC and had demanded countermanding of elections at all places where there had been large scale booth capturing and violent incidents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-sad-accuses-cong-of-misusing-civil-police-machinery-in-civic-body-polls-101613312373664.html

Recently we had requested the state government to extend ₹113.47 crore financial assistance to make payment for the outstanding bills of PGCIL and to reinstate the letters of credit with central generating stations."Deliberations are going on at the highest levels of the government," the MeECL said in a statement.The MeECL was forced to regulate about 70MW of energy and the PGCIL wanted a firm commitment on payment of 50 per cent of dues in one week and a definite timeline for the remaining 50 per cent, it added.The state government has availed a loan of ₹1,345 crore under #AatmanirbharBharat from the Centre to clear all outstanding power purchase dues of the MeECL."The loan under the special package given by the Prime Minister will be disbursed to all gencos and transcos which include NEEPCO, OTPC, NHPC and PGCIL. We expect that we will be able to end all our liabilities to the generating companies and transmission companies soon," state's Power Minister James Sangma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/7hour-daily-load-shedding-begins-in-meghalaya-due-to-power-purchase-dues-101613311223802.html

Five of the bodies were pulled out from the 1.7km long main tunnel of NTPC's hydel power project and seven others were recovered from various places.  Scientists have said that the flash flood in Chamoli was triggered by what could have been a large avalanche of glacier ice, which sent water, rocks and debris down the Dhauliganga river valley.Here what we know seven days after the disaster:1. Officials said the five bodies were recovered after the rescue workers cleared the muck inside the tunnel of the Tapovan Vishnugad Hydropower Plant at a distance of about 130 metres. They were among the 35 workers trapped inside the tunnel including about 30 workers trapped in another smaller underground tunnel beneath the main one.  2. "In the morning two bodies were first recovered inside the tunnel after clearing the muck at a distance of about 125-130 metres. Following that, three more bodies were recovered till Sunday afternoon,” Swati S Bhadauria, Chamoli’s district magistrate, said. 3. "The administration has kept seven ambulances and a chopper on standby in case any of the workers is found alive from the tunnel,” Bhadauria said. 4.

Therefore, we were on a high alert." Inspector General of Police (Jammu zone) Mukesh Singh told reporters.Two years ago on this day, a Jaish-e-Mohammad suicide bomber rammed his explosive-laden car into a CRPF convoy in Pulwama killing 40 troopers.“Late Saturday our patrol nabbed a man from the bus stand area with a bag and recovered a 6.5 kg IED from it,” Singh said.Earlier in the day, a police officer had said that the IED was recovered on Sunday.The terrorist, a student of a nursing college in Chandigarh, has been identified as Suhail Bashir of Pulwama.The IGP said that during questioning Suhail divulged that handlers of al-Badr in Pakistan had given him the task to plant a powerful IED in any of the three to four areas of Jammu city."Raghunath Temple, Jammu railway station, general bus stand and Lakhdatta Bazaar (jewellers' market) were the targets," the IGP said.After planting the IED he had to take a flight to Srinagar where a top over ground worker of al-Badr, Athar Shakeel Khan had to receive him and induct him as an active member of al-Badr, the officer said.The IGP said that two more men - Qazi Waseem from Chandigarh and Abid Nabi - who had the information about the plan to plant the IED, have also been arrested."Had the IED exploded, it would have caused mass destruction," he said.Director General of Police Dilbag Singh said that police in recent times also arrested Hidayatullah Malik and Zahoor Ahmad Rather, self-styled chief Lashkar-e-Mustafa, an offshoot of Jaish-e-Mohammad and The Resistance Front, an offshoot of Lashkar-e-Taiba from Jammu."Their arrest, recovery of IED and arrest of al-Badr militant are three big achievements of Anantnag, Jammu and Samba police,” he said.The DGP also said that another terrorist Ashiq Nengroo, who used to transport terrorists to Kashmir after receiving them on the international border in Jammu through tunnels and intrusions, escaped to Pakistan with his family via one such tunnel in December 2019 and has been given the task to fuel terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir.The IED recovery comes close on the heels of the arrest of two top terrorists from Kunjwani in Jammu and Bari Brahmana area of Samba districts.Zahoor Ahmad Rather, a top terrorist affiliated with The Resistance Front (TRF) who was wanted in connection with the killing of three BJP workers and a policeman in south Kashmir last year, was arrested in Bari Brahmana area of Samba on Saturday.Earlier on February 6, self-styled commander of the Lashkar-e-Mustafa (LeM), Hidayatullah Malik, alias "Hasnain", was held from the Kunjwani area of Jammu."Obviously there are now attempts by Pakistan and various terror outfits to create disturbance in Jammu region", said a senior police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-police-foil-major-terror-plot-in-jammu-seize-ied-from-al-badr-man-101613309157211.html

14-02-2021||India||Peter Mukerjea pens memoir, says not a set of 'kiss-and-tell' stories||Beleaguered media baron Peter Mukerjea has come out with his memoir, which he says is just a personal recollection of his experiences in the satellite television industry in India and is neither intended to open a can of worms nor is a set of kiss-and-tell stories."It is intended purely to share my journey, to highlight and showcase the plenty of mistakes made and the plenty of lessons learnt over almost three decades," says the former chief executive of Star India, who was media mogul Rupert Murdoch's right-hand man once in the television industry of the region."Starstruck: Confessions of a TV Executive" is the story of the Indian television industry, authored by the man who was at the forefront of it all."This book is a memoir. No more than that. It is a personal recollection of my experiences at the coalface in the formative years of the satellite television industry in India and a super-fast-changing media landscape. This is not intended to open a can of worms, nor is it a set of kiss-and-tell stories," Mukerjea says."It is intended purely to share my journey, to highlight and showcase the plenty of mistakes made and the plenty of lessons learnt over almost three decades," he writes.The early '90s marked an age of American TV dominating the world, from "Baywatch" to "Cheers" to "The Jerry Springer Show". Only that approach wasn't working so well in India, where access to one billion TV viewers was dominated by a powerful terrestrial network.Sensing a once-in-a-generation opportunity, Murdoch gave Mukerjea a seemingly impossible task - to grow a tiny foreign-owned TV channel in India into one of the biggest in the world. Mukerjea was instrumental in transforming a loss-making Star TV into a billion-dollar network.According to Mukerjea, neither Star founder Richard Li nor Murdoch had considered India to be a worthy market for their business model."The adoption of India as a key market was a completely new element and fell into their laps by default… The Indian consumer was changing rapidly and television was one of the main catalysts of this change. Ready access to a television and an international standard of content meant consumers were glued to their sets," he writes.The book, published by Westland, also talks in detail how Amitabh Bachchan was hired as a host for "Kaun Banega Crorepati".The author says that KBC was originally conceived as Kaun Banega Lakhpati with a prize of ₹one lakh. But Murdoch believed that the prize money was way too little to trigger any interest from viewers. Murdoch, who was in India that time, then decided to increase the prize to ₹one crore."Had Rupert not been in town that week and turned KBL into KBC, I doubt if Star TV would have been able to make a go of it in India," Mukerjea says."Amitabh would rise from the ashes like the proverbial phoenix and Star TV would propel itself off the back of KBC to heights that the television industry in India had never seen," he goes on to say about the deal.Soon, everyone at Star "focussed their attention on KBC and used it like a battering ram to knock a hole through their competitors' doors"."We had helped recreate and revive the legend of Amitabh Bachchan, and in turn he had carried Star Plus on his back, turning it into the most watched, most discussed and most profitable television channel in the country," says Mukerjea.He also writes about how Star roped in Ekta Kapoor and how her "soaps were able to touch on sensitive issues that Indian television shows either avoided or swept under the carpet".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/peter-mukerjea-pens-memoir-says-not-a-set-of-kiss-and-tell-stories-101613296055126.html
14-02-2021||India||Premium petrol price crosses ₹100 mark in 3 Rajasthan districts||Premium petrol price crossed ₹100 mark in three districts of Rajasthan on Sunday riding on the sixth consecutive day of rise in fuel prices in the backdrop of a political blame game between the BJP and the Congress over fixing responsibility for the continued hike, which is likely to impact millions of consumers with a likely rise in prices of vegetables and fast moving consumer goods (FMCG).Premium petrol was selling at ₹102.07 per litre in Sri Ganganagar district, the highest rate in the state, followed by Hanumangarh – ₹101.42, Bikaner- ₹100.24 and Barmer- ₹99.43. In capital Jaipur, the price of premium petrol was ₹97.95.Both the Centre and the state governments have blamed each other for levying steep taxes on fuel prices.“While the Indian government is trying its best to reduce the prices of petrol, the Ashok Gehlot government in the state has enough allocations to reduce fuel prices. It depends on him how much he wants to ease the load on people,” said Union minister Smriti Irani, during a press conference at the BJP headquarters in Jaipur on February 7.The Rajasthan government late last month cut the value added tax (VAT) on petrol and diesel by 2% after the price of premium petrol crossed ₹100/litre-mark in Sri Ganganagar district. Despite this, the state has the highest VAT at 36% plus ₹1,500 per kilolitre road cess on petrol. On diesel, the state levies 26% VAT and ₹1,750 per kilolitre road cess.Prices of petrol and diesel across the country are market-determined and attract uniform central excise duty, but their prices differ from state to state because of the wide variations in the local levies or value-added tax. The Central government levies ₹32.98 per litre of excise duty on petrol and ₹31.83 a litre on diesel. Central and state taxes make up for over 61 per cent of the retail selling price of petrol and about 56 per cent of diesel.The international oil prices touched USD 61 per barrel for the first time in more than a year on improving demand and hope amid the global rollout of Covid-19 vaccines further sending the fuel prices through the roof.However, Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan last week told Parliament that the government is not considering a reduction in excise duty to cool rates from their record highs.The Ashok Gehlot government stated last month that it had decided to cut down VAT rates on fuel to ease the burden on consumers despite it hitting the state revenues.“With the reduction in VAT rates, the government’s revenue will reduce by approximately ₹1000 crore annually,” a statement from CM’s office said on January 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/premium-petrol-price-crosses-rs-100-mark-in-3-rajasthan-districts-101613296075834.html

14-02-2021||India||Union minister cautions Odisha over AP holding rural polls in state territory||A day after neighbouring Andhra Pradesh conducted rural polls in some villages under Odisha territory, Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan Sunday expressed concern over the matter and cautioned the state government that situation may aggravate if required pre-emptive measures were not taken to resolve the inter-state dispute. Pradhan in a statement said that though the Odisha government has taken legal recourse to resolve the border discord, it should be taken to a conclusive end. "We may encounter more worse situations if timely measures are not taken at proper time," he said, adding the AP holding panchayat polls in the border villages by including people of Koraput, Ganjam and Gajapati, has certainly created bitterness between the two states. Ignoring opposition from Odisha government, Andhra Pradesh on Saturday conducted gram panchayat polls in Kotia area of Koraput district, the region on which both the states have been staking their claim. Even though district magistrate of Koraput Abdaal Akhtar had written a letter to his Vizianagaram counterpart requesting not to hold elections in the disputed Kotia region as the matter is sub-judice in the Supreme Court, the Andhra government set up polling booth at Potu Senari and voting was held under a thick security cover. The Odisha government had approached the Supreme Court against Andhra Pradesh for holding panchayat polls in Kotia and the Apex Court had on Friday served notice to the Andhra government and posted the case for February 19. Pradhan, who hails from Odisha, said the state government should give utmost priority to the border villages by implementing welfare schemes. "It is our responsibility to protect the boundary of our state and ensure that our brothers and sisters living in the border villages avail all the benefits of the welfare schemes of the state government," Pradhan said. He also urged Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik to seriously take up the matter and do the needful at the earliest before it is too late. The Union Petroleum minister pointed out that the border disputes with Andhra Pradesh or any other state, many times generate hostilities which should not happen at all. He said all political parties, social organisations and individuals should put their best efforts to keep Odishas boundary intact. "A collective effort is required for maintaining the states territory and resolves the border disputes with other states," Pradhan said. The issue has sparked a political row in the eastern state with opposition BJP and Congress accusing the BJD government of failing to protect the states territory. Congress had on Saturday criticised the states BJD government, saying the chief ministers incompetence led to Andhra Pradesh holding polls in the Odisha territory. The state BJP president Samir Mohanty also came down heavily on the state BJD government, accusing it of not being able to protect the state's territory. He said BJP will soon set up a border security cell to look after the grievances of the people living in the bordering areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-minister-cautions-odisha-over-ap-holding-rural-polls-in-state-territory-101613295608299.html

Seventy children died in the age group of 14-18 years.A total of 624 people died in the age bracket of 18-30 years and 550 people died in the age group of 45-60 years due to drug overdose, the data said.In the age group of 60 and above, 241 people died, it added.To tackle substance abuse, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment recently launched the ‘Nasha Mukht Bharat Abhiyan’ (NMBA) for 272 most-affected districts. The scheme employs a three-pronged approach -- combining efforts of the narcotics bureau, outreach and awareness by social justice and treatment through health department.A senior official said the NMBA will be further strengthened and continued under the National Action Plan for Drug Demand Reduction (NAPDDR), under which 13,000 youth volunteers in 272 districts will be trained as community mobilisers against drug abuse.He said around 11.80 lakh people would be benefited under the NAPDDR in the financial year 2021-22.Experts say to tackle the issue of substance abuse the government should be looking into long-term intensive treatment and rehabilitation.Loon Gangte, regional coordinator for South Asia at the International Treatment Preparedness Coalition, said employment opportunities must be provided after rehabilitation."It needs to be ensured what happens after rehab rehabilitation. Rehabilitation is the easy path. After rehabilitation, about 80-90 per cent fall back into addiction so there needs to be a plan for it. The government should think beyond rehabilitation. Affected people must be provided employment too which will help in keeping them occupied," Gangte said.Akhila Sivadas, executive director at the Centre for Advocacy and Research, a non-profit organisation, said to prevent deaths caused by drug overdose, there must intensive treatment including long-term treatment using state of art regimens and methods for those who are into substance usage."This issue requires both investment and political will," she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-2-300-people-died-of-drug-overdose-from-2017-19-highest-fatalities-in-30-45-year-age-group-data-101613294108240.html

Antony, a former defence minister, also said the increase in the allocation to the defence sector is meagre and a “betrayal of the country” even as India is facing multiple challenges at borders."For the first time, India is facing two front war-like situation- one from Pakistan and now China becoming more belligerent by building infrastructure and military mobilisation across India-China border mainly from eastern Ladakh, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim. The Narendra Modi government is not giving proper priority to national security,” Antony said during a press briefing.Also watch: Ex-defence minister slams troops disengagement in Ladakh﻿﻿The Congress leader’s comments come days after defence minister Rajnath Singh announced the disengagement agreement on the north and west bank of Pangong Lake in Ladakh with China. "The agreement that we have been able to reach with the Chinese side for disengagement in the Pangong lake area envisages that both sides will cease their forward deployments in a phased, coordinated and verified manner. The Chinese side will keep its troop presence in the North Bank area to the east of Finger 8. Reciprocally, the Indian troops will be based at their permanent base at Dhan Singh Thapa Post near Finger 3," the defence minister had said in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday.Also read | Disengagement to be completed by next Fri; PLA forces move beyond Finger 8Antony said that this disengagement at Galwan Valley, Pangong Tso and buffer zone creation is a surrender and added that the government must support our armed forces at a time when India is facing two-front war-like situation at borders. "The entire India-China border needs 24 hours attention. Our armed forces are ready, but they need the support of the nation and the government. Chinese are modernising the army, building the infrastructure and consolidating their positions. We also need matching support to the armed forces,” he said.The former defence minister said that disengagement was good as it reduced tension but it should not be done at the cost of national security. “Both disengagements in Galwan and Pangong Tso are a surrender. We are surrendering our rights," he alleged, adding that it amounted to surrendering of areas traditionally controlled by India and added that Galwan Valley was never a disputed land even in 1962.Also read | China’s actions along LAC led to distrust, confrontation: Army chiefAntony also slammed the Union Budget, under which finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman envisaged an outlay of ₹30,42,230 crore, out of which ₹3,37,553 crore was allocated for the defence, excluding pension. "When India is facing a war-like situation, when Chinese are everywhere at the border, everyone expected a substantial increase in the defence budget. Our armed forces demanded an increase both in the capital and revenue expenditure. The government is showing so much bravado, but practically, there is a 1.48 per cent increase, compared to the revised budget last year,” he pointed out.The Congress leader also warned that China can “play mischief” anytime by helping Pakistan in the Siachen area. “We want to know from this government when there will be status quo ante as on mid-April 2020 in the entire India-China border," he said.Antony also said that the government must take the country and the people into confidence on the restoration of status quo ante at the borders. He said the government always consulted leaders of all political parties before taking such a decision and must keep national security in mind.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/surrender-to-china-antony-on-disengagement-in-areas-of-eastern-ladakh-101613293903074.html

Our target is to defeat the BJP," he said.Sisodia said people of Gujarat are comparing the 25- year-old rule of the BJP in the state's local bodies to the five-year rule of the AAP in Delhi and they can "clearly see a difference".He said people can see how in just a short period of five years, Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal ensured government schools are developed in a such a way that they can compete with private schools.On the other hand, in Gujarat, government schools are being shut down, he claimed."If private schools in Delhi can be stopped from raising fees in an arbitrary manner, then why can't the BJP do the same in Gujarat?" he sought to know."If in just five years, government hospitals in Delhi can be turned fabulous, then why are hospitals in Surat, Ahmedabad, Rajkot in shambles?" he further asked.Sisodia said if the Kejriwal government in Delhi can ensure free electricity to 70 per cent citizens and free drinking water to them, then why can't the same be done in Gujarat."We hope that very soon, the BJP will start getting defeated," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-fights-polls-to-help-bjp-win-alleges-aap-s-manish-sisodia-101613290402346.html

14-02-2021||India||Chhattisgarh: Maoists ‘threaten' scribes, activists for alleged corporate links||Maoists in Chhattisgarh have allegedly issued a threat to five people, including journalists, accusing them of pro-corporate and pro-government activities. The state police, which are yet to establish the veracity of the threat, have cited it as another evidence of Maoists growing ‘frustration’ in the region.The threat, issued on February 9, went viral on social media on Saturday.The press note, titled “Patrkaar Evam Samaj Sevak Ke Aad Mein Corporate Gharano Kee Seva Mein Lage Farukh Ali Dalali Harqaton kee Ninda Karo...”, called for condemnation of ‘persons like Farukh Ali’ who, the press note alleged, were ‘serving the corporate families in the name of journalism and activism.’“The corrupt and agents of corporate will surely be punished in the janadalat ( kangaroo court)..,” claimed the press statement, purportedly issued by the southern sub-zonal bureau of outlawed Communist Party of India (Maoist).The note named former BBC journalist Shubhranshu Choudhary, journalists Ganesh Mishra and Leeladhar Rathi, anti-Maoists campaigners Farukh Ali and P Vijay as ‘corporate and government agents’.“I have been continuously speaking against the violence by the Maoists in the Bastar region and their threats are not surprising to me. I condemn the allegations made against me and other journalists,” said Ali.Meanwhile, inspector general of police (Bastar) Sundarraj P said that police are still confirming the authenticity of the press statement.“We are yet to ascertain the authenticity of the press statement issued by the Maoists. If it is true, then it reflects the growing frustration and madness in the Maoist ranks,” said the IG.Sunderaj further claimed that Maoists were rattled after losing ground, drying up recruits and disaffection in the public in recent times and were thoroughly confused.“The Maoists have fallen prey to the typical ‘if you are not my friend then you are my enemy’ syndrome. This thought and behaviour of the Maoist leadership would prove to be the final nail in their coffin,” said the IG.Ganesh Mishra, a journalist based in Bijapur said that he was hurt after being accused of supporting big businesses and the government.“I have always worked for the people of Bastar. I don’t know why Maoists have accused me of supporting corporate firms, but I am deeply hurt,” said Mishra.“I think this is the sixth press note threatening me in the last few years. I will request them (Maoists) to ponder on the mess they have created in an effort to create a better world and think how we can work together to solve some of the problems they correctly raise in each press note,” said Chaudhary.In December 2020, Maoists had purportedly issued threats to woman journalist Pushpa Rokde accusing her of being a police informer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-maoists-threaten-scribes-activists-for-alleged-corporate-links-101613287851136.html

He also said the orders for idols are less this year."Every year Saraswati Puja was widely performed in educational institutions and neighbourhoods. But in the wake of the coronavirus infection, the festivities have been curtailed," he added.Saraswati Puja is a prominent Hindu festival that marks the arrival of the spring season as per the Hindu calendar. The day is celebrated every year on the fifth day of the month of Magh as per the lunar calendar.There is a tradition of worshipping Goddess Saraswati, who is considered as the deity of wisdom, intellect and learning. It is also a day when many toddlers step into the world of formal education. Many parents enrol their students to school on the day, where they seek Goddess Saraswati's blessings in their pursuit of knowledge, art, music and culture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-artisans-hope-for-better-business-in-saraswati-puja-amid-ongoing-pandemic-101613281819162.html

Anyway, I offer my deepest condolences to all those who died."The Haryana minister said, “The common farmer is naive, some joined (the protests) due to sympathy, some due to community or for some other reason.”आंदोलन में संघर्षरत अन्नदाताओं के लिए इन शब्दों का प्रयोग एक संवेदनहीन और संस्कारहीन व्यक्ति ही कर सकता है।शर्म, मगर इनको आती नहीं।पहले किसानों को पाकिस्तान व चीन समर्थक बताने वाले हरियाणा के कृषि मंत्री जेपी दलाल को कैबिनेट से बर्खास्त किया जाना चाहिए।#Farmers_Lives_Matter pic.twitter.com/la71GiA7ivAs the video went viral, Congress national spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also took to Twitter to slam the minister. “These words can only be used by an insensitive and riteless person for the struggling contributors in the movement. Shame, but they don't know Haryana Agriculture Minister JP Dalal, who first described farmers as pro-Pakistan and China, should be dismissed from the cabinet,” he wrote on Twitter in Hindi.Dalal later apologised for his comments and alleged that they were "twisted" and a "wrong meaning" was given to his statement. "During the press conference, I condoled the demise of farmers who died during the protest. Even if a person dies unnaturally, it is painful. As far as the matter of giving the status of martyred is considered, the Jawans are given this status as the government has made policy for it," the minister was quoted as saying by news agency ANI."My statement was twisted and the wrong meaning was given to it. I saw the video on social media. I tender my apologies if somebody was hurt by my statement. As Haryana's Agriculture Minister, I am working for the welfare of the farmers," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wouldve-died-at-home-too-haryana-minister-on-farmers-deaths-during-protests-101613280935872.html

14-02-2021||India||2 years after Pulwama terror attack, safer convoy movements now||Two years since a Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) suicide bomber Adil Ahmad Dar rammed his explosive-laden car in the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) convoy on the national highway in Pulwama killing 40 troopers, a lot has changed in terms of convoy movement and the way troops secure their camps in the Kashmir valley.Immediately after the deadly attack on that fateful day that pushed India and Pakistan to the brink of war, the CRPF decided to completely overhaul its SOP (standard operating procedure) for moving convoys on the highways. Instead of moving in large convoys, like the one on February 14, 2019 with 78 vehicles, it was decided that personnel will move in smaller contingents with a maximum of 40 vehicles.A Superintendent of Police rank officer started commandeering the convoys and troops were ordered to strictly adhere to the ‘passenger manifest discipline’ for each vehicle in the convoy.Since the attack, the majority of vehicles used for convoy movements have been upgraded to withstand bullet and low intensity Improvised Explosive Device (IED) explosions.The ROPs (road opening parties), which are placed before the convoy moves on the highway, have been strengthened and trained for early warning mechanisms in identifying suspects who could attack the moving vehicles. Subsequently, there is better coordination between central intelligence agencies, Jammu and Kashmir police and army on possible terror threats, people familiar with the developments said.A major decision taken after the Pulwama attack was to restrict the movement of civilian vehicles on the highway when the convoys of security forces are on the move.The government has also allowed all personnel to take a flight to Srinagar from either Jammu or Delhi and air courier service for the central paramilitary forces has been increased by adding flights from Delhi to Srinagar via Jammu and back.A senior CRPF official, requesting anonymity, said “We keep changing our strategy depending on the ground situation. The convoys are safe now. Also, large numbers of terrorists have been neutralized and there is constant watch on terror groups”.Similarly, the security of camps has been increased in Jammu and Kashmir by all forces in the last two-three years. People familiar with the developments said that since the 2016 Uri attack and then Pulwama attack (2019), the perimeter or outer cordon security at most camps in Kashmir has been doubled and most personnel have been equipped with latest arms and ammunitions and night vision devices. The vehicles are now not allowed to park outside security forces’ camps and there is regular audit of personnel, vehicles, arms and ammunition and intelligence is shared in real time with all camps/headquarters offices.To mark the second anniversary of Pulwama attack, the CRPF will organize a wreath laying ceremony at its Lethpora camp in Pulwama to pay tributes to 40 jawans. The event will be watched by all CRPF formations across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-years-after-pulwama-terror-attack-safer-convoy-movements-now-101613279440354.html

Hence, I could not start the 'One-Rupee' clinic. But I was promoted as assistant professor recently and as an assistant professor, I am allowed to do private practice after my duty hours and hence, I have started the clinic in a rented house now", said the 38-year-old doctor.Asked why he charges one Rupee, Ramchandani said "I charge one Rupee from the poor and underprivileged people as I don't want them to feel that they are availing the service free of cost. They should also think that they have paid some money for their treatment."The clinic, which has been set up at the Kachha Market area in Burla town remain open from 7 AM to 8 AM in the morning and 6 PM to 7 PM in the evening. The 'One-Rupee' clinic has provided him with an opportunity to serve the poor, destitute, unprivileged, elderly persons, physically challenged people and the people who do not have access to proper medical care."I am a doctor of the masses and not the classes", he said.Also read| Over 8 mn health, frontline workers vaccinated against Covid-19 in India: GovtRamchandani said hundreds of people regularly come to the OPD of VIMSAR and one can find a long queue of patients to consult doctors. "I have seen elderly people and people with disabilities waiting for hours for consultation with doctors in OPD. They dont need to wait for hours and suffer at the hospital. They can come to my clinic and get consultation at Rupee 1 only," he added.Ramchandani's wife, Sikha Ramchandani, a dental surgeon, is also helping him. The clinic was inaugurated on Friday and 33 patients came to the clinic on the first day, he said.Ramchandani, who had also hit the headlines when he took a leprosy patient carrying hin his arms and dropped him in his house in 2019, said, "my late father, Brahmanand Ramchandani had told me to set up a nursing home. But a nursing home requires huge investment and it is not possible to provide treatment to poor people at Rupee 1 in a nursing home. Hence, I decided to open this 'One-Rupee' clinic."Ramchandani had also drawn the attention of all and received widespread appreciation when he attended a Covid-19 patient beyond his duty hour and also carried the patient to VIMSAR in his car amid the scourge of novel coronavirus in October last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ramchandanis-one-rupee-clinic-to-treat-the-poor-in-odisha-s-sambalpur-101613276968516.html

However, action against identified culprits by Indian High Commission is still to be taken even as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is investigating the issue.Closer to home, the Ministry of External Affairs on Saturday approved supply of Covid vaccine to armies of friendly countries with Bhutan, Bangladesh and Nepal top on the priority list. It was decided that the supplies to armed forces of friendly countries will be dealt by Indian armed forces as a sign of deepening defence cooperation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-supply-5-lakh-doses-of-covid-vaccine-to-canada-after-trudeau-call-to-pm-modi-101613279340845.html

14-02-2021||India||Cong MP Reddy says BJP implementing East India Company model, says rules empower corporates||Slamming the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Telangana Congress working president Revanth Reddy has compared the Centre with the East India Company, alleging that the ruling party is adopting the model of the former coloniser by bringing corporates into every sector, including agriculture.This comment came as Telangana Congress working president's padyatra (foot march), in support of farmers protest, entered Hyderabad on Saturday.The Member of Parliament from Malkajgiri is holding a 10-day-long padayatra which started from Achampeta in Nagarkurnool district and will culminate at Raviryal in Rangareddy district on February 16.Revanth Reddy told ANI, "After trying a lot to convince the Central government to take back the three farm laws that harm the farming community, Centre has not responded to it in a proper way. So, now we from Congress have decided to go on 'padayatra' (march) to support the protest farmers against the farm laws that have been passed by Union Government."Drawing parallels between the Central government and East India Company, Reddy said," This is what happened when East India Company came to the Indian subcontinent. They came for trade and then gradually took control over several kingdoms and rules for several hundred years. BJP is trying to bring the corporates into every sector of work. They are trying to bring in the East India Company Model."On Centre's stand on the farm laws, the Congress leader alleged, "The BJP is bluffing the people and especially the farmers, by making promises about MSP and other promises by word of mouth. There is no guarantee on minimum support price (MSP), there is no provision in the bill that a farmer can approach the courts when they have a problem with the corporates."Further slamming the BJP, Reddy said," The BJP is trying to divert the people of this nation and the farmers of this nation by saying that Congress party is trying to mislead the farmers."He also targeted the Telangana government and alleged that it was walking hand in hand with the Centre. "TRS has shown it support to BJP since the beginning. KCR and Modi are the two sides of the same coin," he alleged.The Central government has offered to put the farm laws "on hold" for 12-18 months, an offer rejected by the farmers' unions protesting against the laws. Several rounds of talks have been held with farmers over their demand for the repeal of three new laws.Farmers have been protesting on the different borders of the national capital since November 26 last year against the three newly enacted farm laws.

Navalny is love. That's why we will win," Leonid Volkov, one of Navalny's close allies, wrote on Twitter when calling on people to gather.Navalny was arrested last month on his return from Germany following treatment for poisoning, in Siberia, with what many Western countries say was a nerve agent. He was jailed on Feb. 2 for violating parole on what he said were trumped-up charges.He blames Putin for the poisoning, and Western countries are considering new sanctions against Russia. The Kremlin denies any involvement and questions whether Navalny was poisoned.Volkov, who is based in Lithuania, is one of several Navalny allies now abroad or under house arrest in Russia.He urged people to flood social media with pictures of Sunday's gatherings - a new venture for the opposition that resembles political actions in neighbouring Belarus - using the hashtag #loveisstrongerthanfear in Russian.Another activist has called on women to form a human chain on a pedestrian street in Moscow on Sunday afternoon in support of Navalny's wife Yulia, who according to media reports flew to Germany this week, and other women affected by the police crackdown against protesters.Russian law enforcement agencies said on Thursday that people taking part in unsanctioned rallies could face criminal charges.Some rights groups accuse police of using disproportionate force against protesters in recent weeks. The Kremlin has denied repression by police and says the protests were illegal as they were not approved and risk spreading Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/russians-set-for-candle-lit-valentine-s-day-protests-after-navalny-jailing-101613277273912.html

The total death toll in the disaster has now reached 41 with about 163 still missing."Their bodies were recovered by the team of rescue workers from SDRF and NDRF while clearing the slush from the tunnel, where about 35 workers were originally feared to be trapped," said state director general of police, Ashok Kumar.The rescue workers recovered another body on Sunday noon from the Reni village near Rishi Ganga hydel power project from the muck.Earlier on Saturday, the rescue workers finished drilling vertically in the main tunnel to reach a small underground tunnel beneath it at a depth of 12.7 metres. They however, hit slush after drilling the required depth. The slush is being pumped out to gain access to the tunnel for the search of about 30 remaining workers, feared trapped.Also Read: Uttarakhand farmers destroy crops after failing to get buyers, proper ratesTragedy struck last Sunday morning, when a glacier breach sent a torrent of water and sludge hurtling down a valley into the Rishiganga river--it becomes Alaknanda in Chamoli city. The subsequent flooding that hit villages on the way, also damaged two power plants--the Tapovan project and the Rishiganga hydel project-- and prompted a section of experts to link the event to climate change.It was feared that a glacial lake, formed by the debris following the glacier burst blocking a Himalayan stream about 8-kms above the Reni village, may trigger fresh flash floods, however, a eight-member SDRF team, which trekked for about 14 hours on foot to reach the 350 metre-wide lake said it currently posed no threat since enough water was continuously draining out in the form of a stream.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-bodies-found-in-tapovan-tunnel-164-missing-amid-good-news-on-glacial-lake-101613276554627.html

The PLA is moving very quickly as per the agreed schedule,” said a senior official.Also Read | Security forces thwart drug smuggling attempt at international borderAs per the Pangong Tso disengagement, the PLA will move east of Finger 8 on the Srijap plain and the Indian Army will move back to the Dhan Singh Thapa post on the Finger 3 spur. The entire area between Finger 4 and 8 will be demilitarised with patrolling schedules decided through consultations between commanders at a later stage.There is evidence of the pullback by Chinese main battle tanks from the southern banks of Pangong Tso, matched by the withdrawal of the Indian armour and artillery guns. However, there has been no evidence of any withdrawal of PLA forces or equipment from depth areas or from central or eastern sectors.According to the ministry of defence, the two sides will discuss the disengagement in the Gogra-Hot Springs area and the Depsang bulge after the Pangong Tso withdrawal is completed to ensure peace and tranquillity along the 1,597km Line of Actual Control in the Ladakh sector.Also Read | ‘Recced his office’: Jaish terrorist reveals Pak’s plan to target NSA Ajit DovalWhile Indian security planners are satisfied with the disengagement after nearly 10 months of eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation, they are aware that the disengagement does not mean peace on its own.

14-02-2021||India||Delhi-Mumbai expressway will ease traffic load: Nitin Gadkari||Once completed, the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway will ease the current traffic load on the Pune-Mumbai Expressway, Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari said on Saturday after reviewing various road projects in Pune and western Maharashtra.Addressing a press conference after inspecting the under-construction multi-level flyover project at Chandni Chowk in Pune, Gadkari said he had instructed officials concerned, contractors and local civic bodies to prepare a plan to ensure that the work gets completed during the next one year.The BJP MP also reiterated that motorists would have to pay road tax if they need "good services"."The Delhi-Mumbai Expressway work is going on. (Once completed), it will ease the traffic load on Pune-Mumbai Expressway as a bulk of traffic between northern and southern states currently pass through the Mumbai-Pune expressway," he told reporters.The Delhi-Mumbai Expressway is a proposed 1,250-km long controlled-access highway connecting the national capital with the commercial capital of the country.Gadkari said the main reason behind heavy traffic on the Pune-Mumbai expressway is that vehicles coming from northern states pass through this highway to travel further towards southern states."But the proposed 12-lane Delhi-Mumbai Expressway will ease the traffic congestion on Mumbai-Pune expressway and other westerly highways," he said.Gadkari said once the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway reaches Surat in Gujarat, the south-bound traffic can be diverted using a new alignment (Surat - Nashik - Ahmednagar- Solapur)."This will ease the traffic load on Pune-Mumbai Expressway and other highways, and also bring down vehicular pollution," he added.Talking about the development and four-laning of the route from Pune that is used for walking palkhis or palaquins of Sant Dnyaneshwar and Sant Tukaram by devotees of Lord Vitthal, Gadkari said the work was going on at high speed."Since the project is close to my heart, I think that beautification of the route should be done with the help of putting the couplets from 'abhangs' and songs devoted to Lord Vitthal along this route," he said.He said devotees can also suggest some ideas which can be implemented for beautifying the palkhi road.After inspecting the work of the multi-level flyover project at Chandni Chowk, Gadkari said, "I was told that the deadline to complete this project is 2023, but looking at the hardships and inconvenience caused to the public due to the ongoing work, it is not feasible to wait till 2023"."I have asked all officials concerned and contractors to prepare a plan to complete the project in the next one year," he added.He said the modalities regarding the acquisition of land for the flyover project stood completed and efforts will be made to complete the project at the earliest.Gadkari said Axis Bank, which was the financier for the project, has violated norms."What this bank used to do is that it used to get the money collected in the form of toll (and) deposited it in its own account. Due to this, the concerned contractor did not get funds to finish the work. I requested the bank to hand over the funds to the contractors but it did not relent. The bank actually betrayed.... It violated the norms for the (flyover) project."It is because of the actions of Axis Bank, that the common people got inconvenienced as the contractor could not complete the work," said Gadkari.He said he had written to Pune rural police and Pune collector that because of the bank's action, the contractor is not getting money and the work is getting delayed.The National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) is now giving money to contractors to complete the flyover work, he said.When asked about the people's reluctance to pay the toll in cases where road works are pending completion, Gadkari said the road tax has to be paid if people want good services."The way Chandrakant Patil (when he was PWD minister in the previous BJP-led government in Maharashtra) waived the toll, we won't do it," he quipped.Patil was also present when Gadkari referred to him.Gadkari said the work of Katraj flyover near Pune will be started in the next one month.He said works on road projects for Talegaon-Chakan- Shikrapur and Pune-Shirur-Ahmednagar will start soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhimumbai-expressway-will-ease-traffic-load-nitin-gadkari-101613266390525.html

14-02-2021||India||Soon, protesters will pay for damage: Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Saturday said his government is planning to bring a law under which protesters will have to pay for the damage to public properties during any protest.Khattar made the statement on the sidelines of his meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah. “We talked about party matters. We also talked about the farmers’ protest and I gave the Home Minister all the information that I had about dharnas and Kisan mahapanchayats in the state,” he said.Asked about his government’s proposed law against protestors, Haryana CM said, “No, we have not talked about the laws. We have been planning to bring this law even before the farmers’ movement started. Once Supreme Court in its decision had said that nobody had the right to vandalise public property, and we are bringing a law under which people have to pay for damage to public property.”The statement comes amid farmers’ protests across Delhi borders for nearly 3 months over the three new laws, which they say favour big corporations. The Centre has refuted the concerns, and offered to put the laws on hold for 18 months, but talks are currently locked in a stalemate.Reiterating the Centre’s stand, Khattar said the three laws are for the benefit of farmers and will give a boost to the agricultural sector. Some people are protesting just for the “sake of protest” and it shows their “vested political intent”, the CM said according to the statement.Farmers would have died even at home: MinisterHaryana agriculture minister JP Dalal on Saturday said farmers would have died even if they had stayed back home. Responding to a query over the “death of 200 farmers” in the ongoing protests, Dalal said: “Had they been at their homes, they would have died there also.” “Listen to me, out of one to two lakh, do 200 people not die in six months?” he asked in response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/soon-protesters-will-pay-for-damage-haryana-cm-manohar-lal-khattar-101613251968093.html

They are presently in the custody of the SIT of the crime branch, which is probing their alleged role in the Red Fort violence on Republic Day. Police have alleged that the two were “prominent players” behind the violence and “instigated the mob” by delivering “provocative speeches”.During the recreation of the crime scene, SIT members asked Sidhu and Iqbal to describe their movements and activities at the Red Fort on January 26, a police officer who did not want to be identified said. They were asked about the passage through which they entered the iconic structure and exited it after religious and farm union flags were hoisted by some protesters.The investigating team inspected the entire scene of violence at the fort to corroborate their claims and to ascertain how things unfolded at the monument, the officer said.The Delhi Police have registered at least 44 cases in connection with the January 26 violence and the incident of January 29, when a group of people, claiming to be locals, entered a farmers’ protest site at the Singhu border and clashed with farmers and police.Three more arrested in Burari violence casePolice on Saturday said they arrested three more persons for the violence near Burari on Republic Day. A total of 146 persons have been arrested for the violence that broke out in different parts of the city on that day.Sukhmeet Singh,35, his brother Gundeep Singh,33, and Harvinder Singh,32, were arrested on Friday, after their presence at the scene were confirmed from video clips and photographs collected by the investigating team, a senior police officer said, requesting anonymity.“We have arrested the three men on the basis of the video footage and cellphone location analysis. Their bikes are also seen at the scene of the violence in Burari. Their exact role in the violence is also being investigated,” said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deep-sidhu-iqbal-singh-taken-to-red-fort-to-recreate-sequence-of-r-day-clashes-101613250074727.html
14-02-2021||India||J&K to get statehood at appropriate time: Amit Shah||The Centre will grant full statehood to the Union Territory (UT) of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) at an “appropriate time”, home minister Amit Shah said in the Lok Sabha on Saturday, stressing that this government had done more for the region since the nullification of its special status in August 2019 than those who ruled it for decades.J&K has been a top priority of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government since it came to power at the Centre in 2014, Shah said. He added that devolution of power took place there after the government nullified Article 370, which granted special privileges to the erstwhile state, and said the move will hurt dynastic politics.“We should not do politics on Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. There are several issues over which politics can be done. These are sensitive places and people have suffered a lot. We need to assuage their feelings,” he said, replying to a discussion on the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill.He also rejected the Opposition’s charge that the proposed law negates the hopes of the region getting back statehood.The bill to merge the Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) cadre of all-India services officers with the Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Mizoram Union Territory (AGMUT) cadre was later passed by the Lok Sabha by a voice vote. The bill has already been green-lighted by the Rajya Sabha. It replaces an ordinance issued last month.“I am piloting the bill. I have introduced it...Don’t impose your apprehensions on the people of J&K…This bill has nothing to do with J&K statehood. The region will be granted statehood at an appropriate time,” Shah told the Opposition that has spoken out against the move to nullify Article 370.Targeting opposition parties, especially the Congress, he said Article 370 was a temporary provision but they continued with it for 70 years for the sake of “vote bank politics” before the Modi government nullified it on August 5, 2019, and bifurcated J&K into two Union Territories – J&K with a legislative assembly and Ladakh without one.“Who pressured you to continue with it for years?...This government does not believe in vote bank politics. This government takes decisions that will benefit the nation,” Shah said. He wondered what the ruling NDA’s predecessors, who were now asking questions about development in the region, had done for J&K since Independence.Shah also stressed that the panchayati raj system was in place in J&K after the Article 370 move and cited the successful conduct of local polls. “Even our rivals could not allege any wrongdoing in these polls, which were conducted fairly and peacefully,” he said.“Now people chosen by the masses will rule Jammu and Kashmir, not those born to kings and queens,” Shah added, launching a scathing criticism of “three families” that dominated politics in J&K for long. He did not name any party in this context, but was apparently referring to the Congress, the National Conference (NC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauded Shah’s address and also praised finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s “comprehensive” reply in the Lok Sabha to a discussion on the Union Budget. “A wonderful speech by Home Minister Shri Amit Shah in the Lok Sabha. Extensive in detail and rich in content, it highlights our efforts for Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh,” he tweeted.Also Read | What Amit Shah said on Jammu and Kashmir in Parliament: 10 pointsIn Kashmir, Shah’s remarks drew sharp reactions. “HM’s allegations that J&K was run by three families pales in comparison to the country being run by ‘hum do humaray do’,” former chief minister and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti said on Twitter, referring to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s charge that the country was being run by and for four people.NC spokesperson Imran Dar said the government gave no reason behind downgrading the erstwhile state to a UT. “Even now they gave no justification as to why they are delaying the return to statehood. At the same time, the disempowerment of J&K continues…They are bringing legislation after legislation to disempower the state,” he said of the move to merge the J&K cadre with the AGMUT cadre.J&K Congress vice-president Ghulam Nabi Monga said the government never consulted people before doing away with the statehood. “It had never happened in the history that a state was downgraded. The decision was against the will of people of J&K…The home minister should now fix a time line for the restoration of statehood,” Monga said.Back in the Lok Sabha, Shah said work on two All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in the region had begun, and the Kashmir Valley will be connected to the railways by 2022. He said the government expected that around 25,000 government jobs will be created in J&K by next year.The home minister also gave the assurance to the people of J&K that “no one will lose their land” and that the government had sufficient land for development works.Replying to All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) president Asaduddin Owaisi, Shah said the decision to restore 4G services in the region last week after 18 months was not taken under pressure of any foreign government.“…The (Congress-led) United Progressive Alliance government is gone. This is Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party government. The nation makes it decisions. Parliament makes its decisions. No one can pressure us,” he said.Authorities restricted the 4G services to buy some time and make sure rumours were not being spread (after the Article 370 move), Shah added.Criticising Owaisi, he said the AIMIM leader was creating a divide between Hindu and Muslim officers. Participating in the discussion earlier, Owaisi said the bill will further alienate Muslims and Kashmir. He also sought to know about the number of youngsters from the Valley arrested under the Public Security Act (PSA).Congress floor leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said local officers should be posted in J&K and accused the Centre of nullifying Article 370 “without preparation”. “This government is facing a trust deficit there. There is a lot of trust deficit and I suggest that posting local officers to the largest extent will be good for Jammu and Kashmir administration,” he said.Shah later explained that states such as Mizoram, Goa and Arunachal Pradesh are part of the AGMUT cadre and the Opposition’s concerns on the bill were unfounded.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-to-get-statehood-at-appropriate-time-amit-shah-101613248006225.html
14-02-2021||India||2 years after Pulwama, Interpol issues notices||Two years after a terror attack on a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) convoy in south Kashmir’s Pulwama killed 40 security personnel, Interpol has issued red notices against Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) chief Maulana Masood Azhar and three of his relatives in connection with the brazen strike that brought the already fraught ties between India and Pakistan to a new low, people familiar with the development said on Saturday.The National Investigation Agency (NIA), which is probing the case, hopes that authorities in Pakistan, where Azhar and his aides are believed to be hiding, will honour the red notices and take action against the terror masterminds.Apart from Azhar, red notices, or global arrest warrants, have been issued against his brothers Abdul Rauf Asghar and Ibrahim Athar, and his cousin Ammar Alvi.Also Read | Two years of Pulwama: Terror attack that killed 40 CRPF men explainedThe development comes at a time when the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has begun a series of online meetings that will review Pakistan’s actions to counter terror financing amid signs that Islamabad is yet to completely implement the multilateral watchdog’s action plan. The crucial plenary meeting during February 22-25 will take a final call on Pakistan, which is in FATF’s “grey list”.The fresh Interpol notices against Azhar and Rauf are in addition to the red notices issued against them previously — for their role in the attack on Indian Parliament in 2001 as well as the deadly attack on the Pathankot air base in 2016. Rauf has another Interpol red notice against him for hijacking Indian Airlines’s Flight IC-814 in 1999, which forced the government to release Azhar and two other terrorists (Mushtaq Zargar and Omar Sheikh) in exchange of about 150 passengers on board.“Azhar and his brother live freely in Pakistan despite killing hundreds of innocent people…they are globally designated wanted terrorists and have three to four Interpol red notices pending against them. Pakistan must arrest them and hand them over to India,” said a counterterrorism official, requesting anonymity.Under FATF pressure, Pakistan issued an arrest warrant against Azhar last month, acknowledging officially for the first time his presence in its territory. But Indian counterterrorism officials call it “total eyewash”.“The JeM chief has not even been charged under terror laws in Pakistan despite India sharing massive evidence in all these attacks. The court warrant is to show before the FATF plenary that some action is happening,” the official quoted above said.FATF president Marcus Pleyer last year cautioned Pakistan that it would not be given a chance “forever” to address outstanding issues and that repeated failure to deliver on the action plan would result in a country being put in the “black list”. Pleyer also said Pakistan had fully complied with 21 of 27 points in the action plan.As reported by HT on December 12, India has also prepared a formal judicial request, or Letter Rogatory, seeking information on Azhar, Rauf, Athar and Alvi, and three Pakistani nationals who came to India to execute the Pulwama attack. Athar’s son Umar Farooq and JeM commander Kamran (both killed in encounters with security forces) and one Ismail, alias Saifullah, are the three others on whom information will be sought.The Letter Rogatory request has been approved by the ministry of home affairs and will be sent to Islamabad in next two weeks, said a second official.In a 13,500-page charge sheet filed in August 2020, NIA said Azhar’s nephew Farooq, a highly skilled Afghanistan-trained improvised explosive device (IED) maker, executed the suicide bombing on the morning of February 14, 2019, when a CRPF convoy was moving on national highway in Pulwama.“Since the Pulwama attack, many of these high-profile terrorist commanders have gone under the radar in Pakistan and haven’t been seen publicly as part of Pakistan’s strategy to show to the international community that the terrorists aren’t active in its jurisdiction. As soon as the global scrutiny subsides, these terrorist commanders will be back, operating openly,” Sameer Patil , fellow at the International Security Studies Programme at Gateway House, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-years-after-pulwama-interpol-issues-notices-101613247601515.html
14-02-2021||India||Manipur's first comic book on folktales of 3 tribes released||The first comic book based on folktales of three major tribes -Mao, Maram and Poumai - inhabiting in Manipur's Senapati district was formally released during a function in Imphal on Saturday.The 135-paged colour comic book called ‘Folktales of Mao, Maram and Poumai’ is written by Th Kirankumar, the current deputy commissioner of Senapati district, with inputs provided by literature societies of the three major tribes.The book is a collection of 15 short stories consisting of seven folktales of Poumai, five of Maram and three of Mao. It was formally released by Manipur chief minister N Biren Singh in the presence of vice-chancellor P Gunindro Singh of Manipur University of Culture at a hotel in Imphal.Speaking on the occasion, chief minister N Biren Singh appreciated the writers and contributors of the book for bringing up such a comic book of folktales which would have high importance in bringing back the age-old bonding among different communities of the state.Expressing that many historical facts could be gathered from folksong and folktales, Biren Singh said that many valuable facts are yet to be explored and so there is a need for frequent interaction among different communities.Highlighting that folksongs and folktales have valuable facts on how different communities lived together and maintained good relations during the olden days, he also stressed the need to collect more historical facts by interacting with elders residing in the interior parts of the state and come up with more such storybooks.Reading such kind of comic books would make the younger generation aware of the age-old relations that had existed among different communities, he added and recalled a memorable folk song sung by elders which he had heard during a visit to a Paomai village when he became the chief minister of the state.Later in a tweet, the CM wrote, “It's my pleasure to have attended the launching of Comic Book titled "Folktales of Mao, Maram and Poumai" at Hotel Classic Grande today. Children and students will learn faster through vivid images of historical facts and folktales depicted in such comic books.”Commenting on the objective of bringing out the folktales into the comic format, writer Th Kirankumar said that the idea is to take such stories to the masses besides preserving the folktales of the communities.“Textbooks are also sometimes boring for students. But children love stories and folktales, they are crazy about it. Even outside the classroom, children continue to learn,” Kirankumar added. “So the basic objective is to introduce our own comic book to our children so that they can digest it easily and it will also help in preserving the lifestyle, traditions and culture as well."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manipurs-first-comic-book-on-folktales-of-3-tribes-released-101613245523892.html
14-02-2021||India||Delhi Police framing innocents: Farm union||Accusing the Delhi Police of framing and arresting “innocent” farmers, the legal team of Samyukta Kisan Morcha on Saturday urged farmers receiving notice from the police to seek their help before making an appearance.The legal team of SKM, the umbrella body of 40 farmer groups protesting against three contentious farm laws, also accused the police of booking farmers under sections of dacoity and attempt to murder with the aim to “implicate” them in “fake cases” and to ensure they don’t receive bail.The legal team also demanded that the cases against farmers be taken back and the Republic Day violence be investigated by a “high-level judicial” team comprising a high court judge and a retired Supreme Court judge.Also Read | Uttarakhand farmers destroy crops after failing to get buyers, proper rates“Since the police are arresting farmers by calling them by issuing notice, we urge all such farmers to first approach our legal team who will assist them at every step. The farmers receiving these summons should not visit the police without our lawyers,” Prem Singh Bhangu, convener of SKM’s legal team, said at a news briefing at Singhu Border. “All arrested farmers are sons of the SKM. We’ll fight your battle,” Bhangu added.So far, the police have arrested 122 people for their alleged involvement in violence and vandalism during a tractor rally on Republic Day. These arrests were followed by the registration of 44 FIRs related to the violence.Bhangu said that since these arrests were based on only a few of the FIRs, more arrests on the pretext of appearance in response to police notices were expected in the near future.“The police booked farmers under sections of dacoity and attempt to murder. We are agitators, not criminals. Did the police receive even a single complaint from any shopkeeper on Republic Day of theft of even peanuts that they registered cases of dacoity?” Bhangu said.On Friday, members of the legal team visited farmers lodged in Tihar Jail and informed them that a team of around 150 lawyers was working to seek bail for them. “We will also be sending monetary help to the jailed farmers by Monday,” said Bhangu.Bhangu also promised help from Monday in recovering farmers’ tractors and other vehicles that are currently in police custody.Members of the legal team also said that of the 38 farmers reported missing after the Republic Day incident, most have been traced and only 16 remain to be found. They said that while some of the missing men were traced to jail, others reached their homes.“Investigation is going on and whoever is served the notice has to join the investigation,” said Chinmoy Biswal, spokesperson for the Delhi Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-police-framing-innocents-farm-union-101613244573983.html
14-02-2021||India||Kidnapping and extortion racket busted in Goa, 12 arrested||The Goa Police have busted an interstate kidnapping and extortion racket that used to lure gullible aspirants with the promise of emigration to Canada. Twelve people have been arrested in the matter while a thirteenth, who is a minor and part of the racket, has been booked.Two victims who were held in their custody at a bungalow in Porvorim in North Goa have been freed, police said.The fiancée of the main victim complained to the Goa Police that her fiancé, one Shapoor Zarifi, an Afghan national, was kidnapped and held against his will when he travelled to Goa on February 7.Zarifi travelled to Goa to meet the ‘agents’ who had promised him to process his papers for his employment and travel to Canada. However, upon arrival, he was abducted and forced to call his friends telling them he had reached Canada and that his agents back in Goa should be paid $20,000.In her complaint, she alleged that Zarifi was communicating with her through WhatsApp voice notes that were dictated to him. Zarifi was made to claim that he had already reached Canada. However, she was able to sense that he was still in Goa and being held against his will.“The victim was traced to a house in Porvorim where he was held captive by the accused. A total of 12 people involved in the kidnapping were arrested after the search and rescue operation and a minor, who was also a member of the gang, has been apprehended and lodged in protective custody. Additionally, one more person from Punjab, who was held in captivity, was also rescued during the search and rescue operation,” South Goa Superintendent of Police (SP) Pankaj Kumar Singh said.According to the police, the main accused, identified as Sushil Singh a.k.a. Rishab, 36, a native of Haryana, had organised his gang members in Goa who took a bungalow on rent in Porvorim while their agents in Delhi lured innocent people who wanted to travel to Canada for employment.“Zarifi was called by the main accused Rishab to Goa on February 2, informing him that his travel documents are ready. The accused obtained ₹2 lakh from him as an advance payment for tickets and visa purposes but he was held captive at the bungalow in Porvorim and was made to call his friends to make arrangements for $20,000 as the payment for his travel to Canada,” Pankaj Singh said.Zarifi was told to tell his friends that if the money was not paid, he would be harmed.“The gang would lure gullible travellers intending to visit Canada and call them to Goa where advance payment would be taken from them after which they would be held captive at the rented bungalow. A fake boarding pass and passport would be sent to the family members to make them believe that the victim had indeed travelled to Canada or their desired destination. WhatsApp voice messages were then sent from the victims mobile number using a VPN connection reflecting their IP locations in Canada. Later, the victims were made to call their family and friends asking for the final payment to be made,” Pankaj Kumar Singh said.The others arrested accused include Ashish Tripathi, 30, from Gorakhpur; Rajat Kalyan, 23; Saahil Kalyan, 24; Pradeep Kumar, 32; Sanju Singh, 28; Vijay, 26; Anil Kumar, 36; Anurag Kumar, 18; Vishal Goswami, 20 - all natives of Haryana. Alex D’Souza, 29, and Robinson D’Souza, 23, both residents of Pernem in Goa were also among the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kidnapping-and-extortion-racket-busted-in-goa-12-arrested-101613242099065.html
14-02-2021||India||Engineers work on Polavaram dam on Godavari for smooth passage of Pulasa fish||Engineers working on the Polavaram major irrigation project, being constructed on Godavari River in Andhra Pradesh’s West Godavari district, are making a special arrangement in the massive spillway of the dam for the smooth passage of a peculiar variety of fish found in the river.Popularly known as “Pulasa Chepa” (Hilsa fish, scientific name: Tenualosa ilisha), it is actually a marine fish variety, but enters the Godavari river during the months of July and August for breeding. From Antarvedi in East Godavari district, where the river joins Bay of Bengal, the fish swims upstream of the river for more than 200 miles for breeding and returns to the sea by October-November.Due to its taste and availability only for a limited period in the Godavari river, Pulasa fish is in high demand not only in coastal Andhra, but also across the state and it fetches around ₹4,000 per kg for fishermen during the peak season.However, the construction of the Polavaram dam across the river has posed a big threat to the Pulasa fish, as its movement to the upstream of the river would be curtailed. “This was one of the issues raised by the Union ministry of environment and forests before considering granting environmental clearance for the Polavaram project. It asked the state water resources department to work out a mechanism for the passage of Pulasa fish,” Polavaram project chief engineer B Sudhakar Babu said.Subsequently, the state government consulted the Central Inland Fisheries Research Institute (CIFRI), Kolkata, to study on what kind of changes could be made in the design of the gates for the passage of Pulasa fish upstream and downstream of the river.“It is perhaps the first time that the CIFRI studied the physiology and behaviour of Pulasa fish in choosing its path in the river and designed a specialised Fish Ladder Gate to be erected on one of the piers of the spillway to enable the unhindered passage of fish during the season,” the chief engineer said.According to Satish Babu Angara, general manager of Megha Engineering and Infrastructure Limited which is executing the project, the fish ladder gate is about 252 metres in length and has three vents at various levels of the spillway so that the fish could move freely even if water levels keep changing.“We have made this arrangement in the second pier of the dam, keeping in view the path of the Pulasa fish. The fish ladder gate can be adjusted according to the water level,” Satish said.Each vent of the fish ladder gate will be of six feet height and four feet in width, which will provide enough space for the fish to pass through during the season, the chief engineer said.The project works are moving at a fast pace now. The erection of 52 spillway pillars, each measuring a height of 52 metres, of the dam was completed on Thursday. “We shall complete the erection of gates shortly, apart from bridge and slab works on the spillway by June,” Satish said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/engineers-work-on-polavaram-dam-on-godavari-for-smooth-passage-of-pulasa-fish-101613240941824.html

A police team began searching for the woman and eventually found her in a state of semi-consciousness in a bush in Annojiguda, about20 km from the state capital. At that time, police said that an autorickshaw driver and his three accomplices allegedly attempted to abduct, gang rape and murder the 19-year-old but failed after she resisted her attackers and alerted the authorities.“She was not abducted. We found that it was a false case after a thorough investigation and gathering of evidence,” Rachakonda police commissioner Mahesh Bhagawat said.Also Read | Hyderabad pharmacy student abduction and rape case was a hoax, say policeIn her statement to the police, the woman said that she left college at 6:30pm and boarded an auto to reach her home, roughly 4km away. She said that two other men boarded the auto, which she said did not stop at RLR Nagar, where she was supposed to get down. According to the woman, the auto finally stopped at Yamnampet village, roughly 6km from where she had started. There, another man with a van was already waiting, she told police. The four men allegedly bundled her into the van and started for Ghatkesar, another 2km away, the police said on Thursday.However, during investigation police found that the woman’s statement was in contradiction to the evidence they found, the police commissioner said.“We examined the video footage obtained from CCTV cameras whichshowed that the woman got down at the next stop from her actual destination, walked for about four kilometres towards Yamnampet and then boarded another auto to reach Annojiguda, from where she called her mother stating that she was kidnapped,” Bhagawat said.After corroborating all the evidences, the police questioned the student and she confessed that she had lied to the police, Bhagwat said.“She confessed that due to family issues she wanted to leave her house. Later, due to police involvement, she panicked and out of fear weaved a false story,” the police said in an official statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cops-rule-out-rape-abduction-bid-on-hyd-medical-student-101613240073407.html
14-02-2021||India||1 held in Capital for shooting 5 dead in Haryana wrestling arena||A day after five persons were shot dead and two others, including a three-year-old child, were grievously injured in a firing incident in the wrestling arena of Rohtak’s Jat College, a joint team of Delhi and Rohtak police arrested the accused, Sukhvinder Singh, from Samaypur Badli in the Capital.Police had announced a reward of ₹1 lakh for information on the accused, a resident of Baroda village in Sonepat and a certified coach from Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports (NIS), Patiala.Rohtak superintendent of police (SP) Rahul Sharma said, “He was caught from Samaypur Badli area in Delhi in a joint operation by Rohtak and Delhi police. We will bring him to Rohtak on a production warrant and seek his remand.”“Prima facie it appears that the incident took place due to a rivalry between the accused and head coach Manoj Kumar. We are collecting CCTV footage from Jat College and nearby areas. The victims’ bodies have been handed over to their family members,” the SP added.On Friday evening, coach Manoj Kumar of Sonepat, his wife Sakshi, two NIS-certified coaches Satish Dalal of Sonepat and Pardeep Malik of Rohtak, were shot dead along with national-level wrestler Pooja on the campus.Manoj’s three-year-old son Sartaj is in the intensive care unit (ICU) at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS), Rohtak, while the other injured, coach Amarjeet Singh, is undergoing treatment at Medanta hospital in Gurugram.Manoj Kumar’s younger brother Parmoj Kumar, a Commonwealth Games medallist in boxing, told HT that his brother, Manoj, and sister-in-law, Sakshi, were national-level players. He added that their family had cordial relations with the accused.“Sukhvinder was working as a wrestling coach at Jat College’s akhara. My brother, who was the head of the akhara, had asked Sukhvinder to leave the college after Pooja filed a complaint against him,” said Parmoj.Pooja’s father, Ram Gopal, said his daughter had become a victim of rivalry between coaches. “My daughter was to return home to Mathura on Saturday. She had won two medals at national-level events. She had moved to Rohtak with an aim of becoming an international-level player. Despite financial constraints at home, I had ensured that my daughter’s practice never suffered. Unfortunately, she was caught in the rivalry between two coaches,” said Gopal.The incident shocked the wrestling fraternity nationwide. “What has happened is extremely sad. I am here at the national camp in Lucknow and it has affected all of us that how can such an incident happen in an akhada. I did not know them personally and I never visited that centre but when you hear such things it jolts you,” said Olympic medallist Sakshi Malik, who has trained at the Chhotu Ram wrestling centre in Rohtak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-held-in-capital-for-shooting-5-dead-in-haryana-wrestling-arena-101613240013289.html
14-02-2021||India||'Jai Shri Ram' has become the slogan of election in Bengal, says BJP's Gajendra Shekhawat||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, who is in charge of five Lok Sabha constituencies in West Bengal, says the Trinamool Congress’s electoral ship is about to sink. In an interview with Smriti Kak Ramachandran ahead of the upcoming assembly polls, he also accused chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s government of corruption, and said “Jai Shri Ram” has become Bengal’s election slogan. Edited excerpts:The BJP won 18 seats in the Lok Sabha elections. How confident is the party of translating the gains in the upcoming assembly polls? People in Bengal are fed up with the TMC government; they are unhappy with corruption, the red tape and politics of vendetta. However, until they believe that the BJP can turn the tables, they won’t be able to escape this. If you look back in time, it took Mamata Banerjee 15 years to make people believe that she can change things.Till the last assembly election (when the BJP won 3 seats), people did not believe that the BJP can be an alternative. Now, people are convinced that change can happen only when the BJP comes to power.What gives the BJP an edge over the TMC? Development that took place since the Narendra Modi government was formed (at the Centre)…the changes in the lives of ordinary people have sent out a message to the poor and the masses that development can only happen if the BJP government is there. People are aware of how the implementation of central schemes is not happening in West Bengal.How will the BJP counter the “Bahari (outsider)” vs Bengali narrative? The TMC also accuses you of communalising politics. In the last 10 years, her (Banerjee’s) slogan has been “Ma, Mati, Manush (mother, soil and people)”. Today, the people of Bengal are compelled to acknowledge that they (the state government) have not done justice to any of the sections.The state ranks very high in crimes against women. When I went to the state for the first time, I saw posters of missing girls on the walls with numbers scribbled at the bottom. I was told that there is a problem of girls going missing and the police not taking action. So, NGOs have come forward to help those families whose girls had gone missing...Drinking water is another issue that directly affects women. If water connections can be supplied in other parts of the country, why not in Bengal?The general image of Bengali people was that of bhadralok (gentleman). People of Bengal would react to any injustice or a problem in any part of the world. But now there is such an atmosphere of fear that people do not raise their voice against injustice in neighbour’s home.The BJP has managed to get some TMC leaders with political heft on board. The Opposition says it has become a trend to poach leaders ahead of elections. Why has the party not been able to groom its own leaders? It is natural that when a ship is sinking many people want to opt out. Mamata Banerjee’s ship is about to sink. Even in Uttar Pradesh, when we were contesting elections, there were many people from various political parties who joined the BJP. We are a party based on ideology. We welcome those who want to align with our ideology. Today, the BJP is the largest party in the country and many people who were with other parties have chosen our path.Is it ideology or political expedience? In our sphere of work we have to consider all possibilities. We go with a belief that those who believe in our ideology will continue to work with us and those who don’t may even quit.The BJP accuses the TMC of appeasement for votes. Now, Furfura Sharif cleric Abbas Siddiqui has floated his political party. AIMIM is also throwing its hat in the ring. Will the BJP benefit from the divisions in the Muslim vote? This is the first time that elections will be contested in West Bengal on the basis of development…the face of development in India is Prime Minister Modi. If there is a Modi versus Mamata comparison on the issue of development, then people have no doubts about who to pick...The policy of appeasement that has been followed has in some way compelled the majority community to think that despite their support, the government, for its own vote bank politics, has been indulging in appeasement.How do you read Banerjee’s decision of contesting from Nandigram? She’s running away to Nandigram because she is scared. She is aware and she’s been told by her intelligence network that this time she cannot win the election in Bhawanipore (in south Kolkata).What is your comment about the acrimony between the parties over chanting “Jai Shri Ram”? Looking at her response to the chant, people across ideologies are questioning why she gets irritated by it. Jai Shri Ram has now certainty become the slogan of the election in Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jai-shri-ram-has-become-the-slogan-of-election-in-bengal-shekhawat-101613239953332.html
14-02-2021||India||FM Sitharaman poses 10 questions to counter Congress attack on Budget||Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Saturday that Rahul Gandhi was becoming a “doomsday man” for India by creating fake narratives on various issues, as she hit back at the Congress leader’s “hum do, humare do” jibe that questioned the government’s intent behind three farm laws, and posed a 10-point questionnaire-cum-rebuttal on farmer’s welfare.After responding to various issues raised by members of Parliament in the Lok Sabha during a debate on the Union Budget over two days, Sitharaman asked Gandhi why the Congress took a U-turn on farm reforms after it proposed a similar move during the 2019 general elections.“Shri Rahul Gandhi, when he stood up [in Lok Sabha on Thursday]... when the foundation was being laid [by him] for the [reply to the] Budget speech, which never happened... I want to ask, and I also share my expectations... Why the Congress party had taken a U-turn in its position [on farm reforms]... [mentioned in its] 2019 election manifesto…,” the finance minister said.“We need to recognise these two tendencies of the Congress party. One is creating fake narratives and second, lack of belief in a democratically elected Parliamentary system,” she said.Also Read | Cong MP moves motion against FM for calling Rahul Gandhi 'doomsday man of India'Gandhi said on Thursday that the three new farm laws would allow corporates to buy unlimited quantity of food grains for profiteering, kill the ‘mandi’ system, remove the Essential Commodity Act (ECA) leading to hoarding, and deny judicial remedies to farmers against corporate buyers of their farm produce. “These laws will destroy India’s food security system and will hurt rural economy,” he said.The “hum do, humare do” expression was used by Gandhi to say that only four people were ruling this country including two business houses.Speaking in the House, Sitharaman said she was posing 10 questions to the Congress, which the party would have to answer in the due course. She sought an answer from the opposition party over its “U-turn” on the farm legislation, which she said it supported earlier.Her second question was related to the Congress’s electoral promise of farm loan waivers in states such as Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. “Karza maafi Rajasthan men nahi hua, Madhya Pradesh men nahi hua... Chhattisgarh men bhi wo karza maafi nahi hua,” she said.Sitharaman’s third point was an expectation from Gandhi that he would “order” the Punjab chief minister not to implement the “kala kaanun” [the three farm laws]. “I thought, he would reveal this in the House,” she said.“When Rahul Gandhiji was talking about the farm laws at that time I expected that he would say that farmers have problems related to ‘parali’ [stubble] and the Congress government in Punjab will give some relief to them. But, that didn’t happen,” she said.She asked Gandhi for at least one clause of the three farm laws that would demonstrate that farmers’ interest would be hurt. “[Congress] participated in the voting [of the Bills in the Parliament], gave [its] support, and then changed its mind...,” she added.Referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s reply to the motion of thanks on the President’s speech that enumerated several measures for small farmers, Sitharaman said: “I thought he would stand and say, ‘Pradhan Mantriji’ you have spoken several good things about small farmers, I will ask my friends to return lands to the farmer... because we took land cheap from them... We are in politics, therefore, my family and I have to take a stand on this matter and return the land.”“He could have said here, ‘hum do, humare do’ mein main damaad [son-in-law] ko aadesh karke aaya hun ki zamin waapas karo... But that did not happen,” she said.She also referred to PM Modi’s reply to the President’s address, wherein he quoted former PM Manmohan Singh that he also supported such farm reforms. “I thought, he [Gandhi] would say [something about]... forgetting the statement of Dr Manmohan Singh.... I thought he would say we will not dishonour Dr Manmohan Singh,” she said.“While debating on Budget... several members raised the question whether any APMC [Agricultural Produce Market Committee] has been closed after the three [farm] laws were enacted? They are not closed anywhere... Prove even if one APMC mandi is shut?”“Why does he choose to insult constitutional authorities?” the finance minister said.Sitharaman also alleged that the Congress was creating “continuously fake narratives” even as the country was fighting the Covid-19 pandemic. On Friday, while speaking in the Rajya Sabha, she attacked former finance minister P Chidambaram on the same issue. “False narratives were created... There is a lot of grudge in the speech of the former finance minister [referring to Congress leader P Chidambaram]... not to recognise how honourable Prime Minister handled the Corona crisis,” she said in the House on Friday.Without giving any specific instance, Sitharaman alleged that Gandhi never believed in the Indian government but preferred to rely on outsiders, did “politics with a fringe group” and indulged in “bhayankar [frightful] abuse... total unacceptable terminology for constitutionally elected heads.”She said Gandhi indulge in “destructive” politics. “I’m very scared... probably he is becoming a ‘doomsday man’ for India,” she said.Congress MP TN Prathapan later moved a notice for privilege motion against Sitharaman on her “doomsday man” remark. “Minister of Finance Nirmala Sitaraman abused Rahul Gandhi as ‘Doomsday man of India’, accused that Rahul Gandhi, an elected member in the house, has joined with fringe element groups and that he is demeaning the country. This is an utter breach of privilege,” the notice said.Speaking about Budget 2021-22 earlier on Saturday, Sitharaman said the focus of the exercise was “Aatmanirbhar Bharat” (a self-reliant India) and it was in sync with several stimulus packages and reforms announced during the lockdown period to revive the economy. On February 1, she presented Budget 2021-22 that focused on capital investments in areas such as health care, agriculture, defence, water and sanitation.The finance minister said the government was committed to providing full monetary support to the rural jobs guarantee scheme under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) in 2021-22. The Union Budget has estimated about a ₹73,000-crore fund for the scheme, but like previous years, more funds will be made available to the scheme as many migrant workers who returned home because of the Covid-19 pandemic are likely to stay back in their villages.Nilaya Varma, CEO and co-founder of consultancy firm Primus Partners, said: “The Union Budget 2021 does both, as it focuses on increased capital expenditure and provides ample opportunity for private sector participation. Developing robust infrastructure across segments including health care, agriculture, logistics, oil and gas will have a much-needed multiplier effect on the economy. Additionally, infrastructure development and manufacturing focus will drive sector-specific capacity building initiatives to employ the country’s youth gainfully.”Reacting on Nirmala Sitharaman’s speech, Adhir Chowdhury, Leader of Congress Party in Lok Sabha, said: “How does she explain that the lockdown made India’s billionaires 35% richer, while 84% of households support income suffered loss and 1.7 lakh people lost their jobs every hour in April, 2020 alone.”“How does she explain that income increase for India’s top 100 billionaires since March 2020? Finance Minister’s misplaced priorities include tax concession for corporates in financial year 2019-20 that amounted over ₹1.4 lakh crores. Instead of creating jobs, they used money for trimming up their balance sheets.”On a question about the comment made by Sitharaman on Gandhi’s ‘hum do, humare do’ slogan, Chowdhury said: “Immediately we stood up there and objected to the comments of the Finance Minister and even exhorted her that being a Finance Minister of India, she should not indulge in a such kind of unparliamentary activities inside the house.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fm-poses-10-questions-to-counter-cong-attack-on-budget-101613239953908.html
14-02-2021||India||Only 4% beneficiaries turn up for second vaccine shot: Centre||The roll-out of the second dose of vaccines against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) was off to a slow start on Saturday, with just 7,668 beneficiaries receiving the second jab, according to the provisional data released by the Union health ministry.This accounted for just about 4% of the over 191,000 health care workers who received their first dose on January 16, the day the nationwide roll-out of the vaccination drive took place.The government has set a deadline of March 1 to complete the vaccination of the frontline workers across the country, with a five-day period for “mop up” activity to vaccinate those who might have been missed out, said joint secretary of the Union health ministry, Mandeep Bhandari. For health care workers, the deadline is February 20.The two vaccines that have been cleared for used in India – Covishield and Covaxin – require that two doses be given 28 days apart. However, as per the recommendation of the apex drug regulator, the doses can be taken within a window of four to six weeks.“The second dose can be given any time between four and six weeks. That’s the window period that we have,” Dr VK Paul, member (health) of Niti Aayog previously told HT. He was one of those who received the vaccine on the day of the roll-out. He said he would take the second dose on Monday.Also Read | Registered beneficiaries not willing to be vaccinated: PCMC health chiefThe weekend, half-day working at hospitals, could have been the reason for the low turnout. Dr NK Arora, National Task Force member on Covid-19 vaccines, said this was likely. “The numbers will probably pick up Monday onwards,” he said.With 84,807 people receiving the shot on Saturday, as per provisional data, India crossed the 8 million mark of the number of people vaccinated.The administration of the second dose of Covid-19 vaccines started on Saturday, 28 days after the first dose was given on January 16, in several states across India, even though the attendance of health care workers remained low, according to officials in multiple states.Among the states that started the second dose of Covid-19 vaccination were Tamil Nadu, Goa, Jammu and Kashmir, West Bengal, Odisha and Jharkhand, an official said.No second dose of the Covid-19 vaccines was given in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala. The process to give the second dose will begin in these states from Monday or early next week, another official said on condition of anonymity. Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have not announced the days for the second dose of the vaccination.Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and Serum Institute of India’ Covishield vaccines require a two-dose schedule to be administered through the intramuscular route.Tamil Nadu health secretary J Radhakrishnan, who inspected the administration of the second dose to health care workers at the Government Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, said the vaccination drive would soon be extended to the public.Only 1,154 healthcare workers took the second dose in Tamil Nadu on Saturday, as opposed to the 3,027 beneficiaries for the first dose. “It isn’t compulsory to take the second dose exactly on the 28th day after the first dose. It can be taken soon after 28 days and also because it’s a weekend the numbers are low,” says Dr K Vinay, joint director, immunisation, directorate of public health and preventive medicine.Also Read | India vaccinates close to 8 million beneficiaries against Covid-19 in 28 daysIn Chandigarh, only 325 people were administered the second dose as compared to 5,907 on January 16 when the first dose was administered. State Immunization Officer, Dr Virendra Ahlawat said they will conduct more vaccination sessions Monday onwards and make up for the shortfall.“One need not have any apprehensions over the vaccine being administered. We have given time till February 17 for the frontline workers to register. Soon, the vaccination drive will be extended to other sections of people,” Radhakrishnan said.The Goa government, too, on Saturday started administering the second dose of Covid-19 vaccines to health care workers, said state immunisation officer Dr Rajendra Borkar. Ranganath Bhojje, a health care worker from the Goa Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), was the first person to get the vaccine shot on January 16, when the nationwide vaccination programme had started. He was again the first person to get the second dose of the vaccine, the official said.Those who received the second dose of the vaccine will develop immunity against the infection after 14 days, Borkar said. Out of the total number of 19,952 health care workers in the state, 10,341 have received their first dose so far, while the remaining will receive it by February 20, Dr Borkar said, adding that the state has covered 52% of the health care workers in the vaccination drive so far, Dr Borkar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-4-beneficiaries-turn-up-for-second-vaccine-shot-centre-101613239833404.html
