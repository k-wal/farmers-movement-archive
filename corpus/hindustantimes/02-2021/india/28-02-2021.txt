But the rise is not limited to Maharashtra. Several states where mutant strains have not been found are seeing a spike in the number of cases. And scientists dismissed any link between the resurgence of cases and the mutant strains.Here is what we know about Covid-19 mutants, variants> Mutants and variants are not the same, scientists have emphasised. While variants differ from the original virus, a mutation is a change in a nucleic acid base or amino acid molecule.> Mutations eventually accumulate to generate variants that differ from the original virus more and more, and so, a variant can have limited or even cumulative mutations, virologist Upasana Ray told news agency PTI.> The longer a virus stays in the population and spreads, the more the mutations and hence more variants.> Mutations are not surprising. Over 7,000 SARS-CoV-2 mutations have been documented, but these are not variants. A study from Hyderabad's CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology put the number of total mutations in India as 7,684.> These mutations were documents from the data analysis of 6,017 genomes sequenced so far. “That doesn’t mean 7,000 variants are going around in the country. This only shows that the virus is mutating as expected, and we have documented what these mutations are,” CSIR-CCMB director told PTI.> N440K and E484Q variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been detected in Maharashtra, Kerala and Telangana.> The N440K mutation has been reported on 13 different occasions between May and September 2020 in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Assam.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/feb-spike-of-covid-19-in-several-states-what-we-know-about-mutants-variants-101614531685167.html

Three of four former teachers said work was often or always stressful in the most recent year in which they taught in a public school.In fact, teachers cited stress nearly twice as often as insufficient pay as a reason for quitting. Most former teachers went on to take jobs with less or equal pay, with 3 in 10 taking jobs with no health insurance or retirement benefits.Covid-19 appears to have exacerbated teachers' stress. Almost half of the public-school teachers who left the profession early and voluntarily since March 2020 listed Covid-19 as the main reason for their departure. Covid-19 has elevated stress by forcing teachers to work more hours and navigate an unfamiliar remote environment, made worse by frequent technical problems."Different Covid-19 stressors affected pandemic teachers differently," said Melissa Diliberti, lead author of the report and an assistant policy researcher at RAND, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research organisation. "Insufficient pay and childcare responsibilities drove out younger teachers under 40, while older teachers were more likely to say health conditions made them leave."Those still in education report the top attractions about their new education jobs are more flexibility in their schedules and a better work climate. Of teachers who left the profession and are currently employed, about 3 in 10 holds a non-education-related job, 3 in 10 have a different type of teaching position, and the rest are in non-teaching education jobs.There is some good news for school districts: A substantial share of former public-school teachers are willing to come back to the profession under certain conditions."Despite the many reasons public school teachers left, about half of those who left primarily because of Covid-19 said they would be willing to come back once most staff are vaccinated or there was regular rapid Covid-19 testing of staff and students," said Heather Schwartz, co-author and director of the Pre-K to 12 educational systems program at RAND.The survey was conducted in December 2020 using the RAND American Educator Panels, nationally representative samples of educators who provide their feedback on important issues of educational policy and practice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stress-key-reason-for-teachers-to-quit-job-before-during-pandemic-study-101614529986890.html

Abdullah was responding to media queries.Senior Congress leaders Kapil Sibal and Anand Sharma on Saturday had stated that the Congress party was “getting weaker”.“The point is what Rahul Gandhi is saying and what these G 23 leaders are saying… Why should I react to them? I mean, what have I got to do with them? I am not saying any of these things which they are saying. It is for them to decide and set their house in order,” said Abdullah.He, however, quickly added that he wanted the Congress to be strong.“I want the Congress party to be strong. I want the Congress to unite and fight the divisive forces of the country. Congress must unite and must become strong. People look up to the Congress in trying to sort things out in the country. They are part of this nation and a 150-year-old party,” added Abdullah.Also read: 8,293 new cases in Maharashtra as Covid-19 spike continues amid lockdown, curbsOn Saturday, former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi alleged that democracy in India was “dead”. He was speaking at VOC College in Thoothukudi, Tamil Nadu ahead of the Assembly elections.On the killing of Krishna Dhaba owner’s son in Srinagar in a terror attack, Abdullah said, “He was cremated today. We have already reacted to it and it was very tragic. Those who shout from the top of the mountain that everything is hunky-dory here (J&K) and they bring the ambassadors to show them how good it is here, should answer for that. It should be the L-G. If militancy is dead, he should answer. The DG and police should answer who say every day that it is over.”On February 17, terrorists belonging to the ‘Muslim Janbaz Force’ - an offshoot of proscribed terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba - attacked Krishna Dhaba’ in Srinagar’s Durganag area when 24 foreign diplomats were visiting the Union territory.The son of the owner of popular food joint Krishna Dhaba, who was injured in the terrorist attack on the eatery, succumbed to his injuries on Sunday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-must-unite-to-defeat-divisive-forces-farooq-abdullah-101614529493401.html
28-02-2021||India||Health Minister lauds contributions of medical professionals in pandemic||India has been able to perform well on various Covid-19 management parameters and maintained one of the lowest fatality rates and highest recovery rates in the world due to a preemptive, proactive and graded approach, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said Sunday.He made these remarks at the Global Indian Physicians Congress, organised by the Global Association for Physicians of Indian Origin (GAPIO), through video conference, the ministry said in a statement.Vardhan praised the contribution of medical professionals in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic."As the world faced the unprecedented crisis of Covid-19, it has been our doctors, nurses and healthcare workers who have cemented their position as the foremost champions of humanity, saving humankind as it was staring at an existential crisis," Vardhan was quoted as saying in the statement."I salute their courage, valour and selflessness in serving society. No words are enough to express gratitude towards all the Corona Warriors, who risked their own lives to save the lives of others. It's unfortunate and a great personal loss for me that so many of them lost their lives during this time," he said.In this context, the Union Minister also noted GAPIO's efforts towards establishing the Global Indian Physician Covid-19 Collaborative to continuously share their knowledge and experiences to arrive at the best possible approach for the management of Covid-19, the statement said.Vardhan took the occasion to highlight the government's efforts in controlling the Covid-19 pandemic."It has been a result of our pre-emptive, proactive and graded approach that India has been able to perform well on various parameters related to Covid-19. We have continuously maintained one of the lowest fatality rates and highest recovery rates across the world," he was quoted as saying in the statement."Even with all the attention directed towards managing Covid-19, our government did not lose sight of ensuring continuity of other essential health services. Various policy interventions as well as the use of technology like telemedicine services played a key role in this regard. Our e-Sanjeevani platform has recorded millions of doctor-patient consultations in a short span of time," he said.The Health Minister also noted the contribution of scientists."Our scientists have done remarkably well, working round the clock to provide us with two vaccines which are being indigenously manufactured and have been approved for emergency use in India. The world's largest vaccine drive is underway in the country and is moving forward at a rapid pace with more than 1 crore doses administered already," he said."In what is a remarkable endorsement of our spectacular talent and capabilities, India which is often referred to as the pharmacy of the world, is now also emerging as the Covid-19 vaccine manufacturing hub of the world," he added.Detailing the ongoing work within the ministry, he said it is now working towards further augmenting healthcare systems through a paradigm shift of policies and overarching programs like the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana and Aatmanirbhar Swasth Bharat Yojana.A new thinking is taking shape with the establishment of the National Medical Commission, Nursing Commission Bill and National Commission for Allied Healthcare Professions Bills. Ambitious plans have been made for expanding medical colleges and revamping the healthcare infrastructure in India, he said."We are constantly working to revolutionize the delivery mechanism of healthcare services in the country," he said.Vardhan also mentioned that all the endeavours of the government can greatly benefit from the support and assistance of associations like GAPIO.He added that facilitating exchange of ideas and knowledge will not only help formulate best practices but also expedite their implementation which will ultimately benefit society.Vardhan expressed his appreciation to GAPIO which since its inception in 2011 has endeavoured to bring 1.4 million physicians of Indian-origin across the world on a single platform to facilitate exchange of knowledge, skills and research, Vardhan said, according to the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-minister-lauds-contributions-of-medical-professionals-in-pandemic-101614528028635.html

They do just acts and unjust ones as well. Congress will have work 24/7 and form our own strategy, only then we will be able to fight them," Alvi said while speaking to ANI.This statement comes as 824 assembly constituencies are set to go for polls in four states--Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Assam-- and the Union Territory of Puducherry. The polling in these states will start on March 27 and conclude on April 29.On the question that Congress leaders are switching sides, Alvi said, "When the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) was in power, the BJP's people used to line up to join the Congress but we did not let them in. Today, BJP tries to lure the leaders and indulges in horse-trading.""People with greed for power and those who are threatened by CBI and IT officers join BJP. This has nothing to do with ideology," he added.Slamming his own party for inducting Babulal Chaurasia in Madhya Pradesh, Alvi said, "Babulal Chaurasia, who worshipped Nathuram Godse, has joined Congress in Madhya Pradesh. I have condemned this development. I have written a letter to Sonia Gandhi and asked for his exit from Congress."He further commented on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's regret that he could not learn Tamil Nadu, during his monthly radio programme Maan Ki Baat."If he can learn English then why not Tamil. It does not take much to learn a language. But he is playing politics on language.

28-02-2021||India||Congress faces uphill battle in poll-bound states||The Congress is hoping to benefit from the anti-incumbency factor as well as the public protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act and agri laws in the upcoming round of assembly polls, but still faces an uphill task in the coming days.Barring Kerala, where the party feels it is poised to defeat the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF), the Congress is beset with ally troubles in all other poll-bound states-- Assam, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu -- and the Union Territory of Puducherry.In West Bengal, the party’s seat-sharing talks with the newly formed Indian Secular Front (ISF) are still underway with the Left-Congress alliance keen to have the fledgling party on board to pocket some of the 30 percent Muslim votes in the state.In Assam too, the party is yet to finalise the agreement with Badruddin Ajmal’s AIUDF, its main ally in the polls.In Tamil Nadu, the Congress is banking fully on DMK to dethrone the incumbent AIADMK, while in Puducherry the grand old party is left with hardly any core strength after the recent fall of the government to face an aggressive BJP, which is leaving no stone unturned to make inroads in the eastern and southern belts.Though seat-sharing talks have started, the Congress is demanding over 50 seats this time which the DMK is reluctant to give.Sources say that DMK is citing the Congress' poor performance in recent polls as well as in the 2016 assembly elections when it won just eight seats out of the 41 it contested.Winning at least one state full steam is key to the revival of the sagging morale of Congress workers and the credibility of Rahul Gandhi as the numero uno in the organisation, observers say.Only yesterday, top Congress dissenters expressed lack of confidence in Rahul Gandhi’s leadership when they said in Jammu that the party was weakening and they had taken upon themselves the responsibility of rebuilding it.Rahul Gandhi and his strategists hope to wrest Tamil Nadu and Kerala as power switches sides in these states every five years. They also believe they can upset the incumbent BJP in Assam.That explains why Congress has announced "mission 100" in Assam which has 126 assembly seats. But this time, it does not have a stalwart like former chief minister Tarun Gogoi who passed away in November last year.BJP leader and Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has, however, dared the Congress saying, "A Congress tsunami can only come in Bangladesh".The grand old party also faces a major challenge in West Bengal where the TMC and the BJP having long launched their poll slogans, while the Left and Congress are still dithering on their joint strategy.The eight-phase elections in West Bengal are likely to witness a keen contest between the TMC and the BJP, with the Left parties seeking to regain control after allying with the Congress.In 2016 assembly polls in Bengal, the Congress-Left alliance bagged 38% votes, 7% less than TMC. But in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP emerged as the main rival to Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress and the combined vote share of the Congress and the Left plummeted to 15%.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s personal push in all the poll-bound states is making the road to victory even more rutted for the Congress.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has already started a high-pitched campaign in the southern states and has also toured Assam. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is also set to join the party's campaign in Assam on Monday and Tuesday, where she is likely to address smaller meetings as well as a big rally in Tezpur on March 2.Rahul Gandhi's recent remarks in Kerala about "South Indians being deeply interested in issues unlike North Indians" are being used by the BJP to spin an anti-Congress narrative.The grand old party is attempting damage control by saying Gandhi was talking about the need for people to debate national issues and not superficial matters.With elections announced and seat-sharing details in poll-bound states yet to be disclosed, it remains to be seen how big the turf the Congress gets to fight on as it struggles to retain its pan-India electoral footprint, having lost governments in MP, Karnataka and Puducherry.The Congress party is in power on its own in Punjab, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh and in an alliance in Maharashtra and Jharkhand.The grand old party faces the challenge of performing well at the hustings in these polls or run the risk of losing its relevance as the principal opposition party, a leader said."Winning these elections is very crucial as it would give the Congress the much-needed confidence to emerge as a stronger opposition force against the Narendra Modi-led BJP," said the leader.It will also boost the Congress' prospects as it enters the next phase of electoral battles in Uttarakhand, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh in 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-faces-uphill-battle-in-poll-bound-states-101614524372475.html

So, our ground officials can concentrate more on that specific time,” a ministry spokesperson said.It also measures the socio-economic impact in terms of saving fuel, wait time and carbon footprint…It also measures external impact like change in weather (rain, fog its), festival season (Diwali, Holi) impact of traffic movement to create advance advisory and preparedness. It also helps to measure the traffic pattern at toll plazas and can compare it with the daily, weekly, monthly pattern,” he added.The Centre has made FASTags mandatory from February 15 midnight and any vehicle not fitted with it will be charged double the toll at electronic toll plazas across the country, as per the current rules.Following the mandatory payment of user fee through FASTags at the toll plazas the electronic toll collection has reached more than ₹100 crore per day, according to NHAI. As on February 25, the toll collection through FASTags reached the highest ever mark of ₹103.94 crore with over 64.5 lakh daily transactions.There have been several reports of long waiting queues across toll plazas since the mandatory FASTag roll out, officials said the live-monitoring system will ensure the initial hurdles are taken care of.“The live monitoring system is also designed to give a forecast of daily traffic for better toll plaza operation and management. It gives improvement suggestions, by automatically changing the lanes according to traffic density. So, the unused perishable road inventory can be utilized. It has an escalation and alert system, which will automatically intimate the problem via SMS/email to ground officials,” a ministry official said.It also gives the list of worst and best-performing toll plazas (on a daily, weekly and monthly basis) which will be analysed by the authorities.“It is simple and will help to improve traffic congestion problem at toll plazas/city roads/highways by using central monitoring system along with bundle of analytics and quick decision-making outputs,” the ministry spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-to-begin-live-monitoring-for-toll-plazas-to-measure-queues-waiting-time-101614521478027.html

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader was speaking at a Kisan Mahapanchayat in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh.He termed these new laws as a “death warrant” for farmers. Kejriwal said the farmers were in a “do or die” battle because they felt the government would hand over their land to corporates and they would become labourers on their own land.The chief minister said that all the governments in the past 70 years cheated farmers on their demand for an appropriate price for their crops, “but nothing happens after elections”.He also indicated that farmers had nothing to do with the violence that took place on Republic Day at Red Fort during the farmers' tractor rally.“What happened at Red Fort on January 26 was organised by them,” he said without mentioning any names.Also read: 6 states contributed to 86.37% of new Covid-19 cases, says govt“People met me thereafter and told (me) that protesters were deliberately diverted from the prescribed route and those who hoisted a flag at Red Fort were their workers. Our farmers can be anything but anti-nationals,” he added.Kejriwal demanded that fake cases should not be registered against farmers.He also presented a formula for giving a guarantee to purchase 23 crops at minimum support price (MSP).Kejriwal said that every day BJP leaders claimed MSP existed and it would remain.“I challenge Yogiji (UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath) to mention to me one mandi (market) in UP where crops were purchased at MSP,” he said.The Delhi chief minister also spoke about the issues of sugarcane payment, escalating electricity bills, rising prices of fuel and fertilizers.He appealed to the gathering to bring a government with clear intentions in the state and solve all their problems.“Bring a government with clear intentions and farmers would receive the payment before reaching their home after supplying sugarcane to mills,” he said as the crowd hailed him with slogans like “Arvind Kejriwal zindabad (long live Arvind Kejriwal)” and “desh ka neta kaisa ho Arvind Kejriwal jaisa ho (nation's leader should be like Kejriwal)”.The Aam Aadmi Party has already announced it would contest the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections due in February-March next year.Kejriwal said he was the first person who contacted Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait after he burst into tears because of the “atrocities” on farmers at the Ghazipur border.“I was the first person to contact Rakesh Tikait on the phone and made arrangements for drinking water and toilets for the farmers on his appeal,” the AAP chief said.Referring to the Delhi government’s free electricity scheme, he said, “I was also under tremendous pressure and told that power companies were powerful, therefore, we can't do much to minimise power cuts and providing free electricity. But we did that.”AAP Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh, local farmer leaders and the party's state president Sabhajeet Singh shared the dais with Kejriwal. Sanjay Singh and Sabhajeet Singh had visited many leaders of khaps (clan-based councils) to mobilise support for the mahapanchayat.The stage had photographs of former Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh, one of the tallest farmer leaders of the country, and the late BKU chief Mahendra Singh Tikait.Kejriwal ended his speech with the slogan “Chaudhary Charan Singh Amar Rahe”.He also honoured khap chaudharies (khap leaders) on the stage and sought their blessings.Farmers have been protesting on the different borders of the national capital since November 26 against the three newly enacted farm laws - Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-agriculture-reform-laws-death-warrant-for-farmers-delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwal-101614523019519.html

Senior citizens and those who are 45+ and suffering from co-morbidities will be able to register themselves.Co-Win 2.0 is not a new app. It's an upgrade of the existing app through which the government conducted the first phase of vaccination. For this upgrade, vaccination was stalled on Saturday and Sunday.Here is how you can access the app and register yourself> Cowin 2.0 can be accessed in three ways. You can go to cowin.gov.in, the website and look for the tab where self-registration is allowed (will be live only after the second phase is kicked off)> The app can be accessed through the Aarogya Setu app as well as a separate tab> The app can be downloaded from the Google play store.Private hospitals can't charge more than ₹250 per dose of vaccine> If one does not have access to the internet, spot registration is also allowed in this phase.

This also comes with the threat of fake sites, applications trying to dupe people. Hence, the government has been urging people to only follow official information.This is also the first time the vaccine shots will be available at private hospitals. The government has fixed the price of vaccines at ₹250 per shot and has also released a list of hospitals, which will become vaccination centres from tomorrow.Several glitches were reported in the Co-Win app as the app was launched on January 16. But the government said it worked continuously to resolve those technical issues.In the first phase where healthcare staff and frontline workers have been inoculated, the registration was done internally from the records provided by departments concerned. The ministry has said it has already trained vaccinations to handle the new version of the application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-will-co-win-2-0-be-launched-how-to-register-101614518333515.html

When the entire laws are black then they should be taken back. They (Centre) want to lock grains inside a locker, want to do business on hunger in the country, then that will not happen," the farmer leader said."It is necessary to hold mahapanchayats across the country because this is the problem of the entire nation. Dharna will also continue alongside these panchayats. As of now, we have planned programs till March 24. We will travel across the country," Tikait said.He also asserted that the 'dharna' will continue as the government has not agreed with the farmers' demands.On February 24, addressing a Kisan mahapanchayat in Rajasthan's Sikar, Tikait had threatened the Central Government and said that if the three laws are not repealed, the farmers will 'gherao' the Parliament on 40 lakh tractors.Farmers have been protesting on the different borders of the national capital since November 26 against the three newly enacted farm laws - Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keep-tractors-ready-as-you-may-have-to-reach-delhi-anytime-rakesh-tikait-101614518304524.html

Arrangements are also in place to incorporate the third prioritized group in the upcoming days.Gauba had asked all the states and union territories to closely monitor the trajectory of Covid infections to prevent surge in cases and assiduously expedite vaccination of priority groups. Chief secretaries of some other states participated in the meeting.Subrahmanyan informed the meeting that Jammu and Kashmir is conducting mandatory universal tests on all incoming travelers.He said that Jammu and Kashmir saw a 40% surge in weekly cases with travellers contributing to 2/3rd of all the positive cases. “In Srinagar district alone 50% of recorded positive cases were travellers,” Subrahmanyan was quoted as saying.The government spokesman did not say which week the chief secretary was referring to and to which it was comparing.However when HT compiled the government’s Covid-19 data for the current month, it found that the surge was not 40% but only around 21%. The data reveals that the UT recorded 403 cases in the first week of February, 432 cases in the second week, 526 cases in the third week and 574 cases in the last week.

28-02-2021||India||1 cr more free LPG connections planned in next 2 yrs: Oil secretary||The free LPG connection scheme is one structural reform of the Modi government that has been internationally acclaimed for ridding indoor household pollution and improving women's health.And now, the government plans to give one crore more free LPG connections to the needy over the next two years and make it easier to access cooking gas to achieve near 100 per cent penetration of the clean fuel in the country.Oil Secretary Tarun Kapoor said plans are in the works to provide LPG connection with bare-minimum identity documents and without insisting on residence proof of the place of availing the cooking gas.Also, consumers would soon get a choice of getting a refill cylinder from three dealers in his or her neighbourhood instead of being tied to just one distributor, who may not be able to provide LPG on demand due to availability or other reasons.In an interview with PTI, Kapoor said a record-breaking 8 crore free LPG connections were provided to poor women households in just four years alongside the aggressive rollout of cooking gas, taking the number of LPG users in the country to about 29 crore.The Union Budget earlier this month announced a plan to give out one crore more free cooking gas connections under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala (PMUY) scheme."Our plan is to complete these additional one crore connections in two years," he said.While no separate allocation for this has been made in the Budget for 2021-22, the general fuel subsidy allocation should be enough to cover the expense of about ₹1,600 per connection, he said."We have done a preliminary estimate of the people who are now left out. The number comes to 1 crore," he said. "After the successful Ujjwala scheme, households without LPG are very less in India. We have around 29 crore households with LPG connections. With the one crore connections, we will be close to 100 per cent LPG penetration."He, however, hastened to add that one crore unserved population was a dynamic number and there may be more families that may need LPG connections as they move to cities or other places for employment and other reasons.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's signature Ujjwala scheme for providing a free cooking gas connection to the poor had been lauded by the WHO in 2018 and by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in the following year as one that reduced indoor household pollution by helping families switch to cleaner energy sources and improving the environment and health of women.The carbon footprint of LPG is 50 per cent lower than coal. LPG helps reduce carbon dioxide and black carbon emissions, which are the second-largest contributors to global warming.Before Ujjwala, India was the second-largest contributor to global mortality due to household and ambient air pollution."We want to connect everyone in the country to the LPG network," Kapoor said. "Besides Ujjwala, we are also easing out the procedure for getting LPG connections."While theoretically, the current rule is that everyone is eligible to get a cooking gas connection, practically it is difficult to get one due to requirements such as proof of residence of the place, where the connection is being sought."We have asked our oil companies that those kinds of complaints should be eliminated. A person who is even shifting from one city to another, even temporarily, should also be able to get an LPG connection without hassles. We want to move to a stage where with very basic documents, just some proof of identity, one can get an LPG connection," he said.As a step towards that, a unified software for all the three fuel marketing companies - Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum - is being prepared."We are getting a common information technology-based system in place. Right now, the three companies have their separate IT-based systems. We also want to popularise the mobile applications that our companies have so that no one has to keep a physical booklet," he said.Through this software, inter-company migration will become very easy, he said, adding in cities a person would have a choice of seeking an LPG refill from three distributors of the same company.The Ujjwala Yojana was launched in May 2016 with a target to give free LPG connections to 5 crore mostly rural women members of below the poverty line (BPL) households. The list was later expanded to include all SC/ST households and forest dwellers, among others.In 2018, the scheme was extended to all poor households and the target raised to 8 crore connections.Under the scheme, the government provides a subsidy of ₹1,600 to state-owned fuel retailers for every free LPG gas connection that they give to poor households. This subsidy is intended to cover the security fee for the cylinder and the fitting charges.The beneficiary has to buy her own cooking stove. To reduce the burden, the scheme allows beneficiaries to pay for the stove and the first refill in monthly instalments. However, the cost of all subsequent refills has to be borne by the beneficiary household.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-cr-more-free-lpg-connections-planned-in-next-2-yrs-oil-secretary-101614499682360.html

We intercepted a car and recovered a tiger skin when we searched the car after," Hemant Kathait, in-charge, Chalthi outpost in Champawat said.The two men were identified as Basant Bhatt, a resident of Amori and Mahendra Singh of Diwuri village (both under Champawat police station).A forest official estimated that the tiger was about 7 years old. It measured around 1.7 metres in length.The accused claimed that they had found the tiger’s carcass in the forest area of Diwuri some time ago. Instead of informing forest officials they skinned the carcass to earn money and were going to sell it on Saturday when they were caught, the police said.The recovery of leopard hides is common in Kumaon but a tiger’s hide was recovered after a gap of three years in the area. Forest officials had nabbed two wildlife smugglers in December 2017 for possessing a tiger skin and 8.33 kg its bones. Both were from Lakhimpur Kheri area of Uttar Pradesh. They were entering from Nepal when they were nabbed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-men-arrested-with-tiger-hide-in-uttarakhand-s-champawat-district-101614511846738.html

If farmers who provide us with food can put up such a gallant fight, we too can do it here," he said."This grand alliance of the Left and the secular forces will fight to defeat the corrupt TMC government and the BJP in the state, will fight for a better Bengal," Yechury said while addressing a joint rally at the Brigade Parade Ground in Kolkata ahead of the assembly election in West Bengal.The CPI(M) leader alleged that the Mamata Banerjee administration is doing the same to youths what the Narendra Modi government is doing against the farmers."Many people ask me what we would do in case of a hung assembly. I tell them to direct their question to the TMC as they are in the best position to answer it."The TMC has been part of NDA (for several years) since 1998. It was part of the NDA government (at the Centre). In case of a hung assembly, I am confident that the TMC would join hands with the BJP to form the state's government," he said."All the secular forces have to fight together to defeat the TMC and the BJP in Bengal. Once we stop this communal juggernaut in Bengal, we will stop it in the country also," Yechury said.He claimed that the BJP and the TMC are using religion to divert attention from the problems being faced by the people of the country and the state.Criticising the BJP for attacking several other political parties, especially the Congress, over the issue of dynasty politics, Yechury wondered how Union Home Minister Amit Shahs son became the secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)."The BJP talks about corruption and dynasty politics. A stadium is named after Narendra Modi. Amit Shah's son is an office-bearer in the cricket association," he said."In the name of the corona, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set up a fund (PM CARES Fund), and that money is being used to buy and sell leaders during elections," he said.A number of leaders from various parties, mainly the ruling TMC, have joined the saffron camp ahead of the West Bengal assembly election.The CPI(M) general secretary asserted that West Bengal is headed for a triangular fight in the coming assembly polls as the Left-Congress electoral alliance is a formidable contender against the TMC and the BJP.Elections to the West Bengal assembly will be held in eight phases. The first and last phase of polling will be held on March 27 and April 29 respectively. Votes will be counted on May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-to-join-hands-with-bjp-again-in-case-of-hung-assembly-in-bengal-yechury-101614510490331.html

I am going to work doubly hard for water conservation," said Rajput, who is a second year student of the Bachelor of Arts course.The woman, a resident of the parched Bundelkhand area in MP, decided to revive the lake after her village, located about 100 km from the district headquarters, faced water crisis in 2018.Rajput said in January 2019, she along with 200 to 250 women from the village started digging a canal from a hill located nearby to channelise rain water through it into the lake and accomplished the task in 18 months.Last year, the village received rains only twice, but the lake had enough water for the needs of residents following the efforts made by Rajput and other women, some locals said.The villagers lauded Rajput's efforts towards easing their water woes.Rajput further said she belongs to a poor family and is studying in a college close to her village."My family can't afford to send me to a big city for higher studies," she said.The woman said she is now working on routing water to the lake from the other side of the hill with a canal so that it has sufficient water stock round the year.Rajput and other women from the village are also working on a project to make prudent use of water in agricultural fields.Chhatarpur's Bada Malhera Janpad Chief Executive Officer Ajay Singh said more work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) would be carried out at the lake to ensure it has ample water stock in the summer season.In his 'Mann Ki Baat' broadcast, Modi called for a 100-day campaign to clean up all water bodies and prepare them for rain water harvesting before the monsoon season starts.In this regard, the Union Jal Shakti Ministry is also launching the 'Catch the rain' campaign and its main theme is "catch the rain, where it falls, when it falls", he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-elated-as-pm-lauds-her-for-reviving-dried-lake-in-mp-101614510789713.html

The Left Democratic Front (LDF) in Kerala is strengthening day by day. Even in West Bengal, BJP can not win due to the havoc that they have created with relation to Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA)."He said that the elections in West Bengal will be fought between Congress-Left Front and All India Trinamool Congress (TMC) with BJP nowhere in the competition.He also alleged that the Central government is trying to close public sector banks and industries to aid the growth of the private sector."For the upcoming MLC elections in Telangana, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) has announced Vani Devi, daughter of late PV Narasimha Rao as their candidate because they knew that they are going to face defeat in the elections. They are using the name and fame of PV Narasimha Rao," Narayana said."Both the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh YS Jagan Mohan Reddy and the opposition leader N Chandrababu Naidu must come together to protect the Visakha Steel Plant, the pride of Andhra people," said the CPI leader.Narayana said that the Left parties are supporting a state-wide bandh in Andhra Pradesh on March 5 to ensure that the public sector continues in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-will-fail-in-all-5-upcoming-state-elections-says-cpi-national-secretary-101614509433887.html

The satellite has also started communicating with the ground systems, government sources told ANI.The satellite, if required, can also help in carrying out surveillance in specific areas such as the South China Sea or the pirate-infested areas near the Gulf of Aden and the African coast, the sources said.They added that the Sindhu Netra is one of the first in the series of satellites that would help the nation in enhancing its surveillance capabilities on land in areas such as the Ladakh region with China and the border areas with Pakistan.Seeking to keep a closer eye on the activities of the Chinese military both near the Indian territory as well as in its depth areas all along the 4,000 kilometre Line of Actual Control (LAC), the Indian security agencies feel there is a requirement of four to six dedicated satellites which can help them keep a check on the adversary's moves.Along with the setting up of the Defence Space Agency, the government also created a defence space research organisation to look after the ability to protect space assets from being attacked by adversaries there. The space arm of the defence forces would also be bolstered significantly in near future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdo-deploys-surveillance-satellite-will-help-to-monitor-indian-ocean-region-101614509463927.html

It is heartening to see residents availing free and cashless benefits from reputed empanelled hospitals of Jammu and Kashmir.”The scheme was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in J-K on December 26.The Sehat scheme in convergence with PM-JAY aims to provide universal health insurance coverage of ₹5 lakh per family on a floater basis. ABPM-JAY Sehat has the same benefits as available under PM-JAY, Dulloo said.The scheme covers all residents of Jammu and Kashmir, including employees and pensioners of the UT administration and their families, he said.The scheme covers up to three days of pre-hospitalisation and 15 days post-hospitalisation expenses, such as diagnostics and medicines, of a beneficiary patient, Dulloo said."Benefits of the scheme are portable across the country i.e. a beneficiary can visit any of the more than 24,000 empanelled public or private hospitals (including 229 hospitals empanelled within union territory of Jammu and Kashmir) under ABPM-JAY in India to avail cashless treatment," he said."A network of more than 5,000 CSCs are up and working in J-K.

That is one of the main reasons why we are part of the toys fair.""Because we could be a large buyer and of course, it is contingent on meeting standards and design thoughts… but we feel that there is a great opportunity for us to come together with some potential suppliers as part of the player as well," she added.In India, 80 per cent of the households live with children."IKEA has a fairly large range of over 1,000 products as part of its children's range, which contributes around 6-8 per cent currently, and we aim to reach 10-12 per cent in the near future," Rao said.Also read: IKEA's malls arm plans first India site on outskirts of DelhiBesides toys, the range covers beds and mattresses specifically made for children, ergonomic storage and seating solutions made for a child, among others.IKEA said the India Toy Fair would help it connect with new partners and understand the ecosystem here."That is also the reason why we are participating in the toy fair, organised by the Government of India because it gives us an opportunity to also understand what the ecosystem is," she added.Besides cotton, IKEA is sensing an opportunity to source wooden toys for its stores."If you look at our range, we do have a range of wooden-based toys. So, if we had the opportunity to source some of that from India, we would definitely like to explore it," said Rao.However, she also added that IKEA with forestry-certified wood, as it always sources from sustainable sources.Recently, the government has created eight toy clusters with some significant investments in that space."We feel that it is a great approach because it will also give us the opportunity to look at possibilities for sourcing toys locally, from within India as well," she said adding that "this is a huge initiative and a big focus area for us".IKEA is working on new categories like furniture, mattress and sofas, besides building the textiles category which India is traditionally strong.Under the FDI policy for single-brand retailers, a local sourcing requirement of 30 per cent of the value of goods is mandated. This can be met as an average during the first five years, and thereafter annually towards its Indian operations.However, in August 2019, the government amended the provision by adding that all procurements made from India by a single-brand retailer for that brand shall be counted towards local sourcing, irrespective of whether the goods procured are sold in India or exported.IKEA has been sourcing from India for its global operations for close to 35 years. It is working with around 60 suppliers. IKEA India had opened its second retail store in Mumbai last December and is working on its next store in Bengaluru.Part of Ingka Group, IKEA India had opened its first retail store in Hyderabad in August 2018, followed by online stores in Mumbai, Hyderabad and Pune.On Saturday, while inaugurating the first India Toy Fair 2021, Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked the toy manufacturers to use less plastic and more eco-friendly material, in addition to focus on innovation.He regretted that India's share in the USD 100-billion global toy market is very less, and about 85 per cent of the toys sold in the country are imported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ikea-india-aims-for-12-per-cent-of-global-retail-sales-in-kids-products-101614500449779.html
28-02-2021||India||Arrival of 'sticky bombs' in Kashmir sets off alarm bells||Security forces battling a decades-long insurgency in Indian-controlled Kashmir are alarmed by the recent arrival in the disputed region of small, magnetic bombs that have wreaked havoc in Afghanistan."Sticky bombs", which can be attached to vehicles and detonated remotely, have been seized during raids in recent months in the federally administered region of Jammu and Kashmir, three senior security officials told Reuters."These are small IEDs and quite powerful," said Kashmir Valley police chief Vijay Kumar, referring to improvised explosive devices. "It will certainly impact the present security scenario as volume and frequency of vehicular movements of police and security forces are high in Kashmir Valley."The Indian government flooded Kashmir, already one of the world's most militarised regions, with more troops in August 2019, when it split the country's only Muslim-majority state into two federally administered territories.The arrival of the sticky bombs in India-controlled Kashmir - including 15 seized in a February raid - raises concerns that an unnerving tactic attributed to the Taliban insurgents in nearby Afghanistan could be spreading to the India-Pakistan conflict.Afghanistan in recent months has seen a series of sticky-bomb attacks targeting security forces, judges, government officials, civil society activists and journalists. The attacks - some as victims sat in traffic - have sown fear, while avoiding substantial civilian casualties.None of the devices seized in Kashmir was produced there, a senior security official said, suggesting they were being smuggled from Pakistan. "All of them have come via drone drops and tunnels," he said, asking not to be named.Kashmir has long been a flashpoint between nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan, which each claim all of the Himalayan region but rule only parts of it.India accuses Pakistan of backing the insurgency in Kashmir, which has claimed tens of thousands of lives since the 1990s. Pakistan denies the charge, saying it gives only moral and diplomatic support to Kashmiri people fighting for self-determination.New Delhi has attempted to maintain a tight grip over the Kashmir Valley, where high-speed mobile internet was suspended for 18 months until earlier in February, but the insurgency has simmered on.Officials said the bombs are particularly worrying because they can be easily attached to vehicles using magnets, potentially allowing militants to carry out assassinations or target military convoys that regularly criss-cross the valley.In February 2019, a suicide bomber drove a car laden with explosives into a convoy in Kashmir's Pulwama, killing 40 soldiers - the deadliest attack on Indian forces in the region - bringing India and Pakistan to the brink of another war.Police chief Kumar said that security forces were changing protocols to deal with the new threat. The measures included increasing the distance between private and military traffic, installing more cameras on vehicles and using drones to monitor convoys.A difference between militants in Kashmir and Afghanistan is that the Taliban have tremendous ability to move around in urban and rural areas, which, along with the easier availability of explosives, make the bombs a potent threat.The Taliban, which initially said it was behind some of the attacks, has since denied any involvement in the attacks."The Taliban has targets, can reach them, and kill them with impunity. The whole structure of the attack - and its endless repetition - is what makes the bomb effective," said Avinash Paliwal, a senior lecturer in international relations at SOAS University of London."In Kashmir, the space for such ability to manoeuvre with ease is limited."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arrival-of-sticky-bombs-in-kashmir-sets-off-alarm-bells-101614507407763.html
28-02-2021||India||'Centre can buy farm produce at MSP', says Kejriwal; shares formula||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday addressed a 'Kisan Mahapanchayat' in Meerut in Uttar Pradesh where he lashed out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government. He said that farmers who are protesting for their livelihood have been branded as traitors.He also said that these protesters have braved biting cold and water cannons, but are still continuing their protest because it's a do-or-die situation for them. He also termed the three farm laws as "black laws".Kejriwal then focussed his attention on the issue of Minimum Support Price (MSP), which is one of the main demands of the protesters. The farmers want the system of MSP to continue, but the AAP chief claimed Centre doesn't want to buy crops at MSP.He then shared a formula how it can be done. "I heard from a central minister that buying crops at MSP us not possible because it will cost the government ₹17 lakh crore. But I have a formula using which the government won't have to spend a penny. You say ₹17 lakh crore will be spent but farmers are not asking the money for free, they will give you their crops," said Kejriwal.Further elaborating, the AAP chief said, "If the government buys the farm produce, it will sell it in the market, right? The government will sometime get ₹18 lakh crore, even ₹20 lakh crore. And at other times, it can also result in some loss and the government could earn ₹16 lakh crore," said Kejriwal."I think the government can afford a loss of ₹1-1.5 lakh crore, but keep the families of crores of farmers happy. All the losses will be recovered in 10-15 years," he added.He shared the steps taken by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi to regulate price of electricity. "I was told not to make tall promises of bringing down the rate of electricity in Delhi as the discoms are very powerful. But as you can see, our government fulfilled its promise in five years," said Kejriwal.He said that AAP was able to achieve the target because of its good intention."The Centre can waive ₹8 lakh crore of some of its friends, so why can't it implement this formula? That's because they don't have the good intention," the chief minister said.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh demanding the rollback of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the MSP system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations. They are also demanding a law to guarantee that.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assured the farmers that the MSP system will continue. Speaking in the Rajya Sabha earlier this month, PM Modi had said the mandis in the nation would be modernised.“MSP was there. MSP is there. MSP will remain in the future. Affordable ration for the poor will continue. Mandis will be modernised," the Prime Minister had said.PM Modi also said that the central government has been making changes in the agriculture sector since 2014, aimed at improving the lives of the farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-can-buy-farm-produce-at-msp-says-kejriwal-shares-formula-101614507020443.html
28-02-2021||India||'Could not see his tears': What Kejriwal said on farmer leader Rakesh Tikait||Addressing a Kisan Mahapanchayat in Meerut, a stronghold of the Tikaits, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said he reached out to Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait, one of the farmers’ leaders spearheading the protests against the three central farm laws, after he was manhandled by the police in January this year."I could not believe what I saw on television on January 28. India's famous farmer leader Baba Mahendra Singh Tikait's son who has been protesting on Delhi borders for so long for farmers was crying after the police sent by the government misbehaved with him. He has everything by god's grace but what he is doing is only for the farmers," Kejriwal said"I called Sanjay ji (Sanjay Singh) and he made me talk to Rakeshji. I told him don't worry, we are with you. I asked him what he needs. I asked him to be strong, not to worry. He said the Ghazipur site needs water and toilet infrastructure. We send our MLAs at night and ensured the needful was done. I told him don't give up, the entire country is watching you," Kejriwal said.After Republic Day violence, which Kejriwal said was orchestrated by BJP, sullied the image of the so-far peaceful protest of the farmers, protesters at Ghazipur border were asked to vacate the site by the Ghaziabad administration. As the crowd started becoming thin, Bharatiya Kisan Union spokesperson Rakesh Tikait broke down and his emotional appeal revived the energy of the protest.Coming down heavily on the BJP, the Delhi CM said Red Fort violence was staged. He said farmers didn't know the roads of Delhi. "Those who reached Red Fort and hoisted flag were BJP workers. Our farmers can be anything but anti-nationals," Kejriwal said.Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party announced that it would contest in the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh in 2022. His highly charged address at Meerut Kisan Mahapanchayat also came as a poll pitch, as he enumerated the welfare steps that his government has taken in Delhi.Taking on Yogi Adityanath government, Kejriwal said, "Show me one mandi where minimum support price is there. BJP ministers are claiming everywhere that MSP is there and will always be there. I want to ask the Yogi government to show me where it is implemented.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/could-not-see-his-tears-what-kejriwal-said-on-farmer-leader-rakesh-tikait-101614506590283.html

28-02-2021||India||New social media rules may raise compliance cost, make competition tough for smaller companies: Industry execs||The new social media intermediary rules could raise compliance costs for players, making it difficult for smaller companies to compete against bigger giants like Facebook, according to industry watchers.The new rules, announced last week, distinguish between 'social media intermediaries' and 'significant social media intermediaries' with 50 lakh registered users as the threshold for the categorisation.Significant social media intermediaries will have to follow additional due diligence, including the appointment of a chief compliance officer, nodal contact person and resident grievance officer - with all three officials residing in India.Large players like Facebook have said they are studying the rules.While many in the sector have lauded the new regulations, saying these aim to address concerns like grievance redressal, fake news and online safety of users, a section of the industry has aired concerns around increased compliance cost that could be challenging for smaller players.Software Freedom Law Centre (SFLC) founder Mishi Choudhary said the rules call for an undue burden and compliance and "ensure only larger players with funds and wherewithal of big legal teams are the only ones who will be left to offer services"."(This could result in) increasing the barrier for entry and raising compliance costs for everyone," she added.India has 53 crore WhatsApp users, 44.8 crore YouTube users, 41 crore Facebook users, 21 crore use Instagram, while 1.75 crore users are on microblogging platform Twitter, as per government data.While players like Telegram and Signal do not disclose country-specific user numbers, these platforms have seen a spike in downloads in the last few weeks on the back of concerns around WhatsApp's privacy policy update that seeks to allow sharing limited user data with Facebook and its group firms.Telegram did not respond to queries on the impact of the new rules on the platform.Industry observers noted that players like Telegram and others may not have senior officials based in India and that they will now have to take a series of steps to ensure compliance with the new norms as their business scales up and user base grows in India.According to the amended IT rules, social media and streaming companies will be required to take down contentious content quicker, appoint grievance redressal officers and assist in investigations.The "Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code" designed to curb misuse of social media platforms require players like WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter as well as streaming services such as Netflix, YouTube and Amazon Prime Video to appoint executives to coordinate with law enforcement, disclose the first originator of provocative content and remove, within 24 hours, content depicting nudity or morphed pictures of women.Any contentious content flagged by the government or legal order has to be taken down within 36 hours.An industry executive, who did not wish to be named, said some companies may choose to protect the privacy of users and challenge these rules in court.Also, the industry feels that there needs to be clarity on nuances like how long do users have to be active to be counted as registered users, and what happens if a platform drops below the threshold of 50 lakh registered users.Rameesh Kailasam, CEO of IndiaTech.org, had also cautioned that while these rules are robust and elaborate, it may translate into a certain degree of cost and operational challenges with it.Nasscom had noted that it is imperative that there is a balance between regulation and innovation as the world is in a phase of accelerated technology shifts.The industry body had also pointed out that there is a need for "responsible use" and building of technology for all stakeholders - government, industry, startups and citizens.The option of voluntary self-verification of user accounts, the right to receive an explanatory notification on removal or disablement of access, and to seek remedy against the action being taken by the intermediaries would be helpful for end-users, Nasscom had said.The association had also said the government has emphasised that the new rules will not curb creativity, and freedom of speech and expression of citizens as it urged the government to ensure that this is the 'design principle' followed during implementation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-social-media-rules-may-raise-compliance-cost-make-competition-tough-for-smaller-companies-industry-execs-101614503578855.html

"The Centre is behind the Red Fort violence, not the farmers. It misguided the farmers who did not know Delhi roads," Kejriwal said while addressing a 'Kisan Mahapanchayat' in Meerut.The AAP chief added that he is aware of what happened on the day the farmers took out a tractor parade, saying he is the chief minister of the Union territory. "The farmers of our country are unhappy. It has been more than 90 days that they have been protesting near Delhi along with their families. More than 250 farmers have died in these three months but the Centre has done nothing about it," Kejriwal said.Click here for full coverage of farmers' protestAmid slogans of ‘Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan (Long Live Farmers, Long Live Soldiers)' and ‘Kala Kanoon Vapas Lo (Repeal The Black Laws)’, the AAP leader said that the protesting farmers faced atrocities which were not meted out even during the British rule. "And now, false cases are being slapped on protesters. Our farmers can be anything but not traitors. However, they have faced sedition charges. One son of the country is defending the country's borders, the other is at the border of Delhi," he said.The ' Kisan Mahapanchayat' or the farmers’ meeting comes months after the AAP's announcement that it would contest the assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh in 2022. The address was initially supposed to begin at 11am but was delayed. Earlier in the day, AAP’s Rajya Sabha lawmaker Sanjay Singh posted a video on Twitter in which he is seen talking about the "three black laws", and said Kejriwal will join the cause of the farmers who are protesting against these laws.The AAP chief has been vocal in his support to the farmers. On Sunday, he said that these "black laws are like a death warrant for farmers". The party also plans to organise a 'Kisan Mahasammelan' in Punjab's Moga district on March 21.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at the borders of the national capital since November 26 last year.

This technology works with closer proximity in 2G environment.Senior police officials said the IPDR and call data records of Parra, who was arrested by Criminal Investigation (Kashmir), a subsidiary of CID of Jammu and Kashmir Police, are being scrutinised.During the hearing of Parra's bail plea on Monday, the police had informed the special NIA court in Srinagar that cell phones and other gadgets seized from his residence had been sent to forensic experts."CDR/IPDR in respect of some phones of the accused has been obtained and are being analysed. During preliminary analysis, it has emerged that (Parra) had contacts across the border suspected to be his associates and handlers in Pakistan..."During the course of investigation undertaken so far, it has surfaced that the accused (Parra) has been in constant touch with a number of militants," the court was informed.The IDPR, according to a research paper by IIT professor Ranjan Bose, Computer Science student at the University of Maryland Adya V Joshi, who did internship with Delhi Police in 2017-18, and senior IPS officer Madan Oberoi, currently executive director with Interpol, correlates the mobile users with other users of encrypted messaging service to make explicit the implicit call graphs in this data."When two suspects are talking to each other on WhatsApp, analysing their GPRS CDRs will reveal that both are connected to WhatsApp. The reverse is of course not true. Just because two people are connected to WhatsApp at the same time does not mean that they are talking to one another," the research paper stated."However, the more two people are on WhatsApp at the same time, the higher the probability that they are talking to one another. This means that by correlating two GPRS CDRs, we can see how often two suspects are using the same service at the same time, and potentially inferring that they are connected to each other," it said.The research paper was submitted by the trio at the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), world's leading professional organisation having over 4 lakh members from 160 countries during its 4th International Conference on Collaboration and Internet Computing (CIC) in 2018.Taking a cue from this technology, the police are analysing Parra's phones and have sought time from the court citing scrutiny of voluminous records made available by FSL experts, the officials said.This would serve as corroborative evidence in the case, they said.In the court, Parra's counsel had denied all charges and claimed that his client, who won the District Development Council elections last year, was being made a political scapegoat.The Criminal Investigation (Kashmir), a branch of CID mandated to probe cases under the Unlawful Activities and Prevention Act (UAPA) and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), had filed a case last year against unknown politicians and others based on "reliable and confidential sources" who said some political functionaries were misusing their power and helping militants.These politicians, as part of a criminal conspiracy, had established clandestine connections and relations with different Pakistan-supported terrorist and secessionist organisations operating in Jammu and Kashmir for a number of reasons.The conspiracy was hatched for furthering their political clout among local populace, countering the influence of rival political parties and their members, protecting their own financial and business interests and with medium-term motives of winning the trust of "the Pakistani establishment, dealing with subversion in Kashmir, including those in the United Jihad Council".These politicians have supported the terrorists and secessionists, directly and sometimes through middlemen, by the way of paying money and organising select physical attacks through terrorist elements.They also facilitated movements of terrorists and transportation of their arms and ammunition.In furtherance of the criminal conspiracy, these "unprincipled political parties functionaries" assisted and aided the terrorists and secessionists in intensifying the war against the Union of India with the main objective of ultimately making Jammu and Kashmir cede from the Union."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-police-carrying-out-ipdr-analysis-of-phones-seized-from-pdp-leader-101614501917784.html

Union minister for road, transport and highways Nitin Gadkari congratulated IJM India, a subsidiary of Malaysia's IJM Construction Berhad, and officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for completing the project.Gadkari also congratulated all the workers who contributed to achieving this massive feat as he said this will be recorded in the Limca Book of Records. "500 employees of the contractor company have worked hard for this. I congratulate the project directors, officers, contractor company representatives and project officials of the National Highways Authority, including those employees," the minister tweet, roughly translated from Hindi, read.राष्ट्रीय राजमार्ग प्राधिकरण (@NHAI_Official) ने हाल ही में सोलापुर-विजापुर राजमार्ग पर 4-लेनिंग कार्य के अंतर्गत 25.54 किलोमीटर के सिंगल लेन डांबरीकरण कार्य को 18 घंटे में पूरा किया है, जिसे 'लिम्का बुक ऑफ रेकॉर्ड्स' में दर्ज किया जाएगा। pic.twitter.com/tP6ACFGblPM Venkateswar Rao, the IJM India team leader for the project, said the project faced many technical and logistical challenges during the course of its construction. It was a task to cover an approximate distance of 18,701km in less than 18 hours by all the vehicles put together, he said according to media reports.Noting the feat, Gadkari also said that the Solapur-Bijapur highway will be completed by October 2021. "Currently 110 km of Solapur-Vijapur highway is in progress which will be completed by October 2021," the minister tweeted.The concept of measuring individual lanes instead of the total highway was taken into account by the government in 2018. Under this method, in order to measure the length of the highway, the length of each lane constructed is measured instead of the total overall length.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderabad-firm-eyes-record-builds-25-54km-lane-in-less-than-18-hours-101614498788855.html

28-02-2021||India||Will send BJP back to Nagpur: Rahul Gandhi in poll-bound Tamil Nadu||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday in a renewed attack compared Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government with the British empire and said India has fought greater powers and in comparison, the fight against the Modi-led dispensation is nothing. "The people of India sent back the British empire. We will too send Modi back to Nagpur, that too without any hatred, anger and violence. They can spit on us, kick and abuse but we will not do any such thing," Gandhi said.Gandhi was referring to the city in Maharashtra where the Bharatiya Janata Party’s ideological mentor, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), has its headquarters. He made the comments while interacting with professors at St Xavier’s College in Tirunelveli of Tamil Nadu, where assembly elections will be held in April.Also Read | PSLV lifts off with Amazonia-1, 18 other satellites; ISRO says launch successfulAttacking the party at the Centre, Gandhi said the BJP-ruled government wants to take what belongs to people and give it to one or two big businessmen. "They take what belongs to farmers, labourers and teachers and give it to big businesses," he said.During this address, the Congress leader also talked about his party's vision to decentralise education and make it accessible to all. The Wayanad lawmaker slammed the central government for its centralised approach in the National Education Policy and using it as a weapon to communalise. He said that the government needs to provide a level playing field to all religions for free religious discourse.Gandhi said the aim of the secular alliance between the Congress and the DMK, if they come to power, is to make education universal. “We will increase access to education for the poor and women of this country,” Gandhi said while interacting with one of the professors.He also said that the government sees everything—agriculture, healthcare and education—as a financial commodity. He said ₹1.50 thousand lakh crores given by the government to five to six big businesses during the coronavirus pandemic should have been diverted to the education sector to make it accessible for all.The polls for 234 assembly seats in Tamil Nadu are to be held in a single phase on April 6 and votes will be counted on May 2. The Congress-DMK combine and the BJP-AIADMK alliance are the major groups contesting in the assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-send-bjp-back-to-nagpur-rahul-gandhi-in-poll-bound-tamil-nadu-101614495630282.html

28-02-2021||India||Fuel prices may fall by April, says petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan||Union minister for petroleum, natural gas and steel Dharmendra Pradhan said that he has asked his counterparts in petroleum producing countries to increase their oil production so that Indian consumers get relief from soaring fuel prices.“In April last year, major oil-producing countries decided to cut production as there was a sharp fall in demand due to the Covid-19 pandemic. These countries are producing less fuel to make more profit. While less fuel is still being produced, the demand for fuel has reached the point as it was before pre-Covid situation. Therefore, petrol and diesel prices have increased in the country," Pradhan told reporters during an interaction in Varanasi on Saturday evening.“I am in touch with my counterparts of major oil-producing countries and have spoken to them. I have asked them to increase fuel production in order that prices of oil may come down in our country which buys fuel from these countries.”He said that as the largest oil buyer, India is creating pressure on oil-producing countries like Russia, Qatar and Kuwait among others to increase production. When production will increase, the cost of per barrel buying will come down and subsequently retail fuel price will also fall.Asked about a timeline by when prices of diesel, petrol and gas will come down, he said that no one can predict that. “But the prices of cooking gas, diesel and petrol may come down by March or April,” he said.Fuel prices have been on fire this month with oil companies raising petrol and diesel prices 16 times so far. The last upward revision of fuel prices was on Saturday.On Friday, Pradhan had said fuel prices are likely to drop as winter ends and attributed the rising rates to an increase in demand during the season.In Varanasi on Saturday, the minister said that all boats that along the Ganga in the city will now run on CNG for which a CNG station has been set up at Khidkiya Ghat.He also said that his ministry is working to ensure cooking gas connection in every house, in all eastern UP districts from Gorakhpur to Sonbhadra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fuel-prices-may-fall-by-april-says-petroleum-minister-dharmendra-pradhan-101614500206697.html

I want to know from people whether they want a leader who doesn't know that Department of Fisheries has been in existence for two years," Shah said in Karaikal while campaigning for Puducherry election.Rahul Gandhi was on 'vacation' when the NDA set it up in 2019, he added.The Union minister then highlighted the various initiatives taken by the Narendra Modi government at the Centre for the welfare of the fishermen community. He said that the Centre announced ₹20,000 crore in the budget to improve the fisheries infrastructure in the country. "Puducherry will reap the maximum benefit from this scheme," Shah said.Earlier this month, Rahul Gandhi had visited Puducherry where he asked why don’t the fishermen have a ministry in Delhi. “I consider you to be the farmers of the sea. If farmers of the land can have their ministry in Delhi, then why is it that the farmers of the sea don’t have a ministry in Delhi?” Gandhi had said.At a public meeting in Puducherry, Prime Minister had expressed shock over Gandhi's statement. Many BJP leaders and Union ministers too had also taken a swipe at Gandhi.Union minister of fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying Giriraj Singh responded to Gandhi reminding him that the ministry had already been established.Responding to PM Modi's swipe, Gandhi had later tweeted, "Dear PM, Fisherfolk need an independent and dedicated ministry of fisheries, not just a department within a ministry."Dear PM,Fisherfolk need an independent and dedicated ministry of fisheries, not just a department within a ministry. PS- “Hum do Humare do” obviously hurt bad.The website of the ministry of fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying says, "The Department of Fisheries is one of the two Departments under the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying.

The camps were inaugurated by Union tourism minister Prahallad Singh Patel via video conferencing. Apart from Satkosia, a festival was also organised at Ramchandi beach in Konark, Bhitarkanika, Daringbadi and Hirakud.Transport commissioner Sanjeeb Panda and his IPS officer wife Santosh Bala (Home department special secretary), were in one of the three tents at the Eco-Retreat site that caught fire. Panda tweeted that the fire started at 5am and added that he and his wife were safe. Three cottages were gutted.“By the grace of God, me and Santosh escaped without any injury as fire broke out in our tent at Satkosia Eco Retreat at about 5am on 28.2.2021 due to an electrical short circuit. Three tents were burnt and there was no injury to anyone,” Panda tweeted, attaching a video clip of the fire.Fire services personnel and the police rushed to the spot and doused the flames. However, the three cottages were completely gutted by the time.While the exact cause of the blaze is yet to be ascertained, it is suspected that the fire was triggered by an electric short circuit in the power supply or in the air-conditioners installed in the cottages.Also Read: Odisha limits precautionary measures for travellers from five high-risk statesThe Odisha tourism department confirmed there was no injury or loss of life.

28-02-2021||India||Bombay HC refuses to interfere in physical criteria for medical admission||The Bombay high court has refused to interfere with the eligibility requirement of intact upper limbs for admission to undergraduate medical courses, observing that it was not open for the high court to test validity of the statutory rule based on expert opinion.In administrative or quasi judicial matters, it may be open to questioning an expert opinion, but when it comes to legislative exercise, it would be practically impossible to question the wisdom of any legislation based on an expert opinion, said a bench of justice SC Gupte and justice Surendra Tavade."It is not open in such a case to examine the material before the experts and assessment of such materials made by experts to form their opinion, on the basis of which the particular law is framed," the bench added and rejected a petition filed by a medical aspirant from Pune district.The order of February 8 was uploaded on the high court’s website February 24.Anita Shinde, the petitioner, had moved HC in January this year after she was declared ineligible for admission to an undergraduate medical course as her left hand was amputated. She challenged the validity of a clause of the Medical Council of India's “Regulations on Graduate Medical Education, 1997."The clause required “both hands intact, with intact sensation, sufficient strength and range of motion" for the persons with locomotor disabilities to be eligible for undergraduate medical courses.The petitioner claimed he was wrongfully denied admission to a medical course for despite the disability, a person like her can perform all five roles that MCI wants Indian medical graduates to perform - clinician, leader and member of a healthcare team, communicator, lifelong learner and a professional.Her counsel, advocate Gaurav Bansal, relied on several extracts and national and international opinions submitted that the petitioner had the capacity and ability to undergo and successfully complete the under-graduate medical course. Bansal had added that undergraduate medical courses do not involve any surgery and hence, there was no rationale behind denying admission to a person with disability such as the petitioner.The submission, however, failed to impress the bench."Medical Council is a body of experts and there is no gainsaying that this particular stipulation is based on its expert opinion," said the court. "It is not open, for the reasons stated above, for this court to question the legislative wisdom of the Council or to question the expert opinion, on which its legislation is based," it added.The high court also rejected the argument that denial of admission to the petitioner on account of her disability amounted to discrimination, prohibited both under Section 3 of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 and Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India.The court, however, said sub-section (3) of Section 3 itself recognises the permissibility of an act of discrimination as proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. As regards Article 19(1)(g), the bench said the fundamental right to practice a profession, or to carry on an occupation of one's choice, is also subject to reasonable restrictions and prescribing eligibility criteria for enrolling for a degree course do come within these permissible restrictions."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-refuses-to-interfere-in-physical-criteria-for-medical-admission-101614495251619.html

"The commentary is also done in Sanskrit during the matches of this tournament," the Prime Minister said. “I just played for you a very small part of that commentary. Not only this, in this tournament, players and commentators are seen in the traditional attire,” he added.During the 74th episode of Mann Ki Baat, the Prime Minister also called for the conservation of water ahead of the summer months and talked about the Jal Shakti’ ministry’s upcoming initiative to save water. “In most parts of India, rain starts in May-June. Can we start a 100-day campaign from now on to harvest rainwater, to clean the waters around us? With this thinking, a few days from now, the Jal Shakti Abhiyan - 'Catch the Rain' is also being started by the Jal Shakti ministry. The basic mantra of this campaign is - Catch the rain, where it falls, when it falls,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-mann-ki-baat-pm-modi-shares-his-regret-of-sorts-101614496444159.html

And often you would get a communication that the desired slot has already been taken by some other group,” said a senior Congress leader.Manish Chatrath, All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge for Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya, also manages this prime estate at the heart of Lutyens’ Delhi for the party.The rising demand for the ‘war room’ also coincides with the shrinking real estate space for the Congress in the national capital. Till two years ago, the party’s activities were spread out in at least five places in central Delhi with separate space for research, data analysis, social media and liaison while the core poll activities took place at the 15, Gurdwara Rakabganj Road.Now, some of these properties are no more used by the party’s backroom boys, said two leaders involved in the poll exercises.“Before the 2019 elections, a new operations room was created in a small bungalow in Lodhi estate. The property hosted key meetings related to strategy, campaign and even data analysis. Every evening, a host of senior leaders would meet there. But now, that bungalow is not used anymore,” said a second senior leader.The activities at the 15, GRG, therefore, have increased manifold. Officially, the property belongs to a Rajya Sabha member of the Congress. But it has been refurbished as a highly-secured office for the party’s poll-related strategising. While Congress president Sonia Gandhi has never visited the place, Rahul Gandhi has frequently come here for key meetings.“No Congress leader, except the general secretaries and above, can enter the place without prior appointment. If your name is not given to the private security guards at the main gate, you will be denied entry,” said another Congress leader handling affairs of an eastern state.Must Watch: ‘PM Modi thinks Tamil Nadu is like his television’: Rahul GandhiSuch is the level of security that except a few top leaders, no one can take their cars inside despite ample parking space. A few years ago, a biometric entry and exit system was put in place for the regulars. “The social media team that works from the same property uses a separate gate altogether and their office has been walled off.While the office décor and the style of work remains the same at 15, GRG, it, however, has forever lost Ahmed Patel, one of the few senior leaders who would come almost daily to the ‘war’ room. One of the office cabins was allotted to Patel, who died due to Covid complications, before almost every poll. After many years, the Congress is going to polls without Patel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-war-room-abuzz-with-activity-as-battle-for-4-states-1-ut-draws-near-101614495237567.html

28-02-2021||India||'If you dare...': Rahul's latest challenge to PM Modi ahead of Mann Ki Baat||Hours before Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Mann Ki Baat address on Sunday, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi dared him to address the issues surrounding farmers’ protests and rising unemployment.हिम्मत है तो करो-#KisanKiBaat #JobKiBaat“If you dare, then do - KisanKiBaat and JobKiBaat," Gandhi tweeted. Congress functionaries on Twitter have launched a social media campaign over the past week demanding that the Prime Minister address the issues related to rising unemployment. Congress’ youth wing through social media also criticised the government for not addressing the issues faced by India’s youth.Gandhi has on several occasions attacked the government over the three farm laws, alleging that they are intended to benefit "handful of PM Modi’s friends". He alleged that instead of benefiting farmers, the laws will benefit the companies who invest in the agricultural sector.During a tractor rally in Kerala, Rahul Gandhi had said, “We have pop stars who are commenting on the situation of Indian farmers but the Indian government is not interested. They are not going to take back three laws unless they are forced.” He had also tweeted in support of the Bharat Bandh called by transporters’ union on February 26. “No employment, rising prices, government enjoying, eyes closed, therefore - Bharat Bandh,” Gandhi had tweeted.Congress has criticised the government over the issue of rising prices of fuel as well. Earlier on Friday, Congress said that citizens of the country have been hit by low growth and high inflation under the current regime. “What continues to be an area of concern, however, is the advance estimates for the entire financial year. The Central Statistics Office (CSO) has lowered GDP growth rate for FY 2020-21 from its previous estimated minus 7.7% to now -8%,” party leader Randeep Singh Surjewala said in a tweet. He further added that the GST implementation and demonetisation exercise in 2016 also affected the economic growth of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-you-dare-rahul-s-latest-challenge-to-pm-modi-ahead-of-mann-ki-baat-101614492364665.html

28-02-2021||India||Forest clearance given to contentious Goa railway project through Western Ghats||The Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change has granted approval under the Forest Conservation Act for the diversion of nearly 140 hectares of protected Western Ghats Forest land for the contentious double tracking of the railway line between the Castlerock Railway Station along the Karnataka border with Goa and the Margao Railway station in South Goa. The state is to lose 50,000 trees for the project. In a communication to the forest secretary, the MoEF has informed that the consent is being granted based on Goa’s request subject to certain conditions.The letter of consent was issued by deputy inspector general of forests M K Shambhu after the regional empowered committee in its meeting held on January 27, 'carefully examined' the proposal and decided to grant an in-principle stage-I approval for diversion of the forest land subject to conditions including transferring of money equal to the net present value of the forest land being diverted to the CAMPA funds for raising, maintaining the compensatory afforestation for the degraded forest land.Curiously, despite the trees being felled in Goa on the windward side of the Western Ghats, the compensatory afforestation for these projects is being done in Sutagatti, Iddalahonda, Ramadurg, Kakati, Suldal and Shigeholi villages of Gokak and Karkati talukas in Belgaum District of Karnataka, which fall on the leeward side of the mountain range and are home to very different vegetation.The doubling of the railway line along the existing alignment is being staunchly opposed in Goa by some as the line will cut across the Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary and Mollem National Park – these two are Goa’s oldest wildlife sanctuaries -- fearing that besides ecological damage, new construction will destabilise the vulnerable slopes of the Western Ghats mountain range and lead to landslides and other unforeseen consequences.The forest clearance is the latest in a long line of clearances that have been granted for the project. In April last year, the standing committee, National Board for Wildlife approved the project, based on the approval by the Goa State Wildlife Board.These clearances have now been challenged before the Central Empowered Committee on grounds that they have been cleared in haste and threaten the rich biodiversity of the region before the Bombay High Court at Goa. Opponents also allege that the projects are being planned solely to enhance the capacity to transport coal -- a source of severe air pollution due to its open air handling -- from Goa’s Mormugao Port to Steel units in North Karnataka.In 2010, the Ministry of Railways sanctioned the doubling of the existing 342 kilometres long Hospet-Tinai ghat-Vasco railway line in the states of Karnataka and Goa. The first phase between Hospet and Tinai ghat involved easier terrain atop the largely flat Deccan plateau and has already been completed. It’s the second phase between Tinai ghat and Vasco da Gama that involves crossing the steep slopes, raging rivers and the thick forests of the Western Ghats as well as densely populated areas of coastal Goa that’s being contested.The railways have said there is no alternative to locating the project in forest land as the alignment invariably has to pass through the protected area and that the existing single railway line is saturated. The authorities also announced mitigation measures in the form of four underpasses to allow for wildlife crossing for the railway project and elevated viaduct at 13 locations for the highway, which activists say are not nearly enough.Also Read: New climate pledges 'far short' of meeting Paris Agreement goals: UNThe railways have also claimed that it is not being done solely to transport coal but for the general ‘development’ of the region.“It has been misconstrued that the railway line double tracking is being done solely for the purpose of coal transport. Across the world, the focus is increasingly on non-conventional sources of energy. In the year 2015-16 the South Western Railway carried 12 million metric tons of coal (per year) while in the year 2019-20 we have carried 9 metric tons of coal which is a reduction of 25%,” Prashant Kumar Mishra, the additional general manager of South Western Railways which is tasked with the project, had said late last year.Despite the clearances, the project is likely to encounter further legal hurdles on account of the staunch opposition before work begins.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/forest-clearance-given-to-contentious-goa-railway-project-through-western-ghats-101614487713027.html

Equipped with the latest technology, the new terminal buildings are an integral component of the expansion programme, AAI said in an official statement.M. Suresh, Regional Executive Director of AAI in an official statement said, "Mainly this expansion will help the passengers to have hassle-free travel inside the terminal building - the airport access from the city to the terminal building. The good connectivity so that inside the passenger can enter.""Earlier, there was one entry point, now we have opened 2-3 entry points depending upon the traffic size, so that the queue for the passengers to be reduced. Similarly, for checking also we have increased or doubled the capacity of checking counters as well as check security counters we just doubled it," he added.It is not just the infrastructure, but AAI has been ensuring a seamless journey, even during the pandemic. The Covid-19, which turned things upside down for people across the world, is being methodically managed at these airports.Thorough screening, safety kits, frequent sanitization are part of the standard operating procedures being followed inside the airport premises. Airports in North-East Region have been able to successfully win the trust of the passengers."They are trying to keep the safe distance. They are giving us masks, shields to prevent the droplets," a passenger at Agartala Airport said.Rajeev Kapoor, Airport director at Maharaja Bir Bikram Airport in Agartala said, "The new terminal building will be able to handle 1,200 passengers at one time, a rise from 500 passengers we are handling currently. 1,000 in those will be domestic passengers while 200 will be international. So, our facility will be bigger than double the current size."Amid pandemic, on an average 180-190 flights are operational in the North-East region with a passenger footfall of 18,000 to 20,000 every day. With a consistent double-digit growth rate in passenger volume, the Indian aviation industry is gearing up to become the third-largest industry in the world.A surge in the number of operational flights from the North- East is its immediate plan of action.AAI believes in the homogeneous development of airports across all parts of India which is the key to the comprehensive growth of the industry and Airports in the vast region of north-eastern India could just be the beginning towards that goal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/airports-in-northeast-india-operating-expanding-amid-covid-19-pandemic-101614485353853.html

Alternatively, we shall construct a Bhajan Mandiram (prayer hall) or amenities complex on behalf of the TTD,” said Y V Subba Reddy, chairman TTD trust board. He added that he will write to the Ram Mandir trust for allotment of some land in Ayodhya to the TTD.A resolution to this effect was adopted at a meeting of the TTD trust board, held in Tirumala. The board has already decided to construct Lord Venkateswara temples in Mumbai and Jammu. “We shall perform bhumi pujan in both these places shortly,” he said.The trust board also adopted a resolution declaring cow as the national animal, based on the suggestion of the Hindu Dharmik Parishad. “We have decided to write to the Centre making a recommendation to that effect,” Reddy said.The board approved an annual budget of ₹2,937.82 crore for the financial year 2021-22. Reddy said this budget was smaller compared to the last year’s budget of ₹3,309.89 crore, which could not be realised due to Covid-19 pandemic.The board resolved to resume Arjitha Sevas (paid services to the deity) in Tirumala temple from April 14. It would allow physical presence of devotees for the advance booked Arjitha Sevas. “Devotees with Arjitha Seva tickets should observe all Covid guidelines and also procure Covid-19 test, not more than three days ahead of their Tirumala visit,” the TTD chairman said.The board also decided to frame certain guidelines for taking over of temples by the TTD and for providing them financial assistance under Sri Vani Trust. “We have also decided to frame uniform guidelines for leasing and construction of TTD kalyana mandapams (marriage halls) across the country. An integrated system will be formulated to reduce losses in operating these halls,” he said.Also Read: Andhra govt seeks to affiliate Venkateswara College with Andhra UniversityThe board endorsed a proposal to name all the six Veda Pathshalas run by TTD henceforth as Sri Venkateswara Veda Vijnana Peetham and hike the remuneration of Vedic teachers at all Pathshalas from existing ₹22,000 to ₹35,150.“We have also decided to provide Covid-19 vaccination to all the TTD employees, as per the suggestion of the medical and health department,” the TTD chairman added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ttd-seeks-land-for-venkateshwara-temple-at-ayodhya-declares-cow-national-animal-101614482103628.html

28-02-2021||India||Rahul Gandhi accuses BJP, RSS of ‘destroying institutional balance’||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its ideological fountainhead, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, (RSS) used money power to destroy “institutional balance”, which manifested in several ways such as “poaching” of MLAs and “infiltration” of judiciary. He also said that judges should have a cooling off period before they are re-appointed to “plum posts”, and called for subjecting electronic voting machines (EVMs) to scrutiny, among some of the measures to revive democracy, which, according to him, was “dead”. He also called for “mass action” for change while interacting with advocates in Tamil Nadu’s Thoothukudi district, where he landed on Saturday to campaign for the April 6 assembly elections in TN and Puducherry.“Over the last six years, there has been a systematic attack on elected institutions and free press that hold the nation together. Democracy doesn't die with a bang, it dies slowly. The RSS has destroyed the institutional balance,” Gandhi said.Gandhi said that the country requires a judiciary that is not penetrated by the RSS and the BJP, and agreed that there was a need to strengthen the anti-defection law. “We should absolutely have laws that don’t allow MLAs to move but first we need a functioning Parliament, we need a judiciary that is not penetrated by the RSS and BJP, a press that raises this issue,” said Gandhi.He stated that democracy was “dead” in India because of the RSS and the alleged erosion of Parliament, state assemblies, panchayats, judiciary and a free press. “It is dead because one organisation- the RSS, has combined with huge finances to penetrate and disturb and destroy our institutional balance,” said Gandhi. “There are many different manifestations of this: misuse of sedition law, killing and threatening of people, these are all symptoms""What happens when we come to power? There's full penetration of all institutions. We'll have to deal with 15 years of judges who have been placed in the judiciary because they support one political party. It's going to be a huge challenge for the country going forward,” Gandhi said.Gandhi compared the present situation to the fight against the British rule, when reliance on institutions wasn’t possible, which was a requirement for a functional democracy. He called for “mass action”, which he claimed was starting to take shape at Delhi’s borders, where farmers were protesting against the three farm legislations passed by the Centre.During his campaign in Puducherry about ten days ago, Gandhi had said that no one could hope to get justice from the judicial system without being “terrified of the consequences”. The Congress government in Puducherry collapsed last week after five party legislators resigned, two of whom joined the BJP. Gandhi said the Congress will have to win with two-thirds majority and wouldn’t be able to govern with 10-15 MLAs because they will be toppled. “Even if we put the right MLAs in place, it is not enough. The power is so strong and heavy that MLAs will not be able to sustain,” said Gandhi, suggesting alleged misuse of investigation agencies.He claimed that MLAs were bought to defect in various Congress-ruled states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Puducherry, Arunachal Pradesh, where, according to him, the “concentration of capital took the mandate away from us”. He added, “I know the amount of money that was thrown at MLAs in MP, Rajasthan. We’re talking massive amounts of money. When you have a party that is fighting elections with thousands of crores and other parties are not allowed to raise finance. The financiers who would like to support us say their business will be destroyed.”Also Read: Party is getting weak, say Congress 'letter writers'Gandhi also said that EVMs should be made accessible for scrutiny with transparency to dispel doubts over their functioning. “I think there are problems with EVMs,” he said. “As a first step, the election commission (EC) should allow political parties to study the machines.... Whenever Congress has asked to see the EVMs, do random checks on machines, we are told you can’t do”. During 2020 Bihar polls, Gandhi called EVMs ‘Modi Voting Machines’.In response to his allegations, an RSS pracharak and veteran BJP leader in Tamil Nadu, L Ganesan said, “RSS means discipline, nationalism and all other good qualities. If somebody says that RSS is influencing the judiciary or any field, people should feel happy that something good will happen. It is a compliment given by Rahul Gandhi to the judiciary. Long ago, when guruji Golwalkar was there, a similar question was asked if RSS is dominating the Jan Sangh and he replied, ‘not only Jan Sangh, we want to influence all political parties in India and all walks of life for the country’. Today, I’m telling the same thing,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-accuses-bjp-rss-of-destroying-institutional-balance-101614480135231.html
28-02-2021||India||India all set for phase 2 of Covid-19 inoculation drive, jab to cost ₹250 at private hospitals||The second phase of vaccination drive against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) drive kick starts Monday with citizens above 60 years of age and those above 45 years of age with co-morbidities eligible for the shot. The government has also roped in private hospitals for this phase of inoculation which is likely to cover 270 million people. While the vaccine will be administered free of cost at government hospitals, the Centre has capped the price of the shot at ₹250 at private hospitals.The government has identified 20 co-morbidities for people in the 45-59 years age bracket. Those with co-morbidities need to produce a one page certificate signed by any registered medical practitioner. The certificate can either be uploaded on Co-WIN2.0 by the beneficiary while self registering or a hard copy can be carried by the beneficiary to the CVC, the health ministry stated.The conditions include congenital heart disease that leads to pulmonary arterial hypertension, end-stage kidney disease, or cancers such as lymphoma, leukaemia and myloma, decompensated liver cirrhosis (deterioration of liver function due to scarring), primary immune deficiency conditions, and sickle cell anaemia.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here For those who wish to receive the vaccine in this stage, states were informed about three methods of registration—advance self registration, onsite registration and facilitated cohort registration.The states have been asked to provide login credentials to private centres on the updated Co-WIN platform, which according to the government, forms the backbone of the immunisation campaign in India. It is a digital platform where anyone who needs to get a dose must be registered.The government has allowed states to use around 10,000 hospitals under Ayushman Bharat-PMJAY and 687 hospitals under CGHS as Covid-19 vaccination centres (CVCs). There would also be government health facilities which will be used as CVCs such as medical college hospitals, district hospitals, sub divisional hospitals, CHCs, PHCs, health sub centers and health and wellness centers and geo reference maps with GPS coordinates of all these health facilities have been prepared that will serve as CVCs, the Union ministry of health and family welfare said in a statement.Currently, two vaccines—Covishield, developed by Oxford-AstraZeneca and manufactured by SII, and Covaxin, developed and manufactured by Bharat Biotech— are being administered in India.In the first phase of the vaccination drive, which began on January 16, only health and frontline workers were included. As many as 14,242,547 doses of the vaccine were given by Saturday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-all-set-for-phase-2-of-covid-19-inoculation-drive-jab-to-cost-rs-250-at-private-hospitals-101614478787967.html

The countdown for the launch commenced on Saturday.This will be ISRO's first mission of the year 2021. It is scheduled to take place at 10.24 am today, according to ISRO.Along with Amazonia-1, 18 other co-passenger satellites will also be onboard the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV-C51). According to the last update from ISRO about today's launch, the filling of oxidizer for the second stage of the PSLV rocket has been completed.PSLV-C51/Amazonia-1 is the first dedicated commercial mission of NewSpace India Limited (NSIL), a Government of India company under the Department of Space. The NSIL is undertaking this mission under a commercial arrangement with US-based launch services and mission management provider Spaceflight Inc.The 637-kg Amazonia-1 is the optical earth observation satellite of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), the research unit of Brazil's ministry of science.

28-02-2021||India||More tests for Covid-19 needed, says WHO chief scientist||Chief scientist of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Soumya Swaminathan on Saturday said there should be more Covid-19 tests as there was heterogeneity (on testing methods) among the states. "Testing is really an important issue. At the beginning, WHO found that many countries did not have diagnostics and those which had it was not enough. In fact we found out that diagnostics was lower than it should be," she said while addressing a session at 'Shaastra' organised here at the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras. Stating that WHO has set a benchmark for how much diagnostics in testing was enough, she said if the positivity rate (of a disease) was five per cent or more, it means you should be testing more. "There is a lot of heterogeneity in response to testing between state to state and some states have done higher than the others," she said. "Tamil Nadu has done well in terms of testing and the Health Department had set up fever clinics in Chennai, when the cases were going up. So, the strategy needs to be decentralised," she said. Swaminathan said it was not only the Health Department that needs to cope up but also all other departments which have to play a role in providing additional food and service when people lost their jobs, when families were in distress due to the pandemic. "We now understand the disease (COVID-19) better, understand epidemiology and it is super-spreader. We know that only 15-16 people who are infected are responsible for the remaining 85 people. We need to be able to identify those situations where these kinds of super-spreaderscan happen," she said. "I think that (testing for Covid-19) will continue through 2021 as well," she remarked. Swaminathan said some low-income countries have done better than the high-income countries as community health workers in (the low-income countries) came to the rescue when Covid-19 outbreak happened by means of visiting houses, checking of new infections. "In low-income countries, the whole workforce for contact tracing, visiting houses, engaging community health workers are the ones who actually came to the rescue but whereas in the developed world, where the medical system is well advanced, public health system was neglected. Over the years that aspect collapsed," she said. She said these are the lessons to be learned whether the country was rich or poor and a country can learn from what went right and what did not go well so that the country can make those corrections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-tests-for-covid-19-needed-says-who-chief-scientist-101614474925714.html

28-02-2021||India||Onus on India after LoC ceasefire: Pakistan PM Imran Khan||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday said the onus is on India to create an “enabling environment for further progress” in bilateral ties following Thursday’s surprise announcement about both countries recommitting themselves to the 2003 ceasefire on the Line of Control (LoC), a remark that came two days after India asked Islamabad to take demonstrable steps against terrorist organisations.On Thursday, India and Pakistan jointly announced that they agreed to strictly observe all agreements on the ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC). India told Pakistan “talks and terror” cannot go together and said it desired normal neighbourly relations.In a set of tweets marking two years of Pakistan’s action after the Indian Air Force (IAF) targeted a Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) camp at Balakot in 2019, Khan said Pakistan was ready to move forward to resolve “all outstanding issues through dialogue”. He also said India must take steps to meet the Kashmiri people’s right to self-determination.“I welcome restoration of the ceasefire along the LOC. The onus of creating an enabling environment for further progress rests with India,” Khan tweeted.“India must take necessary steps to meet the long-standing demand & right of the Kashmiri people to self determination acc to UNSC resolutions,” he added.This was Khan’s first formal reaction to the decision by the armies of India and Pakistan on February 25 to strictly adhere to the truce on the LoC, following his return from an official visit to Sri Lanka this week.A statement issued by Pakistan’s Foreign Office to mark the same occasion said the country is committed to “peaceful coexistence and resolution of the long outstanding Jammu & Kashmir dispute in accordance with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people”.The statement added that Pakistan’s government and armed forces are “united against any threat or misadventure” and will act to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country.There was no immediate response from Indian officials to Khan’s tweets or the Foreign Office statement.The ceasefire, which was put in place in November 2003, has frayed due to thousands of violations in the past few years.The decision by both sides to recommit themselves to the truce was the apparent outcome of behind-the-scenes contacts between senior security officials of the two countries.The external affairs ministry said on Thursday that the ceasefire agreement didn’t amount to a change of India’s position on key issues related to Pakistan.“India desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan. We have always maintained that we are committed to addressing issues, if any, in a peaceful and bilateral manner,” ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had said.“On key issues, our position remains unchanged. I don’t need to reiterate it,” Srivastava added.Khan also hailed the role of Pakistan’s armed forces in the air strikes that were launched on the LoC by his country on February 27, 2019, following IAF’s bombing of the JeM facility in Balakot in retaliation for the suicide attack at Pulwama that had killed 40 Indian troopers.The air strikes triggered aerial battles between combat aircraft of the two countries and Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman’s IAF fighter jet was shot down in a dog fight. He was captured and briefly detained by Pakistan before Khan announced that Varthaman would be freed. “I congratulate the entire nation & salute our Armed Forces on the 2nd Anniversary of our response to India’s illegal, reckless military adventure of air strikes against Pakistan. As a proud & confident nation, we responded with determined resolve at a time & place of our choosing,” Khan tweeted.“We also demonstrated to the world Pakistan’s responsible behaviour in the face of India’s irresponsible military brinkmanship, by returning the captured Indian pilot. We have always stood for peace & remain ready to move forward to resolve all outstanding issues through dialogue,” he said in another tweet. Khan had earlier made the rolling back of the changes in Jammu and Kashmir a condition for talks with India. His tweets were silent on this matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/onus-on-india-after-loc-ceasefire-pakistan-pm-imran-khan-101614466996031.html
28-02-2021||India||2 held for ‘conspiracy’ to kill activist Sushil Pandit||The Delhi Police on Saturday claimed to have averted an assassination plot on human rights activist Sushil Pandit, with the arrest of two alleged contract killers from Punjab’s Faridkot, who they said were hired by a criminal facing trial in a murder case there.Pandit, a Kashmiri, is a prominent activist advocating the rights of Kashmiri Pandits. He was also very vocal about his support for the abrogation of Article 370, which had until then granted a special status to Kashmir. The police are also probing foreign links in the alleged conspiracy and said they suspected the involvement of Pakistan’s ISI (Inter Services Intelligence).When contacted, Pandit said, “For the past many years, I have speaking about and presenting facts about the situation in Kashmir. I have been very vocal about issues related to Kashmiri Pandits and Article 370, and these, I believe, were obviously not liked by people opposing them. The police should probe who all are behind the plot.”The two were arrested Friday from RK Puram with four firearms, including two pistols of a foreign make, four cartridges, and a mobile phone containing the photograph of Pandit, which was allegedly provided to them by the jailed murder accused, Prince Kumar alias Tuti. Police said Sukhvinder Singh, 25, and Lakhan, 21, were promised ₹10 lakh each for killing Pandit.Police are also probing why Tuti wanted Pandit dead.A case of criminal conspiracy, abetment of offence punishable with death or imprisonment of life under the Indian Penal Code sections 120B and 115 was registered at RK Puram police station.Since the police’s preliminary probe has indicated that a foreign hand may be involved in the conspiracy, the case has been transferred to the Delhi Police’s special cell for further probe.Police officers said they have reasons to believe that the conspiracy was hatched by people based in Pakistan and Dubai, having links with ISI.“We examined the cellphone recovered from the arrested contract killers and found that they were having conversations with people who are based abroad through Signal, an encrypted messaging platform. The two have identified one of their foreign handlers as Deepak alias King, who they claim is based in Dubai. The calls were made from international numbers,” said one of the officers, who did not want to be named.Deputy commissioner of police (south-west) Ingit Pratap Singh said the RK Puram police had received information that two men from Punjab had arrived in Delhi for committing a murder and were looking for a rented accommodation in south-west Delhi.The station team developed the information and caught the two suspects on Friday. .“They (Sukhvinder and Lakhan) were promised ₹10 lakh each for assassinating one Sushil Pandit, who is a human rights activist and CEO of Hive Communications India Private Limited. It also came out during interrogation that they were provided with four pistols– two countrymade and two foreign-made – along with four cartridges and a phone with Pandit’s photo,” DCP Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-held-for-conspiracy-to-kill-activist-sushil-pandit-101614465571461.html
28-02-2021||India||Subordinate legislation: Power invoked by govt to ratify rules||The new rules for social media intermediaries, over the top platforms (such as Netflix and Hotstar) and digital news media publishers have been cleared as a “subordinate legislation”. A subordinate legislation is a power invoked by the government to ratify new rules.“Subordinate legislation is the legislation made by an authority subordinate to the legislature… Most of the enactments provide for the powers for making rules, regulations, bye-laws or other statutory instruments which are exercised by the specified subordinate authorities. Such legislation is to be made within the framework of the powers so delegated by the legislature and is, therefore, known as delegated or subordinate legislation,” the Rajya Sabha Website sates.These rules do not necessarily have to be debated by Parliament; they only have to be placed at floor of the house. The central government has invoked section 87 of the Information Technology Act, 2000, to issue the new guidelines. The sweeping changes will impact all sectors and while increasing accountability of the platforms, they also give the ministry of information and broadcasting take down powers, which until now has only rested with the ministry of electronics and information technology.Experts say that the move is an executive overreach and the take down powers for websites have no legislative basis. According to them, the ambit of section 69(A) only extends to government agencies and intermediaries. ht||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/subordinate-legislation-power-invoked-by-govt-to-ratify-rules-101614465317034.html
28-02-2021||India||Media houses’ sites to come under ambit of Section 69(A) of IT Act||Websites of traditional media houses, which so far have not come under the ambit of section 69(A) of the Information Technology Act, will now do so and also follow the new rules put in place for digital media by the government, an official familiar with the matter said on Saturday.The websites will have to separately furnish the details of their operations, including the email address of a contact person, to the information and broadcasting ministry. Officials from the ministries of I&B and electronics and information technology are slated to meet on Monday to discuss the issue. The government will also provide a format within which the news media entities will voluntarily furnish their details.Section 69 (A) of the IT Act allows the government to take action against posts and accounts that may pose a threat to public order or the interest of sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of the state, friendly relations with foreign states.So far, traditional media houses have been governed the Press Council of India Act. They are mandated to follow a journalistic code of ethics to ensure the sanctity of the information. Digital news media, on the other hand, was not under any regulation and was only brought under the ambit of the I&B ministry last year. The Centre has repeatedly stated that the new rules will bring accountability to the sector and check the spread of fake news.“Digital news media and entertainment is growing at rate of over 30%,” the government official cited above said. “It is important that there are checks and balances. The rules will work within the framework of the judicial system. If someone believes that unfair action has been taken, it can be challenged in the court.”The emergency blocking guidelines, which so far have only been exercised by a designated officer of the central government, have rested with MeitY (the IT ministry). These have now been extended to the authorised officer of the I&B ministry, who will also head the top tier of the self-regulation system for grievance redressal for over the top (OTT) platforms such as Netflix and Hotstar and online news media organisations.The government in a clarification on Saturday said that the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 “provide an institutional framework for news publishers and OTT platforms on the digital media ecosystem.” They added that no new provision has been inserted.“Certain misgivings are being raised regarding Rule 16 under Part III of the rules, which mention that in a case of emergency nature, interim blocking directions may be issued by the Secretary, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting,” the ministry said. “It is to inform that this provision is exactly the same as being exercised by the Secretary, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology since the past eleven years under the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking for Access of Information by Public) Rules, 2009. Since Part III of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 would be administered by the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, that is why the reference to Secretary MeITY has been replaced by Secretary, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting.”Hindustan Times on Wednesday reported that the Union government wants to treat online news media publishers at par with traditional media publishers, such as newspapers and news channels, and also bring them under the ambit of Section 69 (A) of the Information Technology Act that gives takedown powers to the government, according to new guidelines.Digital media, as defined in a document that lays out the government’s framework to regulate online content, will cover digitised content that can be transmitted over the internet or computer networks. It includes intermediaries such as Twitter and Facebook, and publishers of news and current affairs content. It also includes so-called curators of such content.So far, online news media has remained unregulated, with the Information & Broadcasting ministry brining it under its ambit last year, but not yet formalising rules for it. Nor are intermediaries, especially social media companies that take refuge in their intermediary status when it comes to owing up responsibility for content. According to the guidelines titled Information Technology (Guidelines for intermediaries and digital media ethics code) Rules, 2021, digital news media publishers will need to follow rules that apply to print and electronic media.Newspapers and TV news channels are governed under the Press Council of India Act, 1978 and Cable Television Networks Regulation Act, 1995 respectively. According to the proposed changes, these acts will also apply to online news and current affairs portals under the Code of Ethics. They are expected to follow the norms, with the government also planning to put in place a three-tier self-regulation system to ensure compliance with the Code.An association of digital publications of news and current affairs has written to Union Information and Broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar, expressing strong reservations against the guidelines.The online publications have called the new rules “unfair, the process of their formulation undemocractic and the method of their implementation an infringement upon the freedom of expression”.“From the early 1950s, with the setting up of the Press Council, the idea has been that the written medium be kept away from all executive interference in the interest of not just the publication, but of the wider public to ensure the widest possible dissemination of news and ideas,” the letter notes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/media-houses-sites-to-come-under-ambit-of-section-69-a-of-it-act-101614465083299.html
28-02-2021||India||IAF chief flies Mirage 2000 to mark second anniversary of Balakot operations||Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria on Saturday flew in a multi-aircraft formation from a premier air base in Madhya Pradesh’s Gwalior to mark the second anniversary of the Balakot operations — India’s unprecedented, peacetime cross-border strikes on the back of the February 2019 Pulwama terror attack, people familiar with the developments said.Bhadauria flew a Mirage 2000, the aircraft that was used for bombing Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) targets in Pakistan’s Balakot on February 26, 2019, said one of the officials cited above. “The IAF chief flew with pilots from the squadrons that were part of the operations,” he said. The five-aircraft formation consisted of Mirage 2000s and Sukhoi-30 fighters.IAF on Tuesday also released a video of a precision strike carried out by Mirage 2000s against a dummy target in Rajasthan to mark the second anniversary of the cross-border air strikes. “The strike was carried out by members of the squadron that carried out the actual operations,” the official said. The fighter jets dropped Spice 2000 bombs on the practice target.The IAF’s Mirage 2000s hit three targets in Balakot with five Israeli-origin Spice 2000 bombs with penetrator warheads that allowed them to pierce through the rooftops before exploding inside to cause maximum damage. While the actual bombing was carried out by the Mirages, Su-30s were part of the IAF’s strike package that day.The IAF chief flying the Mirage 2000 with the squadron that carried out the operations is a reaffirmation of the success of the mission at the highest level, said Air Marshal Anil Chopra (retd), director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.“When the head of the force flies solo, it shows that our commanders lead from the front. It also signifies that the IAF is proud of the professionalism and combat training status of its cutting-edge fleets,” Chopra said.“The Spice 2000 live mission by the squadron clearly sends a message that the IAF’s sword blade remains sharp, and ready to penalise a belligerent adversary,” Chopra added.Each bomb that hit the JeM targets carried around 80kg of explosives in a 900-kg steel casing, with the explosion caused by time-delay fuses sending a lethal quantity of shrapnel that instantly killed the occupants. The bombs hit their targets in a vertical attack angle, leaving holes measuring 80 to 90 cm in diameter on the rooftops of the structures, as previously reported by Hindustan Times.The air strikes against the terror base were in response to the Pakistan-backed Pulwama attack in which 40 CRPF men were killed on February 14, 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-chief-flies-mirage-2000-to-mark-second-anniversary-of-balakot-operations-101614459893734.html
28-02-2021||India||Party is getting weak, say Congress 'letter writers'||A meeting to felicitate former Rajya Sabha member of Parliament from Kashmir (and a former chief minister of the state) Ghulam Nabi Azad, and launch a campaign against the Bharatiya Janata Party, also ended up being a platform for some of the speakers — all Congressmen — to air their views on the state of their own party.Azad, and many of the other speakers, Kapil Sibal, Anand Sharma, Bhupinder Hooda, Manish Tewari and Vivek Tankha are among the 23 signatories of an August letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi seeking changes in how the party is run, including an election for organisational posts. The meeting was noticed in Delhi with Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi pointing out that the party would be better served if the leaders campaigned in election-going states. Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, and Assam, and the Union Territory of Puducherry will go to the polls starting in March; the results will be announced on May 2.“This is an occasion and podium to speak truth and the truth is that Congress is getting weak and therefore we have assembled here to make it strong together,” said Rajya Sabha (RS) member of Parliament (MP) Kapil Sibal. Organised under the banner of a Shanti Sammelan’ or peace meeting by a body called the Gandhi Global Family (a reference to Mahatma Gandhi), the meeting was well-attended. Azad is a popular figure in the Union Territory.Last August, the 23 leaders wrote a letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi in which they called for “full-time and effective leadership”, elections to the Congress Working Committee (CWC), and a mechanism to guide the party’s revival. At the last meeting of the CWC last month, they decided to postpone internal elections which did not go down well with the letter writers. Subsequent, party appointments have seen younger leaders who want Rahul Gandhi back as the party president being given precedence in organisational appointments over some of the signatories.In his address, Sibal expressed his unhappiness that the party didn’t choose to accommodate Azad in Parliament after his retirement.“Now, what is the real role of Ghulam Nabi Azad… we need an experienced pilot to fly a plane and an engineer to fix any technical snag. Azad is experienced and an engineer too. Why am I saying this is because he knows reality of the Congress in every state and district. And, when we realised that Azad is being freed from Parliament we felt sad. We never wanted him to be freed from Parliament,” he said.“I fail to understand that why Congress is not using his experience.”Sibal said that they wanted the party to be strengthened in every state and every village because a weak Congress would mean a weak country.The Congress leader also took a swipe at PM Narendra Modi, saying: “Today, the problem India confronts is that she has a rajneta (leader) whose sole ambition is to empower his party and not the people of the country.”Azad avoided criticising the Congress and spoke of how he was impressed by the Gandhian philosophy while a student of SP College in Srinagar in 1969. He criticised the BJP government for dividing the state of Jammu and Kashmir(J&K) in two UTs in 2019“One-and-a-half years ago, we were dismembered... the state was shredded into pieces and today we are being divided in the name of religion and regions,” he said.“But we will keep fighting for statehood in Parliament and outside till we get it,” he asserted, telling the audience that while he has retired from the Rajya Sabha, he hasn’t from politics. Other Congress leaders Anand Sharma, Manish Tewari, Bhupinder Hooda, Raj Babbar and Vivek Tankha also addressed the rally.Anand Sharma said that for the first time since the 1950s, Jammu and Kashmir does not have a representative in the Rajya Sabha but it will be “corrected” soon.Speaking in Delhi at a press briefing, Singhvi responded to the meeting by saying that the leaders were “senior and highly respected, well-regarded persons of the party, and they are part of this Congress family”.“The best contribution to the Congress cause would be to get active in the various abhiyans which are going on in the various states that are going to elections. It is important to campaign in the five states and I would like to remind all of that.”In response, one of those who attended the meeting said: “None of us were put into the list of star campaigners in the last elections. So how do they expect us to campaign now?”Azad and Vivek Tankha are scheduled to address another meeting on Sunday. There are no fixed plans for future meetings yet, said the leader cited above, asking not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/party-is-getting-weak-say-congress-letter-writers-101614453878301.html
28-02-2021||India||AG Venugopal refuses nod for contempt proceedings against ex-CJI Gogoi||Attorney general KK Venugopal has refused to give his nod for initiating contempt proceedings against former Chief Justice of India (CJI) and now Rajya Sabha MP Ranjan Gogoi for his comments on the Supreme Court at a recent event.Responding to a request in this regard by activist Saket Gokhale, the top law officer said that the former CJI’s statements were indeed “very strong” but added that they were made “for the good of the institution” and in no manner scandalised or lowered the authority of the highest judiciary.Gokhale wrote to Venugopal for his approval to the contempt proceedings against justice Gogoi in the wake of the former CJI’s statements regarding the state of the Indian judiciary during a panel discussion at an India Today event.Justice Gogoi, during the event telecast on February 12, used the term “ramshackle” for the judiciary and added that one would be ending up only “washing dirty linen in court” by filing defamation cases.According to Gokhale, these remarks by justice Gogoi “resulted in major scandalisation of the judiciary” and brought down the esteem of the institution since they came from a former CJI.The A-G, however, has found nothing contemptuous about justice Gogoi’s comments, saying these statements reflected the former CJI’s “deep frustration with the ills that undoubtedly beset the justice delivery system”.Venugopal’s reply to Gokhale added: “I had the occasion to watch the entirety of the interview. It is obvious that all that has been said was good for the institution and will not any manner scandalise the court or lower its authority in the eyes of the public.”Speaking to HT, Venugopal maintained that he had watched the entire interview of justice Gogoi and that the former CJI’s views were meant to highlight the problems the Indian judiciary was facing and what the judges had to go through“He (justice Gogoi) was trying to point out the negative factors of the judiciary to highlight the state it is in. His statements had also sought to reflect the issues the judges are facing and the frustration arising from these problems,” the A-G explained.Venugopal added: “There is no question of contempt in anything that justice Gogoi has said. I have gone through each and every statement and I find nothing remotely contemptuous. It would be improper to seek contempt action.”Under the Contempt of Courts Act and the pertinent rules, the Supreme Court can initiate criminal contempt proceedings either on its own motion or upon a petition filed by a private individual after obtaining consent of the attorney general or the solicitor general.In several rulings, the top court has held that the whole object of prescribing the procedural mode of taking cognisance was “to safeguard the valuable time of the court from being wasted by frivolous contempt petitions”.Gokhale now has the option of writing to the present CJI and other judges of the high court, requesting them to initiate contempt proceedings as a “suo motu” (on its own motion) matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ag-venugopal-refuses-nod-for-contempt-proceedings-against-ex-cji-gogoi-101614453372068.html
28-02-2021||India||Fuel prices record 16th hike this month||Oil companies on Saturday raised petrol prices by 24 paise per litre and diesel by 15 paise a litre, making the two fuels costlier by ₹4.87 per litre and ₹4.99 in just one month. With the 16th price hike in the current month, petrol was sold at record ₹91.17 per litre in Delhi on Saturday and diesel at ₹81.47 a litre, just 50 paise short of the all-time high. Diesel was sold at record ₹81.94 per litre on July 30, 2020 in Delhi.Domestic fuel retailers raised petrol and diesel rates on Saturday, even as international crude oil prices fell on Friday because of the strengthening dollar. Benchmark Brent crude on Friday closed at $66.13 per barrel, down by 1.12%. However, Brent crude surged by over 18% in February on supply disruptions in the US and a rapid demand recovery with the launch of Covid-19 vaccination programmes.According to the latest data released on Friday, the Indian economy has come out of contraction zone after the easing of lockdown restrictions and resumption of economic activities. India’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew at 0.4% on a year-on-year basis in the third quarter ending December 2020, after the economy suffered an annual contraction of 24.4% and 7.3% successively in the two preceding quarters because of a 68-day hard lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19.“Petrol and diesel are deregulated fuels. Public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs) take appropriate decision on pricing of petrol and diesel in line with international prices of petrol and diesel, and not with international crude price,” an oil ministry official said on condition of anonymity. The government deregulated the pricing of petrol on June 26, 2010 and diesel on October 19, 2014.State-run OMCs on June 16, 2017 implemented daily revision of petrol and diesel rates across the country. India’s fuel retail market is dominated by three state-run OMCs – Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) — with almost 90% market share.Two executives working in state-run oil companies said retail prices of petrol and diesel are rising because of supply squeeze by producers’ cartel and high taxes on the two fuels by the Centre and states. The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (Opec+) on April 12 last year announced an unprecedented 9.7 million barrel per day cut in oil output, a 10th of the global output, from May 1, 2020, but did not adhere to the planned restoration of the supply reduction.The other reason for high prices of petrol and diesel is central and state levies. According to IOC, while basic price of petrol is ₹31.82 per litre in Delhi, total levies on every litre of the fuel add up to ₹53.51 (central excise of ₹32.90 per litre and value-added tax of ₹20.61 a litre). Similarly, basic rate of diesel in Delhi is 33.46 per litre, but total tax on it is ₹43.48 per litre (central excise of ₹31.80 per litre and value-added tax of ₹11.68 a litre). Petrol and diesel rates vary across the country because of different value-added tax (VAT) and local levies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fuel-prices-record-16th-hike-this-month-101614451205528.html
