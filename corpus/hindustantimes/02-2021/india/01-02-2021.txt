This was the fourth such major gathering of farmers organised in the region in the last four days. The previous three were held in Muzaffarnagar on Friday, Mathura on Saturday and Baraut in Baghpat on Sunday. Like the other congregations, the Bijnor mahapanchayat also drew a huge crowd of farmers.“We would fight until our last breath to keep the farmers’ honour and respect intact,” said Gaurav Tikait and expressed his gratitude to the people of Bijnor and farmers for turning up in large numbers to attend the mahapanchayat.Barring Jayant Chaudhary, who spoke for a few minutes, other political leaders, including those of the Samajwadi Party, the Congress and the RLD, were not allowed to share the stage.Also read: Twitter restores 250 accounts blocked in India for a controversial hashtagWhile BKU chief Naresh Tikait was expected to attend the mahapanchayat, he sent his son Gaurav Tikait instead.Gaurav Tikait called upon farmers to support the movement, rising above caste and community, “because farmers have no caste”.He said, “Over 150 farmers have been martyred during the movement.”For his part, RLD leader Jayant Choudhary also said, “We need to unite and work together to break the ego of this government.”He advised farmers to remain patient during the battle against three contentious farm reform laws.Hitting out at UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, he said, "The state government has not declared the sugarcane price even after two months of the ongoing crushing season in the mills."Meanwhile, banners were put up at two more villages in Amroha district, banning the entry of BJP leaders over the new farm laws. These two new villages are Nareni and Baldana Heera Singh, Chaudhary Chatrapal Singh, pradhan of Nareni village in Amroha, said on Monday. A similar ban had been declared at Kumrala Bahadarpur village in the same district on Sunday.Chatrapal Singh said the police came to his village on Sunday midnight and took the banner away.“We were not against the police, but the government. Then, why are the police removing banners and boards?” asked Chatrapal Singh.Bijendra Singh, a farmer from Nirpura village in Baghpat district, had declared at Sunday’s panchayat in Baraut that residents of his village would not allow BJP leaders to enter the village. He had also demanded that Union minister Sanjeev Baliyan and Baghpat MP Satyapal Singh should resign in support of farmers.Meanwhile, support for the farmers' movement continued with villagers heading for the Ghazipur border in groups, carrying ration, vegetables, milk, curd and other commodities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/naresh-tikait-s-son-says-will-fight-till-last-breath-for-farmers-honour-101612203337745.html
01-02-2021||India||Indian farmers' protest resonates with US agriculture||Images of thousands of farmers streaming into India's capital on tractors and carrying banners to decry potentially devastating changes in agricultural policy can seem a world away, but the protests in New Delhi raise issues that resonate in the United States and have led to dramatic change in rural America.Indian farmers have left their homes to march through New Delhi in a desperate effort to force the repeal of laws they believe would end guaranteed pricing and force them to sell to powerful corporations rather than government-run markets. Despite decades of economic growth, up to half of India’s population relies on growing crops on small parcels of land, typically less than 3 acres, and farmers worry that without guaranteed prices they will be forced to sell their land and lose their livelihoods.The dispute raises questions not only about agriculture but about dwindling populations in rural India where small communities are already struggling to survive — an issue mirrored in the parts of the US“These protests have gone way beyond the bills because this has spiraled into a larger conversation about the soul of rural India, which is something very familiar to those of us in the Midwest,” said Andrew Flachs, an anthropology professor at Purdue University who has extensively studied the experiences of cotton farmers in India. “We’re always talking about the spirit of American agrarianism and the soul of rural America and this has shifted into a conversation of those same dynamics in India.”The images of farmers marching through New Delhi recall similar scenes in Washington, D.C., during the farming crisis of the late 1970s and early 1980s, when hundreds of trucks and tractors flooded the National Mall. Thousands of farmers lost their land, in part because of government policies that caused soaring interest rates as demand for their products plunged, leading to falling land values.In Iowa — one of the hardest hit states — there were about 500 farm auctions a month in 1983 when families had no choice but to sell.Decades later, those memories remain fresh for Rick Juchems, whose parents had to sell their 640-acre farm in Iowa. Just as feared by those protesting in India, the American farmers lost their livelihoods and sense of identity.“We were just trying to stay alive,” said Juchems, who later was able to continue farming thanks to his in-laws. “That’s what you work all your life for and then it’s gone.”Rural economies in the Midwest that had been declining for decades were devastated by the farm crisis. But while many farmers who survived emerged more prosperous, the communities near them continued to struggle. Researchers fear the same could happen in India if New Delhi refuses to repeal the law that favors corporate farming.Post-crisis, many Americans in rural areas were able to adapt, moving to cities and finding jobs, but Bengaluru, India-based social anthropologist Aninhalli Vasavi said farmers in India have few options. Even as economic realities force them to leave their rural homes, they often struggle in urban areas.“India has not had a substantial industrial base to absorb the large population into gainful industrial or urban employment,” Vasavi said via email. “Instead, vast number of rural migrants are ‘adversely integrated’ into the low-end urban and construction economy.”The challenges facing India are common to many developing countries in Asia, where farmland has been gobbled up, often for factories and property development, leaving legions of farmers without adequate compensation and bereft of their livelihoods.In countries including Myanmar, Cambodia and China, many end up on the fringes of fast industrializing cities, finding low-paid work in service jobs such as massage parlors and delivery services that provide no social benefits or security.Vasavi and others also worry about the environmental consequences of the shift from labor-intensive agriculture in India toward the large-scale farming familiar in the US. Such farming isn’t new to India, which implemented aspects of industrial farming — dubbed the Green Revolution — in the 1960s and succeeded in increasing production and reducing widespread hunger.Even as the many small plots make India less productive than in the US, researchers say Indian farmers are good stewards of their land and avoid some of the environmental consequences seen in US agriculture, such as fertilizer runoff and soil depletion.Peggy Barlett, an Emory University anthropology professor who studies agriculture and rural life, said that while a push for industrial farming might seem obvious to Americans accustomed to large-scale farming, it makes less sense in India, where there is plenty of labor but less money for expensive farm equipment.As more attention is paid to the role of agriculture in climate change, US farmers also will be confronted more in coming years with the environmental cost of petroleum-based fertilizer, rather than relying on organic methods used frequently on small farms, Barlett said.Ohio State University researcher Andrea Rissing said there has been a surge in young Americans growing vegetables on a few acres, in some ways more like in India than in the US Midwest. Those small holdings meet a growing demand for fresh, locally grown produce.Rissing said many of her students have no choice but to think small because farmland is so expensive, but they also are drawn to non-mechanized farming that improves soils and limits runoff into waterways. Others are building food hubs to market their vegetables locally, rather than send it to markets nationwide and abroad as is typical of large-scale agriculture in the USIt’s the kind of farming Rissing prefers, but she acknowledges: “Farming is hard. It’s hard for small-scale farmers and it’s hard for big corn and soybean farmers, too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-farmers-protests-resonate-with-us-agriculture-101612200220830.html

I am hopeful that after Mamata and Mission Shakti the next logical step towards women empowerment would be reservation for women in Lok Sabha and the state assemblies. We will continue to fight for this,” he said.Patnaik praised the Budget for its focus on capital investment to boost growth, reintroduction of developmental financial institution, allocation for Covid-19 vaccines, industry and sector specific interventions.“Further capital investments very much required in Odisha both in railways and highways sectors as it has been planned for other states. There is a need to increase allocation in social assistance programmes and quantum of transfers for local bodies. Centralization of revenue by introduction of cess in petrol and diesel will weaken the Centre- state fiscal balance,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/naveen-patnaik-lauds-budget-2021-says-dip-in-share-of-central-taxes-worrying-101612196049907.html

It will look into issues related to their identity. We have been demanding the demarcation of a geographical area (in the Darjeeling hills) but what about those who live elsewhere?”Tamang was referring to the demand for a separate state of Gorkhaland comprising parts of Darjeeling, Terai and Dooars.“The All India Gorkha Assembly should be formed by amending the Constitution. The proposed body will not operate within any designated geophysical area. It will be a pan-India statutory development body and all elected people’s representatives from the community should be its members,” said Tamang."The Indo Bhutan Treaty of 1949 and Indo Nepal Friendship Treaty of 1950 should be reviewed to grant constitutional justice to Gorkhas,” he said.Tamang also demanded the publication of the report of Eminent Persons Group (EPG). The EPG was formed in 2016 by India and Nepal to review the Indo-Nepal Friendship Treaty of 1950 and other agreements between the two countries.Tamang said, “Our demand is that article 6, 7 and 8 of the 1950 treaty should be reviewed. Because of these, Indian Gorkhas are facing an existential and identity crisis. If it is not reviewed and amended we will continue to face a crisis. The EPG has met nine times but till now we do not know the outcome of those meetings. The report has neither been made public by the Indian government nor by the Nepal government.”Tamang said that according to the 1949 Indo-Bhutan treaty, the land in Dooars and Kalimpong district is still owned by Bhutan. “We demand to know the stand of the Indian government on this. We will be writing to the Prime Minister, the chief minister and the governor,” he saidWest Bengal’s tourism minister and legislator from Jalpaiguri district, Goutam Deb, refused to comment on Tamang’s demand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/darjeelings-gjm-an-ally-of-tmc-wants-national-body-for-gorkhas-101612195969855.html
01-02-2021||India||Twitter restores 250 accounts blocked in India for a controversial hashtag||Microblogging website Twitter late Monday evening moved to restore nearly 250 accounts that were blocked in India earlier in the day for allegedly using a controversial hashtag, a person familiar with the matter said.The decision to restore the accounts was taken after a meeting between Twitter officials and those from the ministry of electronics and information technology that had asked the social media company to block access to the handles “to prevent an escalation of violence” in the backdrop of the farmers' agitation.“Twitter had blocked these accounts in the interim in response to a valid legal request from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology pending discussions with them,” said a person familiar with the matter on condition of anonymity.The accounts that had been “withheld” by Twitter included those of Kisan Ekta Morcha, activist Hansraj Meena, former Lok Sabha MP and CPI(M) leader Mohammed Salim, media outlet Caravan India, and actor Sushant Singh. The account of Prasar Bharati CEO Shashi Shekhar, who had nudged Twitter to act against people using the hashtag, was also restricted. The person added that the microblogging website conveyed to the officials concerned that the content withheld was "speech and newsworthy”. “Protecting public conversation and Transparency is fundamental to Twitter... the content is in process of being unblocked,” the person said.Hindustan Times reached out to the electronics and information technology ministry for a response but did not receive one immediately.But a government official had earlier explained that the IT ministry had issued directions to Twitter under Section 69 (A) of the Information Technology Act at the home ministry’s instance. “The home ministry said that the tweets could lead to an adverse law and order situation. The accounts have been withheld to prevent an escalation of violence,” a government official said hours before Twitter restored the accounts.Section 69(A) of the IT Act empowers the government to block access to content that is seen to pose a threat to public order.Withholding an account under Twitter’s policy restricts access to posts by the user. This is different from a suspension, as the account can be made available again and the restrictions are limited to the “specific jurisdiction that has issued the valid legal demand or where the content has been found to violate local law”.The accounts, according to the message displayed by the site, were withheld in India upon receipt of a legal demand. They were accessible to Twitter users if they changed their settings to another country.Twitter’s decision to act in line with the request from the government was sharply criticised by civil rights activists and opposition leaders who said it amounted to throttling free speech. Many people linked the decision to restrict access to selected accounts to their support to the farmers' protest.“After Facebook, the Modi govt seems to have taken control of Twitter India. This backdoor attempt to block the voice of those, who speak for free speech & farmers rights, has unmasked the authoritarian soul of this fascist BJP regime,” Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said.Surjewala said the government had set a new standard in humiliating the constitution of the world’s largest democracy by compelling tech platforms to block accounts of anti-establishment entities, the Modi government has set.“Shocking! @TwitterIndia suspends several accounts of handles giving information about Farmers protests in response to 'legal demands'! Of whom? Govt? Certainly not of any court. If Twitter is going to kowtow to govt demands, how can it call itself an independent platform for FOE(freedom of expression),” lawyer and activist Prashant Bhushan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-restores-250-accounts-blocked-in-india-for-a-controversial-hashtag-101612195458796.html

01-02-2021||India||11 patients have a narrow escape as fire breaks out in a Cuttack hospital||Nearly a dozen patients in a private hospital in Cuttack city of Odisha had a providential escape on Monday when a major fire broke out at the facility.Officials said some extension and construction work was being carried out in Sun Hospital at Tulasipur area when the fire started on the top floor. As smoke bellowed out, the hospital authorities shifted 11 patients out quickly. The hospital, among the biggest nursing homes in Cuttack, did not have many patients as construction work was going on.Cuttack deputy commissioner of police Prateek Singh confirmed that there had been no casualties or injury due to the fire. The hospital is owned by one Dr Dipak Mitra.The approach road to the hospital is quite narrow, and it created hurdles for the fire tenders, at least 5 fire tenders entered the area to put out the flames. The fire service personnel also used a hydraulic platform to carry out operations on the top floor of the building.Maheswar Swain, director of the Odisha Fire and Disaster Response Academy said the fire service department has not granted any fire licence to the hospital. “The hospital authorities had been directed to adopt adequate fire safety measures. But they are yet to get the certificate. We could evacuate the patients safely as we had done mock evacuation exercises there earlier,” said Swain.Cuttack district collector Bhabani Shankar Chayani said that an inquiry has been ordered into the incident to find out if the fire safety measures were in place at the hospital.This is the second instance of fire in an Odisha hospital in less than 6 months. In September last year, 127 Covid-19 patients in a hospital of Cuttack city had a narrow escape when a fire broke out in the ICU of Sadguru Covid hospital in Jagatpur area of Cuttack. As smoke enveloped the ICU and other rooms, many patients fell unconscious.In the largest-ever hospital fire in the state, 24 patients were asphyxiated to death in Bhubaneswar's SUM hospital when a fire broke out in the ICU, dialysis and emergency units of the hospital in October 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/11-patients-have-a-narrow-escape-as-fire-breaks-out-in-a-cuttack-hospital-101612194227168.html

The government will get to know its strength. We will make it fail at every place. We will bear the cost of the stage. We speak for the honour of the farmers."Replying to him, Rana said the welfare of farmers has always been the BJP's top priority."I am myself a son of a farmer and BJP has always kept the welfare of the farmers in its agenda. But I would only say that show of strength is never done against the family," Rana told PTI on Monday."Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken the initiative of doubling the income of the farmers through new laws. And if the farmer brothers have raised questions, then the PM has kept the door for talks open," he added.The UP sugarcane development minister accused the Congress of misleading the farmers over the agri laws."In 2013, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had spoken about amendments in laws for improvement in the agriculture sector. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi implemented this with courage, then instead of praising it, the party started misguiding the farmers. When such people joined the farmers' protest, its direction changed."When asked to comment on the recent remarks made by Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav over the farmers' issue, the UP minister alleged that indulging in casteist politics, spreading animosity in society, deriving political mileage and defining socialism using one's own lens is the priority of Yadav and his party.On Sunday, the SP chief had said that the farmers were deeply hurt by the moves made by the BJP to defame them."The farmers are feeling deeply hurt because of the moves made by the BJP to defame them. The BJP has enacted demonetisation, GST, labour laws and farm laws to give benefits only to the billionaires. The BJP has tortured the common people," he had said in a tweet in Hindi.Rana condemned the incidents of violence that unfolded during the farmers' tractor parade in Delhi on Republic Day."When the prime minister, home minister and the agriculture minister have kept the option of talks open, then solution can be reached through talks. Prime Minister Modi and UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath have continuously worked in the interest of the farmers," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/show-of-strength-is-never-done-against-family-up-minister-on-naresh-tikait-s-remarks-101612193453895.html

01-02-2021||India||SC notice on privacy concerns to Google, WhatsApp, Amazon UPIs||The Supreme Court on Monday issued notices to WhatsApp Pay, Google Pay and Amazon Pay on a petition raising concerns over data protection on their unified payment interface. The petition was filed by Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament (MP) Binoy Viswam from Communist Party of India (CPI).Although a notice on the petition was earlier issued by the top court on October 15, 2020, responses were filed only by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). But with the absence of any response from WhatsApp Pay, Google Pay and Amazon Pay who were named as parties in the petition, Viswam’s counsel senior advocate Krishnan Venugopal informed the court that formal notice must be sent to them as well.The three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde issued a notice on the petition and also on an intervention filed by two information technology professionals Vaibhav Gupta and Yedhu Krishna Menon. The bench sought responses from the UPI platforms and posted the matter for hearing after four weeks.Also Read: Twitter restores accounts restricted for talking about ‘farmer genocide’According to the petition, sensitive financial data of Indian users was at huge risk as these private entities are based abroad and can use the data of Indian citizens abroad in the absence of strong scrutiny by RBI. The petition cited an April 2018 circular of RBI that required all UPI operators to ensure that all the data related to payment systems operated by them is stored in India. The operators were asked to comply with the requirement within six months.Subsequently, RBI filed an affidavit denying any role in this regard. The banking regulator told the top court that the NPCI has the responsibility to ensure the UPIs operate under the laws that govern them. Since the permission to operate UPIs has been granted by NPCI, the RBI has no regulatory control that can be exercised over UPIs operated by WhatsApp/Facebook, Google and Amazon.On Monday, the CPI MP also filed an additional affidavit to bring on record the threat to privacy posed by WhatsApp by highlighting the case of the Pegasus Spyware attack on thousands of WhatsApp users last year which exposed the vulnerability of content shared on WhatsApp. Viswam, in a separate application, pointed out a recent incident involving the TRP scam where conversations between a top journalist and ex-CEO of Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) were leaked.The application filed through his lawyer Sriram Parakkat said, “It is still not clear as to how these chats made their way into the public domain, when WhatsApp guarantees end-to-end encryption of messages sent within the application. These incidents raise serious questions to the sanctity and security of conversations on the application, and in the case of the Payments service offered by the application, the concern is not only limited to private conversations, but even more sensitive data that must be protected.”The Supreme Court is already seized of two petitions on the issue of safety of UPIs and lack of regulatory regime to ensure protection of data exchanged on these forums. The first petition was filed by NGO Centre for Accountability and Systemic Change while the second petition was filed specifically against WhatsApp Pay by an unregistered think tank called Good Governance Chambers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-notice-on-privacy-concerns-to-google-whatsapp-amazon-upis-101612192948826.html
01-02-2021||India||Twitter restores accounts restricted for talking about 'farmer genocide'||Twitter has started restoring several accounts that were restricted for allegedly talking about 'farmer genocide' using the hashtag #Modiplanningfarmergenocide. According to people familiar with the matter, the government had told the micro-blogging platform to indefinitely withhold nearly 250 accounts to “prevent an escalation of violence”.The Twitter accounts were withheld after the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (Meity) issued directions under Section 69(A) of the Information Technology Act. The withheld accounts included that of farmers’ collective Kisan Ekta Morcha, news magazine Caravan India, actor Sushant Singh, activist Hansraj Meena and former Lok Sabha MP and CPI(M) leader Mohammed Salim among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-restores-accounts-restricted-for-talking-about-farmer-genocide-101612192432551.html
01-02-2021||India||Farmers announce nationwide agitation on Feb 6, issue calls to block roads||Barely a week after the violence in the national capital on India's 72nd Republic Day, a section of protesting farmers on Monday gave a call for a nationwide agitation on February 6. This comes even as thousands of farmers are protesting against the three contentious farm laws at the borders of Delhi for more than two months now."There will be a country-wide agitation on February 6. We will block roads between 12pm and 3pm," Balbir Singh Rajewal of Bhartiya Kisan Union (R) said, according to news agency ANI.The farmers made the announcement during a press conference at the Singhu Border that they will block national and state highways for three hours to lodge their protest. The road blockade has been called by farm union to reinforce their demands of the repeal of the farm laws, against the suspension of internet and barricading of roads, and against the budget announced on Monday.This announcement from farmers comes amid tight security measures by the Delhi Police near the protest sites where buses of the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) are being used to seal main entry points amid other multi-layered security arrangements and checkpoints both by the police and farmers' union volunteers. Ghazipur, the new focal point of the ongoing farmers' agitation, also witnessed heightened restrictions on Monday even as it continues to aggrieve Delhi, Noida and Ghaziabad commuters. The Delhi-UP border site, which is galvanising farmers from Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand days after BKU leader Rakesh Tikait's emotional appeal, is a fortress in the making with security arrangements being amplified with every passing day.As the farmers alleged that they have been "ignored" in the Union Budget 2021-22, they also pointed out that water and power supply have been curtailed at their protest venues. The Samkyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of protesting unions, also alleged that the Twitter accounts of Kisan Ekta Morcha and a user named 'Tractor2Twitter' have been restricted. While the accounts on the social media site remained restricted in India for the whole day, they were restored slowly by Twitter around late evening.Swaraj Abhiyan leader Yogendra Yadav alleged the action against the Twitter account was taken on the "request of government authorities". The Union government, Yadav said, has "reduced the allocation to agriculture sector" in this budget.This comes as the government claims that they have introduced a slew of measures to aid the agricultural sector. During her budget speech, Sitharaman said that there is a steady increase in the procurement of wheat, rice, pulses from farmers. The finance minister also said that the Minimum Support Price (MSP) regime has undergone a sea change to ensure the price that is at least 1.5 times the cost of production across all commodities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-announce-nationwide-agitation-on-feb-6-issue-calls-to-block-roads-101612190684503.html
01-02-2021||India||Farmers' protest: A fortress in making in Ghazipur||With parked DTC buses sealing main entry points, multi-layered security arrangements and check points -- both by police and farmers' union volunteers -- Ghazipur, the new focal point of the ongoing farmers' agitation, witnessed heightened restrictions on Monday.The Delhi-UP border site, which is galvanising farmers from Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand days after BKU leader Rakesh Tikait's emotional appeal, is a fortress in the making with security arrangements being amplified with every passing day.Concertina wires -- a new addition in at least three points -- boulders in between the barriers. No major road is open for movement of vehicles and people which is proving to be a growing problem for many passing the stretch.Rakesh Tikait, the star farmer leader, while addressing a packed crowd from the main stage also mentioned the newly put barbed wires in his speech."They (the administration) have put these barbed wires, not us. They are not allowing people to come to Delhi. We are not the one blocking the roads. If we block roads, they ask us to vacate, but no action is taken when the same is done by these security forces," he said to a cheering crowd.Also Read | Farm laws: Agriculture minister has a suggestion and a warning for oppositionOn Wednesday night, the atmosphere was tense at Ghazipur. The Ghaziabad administration had issued an "ultimatum" to the protesters to vacate a stretch of the Delhi-Meerut expressway they were occupying as the January 26 clashes painted a not-so-peaceful picture of the peasant community.As security presence at the site escalated, fears grew that the protesters would be forcibly evicted, but the emotional outburst of Rakesh Tikait saved the day -- and possibly the whole movement -- and people in tens of thousands started converging at the protest site in support of the agitation.Many commuters complained that the heightened security measures and new restrictions on routes day after day are affecting their daily commute."Since December we were facing problems with this stretch, but the security and restrictions has been grown by leaps and bounds. The interior routes which they have not barricaded -- as of yet -- are not only congested but are in a pathetic condition, making them too dangerous to travel on," said Navdeep Kumar, a regular commuter of the National Highway-24.To keep at bay an unruly crowd and any possible plot to disturb the peaceful movement, the volunteers have taken the matter into their own hands. They are maintaining high vigil in the area by setting up multiple-check points."We don't allow locals to enter without any rhyme or reason. Even if you are media, you have to show your id-card for entry. The drill is applied round the clock," said a volunteer, standing next to a make-shift checkpoint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-a-fortress-in-making-in-ghazipur-101612191922016.html
01-02-2021||India||Govt orders probe by Revenue Commissioner into Shivamogga blast; Congress stages walkout||The Karnataka government on Monday asserted that no illegal quarrying or mining would be allowed in the state and said the Revenue Commissioner will probe the blast near Shivamogga, which killed six people, even as the opposition staged a walkout, demanding a judicial probe. As soon as Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai made the announcement about the probe and that police too are investigating it, Leader of the opposition Siddaramaiah demanded that a judicial commission, headed by a sitting High Court judge, be constituted, "for the truth to come out." As his demand was not acceded to, the LoP said the government's conduct was creating suspicion that it was trying to protect someone, and staged a walkout from the assembly along with other Congress legislators. Six people were killed in the powerful explosion of a truckload of gelatin sticks at a stone crushing unit in Shivamogga district on January 21. Replying on behalf of the government to the incident and the probe relating to it as Siddaramaiah had raised the issue, Bommai admitted that illegal quarrying or mining has been going on for some years now under successive governments. He said there was a nexus between landholders, quarry land holders,explosive suppliers and some officials,leading to such illegal activities and stressed the need to break it and also spoke of steps like increasing fine and jail term for breaking rules and making 'mineral protection force' effective. On the Shivamogga incident, Bommai said officials had given the owners license for crushing despite knowing that illegal mining or quarrying was taking place at the siteand cases were booked against them earlier. Explosive materials were brought in from Andhra Pradesh, he said "it looks like no rules or regulations or permit conditions had been followed....investigation is going on and merciless action will be taken against all those responsible." On Siddaramaiah's demand that those guilty must be booked under Section 302 of IPC for murder, instead of Section 304 (culpable homicide), he said it can be done in due course, based on the investigation "The government has taken this case very seriously, especially transportation and storage of large quantities of explosive. Reports suggest it was about 1,350 kg,but only a probe can ascertain it," he said, adding control on explosives is necessary to check illegal mining As part of the probe police have seized such materials in Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh, Bommai said. Expressing worry about large quantity of gelatin sticks transported and its outcome had it reached the hands of anti- socials or terrorists, he said steps were on for "excessive control" of explosives, as he noted that cases were booked against those involved under the stringent explosives act. He said illegal quarrying or mining would be stopped in Karnataka and only those with licenses will be allowed to function. "It has been decided that the probe will be by the Revenue Commissioner after the opposition leader and others had said the Deputy Commissioner (of Shivamogga) should not probe as he had not acted against such illegal activities," Bommai added. Unhappy with his response, the LoP cited reports of involvement of politicians and officials in illegal quarrying or mining and urged the government to get a survey done across the state to identify those that are illegal. "Take strong measures to stop it, take strict action against those involved, especially errant officials,"he said, as he noted that an independent agency should inquire into the incident and it was not possible for the Revenue Commissioner to do so as summons and warrants have to be issued with the probe stretching to neighboring Andhra Pradesh. "If it is not inquired into by a sitting high court judge, the truth will not come out...it will seem as though the government was trying to protect someone," he said as he led Congress MLAs in staging a walkout. Earlier,Siddaramaiah while pointing to reports of large- scale illegal quarrying in the state, especially Shivamogga, urged the government to halt them at once as he also voiced concern over transportation of large quantities of explosives. "In the Pulwama blast it is said that about 250 kg explosives were used, whereas reports of the blast in Shivamogga said it was 1,350 kg." He demanded a criminal case be registered against all errant officials and those who supported illegal activity. In the Legislative Council too, the Congress made a similar demand for the probe, with the opposition leader S R Patil saying the blast pointed to 'serious lapses' and made a comparison to the quantity used Pulwama and in Shivamogga. He said if illegal mining and unlawful transportation of explosives cannot be controlled by the Deputy Commissioner and Superintendent of Police of Shivamogga even in the CM's home district, one wondered what the situation would be in the rest of the state. BJP MLC Ayanur Manjunath alleged that those who died were not labourers, but some people engaged to transport the explosives and were part of the nexus. The leader of the house Kota Srinivas Poojary said the CM has assured stringent action against the illegalities. The quarry owner and two of his associates have so far been arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-orders-probe-by-revenue-commissioner-into-shivamogga-blast-congress-stages-walkout-101612190837746.html
01-02-2021||India||Patna HC raps Bihar govt for slow progress in cases of gang rapes of minors||The Patna high court has rapped the Bihar government on the knuckles for its slackness in two recent cases of gang rape of minors in Muzaffarpur and Madubani districts and the murder of one of them and attempts by the perpetrators to destroy evidence of the crime.Acting on an email complaint from child protection specialist of Unicef, Mansoor Qadri, a division bench of the court headed by Chief Justice Sanjay Karol on January 27 ordered for converting the complaint into a public interest litigation (PIL) and asked the authorities to file their reply within a week.A 16-year girl was allegedly raped by four men and burnt alive in Sahebganj area of Muzaffapur on January 11. Another girl of the same age, who is hearing and speech impaired was gang raped on January 12 and her eyes were severely damaged after the rapists shoved a sharp wooden object. Moved by the manner in which the criminals raped the minors and tried to destroy the evidence, Qadri had sent an email to the Chairperson, Patna High Court Committee of Juvenile Justice and POCSO on January 15.“…the State agency appears to have adopted a very casual approach and has not shown the urgency, unlike the urgency shown in the murder of IndiGo manager (Rupesh Kumar Singh) in Patna,” the court remarked, asking the officials concerned to file a reply on this matter while fixing February 10 as the next date of hearing.The division bench noted that “in both the cases, the crime has become more vicious, as the perpetrators not only committed the crime, but also attempted to destroy all the evidence by burning to death one of the victims and snatching away the vision of the second survivor. The manner, in which the crimes have been committed against the minor girls, is shocking.”“Considering the gravity of the offence and ever-increasing incidents of violence against young girls of Bihar, we take cognizance of the e-mail of Qadri and the same may be treated as a writ petition. Issue notice to all the respondents and are directed to submit a report within a week,” the order said.The order further stated that “It is not a mere matter of violation of an ordinary right of a person, but the violation of the fundamental rights. Rape is an offence, which is violative of the fundamental right of a person guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. Rape is a crime not only against the person of a woman, it is a crime against the entire society.”Prakirtita Sharma has been appointed as Amicus Curiae in this case.Sub-divisional police officer (SDPO), Saraiya, Rajesh Kumar Sharma, under whose jurisdiction the minor was gang raped and burnt alive, refused to disclose the progress made by the police in this case. However, a senior officer of Harlakhi police station of Madhubani said that three persons had been arrested in connection with rape and attempt to blind the girl in the district.Leaders of opposition parties including RJD’s Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and Prem Chandra Mishra of the Congress had cornered chief minister Nitish Kumar over the rapes and asked him to quit if he was feeling too tired and exhausted to protect young girls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/patna-hc-raps-bihar-govt-for-slow-progress-in-cases-of-gang-rapes-of-minors-101612190608582.html

The buses have all facilities like beds, pantry, air conditioning, washrooms, sitting area. We are also providing tents along with the bus, for tourists who want to camp.”The buses which can accommodate three to four people will be run by drivers of the department and will have to stop near GMVN tourist rest houses, “for safety of the tourists”.“The mobile shelters will have to stop near GMVN rest houses as that will ensure safety of both our tourists and the vehicle. During the stay, the shelters will get electricity connection from the rest house and the facility to refill the inbuilt water tank,” added Chauhan.He further said that the mobile night shelter initiative is likely to start before the Tehri Lake Festival scheduled to be held on February 16-17.In a similar initiative to attract tourists, GMVN is also soon going to start a restaurant in Dhanaulti, where old ambassador cars have been used for seating.“The department had some old ambassador cars which would have gone to scrap. We thought that instead of selling them, the cars can be used to generate long term earnings for the department and started the initiative to use the old as restaurant seats. The restaurant will be started in Dhanaulti,” said Chauhan.He further said that GMVN has also started an open air restaurant in Mussoorie, which is getting positive feedback from tourists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-prep-for-char-dham-yatra-uttarakhand-turns-old-buses-into-mobile-shelters-101612191132305.html

01-02-2021||India||‘Anti-farmer, anti-people and anti-country’: Bengal CM Mamata on Budget 2021||The tussle between the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and its main challenger in the coming assembly polls, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), intensified on Monday after Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced important road infrastructure projects for Bengal and a ₹1000 crore package for tea-garden workers in the state and Assam.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee branded the budget as “anti-farmer, anti-people and anti-country” during a trip to north Bengal where the BJP bagged seven of the region’s eight Lok Sabha seats in 2019. Union home minster Amit Shah, on the other hand tweeted in Bengali that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had released a grant of ₹25,000 crore for “development of the state and convenience of its people” and ₹1000 crore for the “welfare of tea garden workers”.Among the salient points of the Union budget was the allocation of ₹25,000 crore for road infrastructure development and renovation of roads connecting Kolkata to Siliguri, the biggest town in north Bengal.Sitharaman also announced that 675 km of roadway will be developed and there will be freight corridors between Kharagpur in West Midnapore district and Vijayawada and between Dankuni in Hooghly district and Gomo in Bihar. She also announced an East-West freight corridor in Bengal.Banerjee arrived in Siliguri shortly after the budget speech ended and headed for a cultural event held by the state government. Her speech, however, was marked by political rhetoric.“This is an anti-farmer, anti-people, anti-country budget. They are selling all PSUs, BSNL, airports and railways. They are also selling banks and 74% of Life Insurance Corporation of India. Be very careful. You keep your money in banks. Some day you may hear that all your money is gone,” Banerjee told the audience.The TMC chief took a swipe at the Centre on the issue of infrastructure, saying the state government has done enough and is capable of taking care of its roads.“We do not need money to build roads. Give this money to the farmers and withdraw the farms laws. The government is forgiving the loans of some billionaires. For the BJP, these people are Ma Laxmi (Hindu Goddess of wealth) while poor people get nothing. They don’t even buy railway tickets for migrant workers but those who steal millions are flown to Delhi in chartered planes,” said Banerjee.Her remark was directly targeted at her former minister Rajib Banerjee, three sitting MLAs and a former legislator who flew to Delhi in a chartered plane on Saturday to join the BJP at Shah’s residence.“I will not comment on the chief minister’s statement,” said Banerjee after attending his first meeting at a BJP office in Howrah district from where he was elected twice.Banerjee also took on the Centre for announcing a package for tea-garden workers.“Why announce another ₹1000 crore when you have not kept your old promises? I have many plans for north Bengal. New industries will be set up here. You (voters) defeated me in north Bengal in the Lok Sabha. I don’t feel any shame because I know you will compensate me. Did those BJP MPs do anything for you? They did nothing. This time please vote for the TMC,” Banerjee said.In a surprise move, she announced a prize of ₹2 lakh for the dancers who took part in Monday’s cultural event.Addressing a virtual press conference, Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra said, “The only clarity in the budget is on how to sell the country’s resources. During the Covid-19 pandemic the rich became richer. The middle class don’t appear in the budget and the poor are in bad shape.”BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya dismissed the allegations. “I thank the Prime Minister for the development packages. He has paved the path for building Sonar Bangla (golden Bengal),” he said.People in the local tea industry welcomed the welfare package but said they were disappointed as well.B K Saria, chairman of the Darjeeling Tea Association, said “We are happy that the Centre has announced a ₹1000 crore package for welfare of tea-garden workers. But we are disappointed that it has not announced anything for the industry. It would have been appreciated had they announced something for the welfare of the companies.”P K Bhattacharjee, secretary general of Tea Association of India, said, “We welcome the provision for a special scheme for women and children in the tea gardens of Assam and West Bengal. Women comprise more than 50% of the workforce. The impact of the proposed minimum wages for all categories of workers has to be examined once the wages are notified.”(With inputs from Siliguri).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/antifarmer-anti-people-and-anti-country-bengal-cm-mamata-on-budget-2021-101612190040388.html

Several political parties announced to boycott the laws during the Budget Session of Parliament."I appeal to the political parties to not engage in politics every time. Those who play politics on every matter meet the same fate as that of opposing parties presently,” Tomar said, according to news agency ANI.Also Read | Budget silent on 'agricultural unrest', ignores 'entire north India': Punjab FMMany political parties, including the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Congress, Trinamool Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) have announced to boycott the farm laws and support the farmers' agitation. Before this, as many as 16 political parties boycotted President Ram Nath Kovind's address to both the Houses of Parliament over the farm legislation. The leaders had also lashed out at the ruling-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), calling it arrogant, adamant and undemocratic.NCP chief Sharad Pawar criticised the latest reforms in series of tweets. A former agriculture minister, Pawar said that the new laws will adversely affect the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and it will also weaken the mandi system. The criticism was rejected by Tomar as he said that Pawar is not bringing out "correct facts" and is "misinformed" about the laws.Tends of thousands of farmers camping at Delhi's borders are demanding a repeal of the laws and a legal guarantee for minimum support price (MSP) for the procurement of their crops. Agitating farmers claim that the new laws will weaken the MSP system, despite the Centre seeking to assure them in vain that the MSP system was here to stay and the new laws would only provide more options for farmers to sell their produce.The government has held several rounds of talks with the leaders of the farmers but has failed to bring any resolution to the matter so far.Earlier in the day, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the government is ready for talks with the protesting farmers as it is the "only solution." Sitharaman made the comments while responding to a question during the post-budget press briefing. "We can understand why farmers are sitting at the border. If any farmer has any question, agriculture minister (Narendra Singh Tomar) has never denied opportunities for talk," Sitharaman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-agriculture-minister-tomar-has-a-suggestion-for-oppn-parties-delivers-a-warning-101612187592653.html
01-02-2021||India||39 BJP workers arrested for attacking TRS MLA's house in Telangana’s Warrangal||Police in Telangana’s Warrangal arrested 39 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers on Monday for allegedly attacking the residence of Telangana Rashtra Samithi lawmaker Challa Dharma Reddy on Sunday evening.The police produced them in a local court which sent them to 14-day judicial custody. They were shifted to Warangal central jail in the afternoon. Another 14 BJP workers who were also allegedly involved in the attack on the MLA’s residence are absconding, the police said.The BJP workers led by the party’s Warangal (urban) district unit president Rao Padma attacked Reddy’s residence at Hunter Road in Hanamkonda, in protest against the latter’s comments alleging that the BJP leaders were collecting huge funds in the name of construction of the Ram temple at Ayodhya without showing any accounts and were swindling the money.The BJP workers pelted stones and eggs at the MLA’s residence and damaged window panes, flower pots and other properties on the premises. The police rushed to the spot and prevented the BJP workers from barging inside. They took the mob into custody and shifted them to Subedari police station.The ruling TRS retaliated and attacked the BJP party office. TRS workers pelted stones at the office and pulled down flex boards and banners. They also pelted stones on the vehicles of the local BJP leaders, before they were dispersed by the police. Later in the night, a large number of TRS workers also attacked the houses of BJP district unit vice-president K Ranjith and BJYM leader Apurupa Sayee.On Monday, the local unit of the TRS gave a call for shutdown of Parkal town in protest against the attack on the MLA’s residence. They blocked the roads by burning tyres and squatted to stage a dharna, bringing the traffic to a grinding halt for several hours.TRS working president K T Rama Rao, in a late-night statement, condemned the attack of the BJP workers on the MLA’s residence. “The BJP should remember that the TRS was born out of a political movement to achieve separate statehood to Telangana. If the BJP wants to resort to such violence, they must remember that TRS too has the power, strength and the force to protect its cadre,” he said.BJP legislator M Raghunandan Rao accused KTR of instigating the TRS cadres to attack the offices and residences of BJP leaders. “He is not going to achieve anything by engineering attacks on the political rivals. If the BJP cadres retaliate, the state will be in flames,” he warned.Rao said mobilising funds for the Ram temple was not like collecting party funds. “The people were voluntarily coming forward to donate funds for the construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/39-bjp-workers-arrested-for-attacking-trs-mla-s-house-in-telangana-s-warrangal-101612186328867.html

So we thought of filing it once she is out. We have to discuss.” The EC on November 23, 2017, allotted the chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami-led government with the symbol after freezing it briefly when the two factions vied for it following Jayalalithaa’s death in December 2016. Sasikala and her nephew TTV Dhinakaran challenged this in the Delhi high court, which, in 2019, upheld the EC order. The Supreme Court also dismissed two following petitions—in March 2019 and in July 2020.Also Read: TN poll battle heats up as Sasikala leaves hospitalSasikala will return to Chennai after completing a week’s quarantine in Bengaluru. On Sunday, she was discharged from the city’s Victoria Hospital where she was treated for a severe Covid-19 infection. Sending out her first political message, Sasikala left the hospital in a car bearing the AIADMK flag. She was hospitalised a week before her release from prison on January 27 in the disproportionate assets case where Jayalalithaa was also accused. The AIADMK, which expelled Sasikala and Dhinakaran on September 12, 2017, have condemned her for using the flag, terming it illegal. Law minister CV Shunmugam warned of legal action against “Sasikala or anyone” who is not a member of the party and “misuses the flag”. But Dinakaran has justified her move saying that she is the party’s general secretary. Dinakaran, an independent MLA, floated the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) with a faction of Sasikala’s supporters who want her to unite them by reclaiming the AIADMK. Palaniswami, who is the chief ministerial candidate in the AIADMK-led NDA alliance which goes to polls in April-May, has made clear that Sasikala will not be taken back. Sasikala briefly held the reins of the party after Jayalalithaa’s death amidst a power struggle with loyalist-turned-rebel O Paneerselvam. She handpicked Palaniswami as chief minister before surrendering in prison but he later united with Paneerselvam. After ousting her, the AIADMK created new posts in their by-laws with Paneerselvam as coordinator and Palaniswami as joint coordinator and Jayalalithaa as the “eternal general secretary”. Sasikala has challenged this matter which is pending in the Madras high court. The AIADMK has expelled party functionaries who put up posters welcoming Sasikala after her release. “She may gain some supporters but the AIADMK status quo will continue,” says political analyst Ravindran Duraisamy. “The present AIADMK has contested the 2019 parliamentary elections and by-elections on the symbol and name without any hindrance. It’s a settled matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-sasikala-to-file-curative-petition-for-aiadmk-s-name-and-symbol-101612186889295.html

In terms of percentage, the month saw 71% dip in deaths and 67% decline in cases in comparison to December.In the past seven months it was for the first time that the monthly death count has gone below one hundred. Last time it was in the month of June, when the Covid cases were slowly increasing from mid-March, that Jammu and Kashmir had recorded 73 deaths and 5,051 cases.“We are quite in control of the disease. The daily numbers have gone down considerably. Quite often we are now showing zero deaths,” said Kashmir's health department director Samir Mattoo.In comparison to September when the viral cases had peaked to 37,372 and deaths to 478 in the region, the month of January has registered a fall of 88% in Covid related deaths and 80% percent in infectionsIn November 216 people lost their lives to the virus, 293 in October, 478 in September, 326 in August, 279 in July and 73 in June.January also recorded the lowest average daily cases of Covid-19 infections since June. While January averaged 114 coronavirus cases daily, the number was 346 in December, 514 in November, 632 in October, 1,245 in September, 559 in August, 414 in July and 168 in June.On an average less than two daily deaths were recorded in January, six in December, seven in November while 10 were reported in October and 16 in September.The total active cases in J-K till February 1 have dropped to 709 which account for 0.56 % of the overall tally of 1,24,550 cases. That means just half per cent of the total cases are now active.Mattoo said that they are expecting the declining trend to continue. “I believe by the end of February we would have wiped out the disease,” he said.A total of 1, 21,905 people have recovered from the disease while 1,936 people have lost their lives which translate to 1.55% of the total cases. A total of 1,215 people have succumbed to the disease in Kashmir and 721 in Jammu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-casualties-in-jammu-and-kashmir-fall-71-in-january-101612184702700.html
01-02-2021||India||India spent ₹20,776 crore on emergency defence purchase amid border row||India spent ₹20,776 crore on the emergency purchase of weapons and systems to beef up its military capabilities to deal with new security challenges in the midst of a lingering border dispute with China in eastern Ladakh, where both armies have deployed a total of 100,000 soldiers and advanced weaponry in their forward and depth areas, Budget documents showed on Monday.The money spent on building capabilities was over and above the budget allocation for modernisation last year. India earmarked ₹1.13 lakh crore as capital expenditure in Budget 2020-21 but revised estimates in the new budget, presented in Parliament by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, show the military ended up spending ₹1.34 lakh crore on modernisation.The border conflict with China forced India to speed up the purchase of smart air-to-ground weapons, missiles, rockets, air defence systems, GPS-guided artillery ammunition, tank ammunition and assault rifles. The United States, Russia, France and Israel are among the countries from which India imported weaponry last year.The increase in capital expenditure -- from ₹1.13 lakh crore last year to ₹1.35 lakh crore -- was one of the highlights of Budget 2021-22. It has gone up by almost 19% at a time when India is planning to place orders for new fighter jets, medium transport aircraft, basic trainer aircraft, light combat helicopters, surface-to-air missiles and loitering weapons systems.The allocation under the capital head has been significantly increased, the defence ministry said in a statement. “The allocation represents an increase of 18.75% over FY 2020-21 and 30.62% over FY 2019-20. This is the highest ever increase in capital outlay in the last 15 years,” the ministry said.An 18% increase in budgetary allocation for capital procurement goes some way in recognising the urgent need of modernisation and weapon enhancement requirements of the armed forces, said Anuj Prasad, head (aerospace and defence), Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas.“Given that capital procurement expenditure for the previous year exceeded the budgetary allocation by more than ₹20,000 crore, a lot more needed to be done given the current geopolitical scenario and the glaring gaps in military preparedness,” he said.Overall, India has set aside ₹4.78 lakh crore for military spending in its budget for 2021-22, compared to last year’s ₹4.71 lakh crore --- both figures include defence pensions. This translates into an increase of 1.45%.But if defence pensions are not taken into account, this year’s military spending stands at ₹3.62 lakh crore, compared to ₹3.37 lakh crore last year --- an increase of 7.3%. Budget documents show that the government’s defence pension bill will be lower than last year – down from ₹1.33 lakh crore to ₹1.15 lakh crore. Last year it was higher as ₹18,000 crore was paid out as pension arrears, officials said.Briefing reporters, Sitharaman said the government agreed in-principle to provide a non-lapsable fund for defence for the first time in line with a recommendation made by the 15th Finance Commission. This will help military modernisation as unspent funds will not have to be returned at the end of the year.This year’s allocation includes ₹2.12 lakh crore for revenue expenditure, compared to ₹2.09 lakh crore last year.This year’s budget (excluding pensions) is a 1.62% of the country’s gross domestic product. If defence pensions in the budget are taken into account, the budget accounts for 2.14% of the GDP.The defence budget (excluding pensions) is 10.4% of the government’s total expenditure for 2021-22. If pensions are counted, it is 13.72% of the total expenditure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-spent-rs-20-776-crore-on-emergency-defence-purchase-amid-border-row-101612182594546.html

The vans will travel to each of the 70 constituencies and AAP members will hold a total of 6,500 public meetings in the next 45 days with a target to add one lakh new party members in the state, Sisodia said."The state has gone into the poll mode as only about a year is left for the next assembly elections. Considering that, we have launched this massive mass outreach programme to visit every village of the state and hold public meetings so as to add at least one lakh new party members," Sisodia said while launching the campaign.Each van is earmarked for one constituency.“They will go among the public and spread the message of Kejriwal model of governance that Uttarakhand needs good schools, government hospitals and mohalla clinics like Delhi for which can only be done by AAP," Arvind Keriwal’s deputy saidThe senior AAP leader alleged that the BJP and Congress have taken turns to exploit the state in the last 20 years while depriving its people of development."They did nothing for the people. They will be made aware of how Arvind Kejriwal brought significant changes in Delhi in just five years of his governance. The same can be done in Uttarakhand if AAP comes to power which we are sure will happen as people are taking it as a hope," said Sisodia.The ruling BJP and the opposition Congress however, shrugged off Sisodia's claims.BJP state media in-charge, Manveer Singh Chauhan said, "AAP is expert in only spreading lies and giving false hopes to people which it has been doing in Delhi. But the people of Uttarakhand are smart enough not to for their false hopes."Congress' state spokesperson Garima Dasauni termed AAP as a party that parachuted into Uttarakhand."It knows nothing about the state's demography and political scenario but claims it will win the 2022 elections which is just laughable. It has no significance in Uttarakhand which they will know in the 2022 election results," said Dasauni.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-me-bhi-kejriwal-aap-s-massive-membership-drive-for-2022-polls-101612183065720.html
01-02-2021||India||Union Budget 2021: Govt earmarks ₹2,217 crore for tackling air pollution||The Centre on Monday earmarked a sum of ₹2,217 crore for tackling air pollution in 42 urban centres, even as it shrunk the budgetary allocation for the environment ministry from the last fiscal by nearly 8% for 2021-22While it has reduced the amount allocated to the climate change action plan by ₹10 crore and to Project Tiger by ₹50 crore, the amount for National Coastal Mission has been almost doubled from ₹103 crore in the last fiscal to ₹200 crore in 2021-22.Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her budget speech, allocated ₹2869.93 crore for the ministry, out of which ₹470 crore were allotted to control pollution -- ₹10 crore more than the last budget.In addition to this amount, the minister also announced a sum of ₹2,217 crore for combating air pollution in 42 urban centres.“To tackle the burgeoning problem of air pollution, I propose to provide an amount of ₹2,217 crores for 42 urban centres with a million-plus population in this budget,” Sitharaman said.For the first time, a budget provision of ₹20 crore has been made for the newly formed statutory body Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) for the national capital region and adjoining areas.The ₹407 crore for 'Control of Pollution' includes financial assistance provided to pollution control Boards/Committees and funding to National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), launched in January 2019.In the last budget session, the climate change action plan was allotted ₹40 crore which has been reduced to ₹30 crore for the year 2021-22.The budgetary allocation for National Mission for Green India has been reduced from ₹311 crore in the last financial year to ₹290 crore this time with the national afforestation programme alone being allotted ₹235 crore, lower than last year's amount of ₹246 crore.In the area of wildlife conservation, the allocation for government-initiated projects -- Project Tiger and Project Elephant -- saw some changes, with the former getting ₹50 crore less and the other being shrunk by ₹2 crore.The allocation for Project Tiger saw a reduction of ₹100 crore in two years. From ₹350 crore allotted to it in 2019-20, it was reduced to ₹300 crore in the last fiscal, and now the allocation stands at ₹250 crore.The budget for Project Elephant, which was launched to conserve jumbos across the country, has been reduced to ₹33 crore from ₹35 crore last year.The budget for the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), a statutory body under the ministry responsible for tiger census and conservation of wild cats, saw a minor reduction of ₹50 lakh from ₹10.5 crore to ₹10 crore.The budget for the National Coastal Mission was nearly doubled with the government allotting it ₹200 crore from ₹103 crore allotted to it last year. In 2019-20, the NCM was allotted ₹95 crore.Under the National Coastal Mission, the environment ministry is responsible for ensuring livelihood security of coastal communities, including fisher folks, conserving, protecting the coastal stretches and promoting sustainable development based on scientific principles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-budget-2021-govt-earmarks-rs-2-217-crore-for-tackling-air-pollution-101612182506501.html
01-02-2021||India||Tamil Nadu CM announces financial relief to farmers affected by crop loss||The Tamil Nadu government will provide ₹1,116.97 crore as input relief to about 11.43 lakh farmers across the state, anticipating central assistance, for the crop loss of the ryots due to rains in January, Chief Minister K Palaniswami said on Monday.The relief sum will be credited directly to their bank accounts, he said in a statement.Owing to the heavy rains last month, a total of 6,62,689 hectares of agricultural crops besides 18,645 hectares of horticultural crops were damaged, the chief minister said."Taking a considerate view of the farmers' plight, my government has already announced a relief higher and above the ceiling permitted by the state disaster relief fund guidelines, to the ryots affected by cyclones Nivar and Burevi," Palaniswami said.Accordingly, the input relief for rain-fed and irrigated paddy crop and other irrigated crops was enhanced to ₹20,000 from ₹13,500 per hectare.While the relief for all rain-fed crops, except rain-fed paddy, was hiked to ₹10,000 from ₹7,410 per hectare, the relief for the perennial crops was increased to ₹25,000 from ₹18,000 per hectare.He informed that a Central team will visit Tamil Nadu again from February 3-5 to assess the extent of crop loss of farmers.Listing out the measures launched by his government to mitigate the conditions of the farmers, Palaniswami said shortly after cyclone Nivar made a landfall near Puducherry on November 25 and 26 last year, Tamil Nadu was hit by the Burevi storm even as relief and rehabilitation activities were on."Due to the precautionary measures taken by my government, human casualties and damage to livestock during Nivar and Burevi storms were largely averted. However, both Nivar and Burevi cyclones caused severe damage to power infrastructure, while roads in many parts of the state were breached or damaged. Further, agricultural and horticultural crops too were severely damaged," he said.."Normalcy returned to the storm-affected districts due to the rescue and relief operations carried out on my advice," the chief minister added.A total financial assistance of ₹3,750.38 crore including ₹641.83 crore for temporary repairs and ₹3,108.55 crore for permanent repairs will be required from the Central government.In addition, ₹485 crore has been earmarked for temporary repairs and ₹1,029 crore for permanent repair works.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-cm-announces-financial-relief-to-farmers-affected-by-crop-loss-101612179833878.html
01-02-2021||India||Nirmala Sitharaman’s budget speech underlines govt’s focus on poll-bound states||Investment for highways and Metro rails, announcement for major fishing harbours and welfare funds for tea workers—complete with a quote from Rabindranath Tagore early in the budget speech—set the ruling dispensation’s underlying focus on poll-bound states in the Union Budget for 2021-22. Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Kerala and Assam along with the Union Territory of Puducherry will face state elections in April-May this year and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is leaving no stone unturned to win Bengal and Puducherry, improve its foothold in Kerala and Tamil Nadu and retain power in Assam. All these states, especially West Bengal, the third-largest electoral state with 42 Lok Sabha seats, are the key focus of the BJP. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman quoted Tagore’s “Faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark” to emphasise how India is well-poised to be the land of promise and hope in a post-Covid world, before her budget speech rolled out schemes with an eye on poll-bound states. Also Watch: Budget: Watch farmer leader Rakesh Tikait’s reaction to FM Nirmala’s speechHer budget also proposed ₹1,000 crore for the welfare of tea workers, especially women and their children in Assam and West Bengal—a major social issue that has wider political ramifications in the BJP’s citadel of north Bengal and Assam. A total of 675km of highway works in West Bengal worth ₹25,000 crore including the upgrade of a Kolkata – Siliguri road and “further works worth over ₹34,000 crore covering more than 1,300km of National Highways” in Assam where highway works worth around ₹19,000 crore are in progress—were announced in the budget. Sitharaman also announced, “A total of 1,100km of National Highway works in Kerala at an investment of ₹65,000 crore, including a 600km section of the Mumbai-Kanyakumari corridor in Kerala” and said the Gomoh-Dankuni section of 274.3km of the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor will be taken up soon. She also added that “We will undertake future dedicated freight corridor projects namely East Coast corridor from Kharagpur to Vijayawada, East-West Corridor from Bhusaval to Kharagpur to Dankuni and North-South corridor from Itarsi to Vijayawada. Detailed Project Reports will be undertaken in the first phase.” Both Kharagpur and Dankuni are key towns in West Bengal. Two more road projects, running through the poll-bound states, also found mention in the speech. Sitharaman announced that Bengaluru-Chennai and Chennai-Salem expressways will be awarded and construction would start in FY 21-22. These projects will not only fill the critical gaps in connectivity in these states but also provide employment for locals. The long list of infrastructure projects also includes the Centre’s funding of 11.5km in the second phase of Kochi Metro Railway, 118.9km in Phase 2 of the Chennai Metro Railway and similar projects in Bengaluru and Nagpur. The finance minister also announced major fishing harbours in Kochi, Chennai and Bengal’s Petuaghat, apart from Visakhapatnam and Odisha’s Paradip, and proposed “substantial investments” to develop these places as modern fishing harbours and fish-landing centres. “We will also develop inland fishing harbours and fish-landing centres along the banks of rivers and waterways,” the minister announced. The BJP was able to open its account in Kerala in the last assembly polls. It has three MLAs in Bengal but in the 2019 national election, the party won 18 seats in its best tally in the largest eastern state. The BJP doesn’t have any seat in Tamil Nadu but hopes to be part of a key alliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nirmala-sitharaman-s-budget-speech-underlines-govt-s-focus-on-poll-bound-states-101612179568331.html

The major highlight was the significant hike in the budget allocated to the healthcare sector,” Rawat said at a press conference."The budget provision of ₹2.23 lakh crore for the sector would help to develop the healthcare infrastructure while realising the dream of making the country healthy and safe. This will also develop the whole medical industry including pharmaceutical and medical equipment manufacturing companies in the country. It was a much-needed step which has been taken now," he said.The CM also commended the provision of ₹27.1 lakh crore for Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative of PM Modi."This will help to make the base of our PM's much ambitious Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative which will help the country develop more while becoming self-reliant," he said.Rawat also hailed the ₹40,000 crore boost in the agriculture sector in the budget saying it will develop the agricultural infrastructure in the country."Many significant steps have been taken in the agriculture sector in the budget including connecting 1000 mandis with e-National Market, micro-irrigation fund and others. PM Modi has always been working for the welfare of farmers like no other PM in the past," he said.He also commended the move to open 100 new Sainik Schools in the country. "It is of great importance for our state which sees a large number of youth going into the army every year. It is also an important step in the education sector.""Overall, the budget is an inclusive one while focusing on health, welfare of poor and rural development. It will boost the growth of our country," said Rawat.The Opposition Congress termed the budget as a "very disappointing one."Leader of Opposition Indira Hridayesh said, "It has got no relief for the middle-class people who are suffering from price rise in all essential commodities. It comprises mainly privatisation and increasing FDI which makes only the corporates happy."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/budget-will-make-india-healthy-and-safe-says-uttarakhand-cm-101612178840877.html

01-02-2021||India||Govt cracks down on Twitter accounts talking about ‘farmer genocide’||The Central government on Monday told Twitter to indefinitely withhold nearly 250 accounts and posts, that used the hashtag #Modiplanningfarmergenocide on the microblogging website, “to prevent an escalation of violence”, people familiar with the matter said.The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (Meity) issued the directions under Section 69(A) of the Information Technology Act after it received directions in this regard from the Ministry of Home Affairs, the people said. “The Home ministry said that the tweets could lead to an adverse law and order situation. The accounts have been withheld to prevent an escalation of violence,” a person familiar with the matter said. Under Section 69(A) of the IT Act, the government can suspend accounts that pose a threat to public order.Action has been taken against the accounts including farmers’ collective Kisan Ekta Morcha, news portal Caravan India, actor Sushant, Prasar Bharati CEO Shashi Shekhar, activist Hansraj Meena and former Lok Sabha MP and CPI(M) leader Mohammed Salim.The withholding of Shekhar’s account was likely a mistake because he drew the government’s attention to the hashtag, an official said. “His account will soon be available again, there must have been some confusion” said an official familiar with the matter. “He was the one who drew the government’s attention to the hashtag that was being used.”Also Watch | Budget: Watch farmer leader Rakesh Tikait’s reaction to FM Nirmala’s speechWithholding an account under Twitter’s policy restricts access to posts by the person and is done in accordance with the country’s laws. This is different from a suspension, as the account can be made available again and the restrictions are limited to the “specific jurisdiction that has issued the valid legal demand or where the content has been found to violate local law”. The accounts, according to the message displayed by the site, had been withheld in India upon receipt of a legal demand. They are accessible outside the country. A second person said that Twitter was moving to ease the restrictions against the users. “These accounts are accessible outside India,” the second person said. “Legal teams are working to find feasible solutions. The accounts may be restored soon.” Officials said that the MHA conveyed to the Meity last week that the “situation had the potential to spiral”. “MHA’s agencies looked into the matter and conveyed that the situation had the potential to spiral. The accounts were tweeting about an impending farmer genocide. The government can’t allow anyone to incite violence,” an official said.In a statement on Monday, Twitter said, “Many countries have laws that may apply to Tweets and/or Twitter account content.

Upon receipt of requests to withhold content, we will promptly notify the affected account holders (unless we are prohibited from doing so e.g. if we receive a court order under seal).”On January 27, the microblogging website took down at least 500 accounts for “spam and platform manipulation”, a day after the farmers’ tractor rally on Republic Day turned violent in Delhi. Thousands of farmers have been camping at Delhi’s borders since November last year, seeking a repeal of the new farm laws, which they say will erode their bargaining power, weaken a system of assured prices, and leave them vulnerable to exploitation by big agri-businesses. The government has maintained that the laws aim to ease restrictions on farm trade by setting up free markets, allow traders to stockpile large stocks of food for future sales and lay down a framework for contract farming.The decision caused a political storm with the Congress condemning the government. “We condemn these anti-farmer , anti-journalist, anti-media actions taken by the government,” senior party leader P Chidambaram said at a press conference. Civil rights activists also slammed the microblogging site for stifling freedom of expression and being in cahoots with the government. Digital rights advocacy group Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF) tweeted that decision was taken under the “opaque” IT Act. “Reports suggest that a large number of Twitter accounts which were sharing information about the farmers’ protests have been blocked by Meity under the opaque Section 69(A) of the Information Technology Act,” IFF said. “Section 69(A) and the IT Blocking Rules prevent intermediaries like Twitter from disclosing any information about blocking of an account or tweet. The confidentiality requirement present under Rule 16 of the IT Blocking Rules creates a bizarre situation where citizens have the right to challenge blocking of online content, but they are unable to do so because they don’t have access to these legal orders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-cracks-down-on-twitter-accounts-talking-about-farmer-genocide-101612177229765.html

01-02-2021||India||SC seeks WhatsApp reply on plea for non-sharing of UPI data with any third party||The Supreme Court Monday asked instant messaging app WhatsApp to file response on a plea seeking a direction to the RBI and the NPCI to ensure that data collected on Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platforms is not shared with their parent company or any other third party under any circumstances.A bench of Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian said if WhatsApp does not file its reply, then the averment made in the writ petition filed by petitioner Rajya Sabha MP Binoy Viswam will be taken as accepted.Several interlocutory applications have been filed in the plea which also seek direction for framing regulation to ensure that data collected on UPI platforms is not “exploited” or used in any manner other than for processing payments.Senior advocate Arvind Dattar, appearing for WhatsApp India, said however no formal notice has been issued to it in the plea for impleadment in the matter.Senior advocate V Giri, appearing for Reserve Bank of India, informed the top court that they have filed their reply in the matter.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, also appearing for WhatsApp, said 'WhatsApp Pay' has received all necessary permission.Senior advocate Krishna Venugopal, appearing for the petitioner, said the last time the court asked the company if Israeli sypware Pegasus has breached their system, it stated that the issue was not pleaded in the petition, which is wrong.The bench said that it proposes that the petition be tagged with a similar plea pending in the top court and asked the Centre to file an affidavit on the issue of spyware.Venugopal said that till date Facebook and WhatsApp have not filed a counter-affidavit in the matter, despite the petition being pending for months and they should also be asked to file counter-affidavit.At the fag end of the hearing, the CJI told the counsels for WhatsApp that pleas challenging its new privacy policy are pending before the Supreme Court and posted the matter for further hearing after four weeks.In its affidavit, the RBI has told the top court that it has no responsibility to conduct “audit of members of United Payments Interface (UPI) ecosystem” and responsibility to ensure that private firms like Google and WhatsApp comply with norms lies with National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI).The RBI also said that the matters related to “data privacy and data sharing” are the domain of the central government.It also sought dismissal of the PIL filed by Viswam seeking direction to it to frame regulation to ensure that data collected on UPI platforms is not “exploited” or used in any manner other than for processing payments.The affidavit said: “It is submitted that RBI's directions issued vide circular dated April 6, 2018 on storage of payment system data pertain only to payment date storage and not sharing or privacy.RBI has not issued any instructions on data sharing by TPAPs (Third Party Application Providers) or the participants of UPI. Matters related to data privacy and data sharing come under the domain of Government of India.”It said that since NPCI is the owner and operator of the UPI, it would be more appropriate for them to respond on the status of “compliance of WhatsApp with the system rules /procedural guidelines governing UPI".Earlier, WhatsApp had denied in the court the allegations that its data can be hacked by Israeli sypware Pegasus, which had led to a controversy last year over breach of privacy following claims that Indian journalists and human rights activists were among those globally spied upon by unnamed entities.Prior to this, the apex court on October 15, last year had issued notice to RBI and others on the plea of Viswam seeking direction for framing regulation to ensure that data collected on UPI platforms is not “exploited” or used in any manner other than for processing payments.It had also sought responses of the Centre, RBI, NPCI and others including Google Inc, Facebook Inc, WhatsApp and Amazon Inc on the plea.“The RBI and NPCI have permitted the three members of 'Big Four Tech Giants' i.e. Amazon, Google and Facebook/WhatsApp (Beta phase) to participate in the UPI ecosystem without much scrutiny and in spite of blatant violations of UPI guidelines and RBI regulations,” the plea has claimed.The plea has alleged that this conduct of RBI and NPCI put the sensitive financial data of Indian users at huge risks, especially when these entities have been “continuously accused of abusing dominance and compromising data”, among other things.It said these allegations have become particularly worrisome at a time when India has banned host of Chinese applications on the ground that those applications were or could be used for data theft and could lead to security breaches.It has further sought a direction that RBI and NPCI should ensure that WhatsApp is not permitted to launch full scale operations of 'WhatsApp Pay' in India without fulfilling all legal compliances to the satisfaction of the court regarding requisite regulatory compliances.

01-02-2021||India||Union minister Tomar, NCP chief spar over farm laws||NCP chief Sharad Pawar hit back at Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Monday over the new farm laws, saying the latter was not putting forth “proper facts” before the people over minimum support price (MSP), which is a prime concern of the farmers. This comes a day after the minister had attacked Pawar for criticising the new farm laws out of “ignorance and misinformation”. He said that no provisions have been made to guarantee MSP to the farmers for trading with private buyers outside agriculture produce market committee (APMC). He also stressed that it is the duty of the Centre to convince the farmers.“Tomar ji is not bringing proper facts before the people. He has been assuring that the new laws will not affect the mandis (APMC) but farmers organisations are of the opinion that the provisions under law are favouring competitive companies,” Pawar said in a series of tweets.“Under the new laws, farmers can sell their produce outside mandis (APMC) but have no MSP guarantee when they sell their produce to private buyers. This is what the protesting farmers have been saying since the beginning. There is no assurance for fair prices to the farmers from the corporate sector in the long term,” he posted.Also read | Congress plans campaign against Centre across states over farm lawsThe former Union agriculture minister also said that the Centre passed the three farm bills without taking any political party or farmers into confidence. In the original form, the laws doesn’t guarantee fair prices to the farmers against their produce. The reference of MSP came in picture only after farmers started their agitation, he pointed out.Pawar also said the MSP was increased during his term as the agriculture minister to ensure fair prices to the farmers for their produce. “Till 2013-14, MSP was increased to ₹1,310 per quintal for rice and ₹1,400 per quintal for wheat from ₹550 per quintal for rice and ₹630 per quintal for wheat in 2003-04. The same year, the country had record production of foodgrain and MSP played important role in it,” the NCP chief said.On Sunday, responding to a critique on the new farm laws that Pawar had posted, Tomar had hoped that the NCP chief “will change his stand” and “explain the benefits of the laws to farmers.”“Pawar is considered well-versed with the issues and solutions relating to agriculture. He has himself tried hard to bring about the same agriculture reforms earlier,” the agriculture minister had said.Pawar had posted six tweets in which he said that the new laws will adversely affect the MSP and will also weaken the mandi system. He also raised concern about the amended Essential Commodities Act. “According to the Act, the Govt will intervene for price control only if rates of horticultural produce are increased by 100% and that of non-perishable items increase by 50%. Stock piling limits have been removed on food grain, pulses, onion, potato, oilseeds etc. It may lead to apprehensions that Corporates may purchase commodities at lower rates and stock pile and sell at higher prices to consumers,” he had posted on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-minister-tomar-ncp-chief-spar-over-farm-laws-101612170808243.html

The accused, who were drunk, also attacked her with bricks. One of the accused was badly beaten up by the villagers after the incident.Last Thursday, the girl was playing with her younger brother outside her aunt's house in a village under Golanthara police station area of Ganjam when she went near a culvert outside her village to attend nature’s call. The two accused - Rutu Behera and Hemant Behera - dragged her under the culvert and tried to rape her."The two accused were drunk. When she raised an alarm, they slit her throat with a sharp object. The two accused also attacked her with a broken piece of brick causing severe injuries on her head, face and ears," said Berhampur additional SP Trinath Patel.Some villagers spotted her lying in a pool of blood at one end of the village after a few hours and subsequently they informed the police.Police said the girl who was first admitted to the MKCG medical college and hospital in Berhampur and later shifted to the SCB medical college and hospital in Cuttack is now stable.The additional SP said a case against the two accused has been registered under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act and Sections 365/366, 376 (D)(B), 307 and 341 of the IPC.Police have recovered the blood-stained brick from the spot.The spurt in incidences of violence against children has raised serious concerns about their safety in the state.In July last, a five-year-old girl in Nayagarh was allegedly raped and murdered following which the state government formed a SIT to probe the matter.As per National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) figures, cases against minor children in Odisha have been steadily rising since 2017, While altogether 3,185 cases on crime against children were registered in the state in 2017, the cases increased to 5,217 in 2018 and 7,012 in 2019.

But I don’t care, I will attend it. It is a government programme and I have received invitation from the PMO. Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan also requested me as I am the local MP,” said Adhikari, TMC MP from Tamluk in East Midnapore.

Suvendu had also earlier said that more members from his family would join the BJP. “I have sought an appointment from the Lok Sabha Speaker on February 10. I am going to meet him. It is personal,” he said, while adding that he will let the people know if he takes any decision (of quitting the party). Meanwhile, the TMC said Adhikari was making false claims about threatening calls. “I think he is staging this to get attention. The TMC is not associated with such threats,” said Akhil Giri, TMC leader from the district. The BJP sought to pin it on the ruling party. Party spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said,“This is an immature task. It is unfortunate that a TMC MP is being threatened when he is still with the party. Such incidents would continue till the TMC is in power.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/got-threat-calls-for-accepting-pm-s-invite-alleges-tmc-mp-101612153947464.html

I visited Dr Prasad ancestral home on January 1. I have now decided to visit more than 15 domestic tourist places this year," Pandey told ANI.During his monthly radio programme, PM Modi said, "I received a message from my sister Priyanka Pande, who is a 23-year-old student of Hindu literature and lives in Bihar's Siwan. Priyankaji has written on Namo app that she was so inspired by my suggestion of visiting 15 domestic tourist places. On January 1, she visited a place which is very special just 15 km away from her home. It was the ancestral house of the first President of India, Dr Rajendra Prasad. She has written a beautiful thing that it was her first step towards understanding our great personalities. Priyankaji found there several books written by Dr Rajendra Prasad and many historical pictures. Indeed Priyankaji, your experience will inspire others also."During his address to the nation on Independence Day in 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi from the ramparts of the Red Fort had urged citizens to visit 15 tourist destinations within the country by 2022 to give a fillip to the domestic tourism sector.Mann ki Baat is the Prime Minister's monthly radio programme to the nation, which is broadcasted on the last Sunday of every month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-girl-to-visit-15-domestic-tourist-spots-after-pm-modi-s-praise-in-mann-ki-baat-101612153276592.html
01-02-2021||India||India expresses deep concern over military coup in Myanmar||The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Monday said it has noted the developments in Myanmar with deep concern, adding that India has always been determined in its support of democratic transition in the country."We have noted the developments in Myanmar with deep concern. India has always been steadfast in its support to the process of democratic transition in Myanmar. We believe that the rule of law and the democratic process must be upheld. We are monitoring the situation closely," the MEA said in a statement.Myanmar military television said on Monday morning that the military was taking control of the country for one year and Suu Kyi and others had been detained. The actions came on the day Myanmar's Parliament was to convene with new members taking oath following November elections.The Irrawaddy, an established online news service, reported that State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, the nation’s top leader, and the country’s president, Win Myint, were both detained before dawn on Monday. The news service cited Myo Nyunt, a spokesman for Suu Kyi’s ruling National League for Democracy party.Its report said that the party’s Central Executive Committee members, lawmakers and regional Cabinet members had also been taken into custody.Tensions had been brewing for the past few months, with the military and its political factions demanding authorities investigate allegations of mass voting fraud in the second general election with widespread participation after decades of army rule. Myanmar’s election commission last week had labeled the vote transparent and fair, and the United Nations and the European Union urged the military to respect the results.On Sunday, the military - known as the Tatmadaw - denied objecting to the outcome of the election and said it “finds the process of the 2020 election unacceptable.” The 2008 constitution allows the military to take power during a state of emergency that could cause disintegration of the union or “national solidarity,” effectively allowing soldiers to take power for vague reasons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-expresses-deep-concern-over-military-coup-in-myanmar-101612151999649.html

Planning started on January 8 and guidelines were drafted by 17th. Massive surveillance started on the same day with meticulous contact tracing unparalleled in the world," Vardhan said.India has also been witnessing a nationwide vaccination programme to combat the Covid-19 infection. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has termed it the world's biggest vaccination programme."Globally, India stands at the fifth position (as on 29th January, 2021) in terms of the number of vaccine doses administered within the country. This is despite the fact that many countries had initiated their vaccination campaign before India," the health ministry said in a statement on Sunday.Addressing the nation on his monthly address Mann Ki Baat, PM Modi had said that India is the fastest in vaccinating its citizens."Just as India's war against coronavirus became an example to the world, similarly our vaccination programme is also becoming an example to the world. India is conducting the biggest vaccination drive in the world. Do you know what is an even better matter of pride? We are not only running the world's biggest vaccination drive but we are also the fastest in vaccinating our citizens," the Prime Minister said."In merely 15 days, India has vaccinated more than 30 lakhs Covid-19 warrior, while a rich country like the US has completed the same target in 18 days and the UK in 36 days. The Made in India vaccines are not only a symbol of Atmanirbhar Bharat but they are also a symbol of self-pride," he added.The number of healthcare workers vaccinated against Covid-19 has crossed the 37 lakh mark on the 15th day of the vaccination program, according to health ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-daily-covid-19-cases-drop-to-11-427-recoveries-surpass-10-43-million-101612150919706.html

01-02-2021||India||Widespread rain, thunderstorms likely over NW India this week||Widespread thundershowers are expected over the plains of northwest India from February 3 to 6, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD).A fresh Western Disturbance is likely to affect Western Himalayan region from tonight. Under its influence, scattered rain/snow with moderate thunderstorm and lightning is likely over the hills during February 1 and 2. Another Western Disturbance, in quick succession, is also likely to affect Western Himalayan Region from February 2 and plains of northwest India from February 3.Due to the Western Disturbance, scattered to fairly widespread and moderate rain/snow with isolated thunderstorm and hail is likely over the Western Himalayan region during February 3 and 5.Due to interaction of southwesterlies associated with the Western Disturbance and lower level southeasterlies from the Bay of Bengal, widespread light to moderate rain/thundershowers is likely over the plains of northwest India and adjoining Central India during February 3 to 6 with maximum intensity on February 4.Rain and thunderstorms are also expected over adjoining Central India during February 4 and 5 and over adjoining east India on February 6.Also read | Delhi had seven cold wave days in January this year, maximum since 2008Dense to very dense fog was observed on Monday at isolated places over Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Visibility recorded at 5.30 am today was less than 26 m over Bareilly, Bahraich, Lucknow, Sultanpur, Gorakhpur; less than 50 m at Varanasi, Patna, Bhagalpur, Purnea, Agartala; less than 500 m at Palam and Safdarjung in Delhi.“The WD approaching on Sunday night will mostly affect the Western Himalayas. But the next Western Disturbance approaching on February 2 will be more intense and will bring both snowfall to the hills and rain to the plains. In Delhi-NCR on February 4 and 5, its likely to cause thunderstorms with light rain. After the WD passes, minimum temperatures will drop once again over northwest India, but cold wave is unlikely because climatologically, we are moving towards comparatively higher minimum temperatures,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.MONSOONSkymet Weather, a private weather forecasting company in its initial forecast for monsoon in 2021 released on Sunday projected that its likely to be a “normal” monsoon year with rainfall of 96% to 104% of the long period average (LPA). Last year, monsoon was driven by La Niña which is peaking right now. It will decline during the spring and turn neutral later through the monsoon season. It also means that monsoon 2021 is going to be a devolving La Niña to start with. This trend of Pacific Ocean temperatures may not lead to an above normal or excess rainfall.“Models and other global weather reports are indicating a normal monsoon this year. Presently, La Nina is at its peak. By the time monsoon arrives, we may see El Niño and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Neutral conditions. The sea surface temperatures are likely to rise soon in the equatorial Pacific Ocean and the probability of continued La Niña will fall. We expect good rains in the first half of monsoon, thereafter rains may decrease a bit. Chances of below normal monsoon are almost nil,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president (Climate change and meteorology), Skymet Weather.ENSO is a periodic fluctuation in sea surface temperature and the air pressure of the overlying atmosphere across the equatorial Pacific Ocean according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.ENSO has a major influence on weather and climate patterns such as heavy rains, floods and drought. El Niño has a warming influence on global temperatures, while La Niña has the opposite effect. In India, for example, El Nino is associated with drought or weak monsoon while La Nina is associated with strong monsoon and above average rains and colder winters.This monsoon, IMD is likely to issue a special seasonal forecast for rain-fed areas where there is no irrigation facility. It is also like to use a multi-model ensemble forecast ( a combination of different models) to predict monsoon rains this year.“Its too early to make a monsoon forecast. We cannot share details now,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD. Last year, the total rainfall recorded in monsoon was 108.7% of long period average and in 2019 it was 110% of LPA --consecutive years of above normal monsoon. Before 2020 and 2019, consecutive years of above normal monsoon were recorded in 1958 and 1959.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/widespread-rain-thunderstorms-likely-over-nw-india-this-week-101612147586816.html
01-02-2021||India||BJP banks on local poll gains to make inroads in Kerala||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is confident that the gains that it notched up in the Kerala local body elections that concluded in December are an indication of its growing support base in the state which will pick a new assembly a few months from now.According to people aware of the details, the party won 3.575 million votes in the local body elections, about 17.20% of the total votes counted. “The party has done better in the local body elections as compared to the elections held in 2015. There has been an increase of about 35% in vote share and overall our members have grown from 1,200 to nearly 1,700 across all six corporations and we even have representation in places such as Kannur where the party was considered weak,” said the BJP’s state unit president K Surendran.According to an internal report of the party, the BJP won 1,635 seats and finished second in 2,800 seats against both the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the United Democratic Front (UDF). The party claims it lost 1,200 seats with a “thin margin” on account of cross-voting between the LDF and the UDF.A senior party functionary in Delhi said the party had been buoyed by its performance in municipalities such as Palakkad, Pandalam, Trivandrum, Thalassari and Chengannur and was expecting a replay there in the forthcoming assembly elections.Also read: UDF launches state-wide rally in KeralaIn 2016, the BJP won a single seat from Nemom and its vote share was around 14%. The party is also counting on the support of Christians and a small section of Muslims. “There is a shift on the ground; many people belonging to the Christian and Muslim faith are also supporting the BJP because they are upset with the corruption-ridden state government. Take the case of Pandalam municipality where the BJP wrested control from the LDF. BJP won 18 divisions in the 33-member municipality whereas last time it had won only seven divisions,” said the party functionary cited above.As for the poll plank, the party will target the Pinarayi Vijayan government on the issues of a gold smuggling racket unearthed in July and its response to the Covid-19 pandemic. “We will focus on corruption, under-development and lack of jobs. Both Oommen Chandy (Congress) and Pinarayi Vijayan are two sides of the same coin. We will go to people with details about the gold smuggling case for which government officials are in jail, the assembly speaker is under the scanner and many people are involved,” Surendran said.The campaign will take off with party president JP Nadda’s visit scheduled on February 3 and 4. According to a person aware of the details, Nadda is expected to address a rally in Thrissur and hold meetings with party leaders, office bearers and booth level functionaries in Trivandrum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-banks-on-local-poll-gains-to-make-inroads-in-kerala-101612145562843.html
01-02-2021||India||After Balakot strike, Pakistani bids to infiltrate via the Jammu border up: BSF||Extensive use of underground tunnels and drones to send more men and weapons to India through the Jammu border reflects a hardening of Pakistan’s attitude, particularly after the February 26, 2019 Indian Air Force strike on a terror camp in Balakot, according to an assessment by the Border Security Force (BSF). The BSF says the threat on this stretch of border had become multi-dimensional in the last few years.The constant presence and movement of the Pakistan Army, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agents, terrorists and Special Service Groups has been noticed not only in the International Border belt, but also along border outposts of Pakistan Rangers, according to BSF’s senior most officer on the Jammu frontier, inspector general NS Jamwal.The Pakistan army, according to Jamwal, is extending its Kashmir ideology to the Jammu border in a similar fashion and with the lethality and seriousness it does across the Line of Control.Also read: BSF unearths tunnel used by Pak to send in terrorists to India“The combined presence of Pakistan Army/ISI/terrorists/criminals in the border belt, with a common anti-India agenda, is a serious issue of concern and an emerging challenge for the BSF planners and executioners,” Jamwal has written in the BSF’s internal magazine Borderman 2020, a copy of which has been reviewed by HT.More than 2,000 cross-border firing incidents in the last six years from the Pakistan side indicate the profile of violence on the Jammu border. BSF has also discovered at least 10 tunnels since 2012 on the Jammu frontier; four to five of them were found in last six months.Detailing the modus operandi used by Pakistan, Jamwal writes that terrorist handlers, after a detailed recce and coordinating with over-ground workers on Indian side, help terrorists infiltrate across border during dusk.The aim of the terrorists is to reach Pathankot-Jammu-Srinagar National Highway by 2 or 3 am so they are picked by OGWs on Indian side and transported to safe places before dawn.To conceal their movement, Pakistan has shrouded certain pockets on its side of the IB with tall elephant grass and other wild growth from where snipers can target BSF troops.As part of Pakistan’s national defence strategy, the Pakistani army has settled its ex-servicemen in the border belt to act “as early warning elements and provide depth to their first line of defence,” according to Jamwal.“One can easily read the management of terrain on Pak side which clearly indicates that Pakistan is not interested in Border management but in furthering its Kashmir policy through Jammu border. Since Pakistan terms Jammu IB as ‘working boundary,’ it attempts to change the status quo of the IB, and as a result some boundary disputes are already pending for settlement, and more have emerged,” the BSF magazine assesses.After the Balakot strike, Pakistan is also using drones to carry out surveillance of BSF forward areas along the Jammu border as well as to smuggle weapons.Jamwal told HT: “Pakistan’s main aim is to disturb J&K and they are finding it difficult to push through borders which are well guarded, so the tunnels and drones are being used. We have made a lot of progress to neutralize this threat”.Sameer Patil, fellow in international security studies programme at Gateway House, said: “Tunnels have been used by Pakistan earlier too, but drones are definitely a challenge for security forces. It also shows how, with the help of the Pakistani state, the terrorists are devising new ways every time we neutralize their traditional routes. I am sure India will be able to neutralize the threat of tunnels and drones also very soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-balakot-strike-pakistani-bids-to-infiltrate-via-the-jammu-border-up-bsf-101612142254636.html
01-02-2021||India||TN poll battle heats up as Sasikala leaves hospital||VK Sasikala on Sunday left a Bengaluru hospital in a car flaunting the flag of Tamil Nadu’s ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), which has expelled her and refused to take her back into its fold, signalling her intent to fight the party leadership as the state gears up for another high-decibel election.Sasikala, a close associate of the late AIADMK leader and former chief minister J Jayalalithaa, appeared frail from inside the car, bowing to supporters who had gathered outside the hospital chanting Vazhga Chinnamma (long live our mother’s sister). She had been receiving treatment for over 10 days for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The decision to use the AIADMK flag on the car, analysts said, was a message that she still belongs to the party and continues to stake a claims to the legacy of Jayalaithaa, who died in December 2016.“Sasikala will remain in Bengaluru for another week,” said a person aware of the development, requesting anonymity.Also read: Sasikala’s political rise and fall after Jayalalithaa’s deathAfter consulting an astrologer, the 66-year-old Sasikala decided to get discharged on Sunday just after 12.00 pm, followed by a convoy of at least 10 cars out of the hospital and moved into Prestige Golfshire, a high-end resort near Nandi Hills, about 45 kms from Bengaluru.She is expected to complete the seven-day quarantine period in the resort and return to Tamil Nadu after February 7 in a grand homecoming of sorts, the first person cited above said.Her return shakes up existing equations within the faction-hit AIADMK amid mixed reactions in Tamil Nadu on Sasikala’s imminent return to the state after serving out her prison term for amassing assets disproportionate to her income and treatment for Covid-19.“She’s not even a member of the party, how can she use the flag? She has no basic rights whatsoever in the party. This is illegal,” said AIADMK spokesperson D Jayakumar. Since her release from prison, the AIADMK has expelled two of its functionaries for putting up posters welcoming Sasikala as the party’s general secretary.Senior AIADMK leader KP Munusamy indicated that a reconciliation was possible.Calling Sasikala’s nephew and Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) chief TTV Dhinakaran an opportunist who tried to break the AIADMK, he said: “If he (Dhinakaran) wants, he can submit a written apology seeking forgiveness for all his mistakes and to be accepted as a cadre. The leadership can take a call on his letter.”Dinakaran on Sunday shrugged off the use of the flag, stating that Sasikala was still “the general secretary of the AIADMK.”Just two months after Jayalaithaa’s demise in December 2016, the Sasikala faction of the party got into a bitter power struggle to oust O Panneerselvam as the chief minister. The Supreme Court convicted three people (Sasikala, Ilavarasi and VK Sudhakaran) in a 21-year-old disproportionate assets case on February 14, 2017.The developments have added to the intensity of the upcoming polls in which the AIADMK is consolidating its resources to take on its bitter rival, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK).Sasikala had handpicked Edapaddi Palaniswami for the CM’s role, over current deputy chief minister Paneerselvam, who had officiated in that role through all of Jayalalithaa’s illnesses.Sasikala had filed a petition in the Madras high court that the general council meeting held to expel her was invalid The case is not yet listed, said her lawyer Raja Senthoor Pandian. “The case is pending in court so she’s put the flag in her car. Chinnamma will continue her legal battle. I floated AMMK democratically to reclaim the AIADMK,” Dhinakaran told reporters in Bengaluru.“By using the flag, she is sending a message to the cadre that she belongs to the AIADMK but when the Election Commission has recognised the Palaniswami-Paneerselvam’s government and party as the true AIADMK, it’s a weak case in a civil court,” Ravindran Duraisamy, a Chennai-based political analyst, said.The election commission in 2017 allotted the party name and its two-leaves symbol to the present regime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-poll-battle-heats-up-as-sasikala-leaves-hospital-101612140633620.html
01-02-2021||India||Farm stir, budget session likely to delay selection of next CBI director||With just three days left for incumbent Rishi Kumar Shukla’s two-year tenure to end, the process of choosing the next director of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is likely to be delayed. The Centre is yet to call a meeting of the high-powered selection committee that chooses the chief of the country’s premier investigating agency, people familiar with the development said.The selection committee, comprising Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Justice of India SA Bobde and Leader of Congress in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, has to decide the name of the next CBI director from among a panel of officers belonging to four batches – 1984 to 1987 – of the Indian Police Service (IPS) on the basis of seniority, integrity and experience in handling vigilance/anti-corruption cases.Shukla’s two-year tenure as agency chief will end on February 3. He had joined the agency on February 4, 2019.However, the panel is yet to take a call on the crucial meeting and people familiar with the process said on condition of anonymity that the government may take a few more weeks to scrutinize the record of eligible officers because it is caught up in the farmers’ protests against the three farm laws, the Covid-19 pandemic and the budget session of Parliament.When contacted, Chowdhury confirmed to HT that he had not received any notice yet for the meeting to choose the CBI director. The Congress is the largest opposition party in the Lok Sabha.The government is tight-lipped over the process, but an official who didn’t want to be named, said at least 25-26 IPS officers from 1984 to 1987 batches are in the fray for the coveted job. As per procedure, the ministry of home affairs (MHA) and Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) will prepare a list of probables in consultation with the Chief Vigilance Commission (CVC) for the selection committee to consider.Among the top contenders are 1984 batch officer of the Assam-Meghalaya cadre YC Modi (currently director general, or DG, of the National Investigation Agency); 1984 batch Gujarat cadre IPS officer Rakesh Asthana (currently DG of the Border Security Force); 1985 batch Maharashtra cadre officer Subodh Kumar Jaiswal (DG of the Central Industrial Security Force); 1985 batch UP cadre officer H C Awasthy (director general of police, or DGP, Uttar Pradesh); 1984 batch officer of Haryana cadre S S Deswal; and 1985 officer of Kerala cadre Loknath Behera (DGP, Kerala).Meanwhile, in another development in the CBI, the agency’s former spokesperson, deputy superintendent of police R K Gaur, who retired in December 2020, has been re-employed in the agency for one year on contract to handle the media.

01-02-2021||India||Congress plans campaign against Centre across states over farm laws||In an attempt to sustain the momentum of protests against the three farm laws passed by the Centre in September, the Congress has set a timeline for its state units to launch campaigns against the legislation and report back to the central leadership.In a letter to all state Congress chiefs dated Saturday, general secretary in charge of organisation KC Venugopal called for block-level conventions on the farm laws to be organised before February 10.“At these conventions, the block committees may honour farmers and farm labourers and pay homage to the farmers who lost their lives during the farmers’ protests,” said the letter, a copy of which has been seen by Hindustan Times.Following the block-level conventions, the state Congress units have been told to organise district level padayatras (walks) before February 20.“A 10 to 20 kilometers-long padayatra with massive participation has to be held in every district in solidarity with the farmers’ protests and demanding a JPC {joint parliamentary inquiry} into the breach of national security. The PCCs {Pradesh Congress Committees} are requested to give instructions to the DCCs {District Congress Committees} to hold a massive padayatra in every district involving every Congress worker, leader and office bearer in the district.”Also read: Opposition leaders may raise the issue in Parliament, says TikaitThe proposed programmes across the states are the first organised, pan-India campaign by the Congress at the grassroots level and coincides with the ongoing farmers’ agitation at the border points of Delhi. A part of the Congress programme will also overlap with the budget session of Parliament where at least 18 Opposition parties are demanding withdrawal of the three farm laws.The laws allow businesses to freely trade farm produce outside the so-called government-controlled mandi system, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales, and lay down new rules for contract farming.Farmers fear the reforms would make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations and pave the way for the government to stop buying staples at minimum support prices (MSPs).The letter, dated January 30, also asked for state-level‘Kisan Sammelans to be organised before February-end. “It has to be ensured that each and every worker/leaders across the state and all elected representatives including MP’s/MLA’s/ Congress candidates/ Party Office Bearers participate and ensure to make it a mass convention,” Venugopal said.Last week, the Congress Working Committee approved state-wise agitations against the farm laws, which the Congress says will only benefit a handful of industrialists.The government has refuted the Opposition claims and Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday the Centre’s offer to protesting farmers of keeping three agri laws in abeyance for 18 months “still stands.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-plans-campaign-against-centre-across-states-over-farm-laws-101612138984627.html

In the notice, it has been mentioned that the tractors were used on public roads for commercial work, and minors were driving them. As a result of this, there were road accidents. The tractors were also used in illegal mining,” Bal Mukund Mishra, SHO, Sikandarpur police station told PTI.Asked if the police can issue such a notice, Regional Transport Officer Rajeshwar Yadav said he was not aware of any such thing.Meanwhile, Leader of Opposition in Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly, Ram Govind Chaudhary said police are trying to threaten the farmers."The farmers have tractors, and they are going to the protest site by tractors.

01-02-2021||India||Took political support for farmers' movement only after democracy was mocked: Rakesh Tikait||The Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) had not allowed political parties in the movement against new central farm laws but took political support "only after democracy was mocked" at protest sites, Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait said Sunday.         Tikait made the remark as hundreds of farmers reached a key protest site on the Delhi-Meerut highway in Ghazipur on the national capital's border with Uttar Pradesh where they danced to upbeat tunes, creating a festive atmosphere as more supporters continued to pour in.        Security measures were strengthened with multi-layer barricading that included iron and concrete structures, while barbed wires also came up on both sides of the highway stretch that has become the BKU's camping site since November 28 last year in a major farmers' stir over three new farm laws of the Centre.         Farmers reached the Ghazipur border from western Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand as a turban-clad Rakesh Tikait led the charge for the BKU, the appeal of which coupled with a clarion call from a January 29 "mahapanchayat" of farmers in Muzaffarnagar has re-energised the stir, which was fast losing its sheen and momentum after the Republic Day violence in Delhi.         In response to a question, Tikait said, “the Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) had not allowed political parties to enter the movement because our movement is apolitical. Support from political parties was taken only after democracy was mocked over the protests. But still, politicians are kept away from the stage of farmers' protest.”         On Sunday, Shiromani Akali Dal leader Sukhbir Singh Badal reached Ghazipur. Besides him, regional leaders of Congress, Aam Aadmi Party, Rashtriya Lok Dal, Samajwadi Party also met with BKU office-bearers, extending their support in the fight for their demand for rollback of the new laws.         “Modi saab nu kisaanan di mann di gal sunni chahidi hai (Prime Minister Narendra Modi should listen to the heart's talk of the farmers),” said Badal, whose party broke ties from the BJP-led NDA over the contentious laws last year.         Tikait said the farmer unions are hoping for a resolution of the deadlock through dialogue and if the prime minister wants to talk to the farmers, they will ensure dignity of the PM's post but also protect their self-interest.         On if and when will the farmers decide on talking to the government, Tikait said, “I am one of the 40 members of the farmers' delegation but the decision on talks would be taken by the SKM committee.”         According to the Ghaziabad administration, senior officials and police officers are regularly monitoring the situation at the Ghazipur border.         Vehicles proceeding towards and coming from the protest site are being checked while drones were deployed for aerial monitoring at the site, which had thousands of protestors on Sunday, according to officials.         "The situation is under control and is being regularly monitored," an officer of the district administration said.         The groups of farmers camping at the site braving the cold nights were seen dancing to folk tunes and songs eulogising the nation and farmers as some young protesters carried music systems to Ghazipur on their tractor-trollies.         Thousands of farmers have been protesting at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, demanding a rollback of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.         The protesting farmers have expressed the apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations.         However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring better opportunities to farmers and introduce new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/took-political-support-for-farmers-movement-only-after-democracy-was-mocked-rakesh-tikait-101612137665487.html
01-02-2021||India||Opposition parties may attend key debates to step up pressure||The Congress and other opposition parties may join two key debates on the President’s speech and the Union Budget after launching protests over three farm laws inside and outside Parliament, according to people aware of the developments.The Opposition’s participation, however, may not come without frequent disruptions and protests, at least three leaders said after the all-party meeting a day before the presentation of the Union Budget.Parties such as the Congress, Trinamool Congress and Left outfits have prepared to push an adjournment motion on the farm issue on the morning of February 2, before a debate on the President’s speech, to amplify their stand on the issue, a leader said on condition of anonymity.At the third and last all-party meeting on Sunday over the Budget Session, the government’s managers suggested that the opposition parties can raise all issues related to the farm laws during the debate on the President’s speech and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, when he intervenes in the debate, would reply to them, another leader said. Among other senior ministers, defence minister Rajnath Singh is expected to speak in the debate, he added.At Sunday’s meeting, convened by Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu, six ministers and 25 leaders of various parties were present. A press statement said: “Chairman Naidu today made a fervent appeal to leaders of various parties to ensure effective functioning of the House during the ongoing budget session. In response, the leaders assured that there will be full participation in all the debates and discussions in the House.”Also read: Police cut off Singhu border from CapitalThe Opposition, however, plans to corner the government on the issue of the three contentious farm laws. “We will press for a separate debate on the farm issue given the gravity of the situation. But the government wants to tackle the issue in the President’s speech debate only. This might lead to another flashpoint,” another leader said, asking not to be named.Thousands of farmers have hunkered down at the Capital’s borders for more than two months to protest against the three farm laws that they say will erode their bargaining power, weaken a system of assured prices, and leave them vulnerable to exploitation by big agri businesses. The government has maintained that the laws aim to ease restrictions on farm trade by setting up free markets, allow traders to stockpile large stocks of food for future sales and lay down a framework for contract farming.On Republic Day, farmer groups broke through barricades, clashed with the Delhi Police and stormed the Red Fort, hoisting a religious flag, on its ramparts. The PM has said law will take its own course over the violence. Farmer leaders sought to distance themselves from the violence, but police have named several of them in FIRs.At the meeting, while Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad spoke on the farmers issue, Congress chief whip Jairam Ramesh pointed out that on September 17 last year, Naidu asked the government to give a briefing on the India-China border situation but no such meeting took place. Naidu asked parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi to address the issue.Meanwhile, upcoming assembly elections are also set to find political space in the debate on the President’s speech. As per the current schedule, first-time BJP MP from West Bengal, Locket Chatterjee, will initiate the debate to send a political message to the voters of Bengal. The President’s speech to the joint sitting of the House, too, had prominent references about poll-bound Assam, Bengal and Kerala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-parties-may-attend-key-debates-to-step-up-pressure-101612130698469.html
01-02-2021||India||Calls for PM’s number, vaccines flood 24/7 helpline for MPs||It was meant to be an exclusive, 24/7 helpline for members of the Lok Sabha to access reference notes and background material for taking part in debates. But from the start, people who staff the helpline have been kept busy fending off queries from citizens on issues that have nothing to do with Parliament.Some people have dialled the helpline to ask for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s phone number. One person called up the staff to seek an appointment with the PM as he “needs to give the PM some advice on the farmers’ protests”, officials involved in the project said on condition of anonymity.Planned by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, the unique helpline became operational on the eve of the budget session that began on Friday to help MPs quickly access reference notes and background material for debates. The round-the-clock service can be availed from anywhere in the country and abroad. Because many lawmakers, especially those from the Lok Sabha, have the added responsibility of managing their constituencies, such information has been made available just a call away .But the helpline started buzzing with calls after the contact numbers were frequently flashed on the Lok Sabha TV channel that is very popular in rural belts and smaller towns. The farmers’ protests and the Covid-19 vaccines were what the citizens were most interested about.“We got many enquiries with curious people asking ‘when are we getting the Covid-19 vaccines.’ While these calls reflect genuine concerns of people, unfortunately the helpline can’t solve their issues,” said one of the officials cited above.Also read: Budget to focus on job creation, health todayTo be sure, a few calls have come from the MPs as well. “The debates in the budget session are yet to start but we have already got 4-5 lawmakers wanting notes..and background {information}. More MPs will definitely avail this service as this is the easiest way to access quality data and research material,” said another official.The assistants of some MPs, however, have also called to find out which seat is allocated for the lawmakers. In the scattered seating arrangement spread over the chamber and the galleries of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, all MPs have been allotted specific seat numbers to adhere to social distancing norms.Named Parliamentary Research and Information Support to Members (PRISM), the helpline to cater to the requirements of the MPs has become operational at a time when the traditional schedules of parliament sessions have been overhauled amid the pandemic.The Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha have been operating in two different schedules between 9 am and 9 pm since the monsoon session. A dedicated team of 12-13 people including officials and research assistants of PRISM will process calls and messages from MPs anytime and send them the information they need, using primary and other authentic resources.“We have created an internal database for this purpose. Also, the Lok Sabha portal has loads of content which are used for MPs,” said another official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/calls-for-pm-s-number-vaccines-flood-24-7-helpline-for-mps-101612130073176.html

India had vaccinated close to 3.7 million health care workers until Sunday morning, with the number of vaccinations per day even crossing 500,000, according to the Union health ministry.“Just as India’s war against coronavirus became an example to the world, similarly our vaccination programme is also becoming an example to the world. India is conducting the biggest vaccination drive in the world. Do you know what is an even better matter of pride? We are not only running the world’s biggest vaccination drive but we are also the fastest in vaccinating our citizens,” Prime Minister Modi said in his 73rd episode of ‘Mann Ki Baat’.Also read: India is more than just a political or territorial entity, says PM Modi“In merely 15 days, India has vaccinated more than 30 lakhs (3 million) Covid-19 warrior, while a rich country like the US has completed the same target in 18 days and the UK in 36 days. The Made in India vaccines are not only a symbol of Atmanirbhar Bharat but they are also a symbol of self-pride,” he added.Highlighting that India is helping the world during the Covid-19 crisis, he said: “I receive messages for India from Presidents and Prime Ministers of different countries of the world... You must have noticed about the vaccination programme that India is able to help others because India today is self-reliant in the field of medicines and vaccines.”India has gifted the vaccine to several countries including Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bahrain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccination-rate-best-in-world-in-1st-15-days-pm-modi-101612127060533.html
01-02-2021||India||Saddened by insult to Tricolour on R-Day: PM||The country has been saddened by the “insult to the Tricolour” on Republic Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday in his monthly Mann Ki Baat radio address, referring to the hoisting of the Sikh religious flag and a farmers’ union flag next to the national flag by protesting farmers at Red Fort.In his first address to the nation in 2021, a day before finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presents the Union budget in Parliament, Modi celebrated India’s vaccination drive against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and the Indian cricket team’s triumph against Australia in the Test series, and called for the infusion of a new hope.“This month, there has been very good news from the cricket pitch too,” the PM said in his radio address, which he delivers on the last Sunday of every month. ”Our cricket team, after initial setbacks, made a grand comeback, winning the series in Australia. The hard work and teamwork of our players is inspirational. Amidst all this, the country was saddened by the insult to the Tricolour on the 26th of January in Delhi.”He added: “We have to infuse times to come with new hope...Last year, we displayed exemplary patience and courage {in the fight against the viral disease}. This year too, we have to work hard to attain our resolve. We have to take our country forward at a faster pace.”Watch: India was shocked to witness insult of tricolor on Republic Day, says PM﻿A tractor rally by farmers to protest against three laws passed by Parliament in September to open up agricultural markets turned violent at Red Fort on Republic Day. In expressing his sadness at the insult to the Tricolour, Modi echoed the sentiment expressed by President Ram Nath Kovind, who said in his speech to Parliament on Friday that the “national flag and a holy day like Republic Day were insulted in the past few days.”Referring to India’s vaccination programme against the coronavirus disease that is currently underway, the Prime Minister said the country’s fight against the pandemic had been “exemplary” to the world.“My dear countrymen, the beginning of this year marks the completion of almost one year of our battle against Corona. Just as India’s fight against Corona became an example, our vaccination programme too is turning out to be exemplary to the world. Today, India is undertaking the world’s biggest Covid vaccine programme. Do you know what’s a matter of more pride?”PM Modi said India was vaccinating its citizens at a faster pace than anywhere else. “In just 15 days, India has vaccinated over 30 lakh Corona warriors whereas an advanced country such as America took 18 days to get the same done; Britain 36 days,” he said.And referring to India’s diplomatic outreach to other countries through shipments of the made-in-India Covid-19 vaccines, he said he had received messages from Presidents and Prime Ministers of countries around the world.“You must also have seen recently how the President of Brazil, in a tweet thanked India – every Indian was gladdened at that....Friends, in this vaccination programme, you must have noticed something more! During the moment of crisis, India is able to serve the world today since she is capable, self-reliant in the field of medicines, vaccines. The same thought underpins the Atmanirbhar Bharat {Self-Reliant India} campaign. The more India is capable, the more will she serve humanity; correspondingly the world will benefit more,” he added.In the backdrop of the country observing a Road Safety month between January 18 and February 17, the prime minister said road accidents were a matter of concern not just in India, but also the world over. He also said in the same context that the government’s FASTag programme had reduced idling time at toll plazas by more than half.FASTag is a radio frequency identification sticker typically fixed to a vehicle’s windscreen that allows the deduction of toll wirelessly and automatically without requiring a vehicle to stop at plazas.“Earlier, a vehicle used to take on an average seven to eight minutes to cross our toll plazas. However, since the emergence of FASTag, this time has reduced to around one and a half minutes to 2 minutes on an average. Due to this reduced waiting time at the toll plaza, fuel too is being saved. It is estimated that this will save approximately ₹21,000 crore of our countrymen,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/saddened-by-insult-to-tricolour-on-r-day-pm-101612126387741.html
01-02-2021||India||Police cut off Singhu border from Capital||With increased deployment of security personnel, four-layered barricading on the main highway connecting Delhi with Haryana, and trenches dug up on the adjacent roads, the Singhu border protest site’s connectivity with the Capital remained snapped throughout Sunday, leading to disruptions in supplies and movement of people.As internet services remained suspended in and around the Singhu border protest venue – thousands are agitating against three contentious farm laws at the site – for the third consecutive day, farmers alleged that the step was taken to stop their voices from reaching the rest of the world.“It (the government) wants to spread its false spin around farmers. It is also fearful of the coordinated work of the farmers’ unions across different protest sites and is trying to cut off communication means between them. This is undemocratic and illegal,” Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), the umbrella body of 40 farmers unions that are part of the agitation against the three contentious farm laws, said in a statement on Sunday.Also read: Ready for talks but not under pressure, says Rakesh TikaitAs per the government’s order, internet services at three borders points – Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur – were suspended from January 29 till 11pm on Sunday. The police denied allegations that the Singhu area was completely cut off, saying that movement and supplies of essential items continued through alternative routes.“As the police have blocked all the roads and sub-lanes and are not allowing us to cross over, we have not been able to use the portable toilets or the water tankers arranged by the Delhi government since yesterday (Saturday). We are now completely dependent on the toilets and water supplies of local residents,” said Dilbagh Singh, a farmer from Punjab’s Sangrur, who has been running a langar at the border point, close to the police’s barricades.Questioning the cordoning off of the protest sites, the SKM said it was being done to disrupt basic supplies such as food and water. “All these various attacks of the government are recognised by us as such, and we condemn the same,” read the SKM’s statement.Apart from farmers, people travelling between Delhi and Haryana also faced problems because of the police blockade.“I have walked more than four kilometers in the fields and through the local villages just to cross the Singhu border. It’s the farmers and local residents who helped me with the alternative routes. There is police everywhere and barricades on every entry-exit point,” said Sunil Sabbharwal, who was coming to Delhi from Karnal and carrying his luggage on his head.Reacting to the farmers’ allegations, senior police officers said that while the connectivity between Delhi and the Singhu border was stopped through the main highway, they diverted the traffic and supplies of essential items through alternative routes.An officer said that the security and barricading was tightened following the conflict between the farmers and local residents witnessed on Friday and Saturday over the issue of clearing the roads, and the violence at the Red Fort and other places in Delhi on January 26.Also read: Delhi Police tracking owners of tractors that took wrong routeThe farmers’ protest at the Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders against the farm laws entered the 68th day on Sunday. On Republic Day, farmer groups broke through barricades, clashed with the Delhi Police and stormed the Red Fort, hoisting the Nishan Sahib, the flag of the Sikhs, on its ramparts.“We have beefed up the security to avoid any further clashes between the farmers and the locals, who say that their businesses have been affected for over two months due to the agitation. Also, many protesters armed with sticks, swords, and other sharp weapons are roaming around. It is another reason why we have increased the police presence. The supplies of the farmers at the Singhu border from Delhi are being allowed through the alternative routes,” said Sanjay Singh, special commissioner of police (law and order, west zone).The crowd at the Singhu border continued swelling throughout Sunday as hundreds of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, arrived on tractors and other vehicles with ration, water, vegetables and other supplies. The protesters also ramped up vigil at the protest site and volunteers carrying sticks were seen taking regular rounds in the backdrop of Friday’s violence and Saturday’s protests by people claiming to be locals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-cut-off-singhu-border-from-capital-101612125355962.html
01-02-2021||India||Ready for talks but not under pressure: Tikait||Bharatiya Kisan Union spokesperson Rakesh Tikait on Sunday sought the release of farmers who have been arrested in connection with the violence on Republic Day for a “conducive environment” to continue talks on the Centre’s three new farm laws.“We respect our Prime Minister and his initiative for talks with the farmers. But there won’t be any discussion on this issue without a conducive environment. We want our people to be released before anything else. There won’t be any agreement under pressure,” Tikait said, a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that his government was just a “phone call away” for discussions with the protesting farmers.During an all-party meeting on Saturday, the PM said that the Centre’s offer to the protesting farmers of keeping the three laws in abeyance for 18 months “still stands” and that his government was “committed to reaching a solution through dialogue”.Responding over the PM’s remarks, Tikait said: “Farmers will honour the dignity of the Prime Minister, but we are also committed to safeguarding the self-respect of our brethren. The government should release them immediately to prepare a healthy environment for talks. The talks can only be held when both the government and the farmers will be on the same page. We will not hold talks under pressure.”Watch: ‘We honor PM, ready for talks but not under pressure’The Delhi Police have so far arrested over 80 people, including farmers, in connection with the violence and vandalism that took place during the farmers’ tractor march on Republic Day.On Sunday, the farm leader also met Shiromani Akali Dal leader Sukhbir Singh Badal at the protest site at the Ghazipur border. After the meeting, Dharmendra Malik, spokesperson of the Tikait faction of BKU, said: “Sukhbir Singh Badal had come to extend support but he was also not allowed to go on stage because our movement is completely apolitical. Many leaders from Tikri and Singhu border also came to meet him and assure him that they are with those protesting at the Ghazipur border.”Thousands of farmers have been camping at Delhi’s borders since November last year to demand a repeal of the laws that they say will erode their bargaining power, weaken a system of assured prices, and leave them vulnerable to exploitation by big agri businesses.The government has maintained that the laws aim to ease restrictions on farm trade by setting up free markets, allow traders to stockpile large stocks of food for future sales and lay down a framework for contract farming.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ready-for-talks-but-not-under-pressure-tikait-101612124776088.html

India was able to identify four Iranian nationals as the prime suspects and sent a team to Tehran to trace them. But they could not be arrested. An Indian journalist was arrested for helping the bombers.Foreign minister S Jaishankar phoned his Israeli counterpart, Gabi Ashkenazi, with a bunch of assurances, pledging that New Delhi would spare no effort to trace the culprits. “We take this very seriously,” Jaishankar said.Similar assurances were extended at different levels. Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla spoke with his counterpart Alon Ushpitz, secretary Sanjay Bhattacharyya, who oversees relations with West Asia, spoke to Israeli ambassador Ron Malka and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval dialled his counterpart Meir Ben-Shabbat.Also Read: Will spare no effort, India promises Israel after blast near embassyPM Netanyahu’s office said NSA Doval updated Meir Ben-Shabbat and through him, PM Netanyahu on the efforts made by India to investigate the explosion.“PM Netanyahu asked to inform India's PM @narendramodi that Israel has full confidence in the Indian authorities' investigation and in their ability to ensure the safety of Israelis and Jews in India,” Ofir Gendelman, the prime minister’s spokesperson to the Arab media, tweeted. He said it was agreed that contacts will continue on all channels and that there will be full cooperation between the two countries.It was agreed that contacts will continue on all channels and that there will be full cooperation between the two countries.The Delhi Police had initially suggested that the explosion could be “a mischievous attempt to create a sensation”. But later, officials acknowledged that the explosion was being treated as a “terrorist attack”.Investigations revealed that the bomb had been thrown near the embassy from a moving car. Investigators, who wished not to be named, said the explosive recovered from the spot was suspected to be ammonium nitrate mixed with fuel oil, with small ball bearings as shrapnels.An envelope was also found near the blast site in which the attackers are suspected to have left a message for the embassy.In a video message released later, the Israeli ambassador Ron Malka referred to the multiple levels at which the two sides have been in touch.“We get full cooperation and support from the local police, from the Indian authorities, the ministry of external affairs, the secretary of external affairs, the NSA – they all called their counterparts in Israel, offered their support,” Malka said, underlining that the explosion had taken place “when we mark 29 years [of] the establishment of full diplomatic relations between Israel and India”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/have-full-confidence-pm-netanyahu-messages-pm-modi-after-blast-near-embassy-101611945991887.html
