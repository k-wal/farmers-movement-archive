However, the defense lawyer opposed the same saying nothing new has emerged in the ED's investigation.The special PMLA judge Abhijeet Nandgaonkar refused to extend Joshi's ED custody and remanded him to 14-days judicial custody.The ED claim its investigations in the case has so far revealed that the loans availed by Omkar Group from Yes Bank have been diverted and accused Sachiin Joshi, son of Gutkha baron JM Joshi, had helped promoters of Omkar Group in diversion for an amount of at least ₹87 crore.Joshi's name came to the fore when the anti-money laundering agency was scanning documents seized during the search and seizure operation carried out at the premises of Omkar Developers last month.The ED came across certain documents related to payments of ₹87 crore to certain outside entities (Viikings Group of companies owned by Joshi). During initial investigation, Babulal Varma and Kamal Kishore Gupta (both previously arrested by ED) had stated that these payments were made for slum evacuation and slum rehabilitation services (for certain SRA projects) and part of it was investment. However, the claim later turned out to be false.The ED said that funds were received by Joshi and his companies from various companies of Omkar Group. Part of the funds was shown as investment and part of them was shown as payment received for rendering services.When questioned about funds received as investment, the accused (Joshi) had stated that same were towards development of land near Pune. However, there was no definitive agreement between the Omkar Group and Viiking Group with respect to such a huge investment, the ED said."It is very surprising that an amount of ₹48 crore is shown as aninvestment but except for a simple term sheet dated March 15, 2019, nodefinite agreement is made. On analysing the actual utilization of the funds it shows that the said funds were utilized for various purposes such as repayment of loans, various expenses etc. However, no expense is seen to be incurred towards the stated purpose of investment," ED stated in their remand application.When ED confronted Joshi about it he simply stated that it was verbally agreed between the promoters of Omkar group and him that till full payment is received he can use the received funds according to his needs."The said reply of the accused is clearly evasive and does not reflect the true nature of the transaction. It clearly appears that the said term sheet of investment is simply used to disguise the real intention of diversion of funds received from Omkar Group of companies and park these funds on the behalf of promoters of Omkar Group. It can be seen that any prudent business transaction would involve definite black and white agreement about investment/utilization of such huge funds," the ED added.The agency said that the investigations regarding the funds received against various invoices raised by the accused, showed that the purpose mentioned in the said invoices were for facilitating settlement of non-eligible tenants and possession of constructed rehabilitation units, help in gettingconsents from society, slum dwellers, committee members, brokerage towards land deal, etc. (for some SRA projects). However, when Joshi was interrogated about whether any such actual services were rendered, he stated that no actual slum rehabilitation work was done by him but he was involved in facilitation with Omkar Group, where Omkar Group was to use his name and brand name in order to rehabilitate the tenants/settle with the tenants."This reply of the accused is clearly devoid of any truth and thus evasive. Use of brand name and/or goodwill for settlement of non-eligible tenants appears to be very farfetched in the light of the fact that neither accused nor his companies had ever done any SRA related work or Slum Rehabilitation Authority project. He himself stated that actual work was done by persons of Omkar Group only. Thus for no actual work done or no actual services rendered, the invoices were raised and funds were diverted in the name of expenses," ED had submitted before the court previously.The ED's previous remand application stated that from the cash flows of Omkar Realtors & DevelopersPvt Ltd for various years it was observed that there are huge inter-company transactions with group companies including the companies from which funds have been transferred to the accused (Joshi) and his companies.“It is established that loans availed from Yes Bank have been diverted and accused (Joshi) has helped promoters of Omkar Group in such diversion for an amount of at least Rs.87 crore,” the ED stated.Joshi was charged for offence of money-laundering under sections 3, punishable under section 4 of PMLA, 2002.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/actor-sachiin-joshi-sent-to-judicial-custody-in-rs-87-cr-money-laundering-case-101614016087576.html
22-02-2021||India||Agriculture minister insulted farmers with his remarks: Samkyukta Kisan Morcha||New Delhi, Feb 22 (PTI) Samkyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of protesting farm unions, on Monday accused Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar of "insulting" farmers by his remarks that mere gathering of a crowd does not lead to revocation of the three farm laws.In a statement, the Morcha alleged that the current protests are a consequence of "deep unhappiness" and anger that was allowed to build up in farmers' minds by the government.On Sunday, Tomar had reiterated that the Centre was ready to talk to the farmers protesting against the new agriculture laws, and said that mere gathering of a crowd does not lead to revocation of legislations."Today, farmers are getting support pouring in from all sides, nationally and internationally. The protestors are not a crowd, but our annadatas, thanks to whom we are all alive today, including people in the government. "The party in power collected votes from this very crowd and this sort of insulting attitude towards our farmers is highly condemnable," the SKM said in statement. It also stated, "Tomar insulted the farmers' movement by saying that 'laws cannot be repealed by collecting a crowd'."Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at three Delhi border points --- Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri --- for over the last 85 days, demanding a complete of three farm laws and a legal guarantee on the minimum support price for their crops.Morcha in statement congratulated the Khap leaders in several places in Uttar Pradesh for standing in solidarity with the farmers' movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/agriculture-minister-insulted-farmers-with-his-remarks-samkyukta-kisan-morcha-101614013614190.html
22-02-2021||India||Supreme Court allows Karti Chidambaram to travel abroad after ₹2-cr deposit||The Supreme Court on Monday permitted Congress Member of Parliament Karti Chidambaram to travel to Germany, United Kingdom and France between March and June on an undertaking to deposit a sum of ₹two crore and to fully cooperate in the probe against him by the Enforcement Directorate in the INX Media case and Aircel-Maxis case.“Any absence of full cooperation on the dates of the investigation will be viewed very seriously by the Court and appropriate orders will be passed, if required,” ordered a bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and RS Reddy as it allowed the application moved by former Finance Minister P Chidambaram’s son to visit three countries between March 1 and June 23, 2021.The Court directed the Congress MP from Sivaganga, Tamil Nadu to file an undertaking in the apex court within three days failing which he shall not be allowed to go abroad. The undertaking shall include the flight details, full itinerary of his visit, places of residence in foreign countries, and date of arrival in India. On serving a copy of the undertaking to the office of the Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, the ED will release Chidambaram’s passport, and the same shall be surrendered upon his return, the Court said.The Solicitor General appeared along with Additional Solicitor General (ASG) SV Raju for the ED and informed the Court that the applicant is being probed for alleged money laundering charges in connection with the Aircel Maxis case registered in 2012 and the INX Media case registered in 2017. According to ED, companies linked to Karti Chidambaram received alleged kickbacks from companies that benefited from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance given to them at a time when his father, P Chidambaram was the Union finance minister.The law officers informed the Court that Karti Chidambaram was required to cooperate with the probe in the two cases and his request to travel abroad should not affect the ongoing probe. ASG Raju urged the Court to direct Chidambaram to deposit ₹10 crore as security with the Court.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal objected saying that his client was a Member of Parliament who has been extended this facility in the past. “I am a Member of Parliament. Will I run away?” Sibal asked.The Solicitor General remarked that in the past, there has been an instance of a MP running away, possibly referring to liquor baron Vijay Mallya, who flew out of the country while being a Member of Parliament and hasn’t returned yet. Mallya has since been declared a fugitive economic offender at the request of ED, probing cases against him.The top court directed Karti Chidamabaram to deposit ₹2 crore as security to the court’s secretary general which would be returned on his return. The money was directed to be kept in an interest bearing account of a nationalized bank for a period of six months.The court also prohibited Karti from opening or closing any bank account overseas or entering into any kind of property transaction during his stay abroad.He was directed to appear before the investigating authorities in connection with the two cases pending against him on such dates as fixed by the Enforcement Directorate (excluding the travelling period), the bench ordered.Karti Chidambaram was last allowed to travel to multiple countries in February 2020 to attend tennis tournaments on a condition that he deposits ₹10 crore as security. He made similar trips abroad in the past years on deposit of ₹10 crore each time with the Supreme Court.In the INX Media case, the ED is probing Karti’s alleged role in obtaining FIPB clearance in 2007 to the tune of ₹305 crore for the company. According to the prosecution, INX Media engaged firms linked with Karti as strategic consultants to swing the deal in their favour and Karti’s firms received alleged kickbacks in the process. In the Aircel-Maxis case too, the ED is probing Karti's role in facilitating FIPB clearance to Global Communication Holding Services Limited for investment in telecom firm Aircel in 2006. The two transactions took place during the tenure of his father as the finance minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-allows-karti-chidambaram-to-travel-abroad-after-rs-2-cr-deposit-101614012201369.html
22-02-2021||India||In latest blow to LJP, its lone MLC in Bihar joins BJP||The severely marginalized Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) of Chirag Paswam took another hit on Monday when its lone member of legislative council (MLC) Nutan Singh, joined the ruling BJP.Singh is the latest LJP leader to jump ship. Last week, more than 200 LJP functionaries, including its state secretary Keshav Singh, had joined the JD(U). Rameshwar Chaurasia, a former MLA and a prominent BJP face who had joined Paswan’s party just ahead of the 2020 Assembly elections, also quit the party last week.Nutan Singh’s husband Neeraj Singh, of the BJP, was recently made a minister. “I joined BJP so that both of us can work jointly,” Nutan Singh said after joining the party in the presence of its state president and Lok Sabha MP Sanjay Jaiswal.After Nutan Singh’s switch, LJP has no member in the 75-member legislative council.Its lone MLA Raj Kumar Singh has fuelled speculation of joining the JD (U) after a meeting with chief minister Nitish Kumar.The JD (U) has 23 members in the legislative council, followed by the BJP (21). Two other NDA partners, HAM(S) and VIP have one member each. The opposition RJD has 6 members, Congress 4 and the CPI 2. There is one Independent MLC while 16 seats are lying vacant.Ties between the JD (U) and the LJP hit a low after Paswan’s party fielded candidates against JD (U) in the last Assembly elections and damaged the latter’s prospects.JD (U) general secretary K C Tyagi had said, “We do not consider it (LJP) as a part of the NDA.”Commenting on the latest development, HAM(S) spokesperson Danish Rizwan said Chirag Paswan’s aspirations at the cost of party has put his own house on fire.With MLC Nutal singh leaving his party and joining the BJP, how can he believe that he has an alliance with the BJP?” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-latest-blow-to-ljp-its-lone-mlc-in-bihar-joins-bjp-101614010331305.html
22-02-2021||India||'The way we treat our women...': Rahul Gandhi explains India's challenge||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday batted for women's rights in the country and termed financial independence as the foundation of empowering women.Gandhi's remarks came during his address at the Silver Jubilee Inauguration of Cherukode Women’s Cooperative Bank in Malappuram in Kerala. Gandhi had reached Calicut International Airport on Sunday to attend a padayatra in poll-bound Kerala.Stating that no country can be successful without empowering its women, Gandhi said, "I'm one of the people who are convinced that no country can be successful without empowering its women. If there's one challenge that our country faces, it's precisely the way we treat our women. You can see it in newspapers every single day," Gandhi was quoted as saying by news agency ANI in Malapurram.Gandhi said there should be no reason for women to fear walking alone at night."There's no reason why our women should be scared of walking alone at night. I think if this country has to be successful, that's one of the most important things it has to focus on," Gandhi said.If you look at empowering women, their financial independence is the foundation of that, suggested Gandhi."We can keep saying women are empowered but unless our women are financially empowered, it means nothing. That's where I value what a cooperative bank does. It trains women in how to deal with money," Gandhi said.Gandhi has consistently backed women empowerment in his public addresses.He had recently remarked on the killing of two girls in Unnao in Uttar Pradesh and slammed the chief minister Yogi Adityanath's handling of women's safety in the state."Not only of the Dalit society, but the UP government is also crushing women honour and human rights. But they should remember that I and the entire Congress Party stand as the voice of the victims and will continue to provide justice to them," Gandhi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-way-we-treat-our-women-rahul-gandhi-explains-india-s-challenge-101614006086502.html

India is also committed to universal, non-discriminatory and verifiable nuclear disarmament and outlined a step-by-step process for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons through its working paper submitted in 2007, he added.“India has welcomed the extension of the New START Treaty between the Russian Federation and the US. However, much work needs to be done by us in the Conference on Disarmament,” he said.“We need to rise above our differences, and demonstrate political will and genuine intent to find consensus to deliver on our collective mandate. Those resorting to politicisation only weaken the mandate of this body,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-committed-to-no-first-use-policy-under-nuclear-doctrine-shringla-101614009090979.html

It should be served at the New Delhi address. So, the matter has been sent back to the lower court. Fresh proceedings need to be started,” said Brajesh Jha, advocate and convenor of the state BJP’s legal cell.The MP-MLA court had on Friday summoned Shah to appear before it either personally or through a lawyer on Monday in connection with a defamation suit filed by Banerjee, who also happens to be the nephew of chief minister Mamata Banerjee.“The summons against Shah was sent to the BJP’s office in Kolkata. The court said on Monday that the summons should be sent to Shah’s Delhi address. As this (MP-MLA court) is a trial court and the suit was originally filed in Metropolitan Magistrate’s court, the case has been sent back,” said Subhojit Saha, one of Banerjee’s lawyerOn August 11, 2018 Shah allegedly made certain defamatory statements against Banerjee while addressing the Yuva Swabhiman Samavesh Rally of the BJP at Mayo Road in Kolkata.“Shah brought allegations of corruption against Banerjee. He alleged that Banerjee was involved in syndicate corruption and siphoned off money which was sent by the Centre,” the TMC leader’s senior counsel Sanjay Basu claimed.A criminal complaint case was filed on August 28, 2018 under section 500 of the Indian Penal Code (punishment for defamation).The summons was served at a time when Bengal is preparing for state assembly elections in which the BJP is mounting a strong challenge to the Trinamool Congress. Over the past few years, the BJP has emerged as the TMC’s main rival. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the party won 40% of the vote share and 18 of the 42 seats in the state.

The information was found correct and we found huge irregularities during the searches," said a senior officer of the IT department who confirmed that Daga’s premises had been searched.The bank lockers found in Betul and Solapur during the searches will be opened on Tuesday, said the officer.“The group has also introduced undisclosed income of ₹90 crore in its books of accounts by way of sale of paper investments in shell companies to another set of shell companies of Kolkata. None of the companies was found to be operational at their shown address and the group could not confirm the identity of such paper companies or any of its Directors. Many of these paper companies were found to be struck off by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs,” the statement said.During the search, officials found that the group showed a loss of ₹52 crore to suppress their profits by indulging in intra-group out-of-exchange contract settlement.Various companies were formed in the name of employees to carry out these transactions, while there was no actual business carried out between them. Directors of these companies were not aware about any such transactions, the statement said.“The group has also claimed incorrect Long Term Capital Gains exemption of over ₹27 crore on sale of shares of a group entity. Investigations revealed that the purchase of these shares was not genuine as group directors purchased shares of this entity at nominal value from non-existent Kolkata-based shell companies. Various types of evidence including chats among key persons of the group reflects unexplained cash payment and hawala transactions of over ₹15 crore,” the statement said.“Incriminating evidence in the form of digital media such as laptops, hard drives, pen drives etc have been found and seized. From the investigation so far, undisclosed income over Rs. 450 crore has been detected,” it said.Daga, who reached Bhopal on Monday to attend the budget session of the legislative assembly, could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-dept-finds-undisclosed-income-of-rs-450-cr-of-mp-cong-lawmaker-s-company-101614002160252.html
22-02-2021||India||Budget set aside for boosting domestic defence buys: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said that a portion of the country’s defence budget for 2021-22 was reserved for buying locally produced weapons and systems to boost defence indigenisation, and stressed that the 21st century defence manufacturing ecosystem could not come up without the partnership of the private sector.“It has been our endeavour since 2014 to bring about transparency, predictability and ease of doing business in the defence sector. We have taken several steps such as de-licencing, de-regulation, export promotion and foreign investment liberalisation,” the PM said at a seminar on ‘Budget Announcements 2021-22: Galvanising Efforts for Atmanirbhar Bharat’.The PM spoke about the government’s negative import list that was released last year and which seeks to ban the import of 101 types of weapons, systems and ammunition over the next five years to promote self-reliance in the defence sector.It may be described as a negative list but in the language of self-reliance, it is a positive list, he said. “It is a positive list on the strength of which our own manufacturing capacity is going to increase. This is a positive list that will create jobs in India… This is a positive list as it guarantees that products made in India will be sold in India,” Modi said.This year, the government is likely to notify a second list of weapons, systems and ammunition that cannot be imported.The PM said India should position itself as a defence exporter and take steps to boost its defence manufacturing capabilities as smaller countries will increasingly turn to India for their defence requirements.“The changes in the world order have made smaller nations aware of the need to strengthen their defence. It is one of their primary concerns. It is natural for these nations to look to India to strengthen their defence capabilities,” he said, adding that India was exporting military hardware to 40 countries.He said the country’s military leadership had fully supported reforms in the defence sector.The defence minister said the ₹70,221 crore to be spent on domestic defence procurement this year accounted for 63% of the military’s capital budget. Last year, the ministry spent over ₹51,000 crore, or 58% of the capital budget, on domestic purchases.“This increase will have a positive impact on enhanced domestic procurement, having a multiplier effect on our industries including micro, small and medium enterprises and start-ups. It would also increase employment in the defence sector,” Singh said.Experts welcomed the move to allocate funds for domestic procurement.“It’s a positive development, provided substantially important operational items are purchased through this route. Many joint ventures are working well including radars with Israel and BrahMos missiles with the Russians. Hindustan Aeronautics Limited is producing good helicopters. And, then there are the light combat aircraft variants. The unmanned systems of the private sector also hold potential,” said Air Marshal Anil Chopra (retd), director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.On the second negative import list, the defence minister said the secretary, department of military affairs - General Bipin Rawat - should consider putting on the list certain parts that are being imported so that the items can be indigenised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/budget-set-aside-for-boosting-domestic-defence-buys-pm-modi-101614004492765.html
22-02-2021||India||After Sonar Bangla, PM Modi calls for Ashol Paribarton in poll-bound Bengal||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday called for Ashol Paribartan (real transformation) in West Bengal, where assembly elections are due in the next two months, while mounting a scathing attack on the Mamata Banerjee-led ruling Trinamool Congress.He also flagged off the extension of the city’s north-south Metro corridor from Noapara to Dakshineshwar along with a slew of other railway projects. Chief minister Banerjee, however, skipped the function.“West Bengal needs the Bharatiya Janata Party-government not just for change in power, but for Ashol Paribartan. In a bid to bring in Ashol Paribartan in the present situation of Bengal, the lotus should bloom here,” Modi said while adding that people of Bengal has already decided for a change.He was addressing a public rally in Hooghly district, around 50 km north of Kolkata. It was the Prime Minister’s second public rally this month in the poll-bound eastern state where the BJP had made deep inroads winning 18 of the 42 seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.“Development of Bengal is not possible till the time there is syndicate-rule, reign of extortionists, culture of cut money (commission) and an administration that gives shelter to goons. We cannot have development till rule of law is established and the government listens to the common man. Voices are being raised from every corner demanding Ashol Paribartan,” he added as he sharpened his attack against the TMC.Paribartan was the main slogan of the Trinamool Congress in 2011 when it uprooted the 34-year-old Left Front government. Earlier Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP president JP Nadda had said that BJP would transform the state into Sonar Bangla (Golden Bengal) in five years.“Injustice has been done with the pride of Bengal. There is a big politics behind this. It is that politics which gives power to appeasement instead of development and supports vote-bank over patriotism. The same politics stops people in Bengal from performing Durga Puja,” Modi added.The Prime Minister alleged that the TMC government was not allowing development schemes to be implemented in the state.“You will be surprised to know what they (TMC) have done to Bengal. Even the country would be surprised to know that out of the 1.5 to 1.75 crore rural households in West Bengal only around two lakh households had access to piped water. Under the Jal Jeevan Mission around 3.6 crore households have received piped water in the country. Even after we released funds and stepped up our efforts only nine lakh households in the state could get piped water. The pace with which the TMC government is working it would take years for households to get piped water,” he said.He said that there is no dearth of enthusiasm to invest in Bengal but it is the environment, which the government has created - the alleged culture of cut-money and syndicate, which is posing a problem.“Every son and daughter of Bengal, settled abroad, wants to do something for the state. But they have a complaint – how to contribute even if they want to? Even if you want to take a building on rent you need to pay cut money. They are so notorious that they take cut money from both sides. Without the syndicate’s permission they can’t even take a building on rent,” he said.He said that while the Centre sends money directly to the bank accounts of farmers and the poor people, the funds of the West Bengal government can’t reach the people without the sanction of extortionists backed by the TMC.“It for this reason that while TMC leaders in villages are getting richer while the common man is getting poorer. “The Centre released ₹1,700 crore to the TMC-government. But only ₹609 crore was used. The government is sitting on the remaining ₹1,100 crores. This shows that the TMC-government is not bothered about the poor and the daughters of Bengal,” he said.On Saturday the TMC had launched its main campaign slogan - ‘Bangla Nijer Meyekei Chay’ (Bengal wants its own daughter) projecting Mamata Banerjee as the daughter of Bengal.The TMC hit back at the Prime Minister and refuted allegations of appeasement."The Prime Minister never spoke about the rising fuel and LPG prices. He never spoke out the farmers protesting in Delhi. He should see whats happening in Gujarat before raising some baseless allegations against West Bengal," said Kunal Ghosh, TMC spokesperson.TMC MP Saugata Roy said "Modi has raised some false and baseless allegations. Mamata Baneerjee herself inaugurates around 200 Durga Pujas. All Durga Puja need to take permission from local police. May be one or two were not give permission. The chief minister also gave ₹50,000 to clubs to perform puja," said He warned that it would be "devastating" if the BJP comes to power in Bengal. "The BJP is not in power. But their workers and leaders have already started extortion. If BJP comes to power then it would be devastating," said Roy.He also accused the Centre withholding money to Bengal."The Centre never gives any money. They are not releasing the GST share. After cyclone Amphan they released just around R 3,700 crores. It is the BJP's propaganda," said Roy||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-sonar-bangla-pm-modi-calls-for-ashol-paribarton-in-poll-bound-bengal-101614004155456.html

The government is not going to take back these laws unless it is forced to. These three laws are designed to destroy the agriculture system in the country and give the entire business to two or three friends of PM Modi,” said Gandhi after taking out a tractor rally in Wayanad, his parliamentary constituency, ahead of the upcoming polls in the southern state.“Agriculture is the only business that belongs to Bharat Mata and few people want to own this business,” he said, urging people to force the government to take back three laws that are detrimental to the farming community.Gandhi drove the tractor from Thrikaripatta to Muttil covering six km, accompanied by several vehicles.The Left Democratic Front in Kerala, led by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, and the Congress-led opposition United Democratic Front have strongly opposed the Centre's new farm laws.Gandhi, however, hit out at the ruling party while criticising the draft notification of the Centre on the Eco-Sensitive Zone (ESZ) in Wayanad. He said the Centre informed Parliament that the rules were based on a report submitted by the state government.“We were really shocked to hear this,” he said.People living in fringe areas of forest say many human settlements will come under the zone and the new announcement will adversely affect their lives.State leaders have asked Gandhi to campaign extensively in the upcoming assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-leads-tractor-rally-against-farm-laws-in-kerala-101614001236275.html

The commission made the suggestion in a document it uploaded on its website for those appearing for the national ‘cow science exam’ to be held on February 25.The Rashtriya Kamdhenu Aayog or RKA (national cow commission) proposed cow-dung CNG pumps for vehicles, bull semen banks and cow tourism as part of their initiative to encourage "cow entrepreneurship".“The cow entrepreneurship concept got discussed in many of RKA’s webinars. Many entrepreneurs across the globe have started exploring these evergreen possibilities utilizing new-age technology with age-old wisdom," the RKA said on its website.“Biogas has been used for a long time as fuel. They are filled in cylinders and could be used for cooking. The energy from cow dung could also be used in transportation. By generating it at a bigger scale, one can set up CNG pumps. Transportation industry will get cheaper and easily available made-in-India energy," the website added.Petrol prices have touched Rs89.29 a litre and diesel costs Rs79.70 a litre in Delhi. In other parts of India, such as Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, the price has already surged past the ₹100-mark.The commission, which falls under the animal husbandry department of the Union government, claimed that cow dung can generate huge profits and offer attractive business opportunities. The other idea it put forth, of “semen banks" for bulls, is an attractive business opportunity, it said, adding that cow rearers and entrepreneurs prefer high-quality pedigree bulls and pay a good amount to procure them.As part of cow tourism, the commission talks about the idea of “cow hugging" for health benefits. In India, it said, the concept of ‘cow tourism’ is gaining momentum.“A place where economic, health, environmental benefits of cows is to be showcased. In Rajasthan, there are guest houses with walls, floors made up of cow dung. Only organic foods are served. Such spots are attracting foreigners, who, after spending some days, return rejuvenated. The sky is the limit for creative business ideas in this segment," it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/use-cow-dung-cng-to-get-cheap-energy-national-cow-commission-101613999643377.html

When crowds gather governments get changed," he told the farmers' gathering.Farmers, mostly from Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, have been protesting at Delhi's borders since November 28 last year demanding rollback of the laws."They (the government) should know if farmers can destroy their own produce, then you are nothing before them," Tikait said."There are many questions, it is not only the farm laws, but the electricity (amendment) bill, the seed bill… what kind of laws do they want to bring?" he asked and slammed the government for rise in prices of diesel and petrol.Tikait said that this agitation is not just of farmers, but also of the poor, daily wagers and other sections."These laws will destroy the poor. This is not just one law, many more laws like these will come," he said.Referring to the farmer leaders spearheading the agitation, the BKU leader also reiterated that the government will have to talk to the same committee of 40 members.The government has held 11 rounds of negotiation with protesting unions and these have remained inconclusive with regard to rollback of the laws.The agitation against the laws at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh is being led by the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, which is an umbrella body of 40 farmer unions. Tikait said this stir will go on and farmers will work in their fields simultaneously.Demanding a law on minimum support price (MSP) for farmers, he said, "When a law on MSP will be framed, farmers will be protected. This stir is about that, this is about rights of farmers." Tikait had recently said farmers will not return home till the farm laws are repealed and had added that farmers should be ready to sacrifice their standing crop for it.The unions are protesting against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. The three farm laws, enacted in September last year, have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-crowds-gather-governments-get-changed-bku-leader-rakesh-tikait-101613998443175.html

The border was sealed from either side in March but the Indian government had given some relaxation to the Nepalese to cross the border, said an official.Himanshu Kafaltia, sub-divisional magistrate, Tanakpur, confirmed the development and said, “Nepal has re-opened the border for Indians but registration and Covid-19 test report are a must for the entry. Nepal has already launched an app for registration, Indians can register their names on the app or can register at the border before entry.”The India-Nepal border had been sealed on March 23, 2020, in a bid to check the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. Nepal didn’t even allow its citizens to enter initially. Citizens of both countries were stuck and had to stay in relief or quarantine centres set up by either side by respective governments. Later, the Indian government provided some relaxation to the Nepalese to cross the border.Also read: India extends $100 mn line of credit for defence equipment to MauritiusAfter 10 months, Nepal announced the Banbasa border to be opened on January 29 but under the standard operating procedure (SOP). The border, however, could not be reopened due to a lack of guidelines from the Nepalese government. Nepal Covid-19 crisis management centre in Kathmandu had launched an app a few days ago for Indians who intend to visit Nepal, said an official.Indians will have to register their names on the app and will have to upload the required information such as a permanent address, mode of travelling, mobile number. The Nepalese authorities will only permit their entry after producing registration information and Covid-19 test reports. This exercise is being implemented in a bid to check the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic in Nepal, said an official.Kafaltia said, “Nepal Armed Police Force (NAPF) deployed at the border will monitor the movement and help in spot registration if someone fails to register on the app. Private vehicles will not be allowed but those for essential and emergency services will not be restricted.”Notably, the Indian government had allowed Nepalese with Indian documents to cross the border during the lockdown period. They could cross over to Nepal between 6 to 10 am daily from the Banbasa entry point. Banbasa of Champawat is one among 19 notified entry points along the border, the official said.Nepalese ex-servicemen who had worked with the Indian security forces also suffered problems in drawing their pensions from Indian banks in bordering areas. They were given certain dates to cross the Indian border and draw the pensions.Bharat Bhandari, former president of the local traders union of Banbasa, hailed the reopening of the border. He, however, expressed apprehensions and said, “It is good that Nepal has reopened the border. Our Banbasa’s 80 per cent trade depends on Nepalese customers. Every time, registration and Covid-19 test report may create problems for traders of India as well as the visitors. Nepalese government should give some more relaxation in favour of Indians.”Vinod Kala, a local resident of Banbasa, said, “the Nepalese government must permit private vehicles of India. This will save time as well as give comfort to Indian visitors and traders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-opens-border-for-indians-registration-and-covid-19-report-must-for-entry-101613998431681.html

This law will destroy the concept of mandis and farmers' market. The second law says that the biggest businesses in the country can store as much grain, fruits and vegetables as they want, for as long as they want. This is a direct attack on Essential Commodities Act, and has been designed to ensure farmer can't negotiate for price," said the former Congress president."Third law is the most fantastic of them all. It says that if the farmer has a dispute about the price of what he is selling, he cannot go to court. It takes away the legal rights of the farmers," said Gandhi.He said that the Congress party is against these laws and will force the government to repeal them. "We are standing with the farmers, we will help them and ensure the BJP Govt takes back these laws," said Gandhi.He repeated his remark about the agriculture sector going in the hands of corporate houses and said that this business belongs to 'Bharat Maata'.Gandhi also held a tractor rally from Thrikkaipetta to Muttil to express solidarity with the protesting farmers.Also Read: Rahul Gandhi leads tractor rally against farm laws in KeralaFarmers have been protesting at the different borders of the national capital since November last year, against the three newly enacted farm laws - Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The Congress has been attacking the government over the three laws, but the Centre has accused the opposition party of running a "misinformation campaign" and trying to mislead the farmers.The government has said that the three laws are historic and will bring about much-needed changes in the agriculture sector.

The court order said that the poet cannot go back to Hyderabad, his home.“It is really a big relief for all of us that he would be out of jail after a gap of more than two-and-a-half years. But it is unfortunate that the court did not grant him permission to return to his home in Hyderabad during the bail period,” Rao’s brother-in-law N Venugopal, who is also a poet and writer, said.While observing that it was a "genuine and fit" case for granting relief to Rao in view of his advanced age and inadequate facilities in the jail, the high court refused to allow him to go to Hyderabad, saying “sending him back to where he belongs is fraught with the risk of his presence being used by those allegedly associated with him”.Rao was also directed not to issue any statements or speak to the media, both print and electronic.Rao’s wife Hemalatha, who is waging a legal battle in the court against his arrest, is presently in Mumbai, awaiting his release. “The court has asked him to furnish a bail bond of ₹50,000 and we are in the process of completing those formalities. We are expecting that he would be released by Tuesday,” Venugopal said.Brother-in-law Venugopal said Rao has no relatives in Mumbai who could take care of him during the bail period.“It is a tricky situation for the family. He cannot afford to take a house on rent to stay there. And given the sensitivity of the case, we are not sure he would even get a house on rent in Mumbai. Since he doesn’t require hospitalisation, he cannot be kept in hospital either,” Venugopal said.Rao’s three daughters – Sahaja, Anala and Pavana – have their own families in Hyderabad. “They have to go to Mumbai in turns to take care of their father. In the given situation due to the coronavirus pandemic, it is risky for them, too,” he said.According to Venugopal, there are two more cases pending against Rao – one in connection with a 2005 Maoist attack case in Pavagada in Kolar district of Karnataka and another case of trucks burning at Gadchiroli in Maharashtra in 2016. The revolutionary poet has been facing trial in connection with the Bhima Koregaon violence case of January 1, 2018, and also on charges of being part of a plot hatched by Maoists to assassinate Prime Minister Narendra Modi.He was arrested by the Pune police first in August 2018 and after he was released on bail following a court order, he was rearrested in November 2018. He was first lodged in the Yeravada Jail in Pune and later moved to Taloja jail in Mumbai.In May, Rao tested positive for Covid-19 and was shifted to JJ Hospital from Taloja jail.In July last year, his family members issued a statement saying Rao’s health condition deteriorated and he appeared to be in a state of delirium and hallucination. “He was talking about the funeral of his father and mother, the events that happened seven decades and four decades ago respectively,” Hemalatha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/where-in-mumbai-varavara-rao-s-family-as-court-declines-hyderabad-return-101613996269475.html

I am as good as dead, living with the pain and trauma. Over the years, multiple attempts have been made to eliminate me. My house was vandalised. I was not allowed to stay in my own house. I am forced to live with my mother,” she said, alleging that Biswal managed to evade arrest in the first place due to the patronage of Congress politicians.Also Read | Hathras gangrape case: CBI files status report before high courtBiswal and two others, Padia Sahoo and Dhirendra Mohanty, had allegedly gang-raped the woman, then a 29-year-old homemaker who had kicked up a controversy by accusing the then advocate general of Odisha, Indrajit Ray, of molesting her in his chamber. She had earlier accused her Indian Forest Service husband of dowry torture and had reportedly gone Ray’s chambers to discuss her case where he allegedly tried to sexually assault her. While the survivor dragged Ray to court, chief minister Patnaik too got drawn into the controversy for allegedly tried to bail Ray, a family friend. A CBI court in Bhubaneswar later sentenced Ray to three years of imprisonment along with a fine of ₹5,000.Then, on January 9, 1999, the survivor was travelling from Cuttack to Bhubaneswar with one of her friends when Biswal, Mohanty and Sahoo allegedly intercepted their vehicle at a desolate place where they allegedly gang-raped her at gunpoint in front of her journalist friend.The survivor then lodged a First Information Report (FIR) in which she accused Patnaik of engineering the assault to intimidate her into withdrawing the case against Ray. As the gangrape led to an unprecedented public outrage in Odisha triggering statewide protests, an embarrassed Congress chief Sonia Gandhi asked Patnaik to resign.Meanwhile, two of the accused were arrested soon after the survivor’s FIR. The Orissa high court then ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation to probe the case and a charge sheet was filed. In a judgment in April 2002, a designated CBI court in Bhubaneswar sentenced Sahoo and Mohanty to life imprisonment and a fine of ₹5,000 each. In 2010, the Orissa high court upheld the verdict. Sahoo died last year while serving his sentence.Police commissioner Sarangi said Biswal had almost managed to evade the police by getting an Aadhaar card and voter identity card in his new name. In his Aadhaar card, however, he had given his village name as Naranpur. “He used to send money to his family. He was asking his family to get a death certificate so that Biswal can be shown as dead in police record. We have informed the CBI about his arrest and are waiting to hand him over,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-22-years-after-gangrape-case-last-of-the-3-accused-arrested-from-maharashtra-101613995641061.html

It was noticed during certain political meetings that the cadres did not wear face masks or follow social distancing. Such an offhand attitude could lead to unpleasant consequences," he said and pointed out to an incident in Amaravathy district in Maharashtra where a family has been infected by the virus.Maharashtra, Punjab, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, apart from Kerala have recorded a surge in daily new cases of Covid-19.The Union Health Ministry had said both Kerala and Maharashtra cumulatively accounted for over 74 per cent of India's total active cases."Tamil Nadu has a low positivity rate of 0.9 per cent per 100 persons and a majority of those who get admitted early with Coronavirus symptoms are treated and discharged.

22-02-2021||India||PDP elects Mehbooba Mufti as party chief for another term||Mehbooba Mufti was elected as the president of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for another term on Monday.Like the earlier party chief election more than three years ago, Mufti was elected unanimously. “Mehbooba Mufti was unanimously re-elected as JKPDP president for a period of three years. Her name was proposed by senior leaders Ghulam Nabi Hanjura and seconded by Khurshid Alam. Senior leader AR Veeri was the chairman of party election board under whose supervision the election was held,” PDP chief spokesperson Suhail Bukhari said. The party was formed by Mufti’s father and former J&K chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed in 1999 after leaving the Congress. PDP went on to form the government along with the Congress in 2003 and later, in 2015, with the Bharatiya Janta Party.Also Read | Lt Governor Manoj Sinha assures tourists safe, pleasant, memorable visit to J&KHowever, many of the founding members have left the PDP, some to join new political parties. The latest to leave the PDP was party patron Muzuffar Beigh who left along with his wife Safeena Beigh after the latter was denied the district development council ticket from north Kashmir last year.In her new tenure, Mufti’s task will get tougher as she tries to reorganise her party which saw many leaders leave post August 5, 2019, for a new political front led by Altaf Bukhari was a close associate at one point.Mufti has started travelling to different regions of J&K, addressing meetings and trying to bring new faces to PDP. Despite massive defections, the party is still strong in south Kashmir and managed to win 27 DDC seats in the recently concluded elections. PDP senior leader and spokesperso, Tahir Sayeed said Mufti is a fighter and has faced many challenges. “The situation in J&K has changed and she will try to hold the party together. The recent DDC wins are an indication that the party is still strong. She has worked very hard and everyone in PDP looks up to her.”Political analysts say Mufti will try to bring in new faces, especially those who won’t leave PDP even in the absence of power. “The party has been weakened and the leadership has to revamp it and get more people into the fold. It has lost many big leaders but it still managed to win a good number of seats in Kashmir,” pointed out Aseem Mohideen, editor of a local newspaper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pdpelects-mehbooba-mufti-as-party-chief-for-another-term-101613993601003.html

22-02-2021||India||India extends $100 mn line of credit for defence equipment to Mauritius||India and Mauritius on Monday signed a free trade agreement that will make the African island nation a hub for Indian investments in the region, even as New Delhi extended a $100-million line of credit to fund purchases of defence equipment. Besides the comprehensive economic cooperation and partnership agreement (CECPA), the two countries signed six other pacts, including two for leasing a Dornier aircraft and a Dhruv advanced light helicopter for monitoring the exclusive economic zone of Mauritius. The agreements were announced following visiting external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s meetings with Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth and foreign minister Alan Ganoo. Jaishankar handed over 100,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines commercially procured by Mauritius, which had received another 100,000 doses as a grant last month. The CECPA, signed by India’s commerce secretary Anup Wadhawan and Mauritius foreign secretary Haymandoyal Dillum, is India’s first free trade agreement with any African country, Jaishankar and Jugnauth told a media interaction in Port Louis. Also Read | Jaishankar arrives in Mauritius on last leg of 2-nation tourThe agreement will provide concessional access to 310 export items from India, including agricultural products, textiles, base metals and chemicals, while Mauritius will get preferential market access for 615 products, including frozen fish, fresh fruits, beer, alcoholic drinks, and medical and surgical equipment. The agreement is expected to open up new market opportunities for both sides and provide a framework to explore opportunities on the African continent. Describing Mauritius as a “gateway between India and Africa”, Jugnauth said: “This landmark agreement is far-reaching and should unleash new and expanded opportunities in trade in goods and services, investment, economic cooperation and technical assistance.” Jaishankar said the CECPA will “provide a timely boost for the revival of our post-Covid economies and enable Indian investors to use Mauritius as a launch-pad for business expansion in Africa”. The goods given preferential access will allow Mauritius to tap into segments of the Indian market that currently account for global imports of $15 billion, he said. For instance, Mauritius will get preferential access for the export of 40,000 tonnes of sugar in an early timeframe and 7.5 million pieces of apparel. Officials said the $100-million line of credit for defence equipment will pave the way for Mauritius procuring a new coastal surveillance system and other hardware. India will lease the Dornier aircraft and Dhruv helicopter “gratis for two years” to shore up Mauritius’ “capabilities to control and monitor its extensive maritime domain”, Jaishankar said. Jugnauth also said Mauritius values its defence cooperation with India, including in capacity-building, coastal surveillance, and deterrence to piracy and illegal fishing. Three other agreements covered the setting up of a renal transplant unit at the Jawaharlal Nehru Hospital with Indian support, creating an 8-MW solar farm to help Mauritius achieve its target of generating 35% of total energy from renewable sources by 2025, and cooperation on consumer protection. Jugnauth said Mauritius and India have a “unique, trusted and enduring relationship” and a “common interest in an open, prosperous and secure Indian Ocean”. Both countries also have converging views on strengthening the rules-based world order and global institutions, including those of the UN, he said. He said Mauritius is looking for India’s assistance in procuring another 200,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines in the coming months Jugnauth said he also discussed the issue of Chagos Islands, which includes the US military base at Diego Garcia, with Jaishankar. The two sides reviewed the “decolonisation process”, the completion of which “will have no implications for the maintenance of the defence operations in Diego Garcia”, he said. Jaishankar said he assured Jugnauth of “India’s steadfast, principled support” on the issue of the Chagos archipelago as “has been demonstrated in the past”. In 2019, the International Court of Justice ruled that the UK should end its control of the Chagos archipelago. The UK has said it doesn’t recognise Mauritius’ claim to sovereignty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-extends-100-mn-line-of-credit-for-defence-equipment-to-mauritius-101613992341175.html
22-02-2021||India||Uttarakhand Mein Bhi Kejriwal campaign a success; over 100,000 joined us: AAP||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)’s “Uttarakhand Mein Bhi Kejriwal” membership campaign in the state has succeeded in getting 103,000 new members since its launch on February 1, said senior state AAP leader Ravindra Jugran on Monday in Dehradun. Under the programme, which was launched by senior AAP leader and deputy chief minister of Delhi Manish Sisodia, the party sent out 70 vans, one each in the assembly constituencies of the state, to educate the public about party policies with the help of videos, all in preparation for the 2022 state assembly elections which the party plans to contest. The party had set a target to rope in at least 100,000 people in 45 days, asking people interested in joining the party to give a missed call on a given number. About the number of missed calls they received, Jugran said, “The party had targeted to touch the figure of 100,000 in 45 days of the campaign but we achieved it in 21 days only, which goes to show the support we are getting.”Also Read| Uttarakhand CM requests Union govt for glacier research centre in state“We have received a total of 103,000 missed calls on our number, 7669007669, for membership across the state. Most people, 17,366, joined us from US Nagar district followed by 16,228 form Dehradun, 14,838 from Haridwar, and 10,569 from Nainital. Among some other districts that our campaign got a good response in are Almora with 8,850 members, Pauri Garhwal with 9,653 members and Tehri Garhwal with 8,859 members,” said Jugran. He said the party had also set a target of holding 6,500 public meetings of which “2,540 have been held”. Upbeat about the response, Jugran said, “We are sure the number of new members would increase manifold as the people want AAP to come to power in 2022.” However, the ruling BJP and main Opposition Congress sought to underplay AAP’s presence in the state. BJP state media in-charge Manveer Chauhan said, “AAP has no presence in the state as it is a party which spread lies and gave false hopes to people like it did in Delhi. They are doing the same in Uttarakhand, but people here will not fall in that trap.” Congress state spokesperson Garima Dasauni said, “AAP is claiming it will come to power in 2022 but it doesn’t have enough leaders to contest from all the 70 seats.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-mein-bhi-kejriwal-campaign-a-success-over-100-000-joined-us-aap-101613992220915.html
22-02-2021||India||PM Modi inaugurates several railway projects in West Bengal||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will build a Bengal where religion and ability will be respected, and where everyone can experience development."BJP will work for a Sonar Bangla that will strengthen the history and culture of Bengal. We will build a Bengal where religion and ability will be respected. We will build a Bengal where everyone is developed," PM Modi said in his address.The Prime Minister was addressing a public meeting in West Bengal's Hoogly. He also inaugurated several railway projects in the state. PM Modi said that the formation of a BJP government in West Bengal isn't merely for a change in power, but for 'Ashol Poriborton'."Our youth is living with the hope of this 'Ashol Poriborton' (real transformation), and thus, we need to form the BJP government in Bengal," PM Modi said. Accusing chief minister Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress government of siphoning funds provided for cyclone relief, PM Modi said, "The Central government has provided ₹1,700 crore for relief work after Amphan to the TMC government in Bengal. The state government has only spent ₹609 crore. The leftover ₹1,100 crore has been siphoned off by TMC."He also accused the chief minister of stalling the availability of free healthcare treatment."Lakhs of needy people in Bengal have not been able to receive free treatment worth ₹5 lakh under Ayushman Bharat. This is the kind of hurdle Mamata Ji's government has formed between the people of Bengal and development," the PM said. Taking a swipe at Mamata-led government, "People who talk about maa-maati-manush have become a wall in front of the development of Bengal. The money deposited by the central government for farmers and the poor goes directly into these people's bank account. Hailing Bengali leaders who participated in India's freedom struggle, PM said, "This entire region including Chandannagar is a major part of India's independence struggle, its culture and its science. Maharshi Aurobindo, Motilal Roy, Rashbehari Bose, Bipin Bihari Ganguly, Kanailal Dutta and several more are associated with this land."Plugging the development plank, PM said, "Better infrastructure, agriculture, industry, tourism - employment opportunities need a lot right reforms. Infrastructure associated with connectivity is the priority of our govt. In the last few years, we've focused on highway, waterway, airway and e-way."PM Modi is in Bengal where he will inaugurate the extension of Metro Railway from Noapara to Dakshineswar, and flag off the first service on this stretch. This 4.1 km extension has been constructed at a cost of ₹464 crore, fully funded by the central government. It will decongest road traffic and improve urban mobility. This extension will ease out access to the two world-famous Kali temples at Kalighat and Dakshineswar, for lakhs of tourists and devotees.The two newly built stations namely Baranagar and Dakshineswar have modern passenger amenities and are also aesthetically designed and decorated with murals, photographs, sculptures and idols.Prime Minister Modi will also inaugurate the third line between Kalaikunda and Jhargram over a stretch of 30 km of the 132 km long Kharagpur-Adityapur Third Line Project of South Eastern Railway, which was sanctioned with an estimated cost of ₹1,312 crore.He will dedicate to the nation the doubling of Azimganj to Khargraghat Road section, which is a part of the Howrah-Bandel-Azimganj section of Eastern Railway, which has been laid at a project cost of about ₹240 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-in-hoogly-will-build-a-bengal-where-religion-is-respected-101613991443469.html

She was arrested by the police in connection with an online toolkit which the cops claimed was created by her in support of farmers protesting against Centre's farm laws.The police had asked for a fresh five-day custody of Ravi.Ravi was presented in court after her three-day judicial custody ended. The 22-year-old was arrested on February 13 and initially sent to five-day police custody.The police said that they require Ravi's custody to question her along with two other accused on the case - activists Nikita Jacob and Shantanu Muluk. Appearing on behalf of police, public prosecutor Vikas Singh said that the present request for police custody is not a punishment, but rather would be helpful to Ravi because she is shifting the blame on the other two accused.Ravi's lawyer Siddharth Agarwal opposed police's demand saying she has already been questioned by the police and facts conveyed in the earlier remand application."The police have a right to interrogate the accused even in the jail. Why would you require to take her in police custody?" asked Agarwal. He also pointed out that an order on her bail plea is expected on Tuesday.While Delhi Police had arrested Bengaluru-based Ravi, Jacob and Muluk were granted pre-arrest bail by a court.Ravi's bail plea is already pending before Additional Sessions Judge Dharmender Rana, who is expected to pass an order on Tuesday.

The number of active cases in the state now stands at 2,051. Chattisgarh added 10 more cases of the coronavirus disease, taking its tally of active cases to 3112. There have been five fatalities between Sunday and Monday and the death toll currently stands at 3800. Chattisgarh had witnessed the highest single-day rise in early January when it registered 1050 cases in a span of 24 hours, breaching the 1000 daily case mark for the first time since the pandemic started.In a controversial move, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had decided to close all Covid care centres in the state, except those in Bhopal, from January 1 in view of the low occupancy of beds. After being criticised by the opposition for the closure, the chief minister had assured that the centres will be reopened when the need arises.India has been witnessing a rise in the active coronavirus caseload over the past few days and the government has said that more than 74 per cent of cases in the country are from Kerala and Maharashtra.

22-02-2021||India||MP, Karnataka before Puducherry: How Congress lost govts in 2 other states||V Narayanasamy resigned as Puducherry chief minister on Monday after losing a trust vote on the floor of the House. The collapse of the Congress-led government means that since 2019, the party has lost power in two states and a Union territory, without the completion of the full term of the respective governments. Before Puducherry, it had lost power in Madhya Pradesh (March 2020) and Karnataka (July 2019).Also Read | Narayanasamy loses trust vote, Congress govt falls in Puducherry: What next?The Congress could have lost another government, in Rajasthan last July, but managed to hold on. Here’s what happened in Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, before Puducherry:Karnataka: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerged as the single-largest party in assembly elections in May 2018, ahead of the ruling Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular). The latter two then joined hands, with HD Kumaraswamy of the JD(S) becoming the chief minister. However, the government collapsed after rebellion by more than a dozen Congress-JD(S) lawmakers in July 2019. The BJP then came to power and in December, won 12 out of 15 seats for which byelections were held, thus adding enough seats to its tally to cross the majority mark. Several of the Congress-JD(S) defectors joined the BJP and were subsequently made ministers in the BS Yediyurappa government.Also Read | Karnataka byelections: Here is why Congress lostMadhya Pradesh: The Congress ended the BJP’s 15-year-rule in the central state in the December 2018 assembly elections. Veteran leader Kamal Nath was preferred over Jyotiraditya Scindia as the chief minister. Eventually, in March last year, Scindia, aggrieved over a host of issues, joined the BJP and was made a Rajya Sabha MP. Several lawmakers loyal to Scindia also jumped ship, triggering the Kamal Nath government’s collapse and the BJP’s return to power after just 15 months. The BJP subsequently won 19 out of 28 assembly seats for which bypolls were held in November, and several defectors were inducted into Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s government.Also Read | BJP regains lost bastion in Gwalior-Chambal belt in MP bypollsRajasthan: The western state was one among three where the Congress defeated the BJP in late 2018. Here, too, just like MP, former CM Ashok Gehlot was appointed to the top post instead of Sachin Pilot, who was made his deputy. The two never got along, and in July 2020, ‘Team Pilot’ rebelled, with rumours linking him to the BJP. However, Pilot did not join the saffron party, instead coming back to the Congress ranks after a three-member panel was formed to address various issues raised by him. The panel comprised Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, KC Venugopal and the late Ahmed Patel. Gehlot went on to win a trust vote and save his government.Also Read | Sachin Pilot falls in line after Rahul meet, settles for 3-member panel to hear his sideThe Congress was also a part of the 'Mahagathbandhan' which came to power in Bihar in late 2015. However, it was the junior partner to the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Janata Dal (United). The JD(U) left the alliance in July 2017 to join the BJP and form government in Bihar. The four states then contributed significantly in the BJP’s re-election at the Centre in 2019, when it won 303 seats on its own, up from 282 in 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-karnataka-before-puducherry-how-congress-lost-govts-in-2-other-states-101613987677476.html
22-02-2021||India||Arriving passengers to be tested for Covid-19 via RT-PCR at Delhi airport||All passengers from the UK, Brazil, South Africa, all European countries and the Middle East arriving at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport will compulsorily have to undergo an RT-PCR test beginning Tuesday, 12am. However, they may need not mandatorily undergo institutional quarantine.As per the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) given by the ministry of health and family welfare dated February 17, passengers from these high-risk countries can get their tests done at the airport before proceeding for home quarantine. Transit passengers will, however, have to wait for six hours until their reports are out.The new SOP states, “All travellers from UK, Brazil and South Africa on their arrival will give their sample in the designated area and exit the airport. They will be followed up by the state Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP). The concerned state authorities/airport operators will collect and convey the test report to the traveller. If tested negative, they will remain in home quarantine for seven days and will be regularly followed up by the concerned state IDSP. These travellers shall again be tested after seven days and if found negative, released from quarantine, and continue to monitor their health for a further seven days. All those tested positive shall undergo treatment.” It adds that all other travellers from Europe and Middle East (other than those in flights originating from Brazil, South Africa and UK) who have to exit the destination airport or take a connecting flight to their final domestic destination will undergo the same protocol but will be advised to self-monitor their health for 14 days.Meanwhile, the new arrangement has increased the daily number of RT-PCR tests tenfold, according to Genestrings diagnostics that is conducting these tests at the Delhi airport.Genestrings diagnostics founder-director Dr Gauri Agarwal said this stringent approach to control the spread of the new variant of the coronavirus by making testing mandatory for travellers from identified high-risk countries will take the number of daily tests from 500-600 to 7,000+.“While our laboratory is equipped to test above 15,000 samples per day, the operations team comprising data entry operators and sample collection technicians also had to be increased tenfold to handle the large inflow of passengers from UK, Europe and Middle East. For this, a massive recruitment drive was launched immediately after the SOP was announced and at least 230 staff members was recruited overnight and trained over the next two days,” Agarwal said.She said that during the peak hours of 3-5am, there are expected to be roughly 1,200 passengers per hour who will undergo the mandatory testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arriving-passengers-to-be-tested-for-covid-19-via-rt-pcr-at-delhi-airport-101613988201328.html
22-02-2021||India||India to clear 45 investments from China, likely to include Great Wall, SAIC: Report||India is set to clear 45 investment proposals from China, which are likely to include those from Great Wall Motor and SAIC Motor Corp, government and industry sources told Reuters, as military tensions between the two countries ease at the disputed border.The proposals have been held up since last year after India tightened controls on Chinese investment in the country in retaliation against alleged Chinese troop incursions in the western Himalayan region. China blamed Indian troops for the standoff.About 150 investment proposals from China worth more than $2 billion were stuck in the pipeline. Companies from Japan and the U.S. routing investment through Hong Kong were also caught in the cross-fire as an inter-ministerial panel led by the interior ministry increased scrutiny of such proposals.A federal Home (Interior) Ministry spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on the proposals to be cleared.Two government sources who have seen the list said most of the 45 proposals set for early approvals are in the manufacturing sector, which is considered non-sensitive in terms of national security.The sources did not elaborate but two other government officials and two industry sources who are privy to the process said proposals from Great Wall and SAIC are likely to be on the list.Great Wall and General Motors (GM) made a joint proposal last year seeking consent for the Chinese automaker to purchase the U.S. company's car plant in India, in a deal expected to be valued at around $250-$300 million.Great Wall, which plans to invest $1 billion in India over the next few years, said earlier that establishing operations in the country is a key part of its global strategy. It had planned to start selling cars in India from this year, and was also mulling bringing in electric vehicles.Great Wall said it continues to seek relevant approvals and investment clearances."Should we be granted all relevant approvals, we will push all work forward in India, abiding by the laws and rules laid down by the Indian government," a company spokesman said.A GM spokesman added: "We continue to seek all relevant approvals to support the transaction."SAIC, which started selling cars in India in 2019 under its British brand MG Motor, has invested around $400 million of the nearly $650 million it has committed to India and would need approval to bring more investment.SAIC's India unit did not respond to an email seeking comment.The change in the Indian government's stance follows an improvement in the border situation. Troops who were in eyeball to eyeball confrontation in territory claimed by both sides have been withdrawn, the two countries announced on Sunday.The plan going forward is to split up over 150 proposed Chinese investments into three categories depending on the risk to national security, the sources said.Sectors such as automobiles, electronics, chemicals and textiles are seen as non-sensitive whereas those involving data and finance are deemed sensitive, consultants and lawyers have said.Proposals from non-sensitive sectors will be approved faster, while those seen as "sensitive" will be reviewed later, one of the government sources said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-clear-45-investments-from-china-likely-to-include-great-wall-saic-report-101613987396064.html

It is clear that WHO do not approve or disapprove any drugs. WHO works for building a better, healthier future for people all over the world (sic)."In a statement issued on Monday, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) said, “Being Health Minister of the country, how justified is it to release such falsely fabricated unscientific product to people of the whole country...can you clarify the time frame, time line for the so-called clinical trial of this said anti-corona product?""The country needs an explanation from the minister. The Indian Medical Association will also write to National Medical Commission for seeking suo moto explanation for his blatant disrespect to the code of conduct of Medical Council of India,” the IMA said."Indian Medical Association is shocked to note the blatant lie of WHO certification...," it said.Haridwar-based Patanjali Ayurved had also released what it claimed was research work supporting Coronil's efficacy in Covid-19 treatment.The announcement regarding the Ayush certification for Coronil and release of a research paper calling it the "first evidence-based medicine for Covid-19 by Patanjali" was done at an event here attended by Vardhan.In a statement, Patanjali had said: "Coronil has received the Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product (CoPP) from the Ayush section of Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation as per the WHO certification scheme."However, WHO South-East Asia in a tweet said: "@WHO has not reviewed or certified the effectiveness of any traditional medicine for the treatment #Covid19."Patanjali had introduced ayurveda-based Coronil on June 23 last year, when the pandemic was at its peak. It had to face severe criticism as it lacked scientific evidence regarding its efficacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ima-shocked-on-patanjali-s-claim-on-coronil-seeks-health-minister-s-response-101613986425907.html
22-02-2021||India||AAP takes a jab at Congress over Puducherry floor test||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Monday took a jibe at Congress after it failed to clear the floor test in the Puducherry assembly. The party, which is in power in Delhi, suggested that Congress should focus on saving its own governments, rather than saving the nation. “Congress has not got a break from saving its own governments in states where it is in power. How will it save the nation?” the AAP tweeted.The Congress-Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) coalition government could not prove its majority in the Puducherry assembly earlier on Monday after which chief minister V Narayanasamy tendered his resignation to Lieutenant Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan. The Congress leader accused the Bharatiya Janata Party and the former L-G Kiran Bedi of colluding with the parties in opposition to topple his government. “We have submitted our resignations… In the coming elections people will punish the opposition who used the three nominated MLAs (of the Bharatiya Janata Party) to topple our government,” Narayanasamy said.Meanwhile, the AAP has not only stepped up its attack on Congress but also on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). After the Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that his party will fight the assembly polls to be held in the next two years, the AAP has also stepped up its attacks on Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and even Gujarat.Kejriwal had said, “In next two years, AAP will be contesting elections in six states - UP, Uttarakhand, Goa, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat. I urge party members to strengthen the grassroots-level hold of the party across the country. The organisation has to be strengthened on a very large scale. The country is important for us and AAP is the vehicle and we need to work towards the development of the party.”The Delhi chief minister has said on February 20 that the people of Gujarat should give the AAP a chance to showcase their abilities when it comes to development. Kejriwal tweeted in Gujarati, “Give Aam Aadmi Party a chance and then take a look at Gujarat.”એક મોકો AAP ને, પછી જુઓ ગુજરાતનેOn the same day, the AAP tweeted that Uttarakhand has failed to address the issues faced by the people of the state. In a tweet, the party said, “BJP’s game is over, Congress has failed. It is time for the implementation of the Kejriwal model.”भाजपा का खत्म खेल, कांग्रेस भी रही फेल।अब उत्तराखंड का होगा 'केजरीवाल मॉडल' से मेल। pic.twitter.com/GwpR259tWmThe AAP’s sharpest attacks have also been levelled at the Uttar Pradesh government where it has criticised the Yogi Adityanath dispensation over healthcare issues and education. Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had previously targeted the UP government regarding the state of education. In December, Sisodia conducted a debate programme titled State of Education – Kejriwal's Delhi Model versus Yogi's UP Model - at Gandhi Bhawan in Lucknow’s Kaiserbagh. During the programme, he kept an empty seat on stage waiting for UP cabinet minister Siddharth Nath Singh, news agency PTI reported.कानून व्यवस्था पहले ही दम तोड़ चुकी है अब स्वास्थ्य व्यवस्था अपनी आखरी सांसे ले रही है उत्तर प्रदेश में।राजधानी लखनऊ में जब ऐसी भयावह स्थिति है तो सोचिए अन्य जनपदों में जनता की क्या दशा होगी! pic.twitter.com/gd8WpRBvwGThe party has also made MLA Raghav Chadha AAP's Punjab co-in charge in a bid to continue its criticism of the model of governance under the leadership of CM Captain Amarinder Singh. The party which has emerged as the main opposition party in the state continues to attack Congress over several issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aap-takes-a-jab-at-congress-over-puducherry-floor-test-101613985255337.html

Earlier, it had allowed him to travel to the UK, the US, France, Germany and Spain.The bench of justice Ashok Bhushan and justice RS Reddy also asked Chidambaram's lawyer Kapil Sibal to submit details of the former’s itinerary and place of stay in the foreign countries that he will visit. The details need to be given to the court before Chidambaram leaves for the visit, the top court stated. Sibal, who is also a senior Congress leader, requested the bench to allow Chidambaram to approach the trial court for seeking further permission as the trial in the INX Media case against Chidambaram is pending there. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta objected to it, saying the top court alone should hear these petitions as in the past too permission was granted in this regard by the Supreme Court. Following Mehta’s argument, Sibal remarked, "Will a member of Parliament run away?". To this the solicitor general replied saying, "In the past, there has been an instance of an MP running away." Mehta’s comment was an apparent reference to liquor baron Vijay Mallya who escaped the country while he was a member of Parliament.Chidambaram is facing several criminal cases related to the Aircel-Maxis deal and the Foreign Investment Promotion Board clearance to INX Media for receiving foreign funds of ₹305 crore when his father, P Chidambaram, was the Union finance minister. The cases are being probed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).The ED had earlier claimed that Karti Chidambaram had been trying to protract the investigation by "blatantly misusing" the liberty granted by the court in allowing him to travel abroad.Earlier this month, a Delhi court had permitted the CBI to investigate documents it has recently received from Swiss authorities in the INX Media case involving former finance minister P Chidambaram and others, according to news agency ANI.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-allows-karti-chidambaram-to-travel-abroad-told-to-deposit-rs2-crore-security-101613982254176.html

The unit will increase the refinery’s crude processing capacity from 2.35MMTPA (million metric tonnes per annum) to 2.7MMTPA. Its commissioning will also significantly enhance LPG production from 50TMT (thousand metric tonnes) to 257TMT and the Motor Spirit (Petrol) production from 210TMT to 533TMT. Modi will also inaugurate Oil India Limited’s secondary tank farm at Madhuban in Dibrugarh and a gas compressor unit at Hebeda in Makum. The farm has been built for the safe storage of about 40,000 kilolitres of crude oil and the separation of formation water from wet crude oil. The ₹490 crore project, will also have a dehydration unit with an operating capacity of 10,000 kilolitres per day, said a press information bureau release. The gas compressor station will increase the nation’s crude oil production capacity by nearly 16,500 metric tonnes per annum. Built at a cost of ₹132 crore, the station comprises three low-pressure booster compressors and three high-pressure lifter compressors, it added. The Dhemaji Engineering College has been built on 276 “bighas” of land, at a cost of about ₹45 crore. It is the seventh government engineering college in the state and will offer BTech courses in civil, mechanical and computer science engineering. The Sualkuchi Engineering College, whose foundation stone will be laid, will be built on 116 “bighas” of land at a cost of about ₹55 crore. “The projects will speed up the pace of development of Assam and also increase employment avenues in the state. Out governments are trying to reach the areas and people who have been neglected earlier,” said Modi. “Our governments at the Centre and Assam have done more for the development of the state in the past few years than what previous governments did for decades,” he added, while urging those present to strengthen the “double-engine” (BJP governments at Centre and state) of growth further. The programme at Dhemaji was attended by Assam governor Jagdish Mukhi, chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal and union petroleum and gas minister Dharmendra Pradhan. On January 23, Modi had addressed a rally in Sivasagar and distributed land allotment certificates to 106,000 landless families. On February 7, he had addressed another rally at Dhekiajuli, laid the foundation stones of two medical colleges and launched the Asom Mala road network project. On February 18, Modi launched several connectivity projects worth over ₹9,500 crore via video conferencing. They included the Mahabahu-Brahmaputra project to improve inland water transport connectivity, laying the foundation stone of a 19km bridge connecting Dhubri in Assam to Phulbari in Meghalaya and the ground-breaking ceremony (bhumi pujan) of another bridge connecting Jorhat and Majuli island.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-assembly-election-schedule-likely-in-first-week-of-march-says-pm-modi-101613980400579.html

The Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) shall be valid w.e.f. from February 22," MoHFW Guidelines said.The testing process has suddenly increased about 10-fold; earlier about 500-700 international passengers were being tested per day, the lab is now staring at 7,000 plus numbers.While the lab infrastructure is equipped to even test above 15,000 samples per day, the operations team comprising data entry operators and sample collection technicians had to be increased 10 folds to handle the large inflow of passengers from the UK, Europe, and the Middle East."A massive recruitment drive was launched immediately after the SOP was announced and over 200 staff was recruited overnight and trained over the next two days," Genestrings lab said.As per record reported at the airport's peak hours, it was identified that between 3 am to 5 am, there will be roughly 1,200 passengers an hour who will undergo mandatory RT-PCR testing."It is a very brave and timely decision taken by the government to control a new wave of Covid-19 cases in the country. We are fully prepared and will ensure a smooth experience for all passengers who will be quite anxious," said Dr Gauri Agarwal, Director of Genestrings Diagnostic labs.Genestrings lab is the only lab at Indira Gandhi International Airport that was the first lab in the country to set up an arrival testing facility in September 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/testing-increased-at-igi-airport-to-help-detect-new-covid-19-variant-101613978962677.html

22-02-2021||India||Narayanasamy loses trust vote, Congress govt falls in Puducherry: What next?||Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and now Puducherry—the Congress’ inability to handle its internal undercurrents continues to topple its governments. The defeat of the V Narayanasamy-led Congress government in Puducherry in the trust vote on Monday was a foregone conclusion. But it will have larger consequences for the Congress that is already riddled with crises. Some party strategists concede that the fall of the government in Puducherry, less than two months before it goes to polls, would significantly weaken their prospects in the upcoming elections as the message to the voters is loud and clear: the Congress can’t keep its house in order. To be sure, Narayanasamy’s campaign against lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi had some resonance on the ground, or that’s what the Congress strategists in Chennai claimed. But Bedi’s swift sacking on February 16, minutes after the Congress lost its crucial MLAs, was aimed to take the wind out of the Congress’ campaign against her alleged high-handedness. Also Read | Will not stake a claim to form govt in Puducherry, says BJPPuducherry was the only Congress-ruled Union Territory in south India. The party, however, now plans to focus the campaign on “how the BJP betrayed Puducherry’s mandate” and “manufactured rebellion” to “topple a popular government,” said a party strategist. “This has to be the key plank for the polls,” he added. At least three party leaders based in Chennai said that trouble had been brewing ever since Narayanasamy was sent from Delhi to lead the Union Territory. But the central leadership largely overlooked the issue and the Narayanasamy vs Kiran Bedi battle took prominence on their radar. “It will be very difficult to turn the tide of the upcoming election in Puducherry. We couldn’t complete our term and that’s purely due to our internal differences, which the BJP fully exploited,” said a second senior party leader based in Chennai. Top Congress strategists believe that the party’s inability to retain its people from jumping ship in places where they are in power remains a lingering issue. Two years ago, the Congress’ coalition government with the Janata Dal (United) in Bihar fell after as many as 16 MLAs from the ruling side rebelled against their own government. Just a year ago, the Congress lost Madhya Pradesh as well. The party was able to end the BJP’s dream run in power for 15 years in Madhya Pradesh. But the Congress leadership failed to solve lingering issues after Kamal Nath became the chief minister. And in March 2020, one of the most prominent leaders of Congress, Jyotiraditya Scindia quit the Congress with a few other MLAs. Shivraj Singh Chauhan returned to the CM’s seat after sitting in the Opposition for just a year and three months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/narayanasamy-loses-trust-vote-congress-govt-falls-in-puducherry-what-next-101613978900358.html
22-02-2021||India||Focus should be on providing defence equipment to smaller nations: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday outlined that the country now has to step out from an import-dependent status and fast track its defence manufacturing capabilities as third-world nations with relatively small economies will look forward to India for their defence needs.“The changes in the world order that we are observing have made smaller nations aware of the need to strengthen their defence. Defence is one of the primary concerns for these countries. It is natural for these nations to look forward to India to help these nations strengthen their defence capabilities,” the Prime Minister said.PM Modi further added, “We have the ability of low-cost manufacturing and we also are able to deliver quality products. We are playing an important role through our rising defence manufacturing sector and there are opportunities to further help these nations with our defence equipment manufacturing abilities.”The Prime Minister, while addressing the webinar on effective implementation of budget provisions in the defence sector, outlined that India is manufacturing defence equipment to more than 40 nations. He said that the focus should be on making India one of the largest defence exporters.He highlighted that startups and medium and small enterprises (MSMEs) are working hard to provide the requisite tools needed to achieve these targets. “MSMEs are the spine for larger industries. Reforms introduced by the governments are empowering the MSME sector and are now encouraged to expand their operations,” he said.PM Modi said that MSMEs add firepower to all the industries. He further added that the defence corridors that are being built across the country are empowering local manufacturers.Earlier in the day, defence minister Rajnath Singh said that India is focusing on bringing a turnover of ₹175,000 crore through defence export. “The ministry of defence aims to achieve a turnover of ₹175,000 crore ($25 billion) including export of ₹35,000 Crores ($5 billion) in aerospace, defence goods and services by 2024,” Singh was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Singh also said that steps are being taken to reduce the time for defence acquisition. He said, “The ministry is also working on reducing the delays in timelines of capital acquisition. We are making efforts to complete defence acquisition within two years, instead of the current practice of three to four years being taken on the average.”India’s defence sector received a hike of 1.4% along with a 19% rise in capital outlay for military modernisation in the Union Budget tabled earlier this month. Allocation for defence services was increased to ₹4.78 lakh crore compared to ₹4.71 lakh crore in the 2020-21 budget, according to a report by news agency PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/focus-should-be-on-providing-defence-equipment-to-smaller-nations-pm-modi-101613977767798.html
22-02-2021||India||Will not stake a claim to form the govt in Puducherry, says BJP||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday said it will not stake a claim to form the government in Puducherry after the V Narayanasamy-led Congress government lost the vote of confidence in the assembly. The BJP said with the collapse of the government in Puducherry, “the worst chapter” in the Union Territory’s history has come to a close. The political turmoil in Puducherry comes months ahead of the upcoming assembly election.“We will not try and form a government at this stage. With the people’s blessings in the forthcoming elections and [Prime Minister Narendra] Modiji’s leadership, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) will form a government with BJP and its alliance partners All India NR Congress and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in May and build a new bright future for the people of Puducherry,” said the BJP state unit president V Saminathan.Also Read | Puducherry CM Narayanasamy loses trust vote in assemblyWhile Narayanasamy alleged that former lieutenant governor (L-G) Kiran Bedi had colluded with the Opposition to topple his government; the BJP accused him of poor governance.Saminathan said that in the last five years, the state’s finances had been “looted and destroyed” and the money meant for the people, which was sent from Central funds for jobs, ration, healthcare, roads, and education, has been misused.“You saw during Rahul Gandhi’s visit how poor women had to complain about suffering during cyclones,” he said.“A culture of corruption and exploitation is the only thing that Congress and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam have given to the people instead of development and helping them. The people of Puducherry will teach them a lesson in the coming elections,” he said shortly after the floor test.PM Modi is scheduled to visit the poll-bound Union Territory on February 25. Last week, Bedi, who had a tumultuous equation with the Narayanasamy government, was removed from the position of L-G and Telangana governor Tamilisai Soundararajan was given additional charge of the Union Territory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-not-stake-a-claim-to-form-the-govt-in-puducherry-says-bjp-101613977281463.html

The Speaker also adjourned the House sine die.Narayanasamy had moved the motion seeking the confidence vote minutes after the assembly met for a one-day special session. The chief minister accused former lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi of "colluding with the opposition" to topple his government. “Former LG Kiran Bedi and the Centre colluded with the opposition and tried to topple the government. It is clear that the people of Puducherry trust us. This is a government elected by the people,” the CM said. “We formed the government with the support of DMK and independent MLAs.

In year 2020-21, minor forest produce worth nearly ₹115 crore rupees have been procured at minimum support price so far. This scheme has played an important role in providing employment to tribal people and forest dwellers during Covid-19 crisis. In year 2020-21, Chhattisgarh secured first rank in the country for collecting 72.5 percent of the total minor forest produce collection under Minimum Support Price Scheme. Similarly, under Pradhan Mantri Van Dhan Yojana, 139 Van Dhan Vikas Kendras have been established and more than 120 herbals products are being manufactured and sold under the brand name of 'Chhattisgarh Herbals',” the CM stated in his letter stated.Baghel further elaborated on the state government’s proposals.Also Read: Chhattisgarh CM requests Rajnath to expedite army cantonment set up at Bilaspur“This includes the proposal worth Rs.100 crore for working capital for collection of minor forest produce at minimum support price, proposal worth ₹21.91 crore for reimbursement of business losses incurred under the Minimum Support Price Scheme,” the letter states.He also mentions proposal worth ₹65.77 crore for livelihood development in scheduled areas under Covid-19 pandemic response plan. “Hence, I request approve these proposals and sanction funds under the same as soon as possible,” Baghel said in the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-cm-sends-proposals-worth-rs-234cr-for-tribal-development-to-centre-101613974415346.html
22-02-2021||India||Fuel prices unchanged for second straight day. Check rates in your city||State-run oil marketing companies (OMC) on Monday kept fuel prices unchanged for a second straight day amid a nationwide rise in their rates, which has triggered protests in some parts of the country. After 12 consecutive days of fuel price hike, OMCs had first kept the rates steady on February 21.Petrol, which has crossed the record ₹90 per litre mark in Delhi, stays put at ₹90.58 while the price of an equal quantity of diesel is unchanged at ₹80.97. Mumbai has the highest fuel prices among the four metros, as a litre of petrol and diesel in Maharashtra’s is retailing at ₹97 and ₹88.06 respectively. Consumers in the southern metropolis of Chennai will have to pay ₹92.59 and 85.98 for a litre of petrol and diesel respectively, followed by Kolkata at ₹91.78 and ₹84.56. Petrol in the IT hubs of Hyderabad and Bengaluru is at ₹94.18 and ₹93.61 per litre, respectively, while a litre of diesel is at ₹88.31 and ₹85.84.Fuel prices were hiked by 39 and 37 paise per litre respectively in the national capital on February 20, taking a litre of petrol to ₹90.58 and diesel to ₹80.97 for a litre.OMCs like Indian Oil, Hindustan Petroleum (HP) and Bharat Petroleum (BP) determine fuel prices daily, as per rates in the international market. The practice of daily price revision came into effect from June 15, 2017. Before that, prices were revised every fortnight.With fuel prices rising, Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Sunday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Gandhi accused PM Modi’s government of ‘profiteering off people’s misery and suffering.’ In the three-page letter, she pointed out how the crude oil price is nearly half of what it was during the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government’s tenure. “Therefore, your government’s act of raising prices is little less than a brazen act of profiteering,” Gandhi wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fuel-prices-unchanged-for-second-straight-day-check-rates-in-your-city-101613972332906.html
22-02-2021||India||Supreme Court to hear Amazon’s plea to stall Future-Reliance deal today||The Supreme Court will on Monday hear a petition by e-commerce giant Amazon, which has appealed against an order of the Delhi high court lifting the restraint against the ₹24,713 crore deal between Kishore Biyani-led Future Retail Limited (FRL) and Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani’s Reliance Retail. A bench of justices Rohinton F Nariman and BR Gavai will take up the plea by United States-based Amazon to restore the status quo on the FRL-Reliance deal till the time various legal issues related to the matter are finally decided by the high court. Amazon, in its appeal, among a host of legal issues, has primarily questioned the maintainability of FRL’s petition before the Delhi high court’s division bench against the interim order on the single judge who had restrained the Future Group from proceeding further with entities of the Reliance Group. Also Read | Future Group creditors scramble to recover $2.5 billion loansThe US retail giant has also banked on the October 25, 2020 Emergency Arbitrator (EA) order passed by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) that had restrained FRL from going ahead with the deal with Reliance Retail. “No provision for appeal is provided against an order passed under Section 17(2) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. The respondents (FRL) have not challenged the EA order itself, but have preferred to challenge the single judge order enforcing the EA order,” said the Amazon’s petition in Supreme Court. It added that the single judge’s status quo order was passed for the limited purpose of preserving the rights of the parties till pronouncement of final orders and the division bench of the Delhi high court ought not to have issued its order “hastily”. Pointing out the consequences of lifting the status quo, Amazon’s petition said, “The greater the progress made towards the completion of the impugned transaction, the harder it will be to unravel it. Over time, the interests of additional third parties may also become entwined with the transaction and be subsequently compromised.” On February 8, a division (two judge) bench of the Delhi high court had stayed a single judge’s direction of February 2 that had put a temporary freeze on the deal between Future Retail and Reliance. The order by the division bench had come on FRL’s appeal, which had claimed that due to the status quo position, the proceedings before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for approving the amalgamation scheme were held up. This could be an “absolute disaster” for the company with its outlets across India being shut and nearly 25,000 employees losing their livelihood, FRL had contended. The order, in an appeal before Supreme Court, had noted, “Statutory authorities should not be restrained from proceeding in accordance with law on Future-Reliance deal,” while lifting the single judge’s status quo direction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-hear-amazon-s-plea-to-stall-future-reliance-deal-today-101613971399980.html

22-02-2021||India||Farmers’ protest: RSS starts outreach programme in Punjab||Concerned by the possibility of a pro-secession movement gaining ground in Punjab and the fear of hostility between Hindus and Sikhs, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has mobilised its cadre to carry out outreach programmes in the border state. The outreach is aimed at dispelling “misunderstandings” about the farm laws and to impress upon the need to insulate the ongoing farmers’ stir from pro-secession groups, said functionaries aware of the details. A section of farmers from Punjab have been demanding the three new farm laws be repealed, though the agitation has also been joined by farmers’ groups from Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, where influential Jat Khaps have also lent their support to the agitation. The Sangh, however, is worried by the agitation being used to stoke the pro-Khalistan sentiment. Also Read | Will soon visit Gujarat to mobilise support for farmers’ protest: Rakesh Tikait“There are some farmers who have been led to believe that because of the new laws they will lose ownership of their land or the government is withdrawing minimum support price for their crops. While there are some genuine concerns that the government is ready to discuss, a misinformation campaign was deliberately carried out. The agitation has now been taken over by vested interests, who are not worried about the farmers, but are driven by other motives,” said a senior functionary, requesting anonymity. At meetings with local leaders, Sangh functionaries have underlined the need to differentiate between the pro-farmer groups and individuals and organisations known to support the Khalistan movement. “Punjab lived through tumultuous times in the 1980s when terrorists killed thousands of innocent people. Nobody wants those days to return,” said the functionary quoted above. The Sangh also sees a “pattern” in how agitations are used to create hostility between communities. “When the Citizenship Amendment Act was formed, a misinformation campaign began that it would lead to Muslim citizens losing their citizenship. Similarly, famers from Punjab are being used to drive the agenda of anti-national forces,” said the functionary. The outreach, however, is not easy. At least two incidents of violent attacks at Shakhas were reported in February in Punjab’s Baltana. Many functionaries have had to face angry responses, especially in rural areas, said a second functionary. “There are some organisations that have, over the years, created doubts about the Sangh. Sometimes this takes a violent turn and we have lost people too, but we are confident of overcoming this,” said the second functionary. Though he did not name names, the second functionary was referring to the friction between the Akal Takht, which serves as the five seats of Sikh religious authority, and the Sangh that has not abated over the years. The Takht accuses the RSS of trying to subsume the Sikh identity with that of the Hindus, even as the Sangh has denied the charge. They object to the Sangh identifying Sikhs as Hindus. The Takht has also accused the Rashtriya Sikh Sangat—an offshoot of the Sangh formed in 1986 with the intent of building ties between Sikhs and the Hindus in the aftermath of the 1984 riots—of colluding with the RSS to gain control over the Sikh religious bodies. The Sangh’s latest outreach to build bridges between communities is a throwback to the 1980s when the third RSS chief Balasaheb Deoras had asked for full-time volunteers drawn from each state to be deputed to Punjab. The ongoing agitation and the consequent disruption of shakhas in the state have also led to concern that the functionaries could be sitting ducks for physical attacks. Asked whether the Sangh has requested for security at the shakhas and its offices, the second functionary said the issue will be discussed with the authorities. “The authorities are aware of the threat perception to the Sangh functionaries. Over the years there have been several attacks; since 2014 at least five senior functionaries have been killed. But the Sangh has continued its work. Even after the bloody attack of 1989, our work did not stop,” said the second functionary. In 1989, terrorists attacked a shakha in Moga killing 27 Swayamsevaks or volunteers; the death toll rose to over 40 after the injured succumbed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-rss-starts-outreach-programme-in-punjab-101613966059934.html

22-02-2021||India||India-China disengagement: ITBP to continue patrolling in non-friction points||Even as the disengagement of frontline solders at the north and south banks of Pangong Tso is completed, the Indo-Tibet Border Police (ITBP) will continue to patrol areas in Ladakh that were not friction points between India and China. Patrolling in these areas had come to a standstill due to the tensions, people familiar with the development said. The border guarding force won’t be patrolling the areas where disengagement has taken place or other friction points like Depsang, Gogra, Hot Springs and Kongka La until the redesigned patrolling terms or status of old patrolling terms in these areas are conveyed by the Indian Army. “We will continue to patrol the areas which we were patrolling earlier on our perception area of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and are not friction points. These include certain grazing grounds, inner areas and patrolling points towards Uttarakhand as well as the eastern sector,” said an officer, requesting anonymity. Also Read | Disengagement process in east Ladakh over, says RajnathUnion defence minister Rajnath Singh had told parliament last Thursday that the decision on other friction points will be taken during discussion between two armies 48 hours after “complete disengagement” in the Pangong Lake area — both north and south banks. As part of the agreement on disengagement, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) moved its forces to the east of Finger 8 on the north bank, and the Indian Army to its base near Finger 3, Singh had said. ITBP, another officer said, will also maintain status quo for now at its Border Outposts (BOPs) in the Ladakh region, which were strengthened by ssome 60 additional companies (around 6,000 personnel) in June-July last after, after the Galwan valley clash on June 15-16 in which 20 Indian army soldiers and unknown number of PLA troops were killed. At least 25 to 30 additional personnel had been deployed in most BOPs of ITBP in Eastern Ladakh; usually 100 to 110 personnel are deployed in each border outpost. “Let’s see how things unfold in the next few weeks. If the disengagement in all areas concludes peacefully, the additional personnel will automatically be sent back,” said the second officer. Both officers cited above also confirmed that the infrastructure development, including construction of roads, repair/construction of jawans’ barracks/posts and 47 new BOPs sanctioned by the government across the 3,488km-long border with China will continue as well. In fact, ITBP’s first “climate-controlled” BOP at Lukung Valley along the strategic Pangong Tso Lake, built at a cost of around ₹17 crore, is currently under testing. The state-of-the-art BOP is likely to be officially operationalised by April or May this year. Both Indian and Chinese armies had deployed over 100,000 soldiers and advanced weaponry in their forward and depth areas of the Finger Area, a set of eight cliffs jutting out of the Sirijap range overlooking the Pangong Lake, for past eight months now. In a statement in Parliament last September, Rajnath Singh said no force in the world could stop the Indian Army from patrolling its borders. Sameer Patil, Fellow at the International Security Studies Programme at Gateway House, said – “ITBP’s role has always been like that. They play the primary role in patrolling the border like Border Security Force (BSF) at the International Border (IB) or Line of Control (LOC). The army comes into the picture when there is friction. ITBP knows the terrain, people and areas which need regular patrolling, so it will always be a crucial element in maintaining security at the LAC.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiachina-disengagement-itbp-to-continue-patrolling-in-non-friction-points-101613962520108.html

The bank, however, later amended the message to add the two languages.In an advertisement disseminated through its social media handles, the bank said they “proudly speak the language of respect and diversity” and included a graphic of different languages spoken in the country.“At JK Bank, we encourage linguistic diversity and respect every language. Recognising and valuing each language this International Mother language Day,” it said in the message.The absence of local languages of the Union Territory including Kashmiri, Dogri, Pahari and Gojari prompted criticism from the netizens.“The J&K Bank could have left us without this insult on #MotherLanguageDay. The Bank is going across the country to celebrate even Marathi, Tamil and Gujarati but would not like to take ‘pride’ in Dogri and Kashmiri, for which the Parliament made a huge effort to declare them as official languages of Jammu and Kashmir. Forget Gojari and Pahari if you were thinking since seeing this,” wrote Zafar Choudhary, a journalist.Mir Faheem, a Srinagar resident, said the bank brought itself disrepute.“J&K Bank has only brought itself disrepute by ignoring Kashmiri language in its promotional advertisement pertaining to International Mother Language Day.

Chief minister V Narayanasamy-led government now has 12 MLAs and the opposition’s strength stood at 14 in the 33-member House.Puducherry assembly now has seven vacancies, resulting in an effective strength of 26. The simple majority figure is 14 after Sunday’s resignations. Four Congress MLAs – including former ministers A Namassivayam and Malladi Krishna Rao – quit earlier, while another party legislator was disqualified for anti-party activities last year. The opposition had submitted a petition seeking a floor test to the lieutenant governor (L-G)’s office on February 18.The numbersIn the 33-member assembly, 30 are elected seats and three are nominated members belonging to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Congress currently has nine MLAs. These include assembly speaker SP Sivakolundhi, who is not allowed to vote unless there is a tie.The Congress has the support of two DMK MLAs and an Independent MLA from Mahe. The opposition has seven MLAs from the All Indian NR Congress, led by former chief minister N Rangasamy, and four from the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK).

The dates are yet to be announced.What is a floor test?A floor test is a motion initiated by the government seeking to know if it enjoys the confidence of the legislature. A confidence motion or a vote of confidence or a trust vote allows elected representatives to determine if the council of ministers command the confidence of the House. The idea behind the trust vote is to uphold the political accountability of the elected government to the state legislature.A no-confidence motion, or vote of no-confidence, or a no-trust vote, can be sought by any House member to express that they no longer have confidence in the government.Also read | ‘Centre denied rights to people of Puducherry’, says CM NarayanasamyThe chief minister, in the case of a coalition government, may be asked to move a vote of confidence and win a majority.

22-02-2021||India||Middle class must curb electricity consumption||If we don’t want dams in the Himalayas, the path is via our electricity consumption. India’s residential electricity consumption has tripled since 2000.A research conducted by Prayas, an organisation working on energy, reveals that residential consumption is increasing inequitably. The national Capital, which consumes 250-270 units per month, is comparable to a German household. Delhi’s electricity is from coal and dams. The study points out that this is more than Mumbai at 110 units or even Chandigarh at 208 units. Much is used for running gadgets like air-conditioners. Is this not inequitable?Coal and large hydro-electric plants account for most of this. We, and I am part of this, often ask that the coal-based thermal power plants upgrade to newer standards. Often, question the wisdom of renewables like hydro-electricity from large dams. But what we must know is that our energy demand is rapidly growing, and as 80% of India hits some or the other level of middle class by 2030, the consumption will increase significantly.Where will this come from? We can’t keep expanding even renewables-where is the land for large solar parks? We need an urgent paradigm shift. Energy efficient goods must displace others, and fiscal instruments must be used. Our losses in transmission and other sources have to be plugged, and energy generation cut down. We need a big shift in social behaviour- states must find culturally appropriate ways to cut down consumption. Only then can we expect fewer dams and coal-based power plants. Only then can we protect the environment.(The writer is the founder and director of the Chintan Environmental Research and Action Group)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/middle-class-must-curb-electricity-consumption-101613959132097.html

When the high court ordered the police to investigate it in 2009 both parties denied it and supported such elements. Appeasement politics was carving Kerala and the BJP will put an end to it. The high court had said love jihad will turn Kerala into an Islamic republic. But the government was sleeping and encouraging these elements. Now many state governments have enacted law to contain the scourge.”Also Read | Atmosphere in Kerala is favourable towards BJP, says V MuraleedharanHe also criticised the government’s handling of the Sabarimala temple issue. “The government had hurt feelings of believers.

22-02-2021||India||Atmosphere in Kerala is favourable towards BJP, says V Muraleedharan||Minister of state for external affairs and former Bharatiya Janata Party Kerala president V Muraleedharan speaks to Smriti Kak Ramachandran about the upcoming assembly polls in the state. Edited excerpts :What is the party’s expectation in terms of seats and vote share in the upcoming elections?The vote share was around 15% in 2016, it went up in the Lok Sabha elections and then further up in the local body elections. We are now somewhere around 17%. Generally, in Kerala, BJP’s vote share used to be the highest in the Lok Sabha elections, followed by the local body and then the assembly polls. My expectation is that we will be somewhere between 17 to 20%. I have never predicted the number of seats, but the overall atmosphere in the state is favourable towards BJP.E Sreedharan is in his 80s, is the party expediently using the age bar. His joining is also being compared to the entry of cricketer S Sreesanth, who did not win the Thiruvananthapuram seat.There is a difference between Sreesanth and Sreedharan. In Sreesanth’s case, perhaps we made a mistake because he is basically from Cochin and he wanted to contest the elections from Cochin and suburbs, but was fielded from Trivandrum. That place had no connect with him. The second factor was people look at Sreesanth as a cricketer, but Sreedharan is associated with public service. I’m sure with his experience we will progress further. As for his age, he is still very agile and dynamic.What are the poll planks going to be?People are fed up with corruption, vote bank politics being practised by both the UDF and LDF. Kerala (government) seems to be propagating to the country and the world that they are the best, but in every aspect this government has failed whether it is response to Covid-19, employment or financial management. We will ensure that there is no vote bank politics, no corruption and there is a transparent administration.What plans does BJP have to generate employment in the state?The Union government initiated many activities on that front. The skill development ministry has been authorised to initiate efforts to see what kind of employment can be provided to those who returned back.In the local body polls, the BJP fielded Christian and Muslim candidates. In January, state’s church leaders met Prime Minister Narendra Modi. There is a perception that the BJP is wooing the Christians.The meeting of the Christian leaders with the PM happened after the local body elections. It was sought by them because they wanted to discuss some issues with the PM. For example, the minority scholarship and various other benefits that they felt the Christian community is discriminated (against) and in favour of the Muslims. They wanted to bring this issue before the PM that Christians are not getting their due. The other thing is the problems between the Jacobite and Orthodox factions.From the BJP side, I will say that politically we are in a better position as regards the Christian community compared to the previous years. The suspicion among them that the BJP is against them is over. How far they will support the BJP electorally is a different matter, it depends on the local candidates and various other situations, but I can assure you that BJP’s relationship with the Christian community vis-a-vis Muslims is better. I hope that will reflect in the elections also.Opposition says BJP can bank only on Nair votes.That was an old allegation, which was used to target the BJP that it is an upper caste party. The fact is not so. We have among our senior leaders’ representatives from all communities, Nairs, Ezhavas, our ally is the BDJS.There have been defections from other parties to the BJP in West Bengal? Will Kerala follow suit?At this point in Kerala, we are not looking at people from other parties joining us. We would like to have people with integrity, who have experience of public life and who are efficient to join the BJP. I don’t say that others are not welcome but that is not our focus.The Congress has raked the Sabarimala issue again. Oommen Chandy had written a letter to CM Pinarayi Vijayan last week asking him to approach the SC to expedite a ruling.Last time (2019 polls) when Sabarimala happened, it made a huge impact and I admit that it helped the Congress because people were angry against the Left front. People voted for the Congress but have understood it is no different. After the polls they have not made any effort, now just before the elections they have again raised the issue. Otherwise, the Congress is not in favour of Sabarimala or the majority community. Last time they could have benefited but I don’t think this time they will.Do you see the Congress’ resurgence in the state or is it a contest between BJP and the Left.It is a tri-cornered contest. I won’t say it is completely irrelevant, but the Congress is not on an upswing. It does not have a national leadership and I don’t see any hope of resurrection at the national level, so the new generation feels that BJP is the party that can take the country towards progress and the same will reflect in Kerala as well.Both the Congress and the Left Front have assured that if they win CAA would be blocked.First of all, it is a central law. No state has the discretionary power in implementing or not implementing a central law. This law has nothing to do with Kerala and I don’t think there are people who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh or Afghanistan and are trying to get citizenship.BJP is seen to be cracking down on any kind of dissent; people are accusing the government of flexing muscle.The farmers’ agitation is being used by some to campaign against India at the international level. A citizen of India is bound to be committed to the Constitution, so when somebody goes against it and the laws of the land… as per the procedures and the criminal procedure law, action will proceed.Why did the government respond to comments of an international singer?The government had to react because it was not an individual effort; it was part of a larger design. If somebody expressed something and kept quiet there is no issue. but when there is a larger design and there are people who are trying to malign the image of the country, it is the responsibility of the government to come out before the international community and say what exactly is the situation. If we don’t do that, we will be failing in our duty to protect the interest of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/atmosphere-in-kerala-is-favourable-towards-bjp-says-v-muraleedharan-101613957919738.html
22-02-2021||India||Eight booked for spreading ‘false information’ over Unnao case||The Unnao police filed an FIR on Sunday against six people and two news portals for allegedly tweeting false information in connection with the death of two teenage girls.In a press release, the police identified the accused as Nilim Dutta, Abhay Kumar Azad, Suraj Kumar Baudh, Rahul Kumar Diwakar, Nawab Satpal Tanvar and Vijay Ambedkar, along with two news portals. “These individuals claimed that the girls were raped, and their last rites were performed against the will of their family members. This information is false. The post-mortem report has shown that the girls were not raped. Further, their last rites were performed by their family.” Three girls were found in a field with their hands tied on February 17. Two later died of poisoning, while another is undergoing treatment.It added that false information was shared with an intention to spread hatred and communal tension. The accused have been booked under Section 153 (giving provocation with intent to cause riots) and the IT Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eight-booked-for-spreading-false-information-over-unnao-case-101613957511320.html
22-02-2021||India||Rural experience: Fewer legal aid clinics, police personnel||By Gagan Sethi and NupurAs we approach the anniversary of the first Covid-19 lockdown and subsequent migrant crisis it unleashed, it is an opportune time to reflect how rural India — home to almost 400 million migrants and their families — remains under served in all essential pillars of justice delivery: police, prisons, legal aid and judiciary. While some aspects of the crisis such as the availability of food, health services and education received wide coverage, other equally significant ones, like access to justice services, were not. The India Justice Report 2020 offers a glimpse of the wide chasm between urban and rural India that compounded the crisis of migrants who returned to their home states in the aftermath of the lockdown.Many migrants found themselves out of a job, and many of who were forced to return to their villages, left behind unpaid wages. Despite the government’s nudge to employers to pay all workers, we found out that most of 12,000 migrants whose travel to their home states we arranged during the lockdown were not paid their legitimate wages.If the legal aid system had been functional in rural areas it would have certainly been part of their mandate to reach out to the employers who owed the wages thus providing much needed succour to migrants.A unit of legal aid infrastructure in villages is a legal services clinic. Typically, a legal services clinic is required to cater to a reasonable cluster of villages, according to guidelines issued by the National Legal Aid Services Authority (NALSA). These clinics are expected to provide basic legal services and are meant to be the first points of contact for persons seeking legal advice and assistance, helping them to fill up forms to avail government schemes, and to draft representations, among other things.According to IJR, before India entered the lockdown — in March 2020 — there were only 14,159 legal aid clinics for 597,617 villages or on average, one clinic for every 42 villages. Barring Rajasthan and Gujarat, other large states that saw reverse-migration such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh have nearly 100 or above villages served by a single legal services clinic.Uttar Pradesh has the worst ratio at 520 villages for every clinic, while Rajasthan is at 7 villages per clinic.Bodies such as the District Legal Services Authority which are meant to oversee the legal needs of taluka and block level units in the state were able to come to the assistance of migrants according to NALSA — their district level units with the help of local bodies such as ours, and many others across the country, coordinated the food, transportation, and shelter of 5.7 million people between April and June 2020.It also needs to be noted that only 19,300 people were provided legal representation at the stage of being produced before the court across all the 669 DLSAs in the country, which indicates that their core function was impeded during the pandemic.The good news is that states’ legal aid expenditure (what it gets from the Centre via NALSA and its own expenditure) has increased.As the latest IJR report shows, in the last two years, 14 of 18 large and mid-sized states and five of seven small states have increased their contribution to their legal aid spend. Jharkhand, for instance, increased its share from zero to 59% between 2017-18 and 2019-20. Uttar Pradesh increased its share of expenditure from 20% to 89% in the same duration. West Bengal too showed a steep rise: from 18% to 59%.Among the small states, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim and Tripura showed a steep rise in their share of expenditure towards legal aid. This has reflected in rural coverage of legal services, the IJR shows. In the past two years, 22 states and union territories have improved their average coverage of legal services clinics in villages. This has a direct impact on vulnerable sections such as women, children, Dalits and tribal persons.At the moment, while the National Crime Records provides crime data in select cities, it doesn’t share crime figures disaggregated by rural and urban areas. We know from our experience on the ground that crimes, especially those committed against the vulnerable often go unreported, or are not even recorded by local authorities. The sparse availability of institutions like police stations only worsens the situation.As per the IJR, in almost all states, rural police stations cover larger areas than their urban counterparts. In Rajasthan, for instance, the area coverage of a rural police station was nearly 35 times its urban counterpart (695 sq km to 20 sq km). Similarly, in UP, the area served by rural police stations is roughly 16 times that of an urban police station (235 sq km to 16 sq km). One rural police station in West Bengal, covers a population of 250,000 persons, as against the 140,000 persons covered by an urban police station.Urban areas provide better access to state-run helplines for women and child victims of violence. In rural areas, the lack of access of women and children to even mobile phones means that many crimes cannot even be reported to the right authorities. An enhanced presence of legal aid services and police posts would ensure that victims are able to file complaints and seek help and protection.A justice system that was overburdened in normal times has been left overwhelmed by the pandemic, and as a result the most vulnerable among us are in serious peril.This holds especially true for rural areas. The pandemic seems to be on the wane, but now is the time to heed its lessons and improve the availability of justice services across the large swathes of rural India.Faith in rule of law by the common man, after all, is at the core of democracy.Gagan Sethi and Nupur (who only goes by one name) are co-founders of Centre for Social Justice, one of the organisations involved in bringing out the India Justice Report 2020. Released by Tata Trusts, IJR examines the state of justice delivery across prisons, judiciary, legal aid and police.

The Congress alleges that we have ceded the Indian territory but as long I’ve my blood and life in this body, we will never cede even an inch to any country. The country will not allow any ‘unilateral action’ on our border by anyone. We will not keep quiet.

22-02-2021||India||BJP resolution lauds agri laws, Covid fight||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday passed a political resolution hailing the passage of the new agriculture laws, which it said are aimed at improving the lot of farmers and increasing their income even as the Opposition has rallied around an agitation demanding the legislation’s repeal.The resolution, passed at the end of a daylong national office bearers’ meeting addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, also praised the Union government’s response to the Covid pandemic, its economic management amid a global slump and efforts at ensuring the passage of new farm and labour laws.The resolution also made a pointed reference to the India-China standoff along the LAC and said, “India will not let any expansionist strategy succeed on its borders. Under the leadership of PM Modi, India has proved this at every given opportunity.”Also Read | BKU Ugrahan appeals to Punjab farmers to reach Delhi border in large numbers for February 27 rallyEarlier, addressing the national officer bearers and state unit presidents, Modi said the party’s mission and organisation were not only aimed at securing power but at ensuring development for all.National general secretary Bhupendra Yadav told the media, “He (the PM) said there is a positive mood in the country, so work should be undertaken keeping in mind the mantra of nation first.”The party commended the government’s Covid-19 response, and in the resolution said while the world was “speculating over how India with its vast population and limited health care infrastructure” would face the challenge, it can be “said with pride that India not only defeated Covid under the able, sensitive, committed and visionary leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, but also infused in all its citizens the confidence to build an ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’.”While the Opposition had questioned the nationwide lockdown announced on March 24 and accused the government of announcing it without any preparation, the resolution referred to the government’s call as a “decision that will be remembered in history as the prime example of the sensitivity of a welfare government committed to public good.”The resolution also made a specific mention of the Gareeb Kalyan package of ₹1.70 lakh crore announced within 48 hours of the imposition of the lockdown, efforts made to develop indigenous vaccines, and the government’s resolve of building an Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India).The passage of the agriculture laws, drafting of the national education policy, merger of public sector banks, and curbs on financial irregularities were described as reformative steps undertaken by the government.The BJP, gearing up for electoral battles in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam and Puducherry, blamed the Congress and the Left parties of “trying to mislead the farmers about the farm laws”.The party’s performances in local body elections in a clutch of states and the Bihar victory were hailed.A specific reference was made to the local elections in Jammu and Kashmir. “…In the first local elections held after the removal of Article 370 it was democracy that won. The first District Development Council elections held in J&K shattered many myths. Ignoring terrorists and separatists, people fearlessly reposed faith in democracy,” the resolution said.The meeting was attended by national office bearers, state unit presidents, in-charges of election-bound states and national and state general secretaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-resolution-lauds-agri-laws-covid-fight-101613953911657.html
22-02-2021||India||Cyber security brass steps in as experts flag delay in fixing lapses||India’s top cybersecurity officials stepped in as a group of researchers said agencies were slow in fixing a slew of critical vulnerabilities pointed out over two weeks ago, which has potentially created a situation where attackers could access sensitive information and carry out more disruptive operations against government servers.Issues were found in dozens of government-run web services, more than half of which belonged to different state governments. Several of them had multiple issues, including exposed credentials that would allow someone unauthorised access, leaks of sensitive files and the existence of known bugs which, if exploited, could lead to deeper access, the researchers told HT.“Remedial actions have been taken by NCIIPC (National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre) and Cert-IN (Indian Computer Emergency Response Team)… NCIIPC handles only the Critical Information Infrastructure issues. In this case the balance pertained to other states and departments that were immediately informed by Cert-IN. It is likely that some action may be pending by users at state levels which we are checking,” National Cyber Security Coordinator (NCSC) Lt Gen Rajesh Pant told HT on Sunday.Also Read | Ex-defence personnel hit by phishing attackThe remark by the official came as members of his team opened communications with the researchers who found the vulnerabilities, according to a person aware of the development, asking not to be named. The researchers – part of a collective that calls itself Sakura Samurai -- said they reached out to the NCIIPC in the first few days of February but most of the issues they flagged were unresolved for over two weeks.“You need to fix this. I’ve went through our report and not even 1/8 of these Critical Vulnerabilities are fixed, weeks later. Do the Indian Citizens know that they are exposed? They have the right to be protected. This isn’t fluff. Fixing this is Critical,” said Sakura Samurai’s John Jackson, in a series of tweets addressed to NCIIPC on February 19.Late on Saturday, Jackson published a blog with an overview of the vulnerabilities that, without citing specifics, mentioned the discovery of 35 instances of credentials pairs, 3 instances of sensitive files, over 13,000 personally identifiable information instances, dozens of police FIRs.Additionally, they discovered multiple vulnerabilities that could be chained to potentially compromise extremely sensitive government systems.In the blog, Jackson said they tested gov.in systems for vulnerabilities as part of the NCIIPC’s Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure Program (RVDP), a practice followed world over in which companies and countries allow developers, researchers and security professionals to report issues that could pose a risk to information security.On Sunday, after backchannel lines were opened to the NCSC, the official’s team escalated the incident to the respective agencies, according to a person aware of developments who asked not to be identified. Cert-IN did not respond to requests for a comment to HT.Experts said the incident highlights the need to improve coordination on such issues.“Vulnerability management is a complex science. No government gets it right. Transparency in disclosure and swiftness of response become crucial then. The ‘coordination’ part of the National Cyber Coordination Centre needs a major reboot,” said Pukhraj Singh, a cyber threats analyst, while suggesting that manual notification and assessment protocols be automated.“We need not wait for a catastrophe like the SolarWinds attack to make us realise how our cyber vulnerabilities could set back our national security by decades,” he added.Concerns about response times were also flagged by an Indian researcher, who found a trove of data relating to Covid-19 test results of people in a particular state.The issue “is resulting in the leakage of lakhs of Covid test reports. These include sensitive information like name, age, residence address exact date of sample testing, etc,” said Sourajeet Majumder. Majumder flagged the issue to Cert-IN on February 10 but the issue was yet to be fixed. HT is not identifying the state in order to minimise the risk of the information being targeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyber-security-brass-steps-in-as-experts-flag-delay-in-fixing-lapses-101613943157880.html
22-02-2021||India||India may turn to Iran, Venezuela for oil imports||India may make diplomatic efforts to organise oil-consuming countries against the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) as producers keep crude prices artificially high by restricting supply, and also plans to resume import of cheaper energy from countries such as Iran and Venezuela to counter the oil cartel, two officials said.Domestic fuel prices have spiked because of rising energy demand after rapid recovery of major economies from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, but the oil cartel continues to restrict supply, which is a major concern for New Delhi, they said on condition of anonymity.“The current crisis is artificially created by oil producers. Diplomatic efforts are on to ease the supply situation,” one of the officials said. Retail prices of petrol and diesel in India jumped by ₹3.63 per litre and ₹3.84 a litre, respectively, in just 12 days since February 8.Also Read | Why are prices of petrol and diesel increasing? Petroleum minister explainsIndia has already requested OPEC and its allies, including Russia (together known as OPEC+) to immediately restore the output that was substantially cut to stabilise crude prices when the Covid-19 pandemic began raging and most of the global economies were under lockdowns, the officials said.The cartel, OPEC+, on April 12 last year announced a 9.7 million barrel per day cut in oil output, a 10th of the global output, from May 1, 2020, but did not adhere to the planned restoration of the supply reduction.“India can raise this matter at various forums such as Quad, a plurilateral platform involving the US, Japan, India and Australia. With the easing of tension at the border, New Delhi may also engage Beijing to have a common voice of world’s four-five major oil consumers. South Korea could also be an ally on this matter of common interest,” one official quoted above said. India is the third biggest oil consumer in the world after the US and China.When OPEC+ was in crisis, India supported its output cut strategy to stabilise international oil prices that had plummeted below $20 a barrel. Benchmark crude Brent had plunged sharply to $19.33 per barrel on April 21, 2020. “Now that crude prices have jumped by over 200%, they should restore the supply immediately. India has already raised this issue at an international forum on Wednesday,” he said. Brent crude was at $64.34 a barrel on that day (February 17, 2021) and it closed at $62.91 per barrel on Friday.Addressing the 11th The International Energy Agency (IEA)-International Energy Forum (IEF)-OPEC Outlook Symposium on February 17, petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan asked producers to ease the supply situation and salvage oil-consuming countries from an unprecedented jump in fuel prices.“The key producing countries have not only revised the production cuts over and above the previously announced levels, but also added additional voluntary cuts. I had supported the joint decision by major oil-producing countries to cut oil production in April last year... Time has come once again for allowing the collective interests of both producing and consuming countries to be promoted,” Pradhan said.SC Sharma, an energy expert and former officer on special duty at the erstwhile Planning Commission, said restricted supplies and production cuts by oil exporting countries are some of the major reasons for high oil prices. “It is believed that a gradual production increase was part of the agenda with 0.5 million barrels per day in the 4th January 2021 meeting of OPEC. However, subsequent to the meeting, Saudi Arabia announced 1 million barrels per day of voluntary oil production cuts,” he said. “There is a need to join hands with major oil importing nations such as China, India, Japan and Korea to look for a workable solution so that economic recoveries are smooth with adequate supply of oil by OPEC+ countries,” he added.The officials mentioned above said India can resume supply of cheaper oil from Iran from a virtual zero since 2019, and also augment imports from Venezuela. “The import curbs were imposed under pressure from the Trump government. Now, either the US will help to mitigate our energy crisis or we will act in the interest of our nation,” a second official said.Iran is expected to be the biggest beneficiary of change in the presidency that could not only help India to start its oil imports from Iran, but also boost its exports to Tehran.India, which imports more than 80% of the crude it processes, imported about 23.5 million tonne of Iranian crude, nearly a 10th of its requirement, in 2018-19 on lucrative terms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-may-turn-to-iran-venezuela-for-oil-imports-101613942885314.html
22-02-2021||India||‘Nothing short of extortion’: Sonia to PM||Congress president Sonia Gandhi took on the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government over the fuel price hike issue on Sunday, as the chorus against costlier petrol and diesel grew across the country. In a sharply worded letter, Gandhi expressed her “anguish & deep distress regarding the spiralling fuel & gas prices”.“On one hand, India is witnessing systematic erosion of jobs, wages and household income. The middle class and those at the margins of our society are struggling. These challenges have been compounded by run-away inflation and an unprecedented rise in prices of almost all household items and essential commodities,” Gandhi said in a letter to the PM.For over 10 days, the prices of petrol and diesel have been increasing. In Mumbai, petrol is at an all-time high of ₹97 a litre, while diesel crossed the ₹88 mark. This is the second time Gandhi has launched a salvo against the government regarding the steep spike in fuel prices. On January 7, she slammed the government for trying to offset the losses incurred by it during the Covid-19 crisis. “Today, the crude oil price is $50.96 per barrel. That is barely ₹23.43 per litre. Still, diesel is priced at ₹74.38, while petrol costs ₹84.30,” Gandhi had said. “In the last 73 years, fuel has never been more expensive.”Also Read | 'Govts elected to ease burden of people': Sonia Gandhi to PM on fuel price hikeAgain on Sunday, Gandhi attacked the government for “profiteering off of people’s misery & suffering” by raising the price of fuel despite crude oil prices being lower than those during the UPA regime.“Fuel prices are at an historic and unsustainable high. In fact, petrol has breached the ₹100/litre mark in many parts of the country. The surging price of diesel has added to the escalating woes of millions of farmers. What baffles most citizens, is that these prices have been increased despite moderate prices of international crude oil. To put it in context, the crude oil price is nearly half of what it was during the UPA Government’s tenure. Therefore, your Government’s act of raising prices (continuously for 12 days till February 20th) is little less than a brazen act of profiteering,” Gandhi said. She added that the government had increased excise duty on diesel by 820% and on petrol by 258%.“Your Government has been unreasonably over-zealous in levying excessive excise duty on Petrol and Diesel, i.e., ₹33 on every litre of Petrol and ₹32 on every litre of Diesel, which is higher than the base price of these fuels,” she said.“This is nothing short of extortion to cover up economic mismanagement. As the principal party in opposition, I urge upon you to follow ‘Raj Dharma’ and reduce fuel prices by partially rolling back excise duty,” Gandhi added.The government has defended the price hike saying that the international market has reduced fuel production leading to the spike in rates.“There are two main reasons behind the fuel price rise. International market has reduced fuel production and manufacturing countries are producing less fuel to gain more profit. This is making the consumer countries suffer,” petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nothing-short-of-extortion-sonia-to-pm-101613942340500.html
22-02-2021||India||States asked to step up testing||The Union health ministry on Sunday directed all states that have seen a resurgence of new Covid-19 infections to again step up vigilance against the disease by scaling up testing, using more gold-standard RT-PCR tests, reinforcing strict containment strategies and closely monitoring for mutant strains.The direction comes at a time when states such as Maharashtra have seen a clear second wave of infections rising over the past fortnight, forcing the reintroduction of social curbs such as lockdowns amid fears of mutant strains gaining ground. The states have also been asked to focus on better clinical management of patients in districts reporting high deaths.Other than Maharashtra, regions such as Punjab, Haryana and Jammu & Kashmir, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh are all experiencing what appears to be the start of a second Covid wave. The first wave, meanwhile, continues unabated in Kerala.Also Read | 4,070 new Covid-19 cases, 15 deaths recorded in KeralaMaharashtra and Kerala, by themselves, have been responsible for more than 75% of all new cases reported in the country in the past week. Pushed by these two, the seven-day average of daily cases across the country, which dropped to 10,988 for the week ending February 11, has again started rising — it stands at 12,387 in the past week.In light of this resurgence, states have been directed not only to increase the number of tests but also raise the proportion of the more reliable RT-PCR tests. In fact, the states have been told to verify all the negative rapid antigen tests using an RT-PCR test. “All negative rapid antigen test results to be mandatorily followed by RT-PCR test and no such negative persons are to be missed,” the ministry said in a release.RT-PCR is a molecular test that works by amplifying the genetic material of the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 to detect it in a patient’s swab samples. The rapid antigen tests on the other hand works by detecting broken-down proteins present on a nasal swab sample. The latter, therefore, can miss the virus if it is present in trace amounts or if the swab missed the virus during sampling. In other words, if a person tests positive in a rapid antigen test, they certainly have the infection, but the test can miss as much as 50% of positive cases by throwing up false negatives.The states have also been asked to focus on genomic sequencing to detect any mutant strains.With worries of the UK variant of the Sars-CoV-2 virus coming to India – and now the Brazilian and South African variant – the government set up a genomic sequencing consortium to sequence up to 5% of the total positive samples in the country to detect new imported as well as indigenous variants.With over 10 million cases of Covid-19 in India, experts believe that new variants of Sars-Cov-2 may emerge in the country due to selection pressure which is put on the virus with so many individuals being already infected.“For a new variant to emerge two things are needed – one, mutations that happen naturally as errors are made when the viral genome is being replicated; two, the mutations offering a selective advantage to the virus such as higher transmission, better binding to the receptor, or evading an existing immune response. So, as more and more people get infected and develop immunity to the virus, its virulence (severity of disease) will likely go down but it will increase the selective pressure on the virus to mutate,” said Dr Shahid Jameel, director of Trivedi School of Biosciences at Ashoka University and former CEO of Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance in a webinar earlier this week.In Maharashtra, the state that saw the highest increase, the weekly positivity rate – proportion of samples that return positive among the total tested – also went up from 4.7% to 8%.Experts believe the spread of the infection to be under control when a positivity rate of 5% or less is maintained over two weeks. There are five states and union territories in the country that have a positivity rate higher than the national average of 1.79%.Topping the list is Maharashtra with 8.1%, followed by Kerala with 7.9%, then Andhra Pradesh with 3.3%, Goa with 3%, and Chandigarh with 1.8%.The highest increase in the weekly number of cases was noted in Akola (55%), Yavatmal (48%), and Amravati (47%), according to data shared by the Union health ministry. On Sunday, the Maharashtra government announced week-long hard lockdown in state’s Amravati district from Monday in order to contain the rising infections. In Pune, the district administration announced the closure of all schools and coaching institutions on Sunday.An increase of 19% in the weekly number of cases was also seen in the Mumbai Suburban area.“There is a need to study the new infections that are being reported from Maharashtra, where a high proportion of people are likely to have been exposed already. We need to see whether the infections are happening in people who haven’t had it earlier or are these re-infections. Everyone should be asked about their history of the infection,” said Dr T Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College-Vellore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-asked-to-step-up-testing-101613941246658.html
22-02-2021||India||India, China to fix pending LAC issues in 'steady manner', says joint statement||At a marathon 16-hour meeting between senior commanders on Saturday, the Indian and Chinese armies agreed to resolve outstanding issues at friction points on the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in a “steady and orderly” manner; the parties were unanimous that the Pangong Tso disengagement provided “a good basis” for resolving pending problems and decided to take forward the military dialogue to stabilise the ground situation in eastern Ladakh, said a joint statement issued in New Delhi and Beijing on Sunday.The two sides said they had a “candid and in-depth exchange of views” on the outstanding issues in the Ladakh sector during the tenth round of military talks held at Moldo on the Chinese side of the LAC at which both sides agreed to push for a “mutually acceptable resolution” of the remaining issues “in a steady and orderly manner,” the statement said. But the statement made no mention of the issues that are still to be resolved to ease tensions along the LAC.The corps commander-ranked officers of the two armies on Saturday discussed the roadmap for further disengagement of their troops at friction points on the LAC, with the talks taking place after the completion of the first round of disengagement in the Pangong Tso sector.The talks began at 10 am on Saturday and went on till 2 am on Sunday. Outstanding problems with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) at Depsang, Hot Springs and Gogra - friction points on the LAC - were discussed during the talks.“The two sides agreed to follow the important consensus of their state leaders, continue their communication and dialogue, stabilise and control the situation on the ground, (and) push for a mutually acceptable resolution of the remaining issues…, so as to jointly maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas,” the statement said.India and China were of the view that the successful completion of disengagement in the Pangong Tso sector would help them make progress in other areas too. “The two sides positively appraised the smooth completion of disengagement of frontline troops in the Pangong Lake area, noting that it was a significant step forward that provided a good basis for resolution of other remaining issues,” the statement added.The proposals discussed during the talks to normalise the border situation will be put up by both sides before their higher authorities in order to finalise the future course of disengagement, said people familiar with the process, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Disengagement at Gogra and Hot Springs will be easier to pursue than resolving the problems at Depsang, said an official cited above. He added that some issues in Demchok also needed to be sorted out but that would not be complicated.The tone of the joint statement is positive, but it also indicates that a quick resolution of outstanding issues may not be possible, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd).“Depsang, in particular, is tricky because of its strategic value and the vast difference in the LAC perception of the two sides. Hopefully, the success of Pangong Tso can provide an impetus to resolving issues in other areas though we should be patient. Meanwhile, declarations of victory or defeat should be avoided as it can complicate discussions on the ground,” Hooda said.PLA’s deployments in Depsang have hindered access of Indian soldiers to Patrolling Points (PP) 10, 11, 11-A, 12 and 13, as previously reported by Hindustan Times.The Indian Army’s patrolling activity has also been affected in Gogra and Hot Springs, where rival troops are forward deployed and where skeletal disengagement took place last year, but the gains could not be consolidated.The India-China border standoff began last May and saw both sides deploy 50,000 troops each in the Ladakh theatre along with advanced weaponry.The Pangong disengagement took place on strategic heights on both banks of the lake, and saw the two armies pull back their frontline troops, tanks, infantry combat vehicles (ICVs) and artillery guns under an agreement reached earlier this month.The disengagement will be phased, coordinated and verified at all friction points. The first round of disengagement at Pangong Tso involved pulling back troops deployed eyeball-to-eyeball on the Finger 4 ridgeline at heights of almost 18,000 feet as well as withdrawing soldiers holding positions on the Kailash range on the south bank.On the north bank, PLA retreated to its base east of Finger 8, while the Indian Army moved back to its position near Finger 3. Under the disengagement agreement, neither side will patrol the contested areas between Fingers 4 and 8 until an agreement is reached through future talks.India’s bold moves on the south bank of Pangong Tso last August boosted the army’s bargaining power during military talks and eventually led to an agreement on disengagement. The Indian Army occupied a series of heights to prevent the PLA from grabbing Indian territory on the south bank in a stealthy midnight move on August 29, 2020.The Indian Army followed this up by rushing its front-line tanks and ICVs to strategic heights held by its soldiers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiachina-military-talks-end-next-round-of-ladakh-deescalation-discussed-101613916091198.html
22-02-2021||India||Why are prices of petrol and diesel increasing? Petroleum minister explains||India has urged the OPEC (Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) and OPEC plus countries to not go for a production cut as that is impacting the fuel price in India, Union petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Sunday."There are two main reasons behind the fuel price rise. International market has reduced fuel production and manufacturing countries are producing less fuel to gain more profit. This is making the consumer countries suffer," the minister said.West Bengal govt reduces tax by Re 1 per litre on petrol, dieselIn April last year, India had supported the decision of the major oil-producing countries to cut production as there was a sharp fall in demand amid Covid-19 pandemic.Also Watch | How to control soaring petrol & diesel prices? Nirmala Sitharaman answersFor over 10 days, the prices of petrol and diesel are increasing. In Mumbai, petrol is at an all-time high of ₹97 per litre, while diesel rate crossed ₹88-mark.Congress and other opposition parties have been protesting against the Centre for the rising fuel prices while the Centre has said it alone has little role behind the astronomical rise in the price. "It’s a very vexatious issue in which no answer except for reducing the price (of fuel) will convince anyone. I know I am trading on an area where whatever I may say to bring the reality into picture will only sound like I’m obfuscating, I’m avoiding the answer, I am shifting the blame…," finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Saturday.Two poll-bound states, Assam and West Bengal, have cut fuel prices by lowering the taxes that state governments levy on fuel prices. The Assam government has reduced the prices of petrol and diesel by ₹5 per litre. The West Bengal government on Sunday announced a reduction of tax by ₹1 per litre on petrol and diesel.Recently in Parliament, the minister said that blaming the Centre for the price rise is wrong as states too have increased VAT on fuel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fuel-price-rise-have-urged-opec-countries-says-minister-dharmendra-pradhan-101613908773297.html
