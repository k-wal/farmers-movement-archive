But before that a fake website has surfaced, the Centre alerted on Saturday asking people to follow only the ministry's official handle on social media platforms for further update.A website 'https://t.co/OgopT8KLTf' is impersonating the official #CoWIN website & is asking users to register for #COVID19 vaccination using mobile number.#PIBFactCheck: This is a FAKE website. Follow @MoHFW_INDIA for official information related to Covid vaccination drive. pic.twitter.com/Ul4DDCiI4RThis is not the first time that fraudulent attempts have been made to tamper with the ongoing vaccination process. But as in the first phase, registration was internal, there was limited scope. Now, the registration going public, people will have to exercise extra caution against middlemen, fake site links, apps etc.Starting from March 1, senior citizens and people between the age group of 45 and 59 with comorbidities will get vaccinated. To ramp up the process, the government has included private hospitals in this phase where vaccine shots will be given to these priority groups at ₹250.The government has ruled out the possibility of private hospitals charging random prices for vaccines by capping the fee at maximum ₹250 per dose, which includes their service charge. It has also published the list of private hospitals which are part of the process. A list of co-morbidities has also been released by the Centre.Apart from Co-Win registration, there will options for on-site registration in this phase where prospective beneficiaries can walk into identified Covid-19 vaccination centres and get themselves registered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fake-co-win-site-surfaces-as-centre-is-all-set-to-open-registration-for-vaccines-101614445311878.html

He also assured that charges for testing will soon be significantly reduced, thereby bringing down the compliance cost of the industry.Goyal urged the industry to focus on improving quality of their products, of component suppliers and meet quality standards, as this is the only way the cultural mindset will become quality conscious and we can engage with the world. He said India as a manufacturer of products will have to provide quality products. “The moment we start making good quality, we will naturally become a player in international trade. It is only the quality culture which will help us to engage with the world and help us to expand our own contribution to resilient supply chains & future businesses," Goyal said.Observing that the Quality Council of India ran a sample test on a variety of Indian & imported toys, he said the toys were found to be unsafe and were of poor quality."This was the origin of the quality control order. I have taken it upon myself to upgrade the quality of Indian products in every sphere. We have to get quality as a defining feature in every work we do in India," Goyal said.He said that under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, this government will work to change the present situation of 85 per cent imports and 15 per cent indigenous production of toys and turn it around 360 degrees.Speaking on the occasion, the Minister of Textiles and Women and Child Development Smriti Irani expressed happiness that The India Toy Fair 2021 inaugurated by the Prime Minister, has received such an overwhelming response, with over 21 lakh registrations, and a large number of exhibitors.Calling upon reimagining Indian toys, she said that they should reflect Indian legacy, heroes and landmarks. Emphasizing on toys' role as a learning tool, Irani said that the industry should make in India for the global market. She said that India itself is a big Toy market and the Indian Toy industry has a bright future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/actively-pursuing-airbus-to-begin-manufacturing-in-india-piyush-goyal-101614444255105.html

The provision for the same has been there since 2009. The authority to exercise this provision has only been brought under the ambit of the ministry of information and broadcasting from the ministry of electronics and IT in the recently released guideline — Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code Rules, 2021."It is reiterated - no change in provision has been made nor any new provision has been added on blocking of content under Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021," the I&B ministry said in a statement in the wake of "certain misgivings".This week, the government has unveiled a set of new guidelines going by which As per the new guidelines, social media platforms are required to disclose the first originator of a mischievous tweet or message if they are asked by the government. They are also required to submit a compliance report every month.The social media rules have drawn huge criticism from opposition leaders. Maharashtra IT minister Satej Patil on Saturday said the rules are dictatorial and a threat to democracy. "This move by the Centre needs to be fought tooth and nail. Such dictatorial regulations will not be accepted by the people of this democratic country," he said.In India, there are 53 crore WhatsApp users, 44.8 crore YouTube users, 41 crore Facebook users, 21 crore Instagram users and 1.75 crore Twitter users. The rules have been brought to check the "increasing instances of misuse of social media by criminals, anti-national elements", the government said.However, several false claims are doing rounds after the rules were announced, the government said, busting them one at a time.#ClaimAll social media accounts need to be verified with a Government ID through mobile phones within 3 months.#PIBFactCheckThis claim is Misleading. Verification of accounts is not mandatory.#Conclusion MisleadingRead here- https://t.co/aQr6PDlePs pic.twitter.com/vPaqQqasqoAccording to one fake claim, all social media accounts need to verify with a government ID through mobile phones within 3 months.

27-02-2021||India||'Retired from Rajya Sabha not politics, will continue my fight for JK statehood': Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad||Asserting that he had retired only from Rajya Sabha and not politics, Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad Saturday expressed a resolve to continue his fight for the restoration of Jammu and Kashmir's statehood and its residents' special rights over jobs and land.The former chief minister also stressed the importance of unity among the residents of the Union Territory to fight the threats from China and Pakistan and said "we need to stand with our forces against the enemies".Ghulam Nabi Azad retired from the Upper House on February 15."I have retired from Rajya Sabha but not from politics. This is not for the first time that I retired from parliament. Till my last breath, I will continue my services for the nation and will continue my fight for the rights of people," Azad told a 'Shanti Sammelan' organised by the Gandhi Global family here.He was joined by senior party leaders including Kapil Sibal, Manish Tewari, former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Raj Babbar and Anand Sharma.In an apparent reference to the August 5, 2019 development when the Centre revoked J&K's special status and split it into two Union Territories, he said, "We have lost our identity but we will not give up and continue our fight for the restoration of the statehood within and outside parliament.""We want representatives of the people of all the three regions of erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir - Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh - to form the government. Leh supported the UT status but Kargil is against it. Every party in Jammu - from BJP to RSS and National Conference to PDP and Panthers Party wants statehood back," he said."It is the voice of the people and I challenge anyone to come out with a statement that they do not want the restoration of statehood to J&K," he said.He also said he will continue his fight for the locals’ rights over land and jobs."Jammu and Leh face the immediate threat if outsiders start settling in J&K and Ladakh. We are not against the people coming from outside to get jobs here, but in Jammu and Kashmir, resources are limited as we do not have any big industry here," Azad said.In politics, he said the fight continues to ensure that the people get their rights."Jammu and Kashmir shares its border with China and Pakistan and the enemy is very active unlike any other part of the country. We had many wars in the past but the rift has not ended till date. It is our responsibility that we maintain harmony, peace, love and fight the enemy together," he said, adding it is possible when "we are united and did not fall prey to those who are doing the politics of division".He said every party has a right to come to the power but doing the politics of religion is not good for the country."You need to take everyone along as was done by Congress in the past. The Congress could not have achieved freedom for the country, had it not welcomed everyone from every region, religion and every community including educated people, farmers, traders and labourers, irrespective of their caste and creed," he said.He said the Congress learnt from former prime minister Indira Gandhi that border residents are brave people who fight the enemy alongside the forces and need to be given a special attention."We salute our forces for their bravery in the face of challenges from Pakistan and China. We support them and stand with them against the enemy," he said."World leaders like US president Joe Biden makes a reference to Kashmir soon after taking over. They do not talk about any other place of the country but we have now lost our identity and have to fight for its restoration," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ghulam-nabi-azad-says-will-continue-my-fight-for-j-k-statehood-101614439849379.html

The five-aircraft formation consisted of Mirage 2000s and Sukhoi-30 fighters.#WATCH: IAF carried out a long-range precision strike against a practice target to mark the second anniversary of the Balakot Operations. The strike was carried out by members of the same Sqn who carried out the actual operations. pic.twitter.com/CPMhfQZaZt"The IAF chief flew with pilots from the squadrons that were part of the operations. When the head of the force flies, it shows that our commanders lead from the front. It also signifies that the IAF is proud of the professionalism and combat training status of its cutting-edge fleets," said Air Marshal Anil Chopra (retd), director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.Two years ago, the Indian Airforce crossed the border in the disputed region of Kashmir and dropped bombs to destroy a Jaish-e-Mohammed camp in Pakistan's Balakot. The target camp was some 80 kilometers away from the Line of Control (LoC). The strike was in response to a suicide attack by JeM terrorists  in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district just days before. As many as 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) troopers were killed in the attack. The attack that pushed India and Pakistan to the brink of war was carried out on February 14, 2019. After the attack, an aerial engagement between the two countries took place in which Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, flying an upgraded MiG-21 Bison, had fought and shot down one of the Pakistani fighter jets before he was hit and forced to eject. Pakistan returned him to India on March 1 after holding him captive for almost 60 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/squadron-that-carried-out-balakot-op-make-long-range-practice-strike-101614437454149.html

The five-aircraft formation consisted of Mirage 2000s and Sukhoi-30 fighters.Watch: IAF jets destroy long-range target to mark 2 yrs of Balakot strikeThe IAF’s Mirage 2000s hit three targets in Balakot with five Israeli-origin Spice 2000 bombs with penetrator warheads that allowed them to pierce through the rooftops before exploding inside to cause maximum damage. While the actual bombing was carried out by the Mirages, Su-30s were part of the IAF’s strike package that day.The IAF chief flying the Mirage 2000 with the squadron that carried out the operations is a reaffirmation of the success of the mission at the highest level, said Air Marshal Anil Chopra (retd), director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.“When the head of the force flies solo, it shows that our commanders lead from the front. It also signifies that the IAF is proud of the professionalism and combat training status of its cutting-edge fleets,” Chopra said.IAF on Tuesday also released a video of a precision strike carried out by Mirage 2000s against a dummy target in Rajasthan to mark the second anniversary of the cross-border air strikes. “The strike was carried out by members of the squadron that carried out the actual operations,” the official said. The fighter jets dropped Spice 2000 bombs on the practice target.“The Spice 2000 live mission by the squadron clearly sends a message that the IAF's sword blade remains sharp, and ready to penalise a belligerent adversary,” Chopra added.Each bomb that hit the JeM targets carried around 80 kg of explosives in a 900-kg steel casing, with the explosion caused by time-delay fuses sending a lethal quantity of shrapnel that instantly killed the occupants. The bombs hit their targets in a vertical attack angle, leaving holes measuring 80 to 90 cm in diameter on the rooftops of the structures, as previously reported by Hindustan Times.The air strikes against the terror base were in response to the Pakistan-backed Pulwama suicide car bomb attack in which 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were killed on February 14, 2019.Also Read: A rare phone call, secret letter: How India got Pak to release IAF’s AbhinandanPakistan Air Force fighters made a failed attempt to bomb Indian military installations on February 27, leading to an aerial engagement along the Line of Control during which Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman scripted military aviation history by downing an F-16, seconds before his own MiG-21 Bison was hit by a missile forcing him to eject.

27-02-2021||India||Congress getting weak, says Kapil Sibal at G-23 meet in Jammu||Congress leader Kapil Sibal said Saturday that the party is "getting weak" and that it needed the services of Ghulam Nabi Azad who recently retired from the Rajya Sabha to strengthen it.At a public event in Jammu, Sibal, who shared a stage with other members of G-23 - senior leaders who had written an open letter to party president Sonia Gandhi demanding sweeping changes in the Congress, said there is an urgent need to boost the party.“This is an occasion and podium to speak truth and the truth is that Congress is getting weak and therefore we have assembled here to make it strong together,” Sibal said.He went to say that Azad is indispensable for the revival of the Congress.“Now, what is the real role of Ghulam Nabi Azad… we need an experienced pilot to fly a plane and an engineer to fix any technical snag. Azad is an experienced pilot and an engineer too. Why am I saying this because he knows the reality of the Congress in every state and district. And, when we realized that Azad is being freed from Parliament we felt sad. We never wanted him to be freed from Parliament”.“He knows all the leaders personally. All the leaders used to meet at his residence. It can only be done by an experienced leader. I fail to understand why Congress is not using his experience.”Sibal said that they want the party to be strengthened in every state and every village because if the Congress weakens then the country will be weakened too.The Congress leader also took a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying, “Today the problem India confronts that she has a rajneta (leader) whose sole ambition is to empower his party and not the people of the country.”Manish Tiwari, Anand Sharma, Bhupinder Hooda, Raj Babbar and Vivek Tankha were among others who attended the Shanti Sammelan.Azad, who turned nostalgic in his speech as he traced his association with the Congress, also attacked the BJP government for dividing and the downgrading the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories on August 5, 2019.“One and a half years ago we were dismembered... the state was shredded into pieces and today we are being divided in the name of religion and regions,” he said.Azad said that world leaders from US, UK , Africa, Australia, China, Canada are more familiar with Kashmir than any other Indian state.“Even the new US president Joe Biden talked about Kashmir.. so there is not a single leader who doesn’t know about Kashmir but today we have been reduced into a UT,” he said.“But we will keep fighting for statehood in the Parliament and outside till we get it,” he asserted.He also criticized the BJP government for imposing all sorts of taxes on the people of Jammu and Kashmir.“While there are no jobs, development and unemployment is at its peak, the government has burdened the people with a slew of taxes,” he said.Amid a euphoric audience, Azad said, “I have retired from Rajya Sabha but not from politics and I haven’t retired from the Parliament for the first time. I dive here and emerge there and I emerge here and dive there. So, there is no need to lose heart.”Other Congress leaders Anand Sharma, Manish Tiwari, Bhupinder Hooda, Raj Babbar and Vivek Tankha also addressed the rally.Anand Sharma said that for the first time since the 1950s, Jammu and Kashmir does not have a representative in the Rajya Sabha but it will be “corrected” soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-getting-weak-says-kapil-sibal-at-g-23-meet-in-jammu-101614434344712.html

For the fourth consecutive day on Saturday, the state reported over 8,000 fresh infections. With 8,623 new cases and 3,638 recoveries, the Covid-19 curve of the state remains at a critical juncture. Mumbai, on the other hand, reported a dip for the first time in the past few days as with 987 cases, its daily toll fall below 1,000.On Friday, the state reported 8,333 fresh cases while Mumbai's addition to it was 1,035. On Thursday, the state reported 8,702 fresh cases out of which 1,145 were in Mumbai.Maharashtra districts are already on their guards as Amravati extended its ongoing lockdown for another week on Saturday. Lockdown has also been extended in Akola, Akot, Murjitnagar. Latur is observing voluntary Janata lockdown this weekend to contain the spread of the infections.The spurt in the number of cases began in the second week of February, which is being seen as a result of general laxity, mutation of Covid-19 strains and unlocking. Restrictions have been imposed in the districts while surveillance has been strengthened in Mumbai. As the 11 districts of the Vidarbha region have become epicentres of what is being called the second wave of infection in the state, other districts have isolated this region by imposing travel restrictions. Washim in the Aurangabad division has emerged as a hotbed of infections after 229 schools students and three staff members were found positive at a hostel in the district. The priest and 18 other staff of Washim's Poharadevi temple also tested positive on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-sees-spike-of-8-623-fresh-covid-19-cases-mumbai-cases-drop-to-987-101614434836890.html

The Speaker said he will give details about the case after reaching Shimla on Monday.Earlier on Saturday, Assembly Secretary Yash Paul Sharma had told PTI that the Speaker has submitted a formal complaint to DGP Sanjay Kundu for registering an FIR against the Congress legislators.Meanwhile, police did not give any details about the case with the DGP saying as the Assembly session in progress, they can inform about it only to the Speaker.The alleged incident had taken place outside the Speaker's office on Friday when the Governor was leaving for the Raj Bhavan after he cut short his address in the House following a ruckus created by the Congress on the opening day of the Budget session.After the incident, the Speaker suspended Leader of Opposition Mukesh Agnihotri and four other Congress MLAs Harsh Vardhan Chauhan, Satpal Raizada, Sunder Singh and Vinay Kuma for the entire Budget session till March 20 on a motion moved by Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Bhardwaj.Speaker Vipin Parmar had said the Opposition members hit on the Governor's back with copies of his address. They also hit the bonnet of the Governor's car, the Speaker had said.Commenting over the issue, suspended Congress MLA Harsh Vardhan Chauhan had told PTI on Friday that they were waiting outside the Speaker’s office and just wanted to ask the Governor why he cut short his address but they were not allowed to do so.He alleged that it was Deputy Speaker Hans Raj who manhandled the MLAs, a charge denied by Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Bhardwaj, who said the Congress legislators had planned to create a scene.Chauhan also said they did not have any intention of manhandling the governor."If any FIR is registered against us, we will not go to the court for bail, rather we will prefer to be arrested," he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hp-speaker-lodges-complaint-against-cong-mlas-for-manhandling-guv-101614429663724.html
27-02-2021||India||Education Minister says other countries want to implement India's NEP||Topmost institutes as well as various countries have hailed India's National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 as the world's "biggest reform" and shown interest in implementing it, said Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal "Nishank" on Saturday.The minister, who was addressing the 97th annual convocation of Delhi University, said the new education policy that has been brought into place after "much deliberation" will see India "reform, perform and transform".He also praised the policy calling it "impactful, interactive, innovative and inclusive" built on the cornerstone of "equity, quality and access"."Cambridge, the UAE, Australia, Mauritius, Indonesia, .. and many others have said India's NEP is the world's biggest reform and that they want to implement in their countries as well. It is both national and international, supports 'vocal for local' and also local for global. This will bring a new set of opportunities for students," said Nishank, encouraging Delhi University to be the "flag-bearer" of the policy and implement it in "mission-mode".The NEP, approved by the Union Cabinet, replaces the 34-year-old National Policy on Education framed in 1986. It is aimed at paving the way for transformational reforms in school and higher education systems to make India a global knowledge superpower.The 61-year-old leader here also counted on the various achievements of India's education system during the pandemic year. Like how it worked tirelessly in implementing "digital education", transformed homes into schools and didn't let the year go waste for India's 33 crore students -- more than the total population of the USA.To give an idea of how herculean the task was, the minister even shared the data on the size of Indian education system: "1,000 universities", "50,000 degree colleges", "15 lakh schools" and "1.10 crore teachers"."We conducted the exams on time, the results were out on time, and also JEE or NEET -- world's biggest examination in the corona era -- were conducted successfully. Also, we provided online education to 33 crore students. This was huge, something that you don't even think of in your dreams, but we did it and did it successfully," he noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/education-minister-says-other-countries-want-to-implement-india-s-nep-101614434350303.html

27-02-2021||India||Are Mumbai locals responsible for Covid-19 spike? Here's what BMC data reveals||The sudden spike in the number of daily infections in Mumbai has been partially attributed to the resumption of suburban train services for the general public. Though no direct link between the two has been scientifically proven, data from Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation shows the sudden spike in daily cases started from February 10 with ups and downs in between. From February 17, the cases are on a steady rise. The number of Covid-19 cases in Panvel, Navi Mumbai, Thane — areas which are covered by Mumbai locals — has increased as well.According to BMC data, the number of single-day cases remained around 400 in the first week of February, with one exception on February 3, when the number of cases rose to 503.Maharashtra govt may restrict train travel for general public again in MumbaiHere is how the Covid-19 numbers were in the first week of February in MumbaiFebruary 1: 328February 2: 334February 3: 503February 4: 463February 5: 415February 6: 414February 7: 448In the second week, a spike was reported on February 10, when the city reported 558 cases, the highest so far in February. On February 14, a spike of 645 cases was reported.February 8: 399February 9: 375February 10: 558February 11: 510February 12: 599February 13: 529February 14: 645In the third week, the number was stable initially, but from February 17, a steep rise has been noticed.February 15: 493February 16: 461February 17: 721February 18: 736February 19: 823February 20: 897February 21: 921After reporting 760 and 643 cases on February 22 and 23, respectively, cases saw a huge jump and crossed the 1,000-mark. On February 24, 25, and 26, cases remained at 1,167, 1,145, and 1,034, respectively.The state government allowed the general public to travel in suburban trains in non-peak hours excluding 9am to 12 pm and 4pm to 9pm from February 1. This resulted in around 3.3 million passengers travelling every day on three lines in local train services.In January, Mumbai locals were restricted to essential and emergency staff, teachers, lawyers and women travellers.However, the resumption of Mumbai locals is not the only reason behind the spike as the spike is noticeable across the state, not only to where suburban rails ply. Relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar that the state government was thinking of rescheduling the train timing in the wake of the rising cases. “We will not completely restrict the general public from commuting on the train, but will reschedule the timings,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/is-mumbai-s-covid-19-spike-linked-to-mumbai-locals-here-s-what-bmc-data-reveals-101614433162169.html
27-02-2021||India||Central govt should cut its tax on fuel, says Tamil Nadu govt||The Centre should come forward to reduce its tax on petroleum products since the resources for State's own tax revenue is meagre, Tamil Nadu Deputy Chief Minister O Panneerselvam told the Assembly on Saturday. Panneerselvam, pointing to accusations by the main opposition DMK over the interim budget (2021-22), said a flawed view, holding the state government responsible for the petrol and diesel price rise, was being propagated. "There is no iota of truth in such a view," he said replying to the general discussion on budget.Referring to aspects like global economic cyclical changes vis-a-vis the coronavirus pandemic, he said the state government last year modified the system of taxation on petrol and diesel anticipating abnormal changes in prices of petroleum products. "If the old system had been followed there may have been a scope for the state government to get more revenue during price rise. However, to guard the people from price rise, the government changed the taxation system," Panneerselvam, who holds the finance portfolio, said. The ad valorem tax was brought to 15 per cent from 24 per cent in addition to a specific tax of ₹13.02 per litre last year, he noted. For diesel, ad valorem tax was fixed at 11 per cent from the previous 25 per cent plus ₹9.62 per litre and the modified system was in vogue from May 4, 2020, he said. To protect its tax revenue from petrol and diesel notwithstanding a fall in global crude prices the Central government increased excise duty several times, he said. However, there was no change in tax system in Tamil Nadu from 2011 to 2017. "Additional cess and surcharges are being levied by the Central government," he said, adding, state taxes alone were not the reason behind the increase in fuel prices. In view of the Centre's additional cess and surcharges, the revenue to the state government has also been hit, he said. While the Centre's excise duty mop-up increased 48 per cent during April-November 2020, the Tamil Nadu's government's excise revenue share slid by 39.40 per cent, he said. "We are duty bound to urge the Central government to come forward to reduce its tax on petroleum products as the resources for State's own tax revenue is meagre," he said. Amid an outcry over record high petrol and diesel prices, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had recently said the Centre and state governments would have to together work out a mechanism to bring retail rates to reasonable levels. Targeting DMK, the Deputy CM said members of the main opposition used to stage walkout after chatting in the House briefly and they had never respected their democratic duty of taking part in House proceedings. Panneerselvam said, "DMK deputy leader Duraimurugan has said tdhat they would come to the House only after M K Stalin assumes office as the Chief Minister." "Stalin is not going to become the Chief Minister and DMK men are never going to visit the Assembly. They would face defeat in Assembly polls," he added.Tamil Nadu would go to polls on April 6 along with Puducherry and Kerala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/new-covid-19-clusters-have-emerged-in-bengaluru-official-101614432302517.html

27-02-2021||India||Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot attack Centre for 'stubborn stand' on farm laws||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot and his former deputy Sachin Pilot on Saturday shared a helicopter ride for the first time in more than a year as they flew to address two Kisan Mahapanchayat at Shri Dungargarh in Bikaner and Matrikundiya in Chittorgarh where they attacked the Centre for its stand on the contentious farm laws.The two leaders tried to present a united face ahead of the assembly bypolls in four seats in the state. In at least two of these seats, the Gujjars have a significant presence, making it difficult for the Congress to sideline Pilot anymore.During Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s two-day visit to Rajasthan on February 12 and 13, PCC chief Govind Singh Dotasra was given preference at the cost of Pilot in a series of political rallies held then.“The Central government is stubborn and is not ready to listen to the farmers who are sitting on protest in extreme weather conditions for the last 90-days,” said Gehlot in Shri Dungargarh.“Journalist, activists are being arrested. A 21-years-old girl was arrested from Bengaluru. We have seen many governments, but this is happening for the first time. Governments are not meant to be stubborn,” he said.The chief minister said his government has brought a bill to counter the three farms laws passed by the Centre, but they are still awaiting the governor’s consent.“One can understand how much pressure he must be under. The Centre can easily resolve the farmers issue by taking back the new laws. How can this government sleep? The Centre should bring new laws. We are with the farmers and in the recently announced state budget we announced that separate budget for farmers form next year. We announced payments of ₹1000 per month to farmers. We waived farmers’ loan of ₹8,000 crores. Our priority is always the wish of farmers,” Gehlot said.Gehlot also appealed to the people to vote for the development works done by the Congress party. “Your blessings should continuously shower on us. Four bypolls are coming soon. Nobody thought that four MLAs would leave us like that. I can understand what their families and you people must be going through. Late Master Bhanwarlal Meghwal always worked in the interest of the people of Bikaner. If you vote for our victory, then our government will become stronger.”The bypolls are scheduled in Sujangarh, Rajsamand, Sahada and Vallabhgarh where the MLAs died between October 2020 and January 2021.In Matrikundiya, former deputy CM Sachin Pilot said that Congress party was working to create awareness about the farm laws.“Our leader Rahul Gandhi in his meeting with farmers said that the farmers are the spine of our country and they are being attacked through these farm laws. The Centre wants to forcefully impose laws on the farmers. Through these laws the Centre has ended laws on stock limit and wants to give profit to few people,” he said.Pilot added, “The Prime Minister is not ready to listen to the farmers. Our leader Sonia Gandhi had united 24 political parties against the farm laws. They want to shut all the mandis. Through these laws, farmers will become labourers on their own land.”He praised the state budget and asked the people to vote for Congress in the bypolls.“The state budget was very good. The Opposition is left with nothing to say against us. We fought against the state government when we only had 21 MLAs. The Congress is united and together. It is unfortunate that we lost four of our MLAs. Very soon bypolls will be also held. It is our (party workers’) duty to ensure the victory of our candidates in the bypolls,” he said.Pilot also hit out at the BJP government at the Centre over rising fuel prices. “The laws made by the Centre are not only against farmers but also against the common man. The price of petrol is ₹100, cylinder is ₹800 and unemployment is at peak. We need to remain aware," he said.Ajay Maken, Congress leader in-charge of Rajasthan said that the three farm laws are beneficial for few corporations “Before passing any bill, suggestions are taken from the concerned, but these laws were brought without consulting anybody. These laws will end the MSP and mandi system,” he said.Maken added that Congress will continue to fight for the people against the farm laws, rising fuel prices and other issues of public interest.The opposition BJP claimed that the Congress was simply trying to regain losty ground.Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) Rajasthan unitr chief Satish Poonia said, “In the name of farmers, Congress is trying to find its lost ground among the people.”He added that generally it is the perception that the party in power wins the bypolls but the Congress government is afraid that after performing poorly in the panchayat elections it will lose in the assembly bypolls too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ashok-gehlot-and-sachin-pilot-attack-centre-for-stubborn-stand-on-farm-laws-101614430890230.html

Jeevan told AFP.The man was among 16 people organising the cockfight in the village of Lothunur when the freak accident took place, Jeevan said.The rooster was briefly held at the local police station before it was sent to a poultry farm."We are searching for the other 15 people involved in organising the illegal fight," Jeevan said.They could face charges of manslaughter, illegal betting and hosting a cockfight.Cockfights are banned but still common in rural areas of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Odisha states -- particularly around the Hindu festival of Sankranti.Specially-bred roosters have 7.5-centimetre (three-inch) knives or blades tethered to their legs and punters bet on who will win the gruesome fight.Thousands of roosters die each year in the battles which, despite the efforts of animal rights groups, attract large crowds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rooster-kills-owner-with-cockfight-blade-in-telangana-101614430414322.html

Prasad was addressing a function here organised to mark the inauguration of a new building of the Patna High Court by Chief Justice of India S A Bobde, in presence of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, among others. "We can surely criticise the reasoning of a judgement. But, I foresee a new trend which I need to flag today", Prasad said referring to "grossly unfair" comments on social media against judges by those who file PILs and feel aggrieved when the judgement is not favourable. Asserting that the judges of India, be they of the Supreme Court, the High Courts or the district courts must be given the freedom to decide a case as per their knowledge of the law and that though people were free to come up with their own analyses that was critical of a verdict, "trolling" and "agenda setting" were not acceptable. "I had been thinking of making my concerns public. I chose to do so here", said Prasad who also made a mention of having practiced, as a lawyer, at the Patna High Court and his current tenure as the local MP. The Union minister, who also holds the portfolios of Electronics and Telecommunications, also referred to the recently issued guidelines for using social media which was "long overdue". "We are supportive of freedom. We are supportive of criticism. We are supportive of dissent, too. But, the issue is the misuse and abuse of social media. There should be a grievance redressal mechanism for someone who is abused on the social media", he added. The Union Law Minister also spoke of the proposed establishment of All India Judicial Services, "a work in progress", as part of which "the best minds" would be appointed as judges after cracking competitive exams held by the UPSC "under the direction of the Supreme Court. He also said that the government "wished to give proper reservation to SCs, STs and OBCs" which would make the judiciary more "inclusive". Prasad also expressed satisfaction over the judiciary having risen to the challenge posed by the Covid-19 pandemic last year. The total number of cases digitally heard across the country, till January 31, was a staggering 76.38 lakh. Of these 24.55 lakhs were heard at the various High Courts, another 51.83 lakhs at the district courts and 22,353 at the Apex Court. "It is a matter of some assurance and appreciation", he asserted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/comments-against-judges-disturbing-new-trend-law-minister-ravi-shankar-prasad-101614423972519.html

Delhi's law and order situation is in a serious turmoil, I appeal to Hon'ble Home Minister & Lt. Gov to take appropriate action to address the situation," Kejriwal said in a tweet.The chief minister's tweet comes after a 17-year-old boy was beaten up and stabbed for allegedly opposing three boys who were stalking his sister and passing "indecent remarks" on her in southeast Delhi's Kalkaji area. The injured boy, a resident Kalkaji, was taken to AIIMS Trauma Centre, police said.Also read: Minor girl kidnapped from near Kalyanpuri three days ago murdered, body found in Modinagar fieldsIn her statement, the victim's sister said that on Friday, while she was with her brother, three boys followed her and passed indecent remarks on her. When her brother objected to it, they all started beating him and one of them stabbed him in the abdomen and fled the spot, a senior police officer said.In another gruesome crime, the body of a nine-year-old girl, who was kidnapped from east Delhi’s Khichripur three days ago, was found in the sugarcane fields of a village in Modinagar, near Ghaziabad, on Friday morning. The police has said that the autopsy has ruled out sexual assault.Four alleged kidnappers, who live in the same neighbourhood as the girl’s family, have been arrested in connection with the kidnap and murder.The arrested persons were identified by their first names -- Johnny alias Shiva, the key suspect, his cousin Naresh, Kailash and Tarun. “In the kidnapping and murder case of Kalyanpuri, four persons have been arrested and the weapon of the offence has been recovered,” said deputy commissioner of police (east) Deepak Yadav.The girl’s murder also took on a political colour, as one of the wards in the area is going to municipal by-polls on Sunday.Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) legislator from Kalkaji Atishi said, “Despite having CCTV footage, the Delhi Police could not save the missing girl, even though there was heavy police presence in the area when BJP leaders came here to campaign for the municipal by-polls. People of Delhi, especially Dalits, feel unsafe because the Delhi Police is incapable of protecting their lives.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kejriwal-says-delhi-s-law-and-order-situation-in-serious-turmoil-101614424854204.html
27-02-2021||India||Rogue cop arrested for escorting truck carrying methyl alcohol in dry Bihar||The anti-liquor squad of Bihar police on Saturday arrested three persons including a sub inspector on probation from Muzaffarpur for escorting a truck carrying banned methyl alcohol.Production, sale and purchase of methyl alcohol is banned in Bihar where prohibition has been in force since April 2016.The sub inspector identified as Braj Kishor Yadav, is presently posted at the Karja police station, nearly 25 km from Kachchi Pakki area where he was arrested.Yadav, a 2009 batch sub inspector had been inducted into the police department in 2018 following a Patna High Court order to induct over 100 sub inspectors after many of them had moved the court alleging that they were unfairly eliminated in the recruitment tests.Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Jayant Kant said that they had information about transportation of alcohol in a truck, which was to be moved from Kachchi Pakki area. “I alerted the anti liquor quad to apprehend the truck with the consignment. The squad arrested three persons after intercepting the truck. All the three persons were taken to a police station and were quizzed. Later, one of them was identified as Braj Kishor Yadav, a PSI deployed with the Karja police station. While another is a son of chowkidar from the Sadar police station,” said Kant.He said 4,400 liters of methyl alcohol was seized from the truck. Yadav was not in uniform.“Yadav was escorting the truck for safe delivery of the consignment to someone in Maniyari police station area. They will be sent to jail after they are produced in a court,” the SSP said.A police official on condition of anonymity said that Yadav was posted with Karja police station barely three weeks ago.“Yadav is a habitual offender. His was suspended nearly two months ago after a video of his had gone viral on social media. The SSP had suspended him after verification of that video, in which he was seen extorting money from some truckers near Bhagwanpur roundabout, hardly 50 meters away from the Sadar police station, where he was deployed. Recently his suspension was revoked, and he was posted with the Karja police station,” he said.This is not the first time that a police officer has been arrested for conniving with the liquor mafia. On January 14, 2019, the SHO of the Motipur police station was arrested by a special team of Excise and Prohibition department with a huge haul of Indian made foreign liquor (IMFL) from his official residence. After that the entire staff of the police station was suspended and shifted from there.Two sub inspectors from Meenapur police station had faced the departmental proceedings before they were dismissed from service in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rogue-cop-arrested-for-escorting-truck-carrying-methyl-alcohol-in-dry-bihar-101614427111376.html

"Remembering the fearless revolutionary freedom fighter Chandra Shekhar Azad on his death anniversary today. An exceptional leader and a true patriot, Azad motivated and inspired many to join the freedom movement. His supreme sacrifice for our motherland will always be remembered,” Naidu tweeted.Azad was born on July 23, 1906, as Chandra Shekhar Tiwari in Bhavra village of Madhya Pradesh in the family of Pandit Sitaram Tiwari and Jagrani Devi. Azad’s mother asked his father to send their son to Kashi Vidyapeeth in Varanasi. He was deeply affected by the massacre in Amritsar’s Jallianwala Bagh in 1919. He joined the freedom struggle in 1921 while he was just a school student.In December 1921, when Mahatma Gandhi launched the non-cooperation movement, Azad took part in it. After joining the movement, he was arrested by the British police and when he was presented before a magistrate, he declared his name to be 'Azad', his father's name as 'Swatantra', and his residence as 'prison'. Since then, the title of ‘Azad’, which means free in Urdu, was attached to his name.After the suspension of the non-cooperation movement in 1922, Azad joined the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), a revolutionary organisation formed by Ramprasad Bismil. Azad was involved in the Kakori Train Robbery on August 9, 1925, against the British Raj. He was also involved in the shooting of JP Saunders at Lahore in 1928 to avenge the killing of Lala Lajpat Rai, and in the attempt to blow up the Viceroy of India's train in 1929.Azad lost his life in a face-off with the British police in Alfred Park in Allahabad on February 27, 1931. After single-handedly fighting the police for a while with just a pistol and a few cartridges, Azad shot himself in the head, fulfilling his vow of dying as a free man and not as a British captive. The Colt pistol of Chandra Shekhar Azad is displayed at the Allahabad Museum.Azad used to fondly recite a Hindustani couplet which was his only poetic composition: 'Dushman ki goliyon ka hum saamna karenge. Azad hi rahein hain, azad hi rahenge'||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chandra-shekhar-azad-s-90th-death-anniversary-azad-hi-rahein-hain-azad-hi-rahenge-101614427026745.html

It has a 'spin'||Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor took to Twitter on Saturday to share a Whatsapp forward equating Mahatma Gandhi with the spinners of the Indian cricket team.The message featured a picture of Gandhiji’s famous spinning wheel or Charkha along with the text 'spinners have always done well in Ahmedabad especially against England', capped off with a smirking face emoji. Tharoor captioned it as 'one of the better WhatsApp forwards of the day!'.One of the better WhatsApp forwards of the day! pic.twitter.com/fhozGrFe8IIndia played and won a pink ball test against England in the newly christened Narendra Modi Stadium in Motera which ended in just over five sessions. The victory has largely been credited to spinners Ravichandran Ashwin, Axar Patel, and Washington Sundar, picked by captain Virat Kohli. Axar Patel and R Ashwin had a total of nine wickets between them to bowl out England for 112 all out.Gandhiji used the portable spinning wheel, called a charkha in Hindi, to spin thread and make his own clothes as a symbol of protest against the British textile products in favour of homemade clothes. Gandhiji was extremely fond of his charkha and used it to make his clothes while he was imprisoned in Pune’s Yerawada jail first in the early 1930s. The spinning wheel went on to play a big role in India’s push for self-reliance and ultimately self-governance.The Motera stadium is the biggest cricket stadium in the world with a total capacity of 1,32,000.

Two doses to be taken in a gap of 28 days will cost ₹500. This price will include taxes, reports said. Since this is the first time vaccines will be charged, the price is indicative of how much the vaccines will cost when these will be available for all, after the inoculation of priority groups.The government had procured Covishield from Serum Institute of India at a discounted price of ₹200, per dose, excluding taxes. Bharat Biotech's Covaxin was priced at ₹295 per dose for the government.Several political parties had promised free vaccines to all and several chief ministers, including Arvind Kejriwal, Mamata Banerjee earlier urged PM Modi to make vaccines free for all. But as the vaccination drive enters the crucial second phase, the government has made it clear that vaccination at private hospitals will not be free.The decision to rope in private hospitals in the ongoing vaccination drive comes following an uptick in the number of daily infections.The vaccination drive, which began on January 16, will enter the second phase on March 1. In this phase, senior citizens and people (45 years and above) with co-morbidities will be considered eligible for inoculation. Government hospitals will carry out the drive at no cost, as it has been going on, but private facilities which are empanelled under Central Government Health Scheme, Ayushman Bharay and similar State Health Insurance Schemes will charge for the vaccines.Earlier on Saturday, the Centre said several fake claims were doing the rounds on WhatsApp regarding the second phase of vaccination.Several claims are being made in a forwarded #WhatsApp message regarding the next phase of the #COVID19 vaccination drive. #PIBFactCheck: These claims are #Misleading.

"I would like to highlight that ₹102.93 crore is required for the conduct of the Assembly election, of which a sum of ₹102.38 crore has been provided in the Supplementary Estimates," he told the House presenting the Final Supplementary Estimates for 2020-21. The provision has been made under the Public department and the remaining amount would be met by re-appropriation within the grant, he said. Placing the Final Supplementary Estimates for ₹21,172.82 crore, Panneerselvam, who holds the Finance portfolio said it includes various items of additional expenditure necessitated on government account in view of the Covid-19 pandemic and other urgent requirements."I strongly believe that democratic norms need to be observed. As the Election Commission has announced the general election for TN Legislative Assembly yesterday, it would not be appropriate for me to specifically mention some of the important items of expenditure which is the normal practice," he noted. He said for all items of expenditure, necessary Government Orders and sanctions have already been issued or these are ongoing schemes. "None of these, which is being included in the Final Supplementary Estimates is a new announcement or a new item of expenditure."

The waiver, which would apply to a swath of obligations under the WTO Agreement on TRIPS, is set to be discussed at the General Council meeting next week.The push comes as poorer countries are trailing significantly behind richer countries in administering vaccines. According to the United Nations last week, 130 countries have not received a single dose of any Covid-19 vaccines, reported Inside US Trade."Where is the moral imperative? Beyond anything else, that is what needs to be the motivation here," Rosa DeLauro (Connecticut), a member of the Democratic Party, said during a press conference announcing a letter from more than 400 US-based civil society groups to President Biden. "The moral imperative to save lives. The United States should lead that charge. We should not be denying others the opportunity to do this. We have the wherewithal to do this."Support for the waiver is gaining momentum among Democrats. DeLauro was joined at the press conference by Earl Blumenauer (Oregon) and Jan Schakowsky (Illinois).Schakowsky is spearheading a letter to the president with fellow members of Congress that will urge him to support the waiver. Schakowsky, deputy whip for House Democrats, has previously said, and reiterated on Friday, that the waiver is supported by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.The General Council next week is not expected to make any decisions on the TRIPS waiver but will receive a status update from the chair of the TRIPS Council on the state of the talks, reported Inside US Trade.Advocates are urging the Biden administration to use that opportunity to lift the US opposition and allow WTO members to proceed to text-based discussions in the council, according to Public Citizen's Lori Wallach. She told reporters on Friday that the General Council is the place to show political direction on the waiver. The US position so far, she argued, "has basically been a filibuster."Meanwhile, the US, the European Union, Canada and Japan, among others, have so far opposed it, arguing that intellectual property is critical to innovation and that existing TRIPS flexibilities - including compulsory licensing - are sufficient to address any IP-related concerns.The proponents, meanwhile, maintain that the waiver is needed to allow those with the capacity to ramp up production and ensure poorer countries have equal access to the vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-civil-society-groups-lawmakers-press-biden-to-support-india-s-trips-waiver-proposal-on-covid-19-vaccines-101614420291799.html

Such dictatorial regulations will not be accepted by the people of this democratic country," he said.Some bureaucrats deciding on what needs to be published and what not on any media platform is nothing but an attack on the freedom of press in India, Patil added."Such orders will not have any standing in the court of law," he said.Talking about the arrest of activist Disha Ravi for her alleged involvement in sharing a "toolkit" on social media related to the farmers' protest, the senior Congress leader from Kolhapur said the entire episode was an act to suppress the voice of those who are exercising their freedom to speech.A Delhi court recently granted bail to the activist.The Centre on February 25announced sweeping regulations for social media firms, such as Facebook and Twitter as well as OTT players like Netflix, requiring them to remove any content flagged by authorities within 36 hours and setting up a complaint redressal mechanism with an officer being based in the country.The regulations also make it mandatory for platforms such as Twitter and WhatsApp to identify the originator of a message that authorities consider to be anti-national and against security and sovereignty of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-minister-says-centre-s-new-regulation-for-digital-platforms-dictatorial-101614418216084.html

I want to assure that this ceasefire will have no bearing on the counter-terrorist operations and we will maintain our alertness," Lt Gen Joshi said at the northern command investiture ceremony here.During the ceremony, the Army commander presented two Bar to Sena medals (gallantry) and 50 Sena medals (gallantry) to the brave soldiers.He also presented three Sena medals (distinguished) and six Vishisht Seva medals for selfless service to the nation.Lt Gen Joshi also awarded unit appreciation to 26 units for their overall outstanding performance in the command theatre."The northern command has always stood like a shield against the attempts by our neighbouring countries to spread disturbance and it will continue to remain so in the future. Whenever anyone raises an evil eye on our country, Indian Army has replied strongly," Lt Gen Joshi said.Without naming China and Pakistan, he said Indian Army has maintained its domination on its borders with the neighbouring countries and helped in maintaining peace in the hinterland.Referring to the eastern Ladakh standoff with the Chinese army, he said Indian Army stood up to the challenge on the snow-capped mountains of the Line of Actual Control during the challenging situation in 2020 and maintained the highest alert."Our action is a glaring example of our training, bravery and pledge (to safeguard the borders) and it will be written in history with golden words. The northern command made possible what seemed impossible. The success of the operation (in Ladakh) is the glaring example of the bravery of Indian Army,” he said.He said 2020 was historic in many ways for the Army which demonstrated its mettle in eastern Ladakh by its "grit, determination, self-confidence, bravery and steadfastness".He said there has been a tremendous improvement in the basic deployment and preparedness and the efforts in this direction will continue. “The measures we have put in to strengthen our defences, the same efforts were made to maintain peace,” he said.In Kashmir, he said, the overall security situation saw a great improvement in the previous year as there has been a considerable reduction in terrorist-initiated incidents, stone-pelting activities and protests as a result of tireless efforts of the security forces and the people of Jammu and Kashmir.He said the Army also played a key role in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic."Under 'Seva Paramo Dharma', Army doctors, nursing staff, ambulance and medical corps staff without caring for their lives worked round-the-clock and are continuously doing so," he said.He congratulated those who were decorated for their bravery and conveyed his heartfelt gratitude to the brave men who made the supreme sacrifice on the borders, including at Galwan Valley, and in the battle against internal security challenges.Lt Col Joshi urged all ranks, ex-servicemen, civilians and their families to rededicate themselves to the cause of the nation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ceasefire-to-have-no-bearing-on-counter-terrorism-operations-lt-gen-101614418611239.html

They were shifted to Sangareddy jail, Davis said.According to the commissioner, the police received a complaint at around 6.30 pm on Friday evening that some cows were lying butchered at a poultry shed behind brick kilns near the bypass road on the outskirts of Siddipet town.“We rushed to the spot immediately and shifted the remaining cows to a cowshed. We summoned the district veterinary doctors to conduct a post-mortem of the slaughtered cows. The accused were absconding, but the police launched a manhunt and arrested them in the early hours of Saturday,” Davis said.The slaughter of cows and calves is banned in Telangana, but bulls can be slaughtered if a fit-for-slaughter certificate is issued. The police said the cows were slaughtered to sell beef.The news about the slaughter spread like a wild fire in the town leading to a tense atmosphere. Hundreds of workers of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Bajrang Dal and RSS took out a rally in protest against the cow slaughter.They staged a dharna near the old bus stand and raised slogans demanding stern action against the accused. The police swung into action and tried to disperse them but they refused to move till the accused were arrested.Senior police officials, including the commissioner of police and assistant commissioner of police Rameshwar were finally able to persuade them to withdraw their protest. They assured them that the culprits would be brought to book at the earliest.Davis appealed to the people not to believe any rumours and resort to communal violence. “Any deliberate campaign to exploit sensitive communal issues would be sternly dealt with,” the commissioner said.Telangana’ finance minister T Harish Rao, who hails from Siddipet, condemned the slaughter of cows and instructed the police to take stern action against the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telanganas-siddipet-tense-after-alleged-slaughter-of-cows-police-arrest-8-men-101614418198878.html

27-02-2021||India||Petrol, diesel prices hiked again, 16th time this month||Oil companies on Saturday raised petrol prices by 24 paise per litre and diesel by 15 paise a litre, making the two fuels costlier by ₹4.87 per litre and ₹4.99 in just one month.With the 16th price hike in the current month, petrol is being sold at record ₹91.17 per litre in Delhi on Saturday and diesel at ₹81.47 a litre, less than 50 paise away from touching an all-time high. Diesel was sold at record ₹81.94 per litre on July 30, 2020 in Delhi.Domestic fuel retailers raised petrol and diesel rates on Saturday even as international crude oil prices fell on Friday because of firming dollar. Benchmark Brent crude on Friday closed at $66.13 per barrel, down by 1.12%. However, Brent crude surged by over 18% in February on supply disruptions in the US and rapid demand recovery with the launch of Covid-19 vaccination programmes.According to the latest data released on Friday, the Indian economy has come out of the contraction zone after the ease in lockdown restrictions and resumption of economic activities. India’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew at 0.4% on a year-on-year basis in the third quarter ending December 2020, after the economy suffered an annual contraction of 24.4% and 7.3% successively in the two preceding quarters because of a 68-day hard lockdown since March 25, 2020 to contain the spread of Covid-19.“Petrol and diesel are deregulated fuels. Public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs) take decisions on pricing of petrol and diesel in line with international prices of petrol and diesel, and not with international crude price,” an oil ministry official said requesting anonymity. The government had deregulated pricing of petrol on June 26, 2010 and diesel on October 19, 2014.State-run OMCs on June 16, 2017 implemented daily revision of petrol and diesel rates in the entire country. India’s fuel retail market is dominated by three state-run OMCs – Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) with almost 90% market-share.Two executives working in state-run oil companies said retail prices of petrol and diesel are rising because of supply squeeze by producers’ cartel and high taxes on the two fuels by the Centre and states. The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (Opec+) on 12 April last year announced an unprecedented 9.7 million barrel per day cut in oil output, a 10th of the global output, from May 1, 2020, but did not adhere to the planned restoration of the supply reduction.The other reason for high prices of petrol and diesel is central and state levies. According to IOC, while the basic price of petrol is ₹31.82 per litre in Delhi, total levies on every litre of the fuel is ₹53.51 (central excise of ₹32.90 per litre and value-added tax of ₹20.61 a litre). Similarly, basic rate of diesel in Delhi is 33.46 per litre, but total tax on it is ₹43.48 per litre (central excise of ₹31.80 per litre and value-added tax of ₹11.68 a litre). Petrol and diesel rates vary across the country because of different value-added tax (VAT) and local levies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petrol-diesel-prices-hiked-again-16th-time-this-month-101614417107783.html

27-02-2021||India||Fishing hartal hits coastal belt in Kerala||A day long hartal, called by various outfits over the ongoing controversy regarding an alleged deep sea fishing contract between the CPI(M)-led government and a US-based company, hit life in coastal areas of Kerala on Saturday. Various pro-Congress outfits, under the banner of Matsya Mekhala Samrakshana Samithi, called for the hartal in the coastal belt. Boats did not venture into sea in the majority of places and hundreds of fishermen kept themselves away from their job, expressing solidarity with the agitation. Harbours and shops in coastal areas remained shut in various districts. Both boat owners and traditional fishermen were cooperating with the hartal, the Samithi sources said. As the government had already cancelled the MoUs in this regard with the EMCC International, the US-based firm, three outfits were staying away from the stir. However, leaders of other outfits claimed that the government's assurance lacks clarity. The Left government had decided to cancel a ₹5,000 crore memorandum of understanding (MoU) between KSIDC and the EMCC International, against which the Opposition Congress has been raising serious allegations. They had also cancelled another controversial MoU worth ₹2,950 crore between the Kerala Shipping and Inland Navigation Corporation (KSINC) and the same company to build 400 deep sea fishing trawlers and new harbours and for the port development activities. The MoUs were signed by the KSINC and KSIDC with EMCC International at a state government-sponsored global investors meet, ASCEND, in Kochi last year.The opposition Congress on Thursday had organised a day- long 'satyagraha' protest at Poonthura, a fishing hamlet near here, demanding removal of Fisheries Minister J Mercykutty Amma in connection with the controversial deal. They alleged that the deals, if implemented, would have adverselyimpacted the lives oflakhs of fishermen in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fishing-hartal-hits-coastal-belt-in-kerala-101614416002083.html
27-02-2021||India||India has highest stake in Rohingyas' return to Myanmar: India at UNGA||India has emphasised the need for an early return of displaced Rohingyas from Bangladesh to Myanmar, saying that it has the highest stake in resolving the issue since it is the only nation that shares a long border with both countries.Speaking at the informal UN General Assembly meeting on Friday on the situation in Myanmar after the military staged a coup this month, India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti said that it must be ensured that the recent developments in the country do not impede the progress made so far and the international community must encourage and support positive steps.Bangladesh is hosting over 1.1 million Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar, who fled Myanmar facing military crackdown, often considered as "ethnic cleansing" by many rights groups.Myanmar doesn’t recognise Rohingya as an ethnic group and insists that they are Bangladeshi migrants living illegally in the country.Myanmar military seized the power on February 1, detaining the country's de-facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The military coup took place at a time when Bangladesh was spearheading a desperate campaign for safe return of some 1.1 million Rohingyas.Tirumurti, addressing the issue of displaced persons from the Rakhine state of Myanmar, said India has the highest stake in resolving the issue of repatriation of the displaced persons since it is the only country that shares a long border with both Bangladesh and Myanmar.“We have continued to counsel our partners on the need for a balanced and constructive approach to this issue. For this, mobilisation of support for the developmental needs of the local people is crucial. India has been consistently encouraging stakeholders to find practical and pragmatic solutions,” he said.He emphasised the need for an early resolution of the issue of Rohingyas.Underscoring that a “collaborative and consensus-based approach” is key to arriving at a meaningful and practical outcome, Tirumurti said the international community must work to address the challenges that the concerned stakeholders continue to face so that this humanitarian problem is resolved in a timely manner.“India will continue to work with both the governments of Bangladesh and Myanmar to enable the earliest return of displaced persons to their homes in the Rakhine State in a manner that is safe, speedy and sustainable," he said.Commending Bangladesh for hosting over a million displaced persons in its territory, India said it is important for the international community to recognise and understand the humanitarian burden that Bangladesh continues to face and the efforts it has undertaken to ensure the well-being of the displaced persons.“The international community must further support, financially and otherwise, efforts of the government of Bangladesh and also assist in ensuring that issues relating to radicalisation in the camps and other security challenges are addressed in an expeditious manner,” Tirumurti said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-has-highest-stake-in-rohingyas-return-to-myanmar-india-at-unga-101614415694489.html

People rarely left their homes to go to work and schools have been closed for over a year and a half because we didn't want our children to leave the house. I can point out several houses that have bullet holes on doors and walls. I am grateful to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his consideration for the people living in the border areas," he told ANI.He added, "I want to thank Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan for their decision. We have lost several villagers to cross-border firing and many have lost legs, hands and eyes. Now, we can finally sleep and work in peace."Another woman, Sharifa Begum who lost her older brother to a firing at the border told ANI, "I am glad that I can now start a new life and feel safe in my home. We are very grateful to the Modi government for the decision. I lost my older brother to such firing incidents a few years ago. Now my children and I can sleep in peace and focus on their education."Earlier on Thursday, after discussions between the Director Generals of Military Operations of India and Pakistan, the two sides have to cease firing along the Line of Control (LoC)and all other sectors with effect from midnight of February 24 to 25.The discussion between the two armies took place at a time when a large number of ceasefire violations were taking place along the LoC and violence levels were going up especially for the villagers living along the LoC on both sides."Both sides agreed for strict observance of all agreements, understandings and cease firing along the Line of Control and all other sectors with effect from midnight of February 24 to 25," a joint statement issued by the Defence Ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-border-residents-thank-pm-modi-khan-for-ceasefire-agreement-101614416205497.html

We equally respect everyone, that is our strength and we will continue with this," said Azad.Azad's statement came after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's 'North-South' remark that came while addressing a public rally in Thiruvananthapuram earlier this week.Also Read: Congress G-23 hold meet in Jammu, discuss Gandhian philosophy, honour Ghulam Nabi AzadAzad was joined by senior Congress leaders Anand Sharma, former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Kapil Sibbal, Raj Babbar and Vivek Tankha during the 'Shanti Sammelan' in Jammu.Most of these leaders are seen as party's dissenters, also known as G-23 (or the group of 23 dissenting leaders, who had questioned the party's functioning in a letter to interim president Sonia Gandhi).Azad, while talking about the presence of senior party leaders in Jammu and Kashmir said, "These leaders are here because, in the last five-six years, all these friends did not speak any less than me in the Parliament over issues of Jammu and Kashmir, its unemployment, stripping off of statehood, finishing off industries and education, and implementation of GST."On the condition of anonymity, yesterday a senior leader of the Congress G-23 told ANI that the event in Jammu is a "show of party's strength" and a message to Rahul Gandhi: "We will tell the country that from north to south, India is one."Last year in August, G-23 leaders through a letter to interim Congress President Sonia Gandhi expressed their discontent and urged the top leadership of Congress to bring immediate reforms, including organisational elections from the grass-roots to the Congress Working Committee (CWC) level.Today, they are once again up in arms against the Gandhi family and their loyal close circle who are holding key positions in the party and the parliament.Rahul Gandhi was heavily criticised by BJP leaders after he had said "For the first 15 years, I was an MP in the North. I got used to a different type of politics. For me, coming to Kerala was refreshing as suddenly I found that people are interested in issues and not just superficially but going into detail in issues."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-equally-respects-all-religions-people-castes-ghulam-nabi-azad-101614416117457.html

He will also claim that all farmers get MSP when the truth is only 6 per cent of farmers are able to sell at MSP," he added.Earlier, on Monday Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleged that the three new farm laws passed by the Central government are designed to destroy the agriculture business and hand it over to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "friends".Meanwhile, Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the government has still left its door open for discussions with the farmers regarding the three new farm laws.Since November 26 last year, farmers have been protesting on the different borders of the national capital, against the three newly enacted farm laws: Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chidambaram-slams-centre-over-treating-protesting-farmers-as-enemies-101614415323989.html
27-02-2021||India||Despite record paddy procurement in Odisha, farmer continue protests||Amid continuing farmers’ protest over paddy procurement in Odisha, a BJP legislator from western Odisha district of Deogarh, has threatened to immolate himself alleging irregularities at procurement centres in his district.“I will immolate self if the paddy procurement process was not streamlined and faulty token system was not addressed,” BJP MLA Subash Chandra Panigrahi threatened the legislative assembly on Friday while senior Congress leader from Bolangir district, Narasingha Mishra staged protest in the middle of the House alleging irregularities in procurement.Panigrahi’s threat came just days after state cooperation minister Ranendra Pratap Swain told the assembly that the paddy procurement during the 2020-21 kharif marketing season had crossed last year's record. Against procurement of 53.31 lakh tonne of paddy in 2019-20 kharif marketing season, Odisha State Civil Supply Cooperation had procured over 57.67 lakh tonne of paddy till February 25.Despite the record paddy procurement this season, farmers across the state resorted to wildcat protests against the procurement system.Unlike previous years, this year, the protest from farmers and farmer organisations in Odisha during the paddy procurement seems to be shriller across the state.In Harichandanpur block of Keonjhar district, angry farmers staged a dharna and blocked the highway bypass by pilling up sacks of unsold paddy on Wednesday stopping vehicular movement along the Naranpur-Duburi road.In Patrapur area of Balasore district, hundreds of farmers stacked their paddy on road, protesting the delay in procurement. Last week, in western Odisha district of Bargarh, farmers dumped around 5000 quintals of unsold paddy protesting the non-procurement. In Angul district, farmers under the banner of All India Kishan Khet Majdoor Sangathan hit the streets demanding the withdrawal of the faulty token system for procurement of their crops.“We have been waiting for last several days to sell our paddy stocks. Yet the officials seem to be unmoved. We have become victims of apathy of the state government," the farmers alleged.Balasore district president of Odisha Krushak Sabha, Premaranjan Patra said unlike previous years, this year the farmers in other parts of the state have been inspired by the protests in north India over the three new contentious farm laws."The continuing protests and its coverage on social media has definitely made an impact on farmers in villages who are not willing to stay silent," said Patra.However, Biswajit Keshari Das, managing director of Odisha Civil Supply Corporation that procures the paddy from the farmers through primary agricultural cooperative societies, women self help groups, large sized adivasi multipurpose cooperative societies and pani panchayats said this year the procurement has exceeded last year’s due to increased registration of farmers at mandis."Last year, 12 lakh farmers had registered while this year close to 15 lakh farmers have registered. We may cross 60 lakh tonne of paddy procurement this time by the end of March as procurement is still going on in coastal Odisha," said Das. He said that despite the record procurement, storing the paddy was not an issue as it is being rolled over to FCI which accepts surplus rice and evacuates it to other consuming states.Paddy procurement plays a critical role in the state's rural economy. Odisha is among the top rice-surplus states in the country. Paddy is purchased from farmers who register themselves with their nearest societies before the start of procurement operations by submitting their personal/land/ bank account details through a pre designed registration form.The societies digitize the registration forms and upload the details in the Farmer Registration portal. All farmers have to provide identity proof in terms of Aadhaar cards. Registered farmers are then given advance tokens through SMS about the date of purchase.Farmer leader Lingaraj said the growing unrest over paddy procurement in Odisha this year had more to do with the state's inability to put its paddy purchase centres in order. "Odisha could procure mere 49 per cent of the total rice produced in the state during 2018-19 while in 2019-20 it could procure just about 53 per cent. Over the last few years, Odisha is witnessing record production of paddy and is unable to decide on how much to procure. It needs to put its mandis in order or else the government would face a bigger crisis during next year," he warned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/despite-record-paddy-procurement-in-odisha-farmer-continue-protests-101614415413936.html

Apart from Azad, Kapil Sibal, Manish Tewari, Anand Sharma, Bhupinder Hooda and Raj Babbar are also present.The event has been organised days after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's "North-South" remark, which has led to a controversy."Be it Jammu or Kashmir or Ladakh, we respect all religions, people and castes. We equally respect everyone, that is our strength and we will continue with this," Azad said while addressing the event.Other leaders said they want to strengthen the Congress party. "People say we are a part of G-23; for me, it's Gandhi 23. With the belief, resolve and thinking of Mahatma Gandhi, this nation's law and Constitution was formed. Congress is standing strongly to take these forward. 'G-23' want Congress to be strong," said Raj Babbar.He then lauded the work doen by Azad in all his years as parliamentarian. "Azadji was recently given farewell from Parliament, even the prime minister wept. He also didn't get angry by allegations made by (BJP leader) Rajmata Scindia and said 'I take these allegations seriously and a panel be formed and headed by Vajpayee and will accept their decision'. This is Gandhian ideology," said Babbar."Vajpayeeji then met Azad and apologised in Parliament. This is Gandhian philosophy," he added.The ostensible trigger for the public meetings is to honour Azad, a Congress veteran who recently retired from Parliament after four decades.According to one of the person aware of the details of the event, said that this meeting is a message to the Congress high command. “We want to tell the party leadership that we are united, we have an issue and they must do something about it," he added on condition of anonymity.Meanwhile, Azad, who reached Jammu on Friday, said that the Congress party will contest the coming assembly elections in four states and a union territory with its full might.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-g-23-hold-meet-in-jammu-discuss-gandhian-philosophy-honour-azad-101614415160068.html
27-02-2021||India||Govt sets 50 lakh users as threshold for 'significant social media intermediary' under new IT rules||The government has fixed fifty lakh registered users as the threshold for defining 'significant social media intermediary', which will have to adhere to additional obligations and compliance under the new IT rules that seek to crack down on misuse of social media platforms.The new rules, announced earlier this week, require 'significant social media intermediaries' to follow additional due diligence, including the appointment of a chief compliance officer, nodal contact person and resident grievance officer. All three officials will have to reside in India.They will have to publish a monthly compliance report and details of the contents removed proactively.At present, the country has 53 crore WhatsApp users, 44.8 crore YouTube users, 41 crore Facebook subscribers, 21 crore Instagram clients, while 1.75 crore account holders are on microblogging platform Twitter."...the Central Government hereby specifies fifty lakh registered users in India as the threshold for a social media intermediary to be considered a significant social media intermediary," the notification said.Earlier on Thursday, the government announced the tightening of the rules governing social media and streaming companies, requiring them to take down contentious content quicker, appoint grievance redressal officers and assist investigations.The move aims to make social media platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter and Instagram - which have seen a phenomenal surge in usage over the past few years in India - more accountable and responsible for the content hosted on their platform.Social media companies will have to remove contentious content flagged by the government or court orders within 36 hours and take down posts depicting nudity or morphed photos within 24 hours of receiving a complaint, as per the latest intermediary rules.Also, social media platforms on being asked by the court or government will be required to disclose the first originator of the mischievous information that undermines the sovereignty of India, security of the state, or public order.The new guidelines followed the government's spat with Twitter over allegedly inflammatory tweets and hashtags supporting farmer protests, with the microblogging service initially refusing to comply with orders to take down about 1,500 such posts and accounts.

The European Union said the agreement is an important step in the interest of regional peace and stability on which to further bilateral dialogue. The United States too welcomed the decision calling it a "positive step" towards greater peace and stability in South Asia.But for people living in villages near the LoC - who were most affected by firing along the border - it's a major relief. The head or sarpanch of one such village thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistan counterpart Imran Khan on Saturday for the ceasefire.“We want to thank Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan for the ceasefire announcement at LoC. Earlier, due to cross-border firing, several villagers died, while some lost their legs, eyes and their hands. We can now sleep and work in peace,” the sarpanch of Pukharni village was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. The village comes under the Rajouri district in Jammu and Kashmir.For the past few years, Pakistan has engaged in shelling and firing along the LoC and the International Border (IB) resulting in casualties, damage to houses, schools, health centres and religious places."We have suffered a lot to due Pakistani firing and shelling.... Education of kids was affected. Houses were damaged. There were casualties. The fresh agreement of maintaining complete ceasefire is a happy news for us. Hope it stays," said another resident of Rajouri district.However, Subash Chander, a panch, said it is difficult to trust Pakistan. Similar apprehension was raised by Kerni resident Mohmmad Ashraf who welcomed the fresh agreement but raised question over the intention of Pakistan.On Thursday, India and Pakistan released a joint statement saying that they have held discussions regarding establishing a mechanism for hotline contact among both nations. Both sides also agreed to a ceasefire along the LoC from February 25. The announcement was made after a meeting between the Director Generals of Military Operations (DGMOs) of both the countries.During the budget session of Parliament, Union minister G Kishan Reddy had pointed out that 341 civilians were injured due to ceasefire violations along the International Border (IB) and the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir in 2018, 2019 and 2020. The Union minister also said that 70 civilians died during these ceasefire violations. He said that in the past three years 10,752 cases of ceasefire violations had occurred along the LoC.India’s decision to abrogate Article 370 and scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status in August 2019 along with the Pulwama suicide attack in February 2019 led to strains between the relationship of both nations and subsequently affected the truce signed between both nations in November 2003 when India and Pakistan had agreed to a ceasefire on the LoC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-work-in-peace-says-rajouri-village-sarpanch-on-loc-ceasefire-101614412975141.html

Before the IAF pilot ejected from his ageing MiG-21 hit in the aerial dogfight over the skies of Jammu, he shot down a fourth-generation F-16 fighter. He was captured by villagers in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir where he landed and handed over to the Pakistan military.ALSO WATCH | J&K: Terror plot on Pulwama anniversary busted, temple may have been on targetHindustan Times, after talking to former air force, intelligence and politicians has been able to reconstruct some of the behind-the-scenes action in New Delhi and Islamabad that led Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan to release the Indian fighter pilot.PM Khan, who made the announcement in the National Assembly on 28 February, called the decision “a gesture of peace”.Wg Cdr Abhinandan Varthaman returned home on 1 March via the heavily-guarded Wagah-Attari border post. In the 60-odd hours that he spent in Pakistani custody, the air force pilot became the face of the conflict between the two countries when the Pakistani army released a set of propaganda videos that showed him in its custody. In one, he was blindfolded and blood-covered and yet, responded to questions from a Pakistan Army officer with remarkable composure, calm and dignity.It was soon after Pakistan put out the initial set of photographs of the pilot in captivity that India decided to move swiftly, and decisively to secure his release.It is understood that after PM Modi saw images of the bleeding Indian pilot and his smiling captors, he told the Indian intelligence chief to clearly communicate to Pakistan that New Delhi will stop at nothing if Abhinandan is harmed and demand his immediate release. PM Modi's message to Pakistan was: “Our weapon arsenal is not for Diwali.”The message was conveyed by then RAW chief Anil Dhasmana to his then ISI counterpart Lt General Syed Asim Munir Ahmed Shah over a secure line. Dhasmana was so blunt that even the ISI chief was surprised at how the RAW chief was going ballistic over Abhinandan’s photographs. The RAW chief told him that the consequences will entirely lie on Islamabad if the pilot was even touched and must be returned unharmed.To demonstrate that India meant business, the armed forces were ordered to ready mobile Prithvi ballistic missile batteries in the Rajasthan sector. It set alarm bells ringing in faraway Washington as well.Also Read: Pak military on damage control after MP says IAF pilot released out of panicIn his brief statement announcing Wing Commander Abhinandan’s release in the National Assembly on February 28, Prime Minister Imran Khan said he tried to speak with PM Narendra Modi the previous day but couldn’t get through.The first confirmation about Wing Commander Abhinandan’s release came sometime before PM Imran Khan made the announcement. HT learns ISI chief Lt Gen Shah had sent a secret letter to the RAW chief on February 28 morning, conveying the decision to release the IAF pilot. PM Modi was informed about the letter.The ISI chief was removed from his post in June 2019 after serving only eight months and replaced by a hardliner Lt General Faiz Hameed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-rare-phone-call-secret-letter-how-india-got-pak-to-release-iaf-s-abhinandan-101614411836282.html

27-02-2021||India||Marathi Language Day 2021: All you need to know||To honour the birth anniversary of renowned Marathi poet Vishnu Vaman Shirwadkar, Marathi Language Day is celebrated annually on February 27. Shirwadkar, also popularly known as 'Kusumagraj', was an eminent Marathi poet, playwright, novelist, short story writer, and humanist. He wrote 16 volumes of poems, three novels, eight volumes of short stories, seven volumes of essays, and 18 plays and six one-act plays all of which centred on the theme of freedom, justice, and social evils like poverty.The government started celebrating 'Marathi Rajbhasha Gaurav Din' after Kusumagraj's death in 1999. Kusumagraj was the recipient of several state awards and national awards including the 1974 Sahitya Akademi Award in Marathi for Natsamrat, Padma Bhushan in 1991 and the Jnanpith Award in 1987. He also served as the president of the Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan held at Margao in 1964.Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray congratulated the people of Maharashtra urging them to increase the use of the Marathi language in their daily lives. He also reminded people of the role of poet Shirwadkar in the promotion of the Marathi language and greeted the poet on his birthday. “I am Marathi, my Marathi!' Let's save the bow! Such is the appeal. Let's think in Marathi, let's speak in Marathi, let's express. Let's increase the use of Marathi in daily life!” Thackeray said.The day is celebrated to recognise and honour the greatness of Marathi literature. The Marathi language, which contains some of the oldest literature of all modern Indo-Aryan languages, is one of the most spoken languages in India with 42 dialects, out of which some of the most common ones are Vaidarbhi, Zadi Boli, Konkani and Khandeshi. The syntax of the language and the grammar come from Prakrit and Pali.Two special awards for individuals taking initiatives to promote Marathi literature are also given on this day. Various cultural programmes are held across Maharashtra in schools and other institutions to celebrate Marathi Bhasha Diwas. Although owing to the ongoing pandemic and recent spike in cases in Maharashtra, the celebrations this year will be muted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/marathi-language-day-2021-all-you-need-to-know-101614409635915.html
27-02-2021||India||US debt soars to $29 trillion, owes India $216 billion||The US, the world's largest economy, owes India USD 216 billion in loan as the country's debt grows to a record USD 29 trillion, an American lawmaker has said, cautioning the leadership against galloping foreign debt, the largest of which comes from China and Japan.In 2020, the US national debt was USD 23.4 trillion, that was USD 72,309 in debt per person.“We are going to grow our debt to USD 29 trillion. That is even more debt owed per citizen. There is a lot of misinformation about where the debt is going. The top two countries we owe the debt to are China and Japan, not actually our friends,” Congressman Alex Mooney said.“We are at global competition with China all the time. They are holding a lot of the debt. We owe China over USD 1 trillion and we owe Japan over USD 1 trillion,” the Republican Senator from West Virginia said on the floor of the US House of Representatives as he and others opposed the latest stimulus package of USD 2 trillion.In January, US President Joe Biden announced a USD 1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package to tackle the economic fallout from the pandemic, including direct financial aid to average Americans, support to businesses and to provide a boost to the national vaccination programme.“The people who are loaning us the money we have to pay back are not necessarily people who have our best interest at heart. Brazil, we owe USD 258 billion. India, we owe USD 216 billion. And the list goes on the debt that is owed to foreign countries,” Congressman Mooney said.America’s national debt was USD5.6 trillion in 2000. During the Obama administration, it actually doubled.“Since the eight years Obama was President, we doubled our national debt. And we are adding another—projected here—a completely out of control debt-to-GDP ratio,” he said urging his Congressional colleagues to consider this national debt issue before approving the stimulus package.“So I urge my colleagues to consider the future. Don’t buy into the—the government has no money it doesn’t take from you that you are going to have to pay back. We need to be judicious with these dollars, and most of this is not going to coronavirus relief anyway,” he said.Congressmen Mooney said that things have gone completely out of control. The Congressional Budget Office estimates an additional USD 104 trillion will be added by 2050. The Congressional Budget Office forecasted debt would rise 200 per cent.“Today, as I stand here right now, we have USD 27.9 trillion in national debt...That is actually a little more than USD 84,000 of debt to every American citizen right here today,” Mooney said.“We have actually borrowed USD 10,000 per person in one year. I mean, that is out of control,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/american-debt-soars-to-usd-29-trillion-owes-india-usd-216-billion-101614408504426.html
27-02-2021||India||What happens in marathon multi-phase polls? A look at scenarios||The election commission’s decision to hold an eight-phase assembly election in West Bengal has been criticised by the Mamata Banerjee government in the state. The TMC and opposition parties other than the BJP have questioned the need to spread over the polling process between March 27 and April 29; while elections in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry are being held in a single phase on April 6. In Assam the election will be held in three phases from March 27 to April 6.“If elections can be held in Bihar and Assam in three phases, then why are they being held in eight phases here? Who will be benefited? The ECI should be more rational,” Banerjee said.The Election Commission for its part said the polling has been spread over a month taking into cognizance law and order considerations in the state.This is not the first-time questions have been raised over the staggered polling exercise.In October 2019 elections were held for the 288-seat Maharashtra assembly and the 90-member Haryana assembly in a single day while as Jharkhand that has 81 assembly constituencies went to polls in five phases from November 30 to December 20. The opposition had questioned the need for a staggered election in a state with population and area smaller than Maharashtra.A former EC official said though the poll panel, which is mandated to carry out elections to the Lok Sabha and the state assemblies, does take into consideration the suggestions on the polling schedule made by the political parties, the final decision rests on inputs from the state election commission and law enforcement agencies.“At the time of Jharkhand elections many people had questioned the ECs decision to hold election in five phases. The commission had to take into cognizance the security paraphernalia that would be required to hold elections in the state where more than half of the constituencies are affected by Maoist violence.” If elections are being held in a clutch of states, staggered elections allow for the deployment of central forces, the official added.How do parties benefit from a multiphase electionA BJP functionary, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a staggered election allows the parties to recalibrate strategy. “There are times when the mood on the ground shifts, or public perception about a party change. During such times, the parties get enough time to go back to the drawing board and makes quick amends or changes to its strategy,” the functionary said.Sometimes, a phased election allows the party to address the concerns such as in-fighting in the cadre. “There have been elections where the voter turnout has been dismal or not up to the expectations of a party. In such a scenario, the party command can galvanise the cadre to push for better turn out,” the functionary said.Political scientist Sanjay Kumar of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies said the parties benefit from the wave on the ground more than the phases. A staggered election in some cases allows parties to benefit from the prevalent mood.“We do not have any empirical evidence to prove how challengers benefit from a multiphase election. But if there is no wave or the mood is against a party, the number of phases will not matter,” he said.Kumar said though exit and opinion polls are banned during an election, there are unofficial communication channels that relay the voter sentiment. “These unofficial communication channels can have an impact on the undecided voters [during the subsequent phases]. If the mood is in favour of a particular party, there is a small percentage of voters, who prefer voting for the winning side."A second BJP functionary said while the party had suggested a multiphase election in West Bengal, a study of previous assembly elections suggests that the incumbents do not seem to benefit from a prolonged polling exercise. “There is no data to suggest how the challengers benefit from prolonged elections. But in the past, we have seen a trend,” the second functionary, who oversaw elections in a clutch of states, said.The functionary cited the West Bengal elections spread over six phases in 2011 when Banerjee stormed to power. “She made the most of the anti-incumbency against the Left government that was in power for over three decades. She also benefited from the sentiment prevalent at that time against land acquisition in Nandigram and Singur and against criminalisation of politics.”A similar trend was seen in Uttar Pradesh in 2012, when the Samajwadi Party defeated the incumbent Bahujan Samaj Party in an election spread over seven phases. “Incidentally, in Uttar Pradesh, too, land acquisition was a major poll issue,” the second BJP functionary said.Ahead of the 2012 election, the Congress initiated a campaign against the Mayawati government’s land acquisition for a highway project in Bhatta Parsaul village.A ruling Janata Dal (United) leader from Bihar said a campaign spread over several phases costs money and in the long run, a party that can sustain canvassing for long can also hope to benefit from it. “Sustained messaging, rallies and outreach programmes can retain the voters’ interest in elections and allow a party to benefit."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-happens-in-marathon-multi-phase-polls-a-look-at-scenarios-101614407025789.html
27-02-2021||India||Delhi HC asks Animal Welfare Board to sort out row between animal lovers and residents over feeding of stray dogs||The Delhi High Court has asked the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) to intervene in the row between some animal lovers and residents of a sector in Vasant Kunj in the national capital over feeding of stray dogs.The court also asked the AWBI to identify a spot where the canines can be fed so that "peace and harmony" can be maintained in the locality.Justice Prathiba M Singh issued the direction on a plea moved by the animal lovers against the "hindrances", being created by the Residents Welfare Association (RWA) of E-2 Block of Vasant Kunj, in the feeding of stray dogs and in taking care of the canines.The petitioner-animal lovers, represented by advocate Abhik Chimni, told the court whenever they try to feed the street dogs, "enormous resistance is caused by the local residents".Justice Singh said there was a 2009 order of the high court directing the AWBI to identify suitable spots or sites in colonies for feeding stray dogs."It, however, appears that there has been no consensus in identifying the suitable spot. The RWA appears to have been having apprehensions in view of the fact that children and senior residents also roam around in the open area of the block, for their own recreation," the court noted.The court also noted that the residents of the area were also concerned towards the safety of the children and others living there."The residents and the members of the RWA as also the petitioners have to act in harmony with each other and not in a manner which shall lead to unpleasant circumstances in the colony."Accordingly, in order to maintain peace and harmony in the locality,...AWBI shall send two representatives on March 8 to hold a meeting with the RWA and the petitioners," the court directed.It further directed that during the meeting, the AWBI and the RWA shall interact with residents and the petitioners and identify a spot, not used by children, senior citizens or others, for feeding and taking care of the stray dogs."Once the said spot is identified, the petitioners would feed and take care of the street dogs at that particular spot, and no hindrance, whatsoever, shall be caused to the petitioners in carrying out any activities in respect of the street dogs at the said spot," the court said.It said the SHO of the area shall also be present at the time of the meeting and the officer shall ensure that peace and harmony is maintained.With the direction, the court disposed of the plea moved by the animal lovers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-asks-animal-welfare-board-to-sort-out-row-between-animal-lovers-and-residents-over-feeding-of-stray-dogs-101614407757641.html

It ordered that movable and immovable assets of the firm, including 197-acre land, 1.385 kg gold, two quintal silver be attached for their subsequent auctions."The court order came after the finance department attached the same in 2013 under the OPID [the Odisha Protection of Interests of Depositors] Act framed to protect the interest of depositors cheated in financial and real estate scams," said special public prosecutor Subrat Mohanty. He said after this, the price of the land would be reassessed as per the benchmark valuation of the state government as the previous assessment was done a decade ago. "The land and other things attached would be auctioned by the competent authority and the money deposited in the bank account. After that the depositors of Seashore who had lost the money in the scam would be identified and compensated."The group is among 44 chit fund companies facing a Central Bureau of Investigation probe since May 2014 for raising around ₹578 crore from people without listing itself in the stock exchange. Prashant Dash, a 50-year-old former economics lecturer, started the group in 2008. He offered 36% interest per annum to the investors, which was nearly four times the rates offered by the nationalised banks.Dash was arrested in 2013 and released on bail in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-court-orders-attachment-and-auction-of-properties-of-chit-fund-firm-101614401034269.html

27-02-2021||India||Imran Khan says onus on India for progress after LoC ceasefire agreement||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday said the onus is on India to create an “enabling environment for further progress” in bilateral relations following Thursday’s surprise announcement about both countries recommitting themselves to the 2003 ceasefire on the Line of Control (LoC).In a set of tweets marking the second anniversary of Pakistan’s retaliatory air strikes after the Indian Air Force (IAF) targeted a Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) camp at Balakot in 2019, Khan also said India must take steps to meet the Kashmiri people’s right to self-determination.Pakistan, he added, is ready to move forward to resolve “all outstanding issues through dialogue”.“I welcome restoration of the ceasefire along the LoC. The onus of creating an enabling environment for further progress rests with India,” Khan tweeted.“India must take necessary steps to meet the long-standing demand & right of the Kashmiri people to self determination acc to UNSC resolutions,” he added.This was Khan’s first formal reaction to the decision by the armies of India and Pakistan on February 25 to strictly adhere to the truce on the LoC, following his return from an official visit to Sri Lanka this week.There was no immediate response from Indian officials to Khan’s tweets.The ceasefire, which was put in place in November 2003, has frayed due to thousands of violations in the past few years. The decision by both sides to recommit themselves to the truce was the apparent outcome of behind the scenes contacts between senior security officials of the two countries.The external affairs ministry had said on Thursday that the ceasefire agreement didn’t amount to a change of India’s position on key issues related to Pakistan.“India desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan. We have always maintained that we are committed to addressing issues, if any, in a peaceful and bilateral manner,” ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had said.“On key issues, our position remains unchanged. I don’t need to reiterate it,” he added.Khan also hailed the role of Pakistan’s armed forces in the air strikes that were launched on the LoC by his country on February 27, 2019, following IAF’s bombing of the JeM facility in Balakot in retaliation for the suicide attack at Pulwama that had killed 40 Indian troopers.The air strikes triggered aerial battles between combat aircraft of the two countries and Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman of the IAF was shot down in a dog fight. He was captured and briefly detained by Pakistan before Khan announced during a speech in Parliament that Varthaman would be freed.“I congratulate the entire nation & salute our Armed Forces on the 2nd Anniversary of our response to India's illegal, reckless military adventure of air strikes against Pakistan. As a proud & confident nation, we responded with determined resolve at a time & place of our choosing,” Khan tweeted.“We also demonstrated to the world Pakistan’s responsible behaviour in the face of India's irresponsible military brinkmanship, by returning the captured Indian pilot. We have always stood for peace & remain ready to move forward to resolve all outstanding issues through dialogue,” he said in another tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-pm-says-onus-on-india-for-progress-after-loc-ceasefire-101614399421694.html
27-02-2021||India||New variants, negligence among reasons for fresh Covid-19 spread, say experts||India has seen a resurgence in the number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases. In the last two days, the country has recorded more than 16,000 new cases and over 100 fatalities.The worst affected states are Maharashtra and Kerala, which account for a bulk of these new cases. But apart from their contribution, there are a number of other factors which are being blamed for the spike in Covid-19 caseload in the country.Here are the big reasons for the spike:Dip in the number of people being tested for Covid-19: According to Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) cited by Hindustan Times' sister publication Livehindustan, 10 lakh samples were being tested everyday in September last year. By February this year, the number was reduced to 7-8 lakh per day, according to Livehindustan. In a 24-hour period (till Friday morning), 8,31,807 samples were tested for Covid-19. Overall, 21,46,61,465 samples have been tested for the infection in the country.Uptick in the rate of positivity: Though the number of samples being tested for Covid-19 has come down, the positivity rate has constantly remained over five per cent, said Livehindustan. Last month, the positivity rate was above six per cent, and has decreased marginally, but is still over 5 per cent. According to World Health Organization (WHO), the positivity rate has to stay below 5 per cent for two weeks to effectively control the pandemic.The effect of new variants of the coronavirus: The health ministry said recently that at least 180 cases of the new variant of Covid-19 found in the United Kingdom have been recorded in India. Apart from that, there are a few suspected cases of Brazil and South African variants too. And, some new variants have also been discovered in the country. According to epidemiologist Shahid Jameel, India has been able to cross the peak of the disease without much damage, but that doesn't mean it is safe from a second wave.Negligence: Experts say that a major reason for the decrease in the spread of the infection is because a big chunk of the population developed anti-bodies against the infection. They point to the results of the sero surveys carried out in the past few months. These fall in numbers led to negligence on part of the general public, which resulted in the spike in Covid-19 case, said experts, like the one witnessed in Maharashtra. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and health authorities in India's worst-affected state have warned people to not take Covid-19 lightly and keep following government guidelines, including wearing of face masks. Thousands of people have been penalised in the state for not wearing masks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-is-covid-19-again-spreading-in-india-here-are-the-big-reasons-101614399383403.html

Covid-19-appropriate behaviour must be promoted and strictly enforced and the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) prescribed in respect of various permitted activities must be followed scrupulously, the ministry emphasised.The move comes in the backdrop of rising cases in several states, especially Maharashtra and Kerala, that have pushed the country's infection tally past 11.06 million. After witnessing a substantial decline, the share of active cases at 155,986 has again gone up marginally to 1.41%.According to the Union ministry of health and family welfare, 86% of the new cases are being reported from only six states.

27-02-2021||India||Showed utmost respect to protesting farmers, engaged in dialogue: India at UNHRC||The government has shown the utmost respect for protests by farmers and has remained engaged in dialogue with them to address their concerns pertaining to the farm laws, said India on Friday.Speaking at the General Debate on Oral Update of the High Commissioner at the 46th Session of Human Rights Council, Ambassador Indra Mani Pandey, Permanent Representative of India, said that the India has set a goal of doubling the income of farmers by 2024. The purpose of enacting three Farm Acts is to enable farmers to realise better price for their produce and enhance their income."The Government of India has set a goal of doubling the income of farmers by 2024. The purpose of enacting three Farm Acts is to enable farmers to realise better price for their produce and enhance their income. It will particularly benefit small farmers and offer more choices to those farmers who opt for them. The Government has shown utmost respect for protests by farmers and has remained engaged in dialogue with them to address their concerns," Pandey said.The envoy pointed out the constitutional changes in the status of Jammu and Kashmir made by Parliament in August 2019 was a "historic decision" that has been welcomed by the people of India, including people of Jammu and Kashmir."It has given impetus to socio-economic development, end decades of discrimination and combat cross border terrorism, which has been the key hindrance in full enjoyment of human rights by the people. We have restored grassroots democracy, through District Development Council (DDC) elections, and provided good governance through the 'Back to Village' initiative," he added.He stated there has been a significant decline in terrorist attacks and progressive national laws have been extended to Jammu and Kashmir to enable the people there to enjoy the same rights as the people in rest of India.India's response comes as Michelle Bachelet, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said that charges of sedition against journalists and activists for reporting or commenting on the farmer's protests, and attempts to curb freedom of expression on social media, are "disturbing departures from essential human rights principles."Pandey called the remarks "lacking" in "objectivity and impartiality"."Given these developments, we were perplexed to note some of the comments by the High Commissioner. She appeared as oblivious of the enormous efforts made by my Government to address the challenges, as indeed of many of the factors driving these challenges," the envoy said."The unprovoked violence on our Republic Day in the name of farmers' rights, apparently, left her unmoved. Her indifference to terrorism is, of course, not new. Objectivity and impartiality have to be the hallmarks of any Human Rights assessment. We are sorry to see that the High Commissioner's oral update is lacking in both," he added.Hundreds of thousands of farmers, from the northern Indian states of Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting against the newly enacted three farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/showed-utmost-respect-to-protesting-farmers-engaged-in-dialogue-india-at-unhrc-101614390157384.html
27-02-2021||India||Pak went back on its F-16 promise to US. How India fixed the gaps with Rafale||When the French President’s diplomatic advisor Emmanuel Bonne landed in India for a strategic dialogue on January 7, one of the key asks from the Indian Air Force was that the Rafale fighter’s technology, especially its missile capability, be kept away from Pakistan.India conveyed to Bonne that even though Dassault Aviation, manufacturer of Rafale fighter, is selling the omni-role platform Rafale to Qatar, Paris should ensure that no Pakistani-origin person is given access to the plane by Doha.Paris hasn’t just assured India that Rafale technology, specially that related to the Meteor air-to-air missile will be kept out of reach of Pakistan, but also that it will no longer upgrade the Mirage 3/5 fighters or Augusta 90 B submarines in Islamabad’s military inventory. India sought these iron clad guarantees after it burnt its fingers during Pakistani Air Force retaliation on February 27, 2019, a day after the Balakot strike.On that day, Pakistan reneged on its promise to the Americans that it would only use F-16 aircraft in the war against terror and not against India. It was an 75-km range air-to-air AIM-120-C-5 missile, fired from a Pakistani F-16, that brought down Wing Commander Abhinandan’s Mig-21 Bison interceptor on the Line of Control in the Rajouri-Mendhar sector.According to former Air Force Chiefs and Air Marshals, had the Indian Air Force not practised with the premise that Pakistan would use F-16 and beyond visual range missiles against India, more Indian fighters would have been knocked down on that day. “We were very clear that Pakistan would use the F-16 against us and hence we practised to keep IAF fighters beyond what is called dynamic attack zone 1 and 2 or D-Max 1 and 2 of the AIM-120C air to air missile,” said a top IAF official who asked not to be named.D-Max-1 refers to a range where a missile can “secure a kill” provided the opponent doesn’t engage in manoeuvring, and D-Max-2, a no escape zone from the incoming missile even after “all manoeuvring”, added this officer.The Pentagon had previously assured India that Islamabad would not use the F-16 or the missiles against India. It conveyed the message to India after New Delhi requested Washington to put a software lock on the missile so that it cannot be used against India.The Indian concern over the long range missile was raised by Air Marshal AK Gogoi as Director General (Air Operations) with the Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen in Washington in September 2010. It was raised again during the visit of Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar in August 2016 with US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter in no uncertain terms. But all this came to no avail two years ago. Not only did Pakistan use the missile (parts of which were recovered) against India on February 27, 2019, but it also glossed over the F-16 that Wing Commander Abhinandan shot down using a Russian R 73 missile.Analysts say that the F-16 incident may have well forced the Indian Air Force to acquire the Meteor missile for Rafale. The no escape zone of this missile is way beyond the missiles carried by US or Chinese aircraft flown by the Pakistani air force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-went-back-on-its-f-16-promise-to-us-how-india-fixed-the-gaps-with-rafale-101614367538883.html
27-02-2021||India||US senator bats for including India in Trans-Pacific Partnership||The US needs to look at India as a potential addition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a top American senator has advised the Biden administration.The partnership was a proposed trade agreement between Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam and the US signed on February 4, 2016. However, former president Donald Trump withdrew the US' signature from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) in January 2017.In the absence of the US, the rest of the countries negotiated a new trade agreement called the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, which incorporates most of the provisions of the TPP, and it came into force on December 30, 2018.The suggestion by Republican Senator John Cornyn came as the Joe Biden administration is looking to rejoin the TPP."I would suggest that we look at India as a potential addition to the TPP. We've grown much closer to India. Of course, they're the world's largest democracy, one that believes in the rule of law as we do, and a great counterweight as well," Cornyn said on Friday.He was speaking during the confirmation hearing of Katherine C Tai for the position of US Trade Representative."We have entered into what's known as the quad when it comes to national security cooperation with India, and I think it would be appropriate to include India in those discussions as well. I guess that's not so much a question as it is a statement," the senator said.In November 2017, India, Japan, the US and Australia gave shape to the long-pending proposal of setting up the "Quad" to develop a new strategy to keep the critical sea routes in the Indo-Pacific free of any influence.Making a reference of China, Cornyn said that the US needs to improve its negotiating position on economic and national security matters by allying with friends."So, I would certainly encourage... and the administration to look at re-entering that (TPP). I thought that was a good idea by the Obama administration. And, I regret that the Trump administration decided only bilateral trade agreements made sense and not multilateral agreements, especially under these unique circumstances," said the Republican Senator from Texas.US Senator from Montana Steve Daines during the hearing raised the issue of high tariffs imposed by India on pulses from the US."Access to India's pulse crop market is very important for our Montana farmers, for Montana jobs, and for our economy. Fortunately, as you know, US pulse crops face high tariffs. A very unfair playing field there with India," he said.Last year, several senators wrote a letter to the then president, Trump, urging him to prioritise the issue."He (Trump) took that letter directly to Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi, in fact. In fact, the president sent me back a picture as he hand-delivered that letter to Prime Minister Modi during a visit," Daines said.He also asked if the US will commit to engage with India on this issue and prioritise the removal of those tariffs and other barriers to trade.Responding to the Montanan senator, Tai said, "I know that our interests with India are manifold. I commit to you to having an awareness of the importance of pulse crops trade.""And if confirmed, I look forward to engaging with the Indians on our trade relationship and will keep the pulse crops in mind,” she said.On the question of TPP, Tai said even in 2021, the basic formula of TPP which was to work with partners and with whom the US has very important shared interests, economically and strategically and with the challenge of China in mind, is still a sound formula.“I think that the formula for TPP, which is for the US to engage robustly with countries and economies with which it has a lot of shared interests, economic interests and also strategic interests, in particular with respect to those interests in Asia and with respect to the challenges coming from China, that is a solid equation, if you will,” Tai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-senator-bats-for-including-india-in-trans-pacific-partnership-101614386570367.html
27-02-2021||India||Kejriwal arrives in Surat to a hero’s welcome: You people did a miracle, he tells residents||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal arrived in Surat to a victor’s welcome on Friday, with hundreds cheering him on as he took out a road show to thank the people of the diamond city for electing his party as the chief opposition party in the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC).In the recently concluded civic body polls, the AAP won 27 of 120 seats in the Surat Municipal Corporation in its debut appearance, thereby emerging the main opposition party against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which won 93 seats. The Congress and other parties could not open their account in the municipality.Amid allegations by some AAP winners that the BJP was trying to make them defect, Kejriwal cautioned his party workers and said, “The BJP will try to poach you by pressure or by luring you. But stay united and inform the party if you receive such a call from the BJP.”Kejriwal, whose party had scored a zero in the state in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, was visiting Gujarat for the first time in seven years. He had stayed away even during the campaigning for the local body polls, and deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had managed the party’s campaign.Addressing a massive gathering in Surat on Friday, Kejriwal said, “Aapko Surat ki janta ney vipaksh ka kaam diya hai, unki (ruling BJP) naani yaad dila dena, ek bhi galat kaam mat hone dena (People of Surat have chosen you as the opposition party, don’t allow any corruption in the civic body).”“All of Gujarat should know that we have arrived and won’t brook any illegal activities. People of Gujarat should know that a different politics is happening in Surat,” he said.Kejriwal said the entire country was discussing the AAP’s entry into Gujarat, especially in Surat. “Logon ne kamaal kar diya (You people did a miracle),” an elated AAP chief said, as hundreds cheered him.Although his party won only 27 seats, Kejriwal’s roadshow in Surat was like a veritable victory procession. For AAP, as he himself said, opening an electoral account in Gujarat, a BJP stronghold, was in itself an achievement.Kejriwal had a word of caution for his party workers to remain grounded and not get complacent.Reacting to Kejriwal’s assertions, Gujarat BJP’s chief spokesperson Yamal Vyas said, “The AAP had fielded more than 450 candidates and some 300 of them lost their deposits. They got some seats, so what. We don’t have much to say, let them celebrate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-surat-delhi-cm-kejriwal-hails-aap-s-poll-performance-101614379478480.html
27-02-2021||India||23 Cong letter writers plan drive to ‘save idea of India’||The group of 23 Congress leaders who demanded an overhaul in the 135-year-old party are launching a nationwide campaign to “save the idea of India’’. The series of rallies and public meetings will kick off on Saturday in Jammu, where former Rajya Sabha member of Parliament Ghulam Nabi Azad, one of the 23, has invited his colleagues. According to two people aware of the details, Anand Sharma, Manish Tiwari, Bhupinder Hooda, Vivek Tankha and Kapil Sibal, also among the 23, will join him in Jammu.“He asked us to be there and so we will all go in a show of solidarity,’’ said one of the 23. The plan is to have two public meetings on Saturday, and another on Sunday. “We are going to have this across the country. After Jammu, we have planned in Ludhiana and Kurukshetra,’’ this person added.It wasn’t immediately clear whether the Congress and its local units would be involved in these meetings.Last August, the 23 leaders wrote a letter to Congress President Sonia Gandhi in which they called for “full-time and effective leadership”, elections to the Congress Working Committee (CWC), and a mechanism guide the party’s revival. The issues were discussed, but no resolution found, at a fractious Jan 22 meeting of the Congress Working Committee. Subsequent party appointments have seen younger leaders who want Rahul Gandhi back as the party president being given precedence in organisational appointments over some of the signatories.The ostensible trigger for the public meetings is to honour Azad, a Congress veteran who retired from Parliament after four decades, but it would also appear to be a platform for them to discuss the road ahead. The internal party poll for president has been postponed to after the assembly elections.“It (the meeting) is part of a larger effort to galvanise all patriotic nationalistic forces to come together and save the idea of India,’’ said the first person. He confirmed that they would also campaign in the upcoming elections, but for the party.“Our messaging will be to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party, to save India from becoming a majoritarian nation.”A second signatory said the meetings are also a message to the Congress high command. “We want to tell the party leadership that we are united, we have an issue and they must do something about it,’’ he added on condition of anonymity.On Friday, Azad arrived in Jammu on a three-day visit and was received by party workers. The Congress will contest the coming assembly elections in four states and a Union territory with its full might, he said in a single-line response to a swarm of media persons outside the party office, to which he was taken after landing, and where he was received by JKPCC president GA Mir, former minister Mula Ram, and other senior leaders.A Congress leader told HT that it wasn’t an event just for the letter writers. “Our state unit wants to felicitate Mr Azad and an invitation went out to all Congress leaders and so many are attending,’’ he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/23-cong-letter-writers-plan-drive-to-save-idea-of-india-101614374624491.html

WGAD’s report is yet to be released.External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said there were selective leaks of the opinion of WGAD on Michel’s case. “We regret that the conclusions drawn by the Working Group are based on limited information, biased allegations from an unidentified source and on an inaccurate understanding of India’s criminal justice system,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-rejects-united-nations-panel-report-on-christian-michel-101614374660634.html

The counsel for the former judge then withdrew the appeal against the high court’s order. The complainant had also moved an application for conciliation and to end the enquiry. The application was rejected by GSICC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cant-ignore-complaints-of-sexual-harassment-supreme-court-101614374377904.html
27-02-2021||India||Harming reputation ground for divorce, says Supreme Court||A divorce can be granted when the reputation of the spouse is sullied amongst his colleagues, his superiors and the society at large, ruled the Supreme Court on Friday, as it allowed the petition of an army officer whose wife wrote several complaints against him to his superiors and to women’s rights bodies.An SC bench, headed by justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, held that such demeanour by a wife will certainly amount to inflicting cruelty on the man, and will be grounds for divorce under marital laws.“When the reputation of the spouse is sullied amongst his colleagues, his superiors and the society at large, it would be difficult to expect condonation of such conduct by the affected party... In circumstances like this, the wronged party cannot be expected to continue with the matrimonial relationship and there is enough justification for him to seek separation,” said the bench, which also included justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy.The bench emphasised that when the career and reputation of a spouse were severely damaged because of the conduct of the other partner, it could not be expected of the former to reconcile and agree to live together again.Authoring the judgment, justice Roy underlined that mental cruelty, as a ground for divorce, had to be understood keeping in mind the background, the level of education and the status of the couple in order to determine whether the conduct in question was such that it would justify dissolution of a marriage.“The degree of tolerance will vary from one couple to another... no uniform standard can be laid down and each case will have to be decided on its own facts,” said the bench, holding an army officer could not be ordered to put up with a spouse who dented his career and reputation.The bench also accepted the submissions by senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, who represented the army officer, that his client, who was made to stand a commission of inquiry over charges of adultery on the complaint of his wife, could not be now directed by a court to live with her under the same roof.In this case, the man and the woman got married in September 2007 in Dehradun but they were soon separated after the wife left the matrimonial home and went to live with her parents after a few months.A spate of litigation followed. The wife filed cases for maintenance, and FIRs under charges of cheating, dowry demands and breach of trust. The husband, on the other hand, sought divorce on the ground of cruelty and desertion.The husband also got a decree of divorce from a court in Visakhapatnam, where his parents were settled, in February 2009. But this plea was later withdrawn by the man on a petition by the wife in the Supreme Court in 2011. The top court asked the man to file a fresh petition of divorce at a court in Dehradun where the wife lived.Both the husband and the wife then went to a Dehradun court where the man pressed for divorce while the woman asked for restitution of conjugal rights and a direction to her husband to start living with her again. The family court ruled in favour of the man and gave divorce. However, when the woman filed an appeal against this order, the Uttarakhand high court set aside the decree of divorce.The SC found it to be a fit case of granting divorce, saying the “high court was in error in describing the broken relationship as normal wear and tear of middle class married life.” It took note of the complaints written by the wife to her husband’s superiors and also to the state women commission because of which his “career and reputation had suffered”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/harming-reputation-ground-for-divorce-says-supreme-court-101614374231891.html
27-02-2021||India||India out of recession as GDP expands 0.4% in Q3||The Indian economy came out of contraction zone in the second half of the current fiscal year as lockdown restrictions were eased significantly, economic activities resumed, and the government increased its capital expenditure.India’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew at 0.4% on a year-on-year basis in the quarter ending December 2020, according to data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on February 26. A Reuters poll of economists had projected this number to be 0.5%. The economy suffered an annual contraction of 24.4% and 7.3% in the quarters ending June 2020 and September 2020, as per revised data released on Friday. This was largely a result of the lockdown’s disruption to economic activity. India imposed a 68-day-long lockdown — it was among the most stringent in the world — beginning March 25.To be sure, the Indian economy will still face its largest ever contraction in the current fiscal year. According to the second advanced estimates of GDP in 2020-21, released along with the December quarter numbers, GDP is expected to contract by 8% in 2020-21.High frequency indicators such as the Nomura India Business Resumption Index (NIBRI) suggest that the economy is already back to pre-pandemic levels. NIBRI touched 99.3 – 100 is the pre-pandemic base — in the week ending February 21. Even though Covid-19 cases are rising again in some states, as of now, India seems to have escaped a second wave of infections. Expediting the vaccination programme, which is what the government seems to have done by opening up vaccines for people above 60 years of age and those aged 45 or above with co-morbidities, could help contain the pandemic in the days to come.While the latest GDP numbers are in line with the narrative of strong sequential recovery in the economy, questions remain on the nature of ongoing recovery, and its ability to sustain after returning to pre-pandemic levels. Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE), which accounts for more than 50% of the GDP, was still in contraction zone (2.4%) in the December quarter, even as corporate profits continue to soar. This is in keeping with fears of the current recovery not being broad based. The index of eight core sector industries grew at just 0.1% in January. Experts point out that this is a reflection of tepid growth in green-field activities.One positive surprise in the December quarter numbers is a 2.6% growth in investment, as measured by gross fixed capital formation. That this has happened despite private consumption being in contraction zone and consumer sentiment, according to the Reserve Bank of India’s Consumer Confidence Indices, continuing to be weak, could be a result of aggressive capital expenditure (capex) by the central government. Data from Controller General of Accounts, which works under the ministry of finance, shows that the central government spent ₹1.33 lakh crore in capex in the December quarter, which is 80% of what it had spent in the first two quarters of the fiscal year. The January 2021 capex number shows a minor decline compared to December, which suggests that the fourth quarter could see some moderation in the capex push. To be sure, Government Final Consumption Expenditure (GFCE), which accounts for around 10% of GDP, also shows a contraction (1.1%) in the December quarter, which suggests that the capex push might be accompanied with rationalisation of government spending in other areas.A sector-wise analysis of the Gross Value Added (GVA) numbers shows that services are the only broad activity-group which continues to be in contraction zone in the December quarter. Among the two most employment intensive sectors after agriculture, construction has shown a GVA growth of 6.2% while trade, hotel, transport, storage and communication contracted by 7.7%. Agriculture, in keeping with predictions of a record kharif harvest, is expected to grow at 3.9% on an annual basis. Manufacturing grew at 1.7%, although this could be due to a favourable base effect, as the sector contracted by 2.9% in December 2019.Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at CARE Ratings, called for caution in placing too much optimism in the GVA numbers for construction, given the fact that core sector index for cement production has been contracting for three months since November 2020. “Core sector industries presented a flat growth rate of just 0.1% after 0.2% in December. This anaemic growth is a concern as it has a weight of nearly 40% in the IIP (index of industrial production, a measure of factory output) and reflects physical production that has now declined by 8.8% for the year. Therefore, while the monetary value-added number has been positive, the same does not hold here,” he said. “Cement has now de-grown for three months which is disappointing as this reflects developments in the construction sector which was expected to pick up. Quite clearly the mood in the real estate sector has not recovered as the focus is on disposing-off inventory rather than going in for new projects,” Sabnavis added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-out-of-recession-as-gdp-expands-0-4-in-q3-101614373888524.html
27-02-2021||India||‘Peace on LAC must to mend ties’: Jaishankar tells Chinese counterpart||External affairs minister S Jaishankar has told his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi that bilateral ties can only be repaired by maintaining peace and tranquillity in border areas and completing the disengagement of frontline troops at all friction points on the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Jaishankar’s blunt message was conveyed to Wang during a 75-minute phone conversation on Thursday — the first formal contact between the two ministers since they met on the margins of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting in Moscow last September.The continuing differences between the two sides were evident in the Chinese foreign ministry’s readout of the conversation, which quoted Wang as saying that the boundary dispute is “an objective fact” but it wasn’t the “whole of China-India relations” and should be put in a “proper place in the overall bilateral relations”. This was perceived as the Chinese side’s keenness to take forward ties in other areas such as trade while setting aside the standoff.The two ministers also agreed to establish a hotline to facilitate timely communications and exchange of views.The conversation came days after India and China pulled back frontline troops from strategic heights around Pangong Lake along with armoured vehicles and artillery last week, and Jaishankar said it is necessary for the two sides to “quickly resolve the remaining issues along the LAC in eastern Ladakh”.“It was necessary to disengage at all friction points in order to contemplate de-escalation of forces in this [Ladakh] sector. That alone will lead to the restoration of peace and tranquillity and provide conditions for progress of our bilateral relationship,” Jaishankar was quoted as saying in a statement issued by the external affairs ministry.He added that once disengagement is completed at all friction points, the two sides “could look at broader de-escalation of troops in the area”. Jaishankar noted that both countries had always agreed that maintaining peace and tranquillity in the border areas was “essential basis for development of bilateral relations”, and a “prolongation of the existing situation was not in the interest of either side”.A senior South Block official, who didn’t want to be named said: “Normalcy and a border dispute cannot run in parallel as Beijing wants. China has not told India why it attempted to change the status quo at Pangong Tso in May 2020 and why it withdrew 10 months later.”Jaishankar, the official added, presented his diagnosis of the hurdles to resumption of normal bilateral ties to Wang, and the steps needed to turn back the clock.Indian and Chinese military commanders held the 10th round of talks on February 20, which lasted a marathon 16 hours, to discuss disengagement at other friction points such as Depsang, Hot Springs and Gogra. However, there hasn’t been any announcement on extending disengagement to other sectors.The Indian statement said Jaishankar reminded Wang of their conversation in Moscow last September, when the Indian side expressed concern over “provocative behaviour and unilateral attempts of the Chinese side to alter status quo”. Jaishankar noted bilateral ties have been “impacted severely”, and the boundary question may take time to resolve but “disturbance of peace and tranquillity including by violence, will inevitably have a damaging impact on the relationship”.He added the two sides also decided in Moscow that border troops should quickly disengage and ease tensions.According to the Chinese readout, Wang described boundary disputes as an “objective fact” that should be taken seriously, but he said this isn’t “the whole of China-India relations, and it should be put at a proper place in the overall bilateral relations”.China and India, Wang said, should “work together for shared progress rather than erecting walls against each other”, and suggested the two sides can “begin from easier things and proceed incrementally so as to build enabling conditions for a better relationship and greater practical cooperation”.Wang also said the two sides should commit to the consensus reached by their leaders and “handle the boundary question properly to prevent the bilateral relationship from sinking into a negative cycle”.The Chinese readout was silent on addressing the other friction points, and Wang only said the ground situation had noticeably eased after disengagement at Pangong Lake. “It is imperative for the two sides to cherish the hard-won relaxation, and work together to consolidate the progress, keep up the consultation momentum, further ease the situation, and improve the border management and control mechanisms,” Wang said.Wang also sought to again blame India for the standoff at the LAC. He said: “There has been some wavering and back-pedalling in India’s China policy, and practical cooperation between the two countries has been affected.”The Indian statement said Wang noted the Indian side’s proposal of “three mutuals” — mutual respect, mutual sensitivity and mutual interests — as the approach to the relationship, and that he agreed on the “importance of taking the long view of our ties”.Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said the disengagement at Pangong Lake has created hope for giving momentum to de-escalation at other friction points. “The Indian side wants to strike while the iron is hot and get the disengagement at other places. We need to keep the focus on this issue, and that’s reflected in the external affairs minister’s remarks. India can’t allow any diversions or give any leeway to the other side,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/peace-on-lac-must-to-mend-ties-jaishankar-tells-chinese-counterpart-101614373586833.html
27-02-2021||India||Business of liquor needs a major detox||Liquor sales and excise duty form one of the most important streams of income for the Delhi government but labyrinthine rules, underperforming government shops, brand suppression, malpractice in registration, and an opaque cabal of operators controlling the business in the city are forcing the administration to haemorrhage revenue, experts say.In 2019-20, the city government pegged its revenue from the liquor business at ₹5,500 crore -- roughly 11% of its total revenue of ₹51,000 crore. Among major states, an HT analysis showed only in Karnataka and Telangana, liquor revenue formed a bigger percentage of the state’s revenue.This is crucial because unlike major states, Delhi sits on a smaller revenue base. The problem, experts said, is made worse by the city’s high legal drinking age and several dry days.An expert committee formed last year calculated that the liquor revenue can rise to ₹7,651 crore just by plugging some of the obvious loopholes and cracking down on the liquor mafia. Some government officials say that it can even be doubled or trebled if the system is cleaned up and progressive rules are put in place.“If you look at it in a collective way, it is huge…in most cases, number of transactions are high and it gets difficult to prove such cases even though we can smell something fishy. So, we are now trying to address the root of the problem,” said a senior excise department official.According to experts, the liquor business in Delhi is shrouded in opacity and controlled by a handful of individuals or groups. They steer the wholesale procurement of brands, dictate terms and commissions to major brands for getting stocked in shops, some of them duplicate bar codes and game the registration process to push off-the-book manufacturers, and even facilitate the illegal transport of liquor from neighbouring states into the city and ensure that a majority of retailers only sell brands approved by them. HT has raised several of these points in the first four parts of this series.Officials say the large-scale corruption and irregularity starts at the procurement level, and thrives in a murky system where customers get 10 seconds in front of a window grille before being shoved aside, pilferage is unchecked and oversight lax, and no one has a clear handle on stocks, procurement or revenue figures.The fallout of is multifold: Dissatisfied customers who have to jostle to grab whatever bottle the retailer is pushing, annoyed buyers not being able to buy their brand of choice because the shopkeeper is being paid a commission to suppress it. It results not only in poor customer experience but also in loss of revenue to the state.“The reforms are needed as a mitigation measure to such cartelisation, and hence, the committee has proposed a lottery system for retail vends and also suggested fixing targets on VAT per vend which would have to be achieved annually,” a government official said on condition of anonymity.The government believes its new proposed excise policy can help cover the lacunae, and has identified five pain points that are symptoms of a larger malaise.One, the problem of duplicating mandatory bar codes – crucial to tracking revenue and checking leakage -- attached to each bottle of liquor sold in Delhi. The city government doesn’t have a role in liquor wholesale, which is managed by 77 private vendors. Officials say there is a big racket in the “liquor mafia” of slapping duplicated bar codes on non-duty paid liquor (NDPL), from which the government receives no revenue.This also means that the government has very little control over other malpractices such as brand pushing and brand suppression, because duplicate bar codes make tracing off-the-books brands almost impossible. This is a violation of Section 33 of the Delhi Excise Act and punishable with a jail term of up to three years and a penalty of up to ₹1 lakh.“Although it is tough to attribute a percentage to the menace in terms of revenue loss, the practice of sticking duplicate barcodes on liquor bottles is quite frequent. Last year, we registered an FIR against a private liquor shop in Pitampura after our enforcement team found duplicate barcodes pasted 12 cases of whisky bottles. In 2019, we banned the world’s largest brewer from selling its products in Delhi for three years as we found that barcodes were being duplicated by its acquired company and supplied to the retail outlets to evade payment of excise duty,” said a second excise official.Two, license fees on retail liquor vends are low and the slabs unevenly spread. Setting up a retail liquor shop currently costs anywhere between ₹4 lakh to ₹8 lakh depending on the category of license applied for.A 40-seat resto bar located in an upmarket commercial space such as Connaught Place pays the same license fee as one located in Dilshad Garden or Seelampur. The license fee is calculated based on seating, and the rates differ on whether an establishment has 48 covers or 96 covers, and so on.The expert committee suggested this policy be discontinued, and license rates be hiked to ₹75 lakh per licensee for private vends.But Prakul Kumar, secretary general of the national restaurants association of India (NRAI), disagreed, underlining that establishments in areas such as Khan Market and Connaught Place paid much higher rent. “The government should ensure that the revised license fee does not add to their burden, especially at a time when the industry is recovering after the Covid-19 pandemic.”Three, the existing regime for brand registration is not revenue accretive because a brand with sales volume of a few thousand bottles or less pays the same fees as paid by a brand with a sales volume of one million cases a year. In addition, the current rules facilitate the registration of cheap brands of whisky and rum with cost up to ₹140 with a minimum-sale criteria. The government’s revenues from these brands are the lowest and these makes are often pushed at the cost of more premium variants, say officials.To resolve this, the expert committee recommended the reduction of brand registration fee across all categories, and the abolishing rum and whisky brands below ₹140 so that quality products are made available. It has also recommended to set a sales volume criteria to give an opportunity to niche players to enter the market with quality products.Another problem is the capping in profit margin of Indian Made Foreign Liquor and Foreign Liquor to ₹50 and ₹100 respectively, which has remained unchanged for six years. This discourages retailers to place purchase orders for premium brands due to the ceiling on the margins. The lopsided license registration system – which places 80% of IMFL in one slab – has also been overhauled .Four, the low numbers and uneven distribution of liquor stores. Delhi has one of the lowest densities of liquor stores with respect to population, and this encourages bootlegging and illicit trade from other states. Out of the 272 municipal wards in the city, 70 have no liquor shops. No new license allotment for opening liquor shops has happened since 2016.Delhi has 720 liquor shops – of which 460 are run by government agencies and 260 by private individuals and agencies . The expert committee plans to change this by increasing the number of shops to 916, with more equitable distribution across municipal wards.However, Bhoob Singh, a member of the Delhi Alcobev Retailers Association, a group of 107 retailers in the city, said: “The government should allot new licenses for underserved and unserved areas but they should not bring existing license holders under its equitable distribution plan.”Another problem is “mixing”, where some bars switch out premium, registered brands with local, unregistered makes without the knowledge of the consumer. It not only vexes buyers but also hurts revenue because governments earn far more per bottle from premium brands as excise duty, the officials added.“It has happened with me so many times. But there are no means to check,” said advertisement executive Ankit Sharma.A senior excise department official said the administration receives many such complaints every year, singling out a 2017 incident when the department raided a popular restobar and found irregularities between orders recorded for some expensive brands and their actual stock. “We suspended the bar’s license for that year,” said the official.Kumar said any instances of mixing should not happen at all.Five, the presence of government in the liquor retail business is a high investment, low returns model. Experts say government shops make up the bulk of the retailers but are poorly managed, grimy and often don’t stock premium brands that earn the government more revenue. A government document showed that for six premium brands of liquor, the revenue generated by private vends outstripped that by government shops three to one.“The revenue contribution by the government vends is almost equal to the private shops in spite of Delhi having 40% more government vends. The average contribution per vend of government corporation in terms of excise duty is ₹5 crore annual in comparison to ₹8 crore per private vend. Further, corporation or government vends fall short in providing a congenial consumer experience in terms of choice and brand availability,” a third excise official said.Moreover, the chain of government ownership is complex and involves four agencies: Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation (DTTDC), Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (DSIIDC), Delhi State Civil Supplies Corporation Ltd (DSCSC) and Delhi Consumer’s Cooperative Wholesale Store Ltd. (DCCWS).“It would make sense for the government to reduce its presence the retail sector, or even exit altogether. The government shops are anyway not contributing to improving customer experience or revenues,” said Vivek Makhija, a Delhi-based businessman.“Government moving out of retail would mean more private shops and that would contribute to improving buyers’ experience, if the government exits in a phased manner. Their exit at one go can give disproportionate power to private license holders and they may start taking calls on what brands to boycott or endorse,” said Vinod Giri, director-general of the Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies.Experts agree that it is the right direction to move in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/business-of-liquor-needs-a-major-detox-101614373058658.html
27-02-2021||India||Sops galore hours before poll schedule out||Divya Chandrababu and Joydeep GuptaHours before the Election Commission announced poll dates on Friday, sops ranging from reservation in jobs and admissions to wage hike to reduction in fuel prices were announced by functionaries of the election-bound states.Most number of sops came from Tamil Nadu chief minister E Palaniswami, who is trying to beat 10 years of incumbency. The state assembly unanimously passed a bill providing 10.5% reservation for influential Vanniyar community within the existing quota of 20% for the Most Backward Classes (MBC). The move will not increase the overall 69.5% reservation in government jobs and admissions in higher education in the state.With the announcement, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK)-led government met the longstanding demand of its ally, the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK). Soon after, a video started making rounds, showing a teary eyed former Union minister Anbumani Ramadoss sharing the news with his father and PMK founder. He could be heard in the video saying that the first step towards their “40-year struggle” has been met.Earlier in the state assembly, Palaniswami announced waiving gold loans up to six sovereigns taken from cooperative banks by the poor and farmers. An AIADMK member said it would mean waiving loans worth ₹11,306.11 crore outstanding in the state as of 31st May 2020 in the category of under-five sovereigns. Earlier, Palaniswami had waived ₹12,110-crore loans taken by 16,43 lakh farmers from cooperative banks. Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) president MK Stalin had in January promised to waive farm loans if his party was elected to power. Stalin on Friday called the move a “selfish election stunt”.In West Bengal, chief minister Mamata Banerjee announced an increase in daily wages of labourers working under the state’s Urban Employment Scheme. “I am pleased to announce a hike in the wages of daily wage workers under WB Urban Employment Scheme,” she tweeted.She said unskilled workers would get a daily wage of ₹202 per day, up from ₹144, while the same for semi-skilled labourers was raised to ₹303 from ₹172.Under the job scheme, the government introduced a new category for skilled workers, who will get a daily wage of ₹404, Banerjee said. These wages are in parity with rural workers’ enhanced pay (MNREGA unskilled & semi-skilled). The BJP, however, shot back saying that last minute sops won’t be able to save the Trinamool Congress (TMC).“We are happy that she announced it. At least the poor people would get some benefit. But this won’t be able to save the TMC. The people of Bengal have seen the true face of the TMC in the last 10 years. The TMC government has failed to provide DA to the government employees,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson in the state.In Puducherry, Lieutenant Governor Tamilsai Soundararajan announced reduction of Value Added Tax on fuel by 2% providing marginal relief to people. According to a statement by Raj Niwas, it would bring down the fuel prices by ₹1.2 per litre.In Assam, chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal on Friday appointed international athlete Hima Das to the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police. Das has been appointed under the Integrated Sports Policy of the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sops-galore-hours-before-poll-schedule-out-101614371783867.html
27-02-2021||India||Crucial election cycle in 5 states to start on March 27||Around 187 million people across five states in southern and eastern India will vote in 824 assembly seats for a month starting March 27, the election commission announced on Friday, kicking off the most crucial poll season since the general elections two years ago.Votes in Assam, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry will be counted on May 2, said chief election commissioner Sunil Arora. All Covid-19 election guidelines, including limiting the number of electors, regulating physical campaigning and road shows and sanitising booths and personnel, will be in place, he added.The commission has set up 270,000 polling stations for what will be the largest electoral exercise in the country since the coronavirus pandemic struck early last year.West Bengal, where a surging Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is looking to unseat the ruling Trinamool Congress, will vote in the highest number of phases: eight. The 294 assembly seats in the eastern state will go to the polls between March 27 and April 29.Polling for 234 seats in Tamil Nadu, 140 seats in Kerala and 30 seats in Puducherry will take place on April 6. Assam, with 126 assembly seats, will vote in three phases: March 27, April 1 and 6. Bypolls to Kanyakumari and Malappuram Lok Sabha seats will be also conducted on April 6.Tamil Nadu will witness traditional rivals Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) square off in the first state election without political stalwarts M Karunanidhi and J Jayalalithaa. Kerala will see the Left parties fight a Congress-led alliance to hold on to their last bastion and Puducherry will head to the polls under President’s Rule after its government fell four days ago. Assam will see a three-cornered fight between BJP, Congress and regional parties.“Last year, the entire world, when confronted with Covid-19, was figuring out how to balance the rights of citizens while protecting the health and safety of citizens,” said Arora, who demits office on April 13. “The commission used the Rajya Sabha elections and Bihar elections last year as a litmus to see how to conduct large-scale polls.”Arora said the nationwide vaccination drive made the situation more conducive to conduct elections. He said door-to-door campaigning will be restricted to five persons, including the candidate, while road shows will be allowed with a maximum of five vehicles. The number of electors per booth will also be limited to 1,000.The announcement of the month-long poll schedule in West Bengal stoked a controversy with CM Mamata Banerjee alleging the dates were suited to the BJP. “With all due respect to the Election Commission, I want to say questions are being raised on why elections will be held in so many phases in Bengal while other states will be voting in one phase,” she asked.But the EC dismissed the charges.”The elections to West Bengal (assembly) in 2016 were in seven phases. The Lok Sabha was in seven phases. So, 7 to 8 (phases) is not such a big deal because we have to see movement of forces, we also have to see the current charges and counter-charges,” said Arora.Bengal is expected to witness a pitched battle between the TMC, which is looking for a third straight term on the back of Banerjee’s mass popularity, and the BJP, which has rapidly expanded its presence and is hoping to form the government in the state for the first time.For decades, the BJP was a fringe player in Bengal but surged to 40% vote share in the 2019 general election and ended up with 18 seats, just behind the TMC’s tally of 22. The party is banking on PM Narendra Modi’s appeal, corruption charges against grassroots TMC leaders and Hindu mobilisation to carry it past the majority mark of 147.The BJP is also hoping to gain the support of refugee Dalit communities by promising them citizenship through the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which seeks to fast-track grant of Indian citizenship to persecuted Hindu, Buddhist, Sikhs, Jain, Parsi and Christian minorities from Muslim-majority Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Pakistan.In Tamil Nadu, the DMK and the AIADMK have traditionally swapped power, but Jayalalithaa made history when she returned to power in 2016. This is the first state election without the two stalwarts and parties are jockeying to claim their legacy.Observers will be watching AIADMK for signs of internal dissent after the emergence of former general secretary VK Sasikala from prison last month. The DMK alliance is led by Karunanidhi’s son MK Stalin, who is aiming to become the chief minister for the first time.In Kerala — another state where traditional rivals Left Democratic Front and United Democratic Front have alternated in power — the ruling LDF is fighting to keep the Left parties relevant in national politics. If the Congress-led UDF wins, the Left won’t be in power in any state. The BJP is also looking to make a mark, especially in the urban pockets of state capital Thiruvananthapuram.Assam is set to see a triangular contest between the ruling BJP coalition, a Congress-led alliance and a clutch of regional outfits born out of the fierce protests against the CAA. The 2019 election was held in the shadow of the National Register of Citizens (NRC), which left out 1.9 million people, and the impending CAA, which indigenous groups fear may trigger an influx of illegal immigrants.But since early 2020, implementation of CAA has been slow, and the rules not drafted. The NRC, too, has proceeded at a glacial pace. The BJP is hoping to retain power due to its social schemes while the Opposition is hoping to benefit from anti-CAA sentiment.Puducherry is heading to the polls in political turmoil and under President’s Rule. Its Congress-led government collapsed four days ago after failing to prove a majority due to a spate of resignations from its lawmakers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/crucial-election-cycle-in-5-states-to-start-on-march-27-101614369979732.html
27-02-2021||India||IAF adds muscle to firepower in 2 yrs since Balakot||The Indian Air Force (IAF) has strengthened its offensive capabilities significantly since the effective bombing of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) targets in Pakistan’s Balakot exactly two years ago, and the months-long border standoff with China saw IAF flex its muscle in the Ladakh theatre where it deployed cutting-edge weaponry that was inducted after the unprecedented cross-border strike on February 26, 2019.IAF’s Mirage-2000s struck targets in Balakot in response to the Pakistan-backed Pulwama suicide attack in Kashmir in which 40 CRPF troopers were killed on February 14.Frontline platforms, inducted over the last two years, form a critical part of IAF’s force projection in eastern Ladakh, and have demonstrated its capability to carry out day-and-night, all-weather combat missions in the sensitive theatre, said people familiar with the developments.The platforms inducted after the Balakot raid include Rafale fighter jets, missiles, smart air-to-ground weapons, AH-64E Apache attack helicopters, and CH-47F (I) Chinook multi-mission helicopters. To be sure, these acquisitions were planned years before the Balakot strikes, but were inducted during the last two years.Referring to some of the new acquisitions, experts said IAF’s fighter, helicopter and transport fleets played a crucial during the Ladakh standoff that began last May. A disengagement process underway in the sector has raised hopes for the resolution of the border row, but de-escalation of the conflict is still a long way off.IAF’s fighter fleet, reinforced with new Rafale jets, and the Apache attack helicopters sent a strong message to the Chinese, while Indian transport aircraft played a crucial role in the swift mobilisation of troops and equipment to forward areas, said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.He made a special mention of the capability brought to the table by the Rafale jets armed with ultra-modern armament such as Meteor beyond-visual-range missiles and Hammer air-to-ground munition — capabilities that were not available during Balakot.The need for Rafale jets with their superior weapons was felt during the dogfight with the Pakistan Air Force on February 27, a day after the Balakot raid.A professional force learns from every engagement, and the Balakot strike was no different, said Bahadur. “While ‘Balakot’ was only a strike mission, the long-drawn-out face-off with China brought to fore the massive airlift capability of IAF. The investment of planners more than a decade back proved its worth as the Indian Army inducted almost three divisions into Ladakh, along with heavy armour, using the transport fleet of IAF,” said Bahadur.The air force’s C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft were used to move soldiers, tanks and infantry combat vehicles to the Ladakh sector, while C-130J Super Hercules aircraft undertook sorties to the advanced landing ground in the strategic Daulat Beg Oldie sector to support the military’s deployments.The deployment of the Apache attack helicopters made it clear that Chinese mechanised formations would face a formidable foe, he said. Armed with fire-and-forget Hellfire missiles, an Apache can track up to 128 targets a minute and prioritise threats. The missiles equip the gunships with anti-armour capabilities.The induction of the Chinook multi-mission helicopters enhanced the IAF’s capabilities to transport troops and artillery to forward areas.“Some capability gaps still remain, especially of combat enablers like AWACS (airborne warning and control systems) and flight refuelling aircraft — deficiencies that the government must look into urgently,” Bahadur added.If the Balakot air strikes showed there was scope to use fighter jets for taking out targets in Pakistan below the threshold of conventional war, India’s firm actions in Ladakh have made it clear to the Chinese that the salami-slicing tactics in their playbook will not work against India, the people cited above said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iafadds-muscle-to-firepower-in-2-yrs-since-balakot-101614367865061.html
27-02-2021||India||‘Did not break any law’: Nodeep Kaur after HC grants bail||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday granted bail to labour rights activist Nodeep Kaur in an attempt to murder case while taking note of a medical examination report, which listed two simple injuries on her caused by a “blunt object”.Kaur was released from Karnal jail on Friday evening. Addressing mediapersons, Kaur said, “I did not break any law and cannot think of doing so in future. But I raise voice against exploitation of labourers and farmers by the big corporate houses. Such influential people cannot tolerate this and try to suppress their voice.”The activist was arrested on January 12 after she had participated in the farmer’s protests at Kundli in Haryana.The high court bench of justice Avneesh Jhingan, “It would be appropriate to say that the right to peaceful protest is circumscribed by a thin line. The crossing of line may change the colour of protest. It would be subject matter of trial as to whether the line for peaceful protest was crossed in the alleged incident or not.”It is debatable whether Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections of attempt to murder, assault on public servant and attempt of snatching (which could have caused death), could have been invoked by the police, the bench said.These issues would be dealt with during the trial, the bench said, further recoding that though the matter is under investigation but that itself would not be sufficient ground to deny personal liberty to Kaur. The court also refrained from commenting upon content of a video submitted by the government, in which, the police alleged, Kaur can be seen inciting protesters.The court further asked Kaur to maintain restraint while on bail to ensure that no law and order issue arises due to her actions.Kaur moved the high court seeking bail on February 22.Kaur’s counsel RS Cheema had told the court that she, along with some workers, were peacefully protesting against the non-payment of wages. Cheema also contested the attempt to murder charges invoked against Kaur.Opposing her bail, the police accused Kaur of trying to extort money from industrialists and inciting workers during the protest. According to police, a unit in Kundli was gheraoed on January 12 and its staff was manhandled by members of Kaur’s group. The police also accused her of making provocative speeches during the protest that resulted in clashes and injuries to seven police personnel, including a woman constable.Meanwhile, the medical examination report of the activist submitted in court recorded two injuries caused by a “blunt object”. The report termed them simple injuries.The examination was conducted on January 25, thirteen days after her arrest.While Kaur has alleged that she was physically assaulted by the police, the Haryana Police have denied the accusations.Three first information reports (FIR) were registered against Kaur and she has already been granted bail from the lower courts in two of the FIRs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/did-not-break-any-law-nodeep-kaur-after-hc-grants-bail-101614366410977.html
27-02-2021||India||SC rejects contempt plea, says tigress Avni killed in accordance with order||The Supreme Court on Friday closed contempt proceedings initiated against Maharashtra government officials over the death of man-eater tigress Avni in November 2018.The Court issued notices to Maharashtra principal secretary Vikas Kharge, principal chief conservator forests (Nagpur), deputy conservator forests (Nagpur), deputy conservator forests (Pandharkawada) and member secretary, NTCA, on February 10 on a petition filed by a wildlife activist Sangeeta Dogra.The petition raised doubts on the tigress being a man-eater and also pointed out that the forest officials violated the Supreme Court’s order of September 11, 2018, restraining any kind of celebrations over the death of the tigress.On Friday, the officials who were issued notices filed their responses, claiming that there are no grounds for contempt. They said that the order to shoot the tigress was confirmed by the top court itself in its September 2018 order. On the aspect of celebration, the officers stated that they had no knowledge about the function to felicitate the shooter as it was organised by villagers. This event did not involve forest officials, they submitted to the court.Dogra said in her petition that villagers arranged a felicitation function for the shooter, a professional hunter, on November 14, 2018. At the event, they presented a silver statue of tigress along with a cash reward to the hunter.The bench led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde and comprising justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said: “If villagers believe that they will not be attacked again and decide to celebrate, how can the forest officials ensure that they don’t celebrate?”The court took the statements of the officers on record and said, “We can’t review our earlier decision and say she was not a man-eater. Also, they are stating that villagers and not they (officials) had celebrated... We cannot interfere in this case.” The court allowed Dogra to withdraw the petition.On September 11, 2018, the Supreme Court while permitting Avni (T-1) to be shot said: “The efforts to tranquilise and capture T-1 tigress will be continued and if unsuccessful, it shall be eliminated by shooting to avoid any further loss of human life. The Chief Conservator of Forests, Yavatmal is authorised to carry out the above order. He shall not declare any prize or any similar incentive for the responsible person.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-rejects-contempt-plea-says-tigress-avni-killed-in-accordance-with-order-101614365117607.html
27-02-2021||India||‘Best of the best’: Election Commission on poll observer deployed in Bengal||The Election Commission of India would be deploying some of its ‘best of the best’ observers in West Bengal, who had earlier also been deployed in the state during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls when the BJP managed to make deep inroads.TMC chief Mamata Banerjee has hit back saying that it would be a big blunder.The chief election commissioner Sunil Arora said that Ajay V Nayak, former chief electoral officer of Bihar, would be deployed as the special observer to West Bengal. He is a 1984 batch retired IAS officer.“He is one of the best CEOs the commission ever had. Not that we have dearth of them but he was one of the best of the best,” said Arora.Nayak was also deployed as a special observer in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. The BJP had won 40% of the vote share and 18 of the 42 seats emerging as the principal opponent of the ruling TMC. The TMC which got 43% votes had won 22 seats.The ECI has also decided to send at least two police observers to West Bengal to look into the law and order. At least 125 companies of central armed police forces have already been sent to West Bengal.“Retired IPS officer Vivek Dubey, a 1981 batch officer from Andhra Pradesh would be sent as IPS observer. He was the IPS observer in West Bengal in the last parliament elections also. Mrinal Kanti Das, a retired 1977 batch IPS officer of Manipur-Tripura cadre would also be sent. He was the observer in Tripura elections. Under different circumstance he had acquainted himself exceptionally well,” he added.Earlier in January this year when the full bench of the ECI had visited West Bengal, the opposition parties had complained about deteriorating law and order situation in the state and rising violence.Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee hit out saying: “I would humbly request the ECI not to look at West Bengal through the eyes of the BJP. Same man is being deputed as observer. In 2019, Vivek Dubey was the observer here. We know what he has done here. We know all the game and drama. BJP has the power of central agencies and the Union government. The Union government should not misuse its powers. If it is allowed it would be a big blunder and you will have to face the music.”BJP’s state spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said: “Disrespecting the ECI means the chief minister is disrespecting the Constitution. The people of Bengal will give a befitting reply to this.”As expenditure observer the ECI is sending B Murli Kumar, a retired 1983 batch IRS officer.Poll panel officials said that special central observers are sent to each poll-bound state depending on the sensitivity of the state to look into law and order, expenditure and other aspects. The observers are usually retired bureaucrats who had held top posts in various central agencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/best-of-the-best-election-commission-on-poll-observer-deployed-in-bengal-101614364793873.html
