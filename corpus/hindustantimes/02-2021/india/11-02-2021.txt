11-02-2021||India||Supreme Court refuses bail to anti-CAA activist Akhil Gogoi||The Supreme Court on Thursday refused bail to Assam-based activist Akhil Gogoi, who was arrested by the Guwahati Police in connection with violence during the mass protests organized in the state against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) passed by Parliament in December, 2019.Gogoi, who is currently lodged in Guwahati Central Jail had approached the top court against the order passed by the Gauhati High Court rejecting bail on January 7 this year. Senior advocate Jaideep Gupta who appeared for the Raijor Dal leader told the apex court that during the agitation that broke out in December 2019, Gogoi’s organization organized mass protests. Three minor incidents of violence were reported across the state but there was no evidence to indicate that the same were at Gogoi’s behest, Gupta argued.With 12 cases lodged against Gogoi now being probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), Gupta argued that the acts in question did not amount to terrorism and with the trial being held up due to Covid-19, a ground for releasing the accused on bail was made out.A bench of Justices NV Ramana, Surya Kant and Aniruddha Bose refused to entertain the plea. It said, “Having heard learned senior counsel for the petitioner and carefully perusing the material placed on record, we are not inclined to grant bail to the petitioner at this stage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-refuses-bail-to-anti-caa-activist-akhil-gogoi-101613066721059.html

The training centre would be named after Chilarai (Shukladhwaj Singha --- a legendary commander of the Koch dynasty),” Shah said while addressing a rally in Cooch Behar.The Rajbongshi community, the largest Scheduled Caste (SC) group of West Bengal, forms around 30% of the population in north Bengal. The formation of a ‘Narayani Sena’ regiment has been an emotive issue for them.Earlier in November 2020, chief minister Mamata Banerjee had also announced the formation of three police battalions one of them being ‘Narayani’ in Cooch Behar to woo the community ahead of the polls.Shah also announced a ₹500-crore cultural centre for the Rajbongshis, setting up a statue of Thakur Panchanan Barma, a Rajbongshi leader and a social reformer from Cooch Behar.He added that the BJP government would develop a tourist circuit comprising Madan Mohan Temple, Kamteshwari Mandir and the birth-place of Panchanan Barma so that people from across India could visit.With Cooch Behar being a district located along the porous Indo-Bangla border, the Union home minister attacked the state’s ruling TMC on cross-border infiltration.“Just the name of Narayani Sena, had left the Mughal army bewildered. Chilarai forced the Mughals to retreat. But today that land is being filled up with infiltrators,” he said.In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the community, which is numerically significant in North Bengal especially in Cooch Behar district, had helped the BJP to make deep inroads in north Bengal. Shah met Ananta Rai Maharaj in Assam. He is one of the most important Rajbongshi leaders.The TMC is however not far behind in the race. Banerjee had recently announced two separate boards for the Rajbongshi, along with ₹25 crore for the community’s upliftment.Earlier in January, Banerjee said the school education department would inspect 200 informal schools, where education was imparted through Rajbongshi language, to find out whether those could be converted into formal schools.Out of the eight Lok Sabha seats in north Bengal, BJP had won seven in 2019 elections leaving just one for the Congress. The TMC didn’t win any seats. This time both parties are eyeing north Bengal where the Rajbongshi community plays an important role.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eye-on-bengal-polls-amit-shah-nurtures-rajbongshi-sentiments-showers-sops-101613066079903.html
11-02-2021||India||‘A courtesy call’: Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on meeting with PM Modi||Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Thursday met Prime Minister Narendra Modi at his Parliament office and held talks on different issues for close to an hour.This was Kumar’s first visit to Delhi after becoming the chief minister for the fourth time in a row. Kumar is also scheduled to meet the President and vice-president. Earlier, on Wednesday, he had a meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah as well. Kumar is on a two-day visit to New Delhi.The meeting with PM and Shah, immediately after the cabinet expansion in Bihar, assumes significance following the impending cabinet expansion at the Centre. Also, it is believed that Kumar in his meeting could have raised the LJP’s continuation in NDA. The Bihar CM, on Wednesday had spoken about the role of the LJP in the Bihar assembly election. “What is going to be the LJP’s role, the BJP has to take a call. We don’t take cognizance of such issues,” he had said.The LJP contested the Bihar assembly polls independently and was instrumental in the defeat of the JD (U) on a number of seats.However, Kumar, after meeting the PM said, “No meaning should be attached to the meeting. It was a courtesy meeting. I did not make any demand and we talked on a range of issues.”“In coalition politics, every party keeps talking to each other on different issues. What are the requirements on environment, education, etc.,” he said and ruled out that any discussions had been held with PM Modi on the Bihar cabinet expansion.The Bihar CM said that his party is with the government on the issue of Farm Bills and that the Centre has opted for the right path by holding talks with the farmer unions agitating against the three laws.“These legislations are in the interest of farmers and not against them. Hopefully, the issue will be resolved soon," he said.Kumar also made light of the claims of rival parties, including the RJD, that his government in Bihar will not last its full term, saying if they are getting publicity out of it, then there is nothing wrong with that. He added in the same vein that these leaders are ignorant of realities.Kumar's meeting with the BJP’s top leadership had also triggered speculation that JD (U) may join hands with the saffron party to contest the West Bengal assembly polls. Kumar, however, said that the party was still to decide on the number of seats it would contest in West Bengal. “Party’s West Bengal wing wants to contest polls and national president R C P Singh is holding discussions with them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-courtesy-call-bihar-cm-nitish-kumar-on-meeting-with-pm-modi-101613064077905.html

And a bit of cricket,” he added.Developments in Myanmar had figured in a phone conversation between Jaishankar and US secretary of state Antony Blinken on Tuesday. Blinken had expressed concern at the coup and the importance of rule of law and the democratic process.Blinken also discussed ways to strengthen cooperation with allies and partners of the US to address the military coup in Myanmar during a phone call with Japanese foreign minister Toshimitsu Motegi on Wednesday.Unlike the US, which announced sanctions on Wednesday against the military leaders involved in last week's coup in Myanmar, India has adopted a more cautious position and called for the democratic process to be upheld.India has close ties with both the civilian and military leadership of Myanmar, and the security relationship between the two countries is crucial in view of concerns related to militant groups from the northeastern states that have bases in Myanmar. India’s armed forces have worked with Myanmar’s military in recent years to pressure these groups and push them to the negotiating table.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-australia-discuss-situation-in-myanmar-post-military-coup-101613061012215.html

11-02-2021||India||E-commerce giant Amazon moves top court on Future-Reliance deal||United States-based e-commerce giant Amazon has approached the Supreme Court against an order of the Delhi High Court staying the status quo order on the ₹24,713 crore deal between Kishore Biyani-led Future Retail Limited (FRL) and Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani’s Reliance Retail.On February 8, a Division Bench of the Delhi High Court led by Chief Justice DN Patel had stayed a single judge’s direction of February 2 putting a temporary freeze on the deal between Future Retail and Reliance. The order came on FRL’s appeal seeking stay of the February 2 order where FRL claimed that due to the status quo position, the proceedings before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for approving the amalgamation scheme were held up. This could be an “absolute disaster” for the company with its outlets across India being shut and nearly 25,000 employees losing their livelihood.The February 8 order of the Delhi High Court had noted, “Statutory authorities should not be restrained from proceeding in accordance with law on Future-Reliance deal,” while lifting the single judge’s status quo direction.Amazon in its appeal before the Supreme Court has raised a host of legal issues, primary among then being the maintainability of FRL’s petition before the Delhi High Court Division Bench. It was Amazon that had moved the single judge to restrain Future Group from proceeding further with entities of the Reliance Group.The US retail giant banked on the October 25, 2020 Emergency Arbitrator (EA) order passed by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) that restrained FRL from going ahead with the deal with Reliance Retail.The petition by Amazon said, “No provision for appeal is provided against an order passed under Section 17(2) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. The respondents (FRL) have not challenged the EA order itself, but have preferred to challenge the single judge order enforcing the EA order.” Further, the foreign retailer stated that the single judge’s status quo order was passed for the limited purpose of preserving the rights of the parties till pronouncement of final orders and the Division Bench ought not to have issued its order “hastily”.Stating consequences of lifting the status quo, Amazon’s petition said, “The greater the progress made towards the completion of the impugned transaction, the harder it will be to unravel it. Over time, the interests of additional third parties may also become entwined with the transaction and be subsequently compromised.”Amazon had contended before the High Court that the award was valid and enforceable against FRL. In its suit, it had even sought detention of Biyanis, directors of Future Coupons Private Limited (FCPL) and FRL and related parties in a civil prison besides attachment of their properties for alleged “willful disobedience” of the EA order. The e-retailer sought stay of the Division Bench’s decision terming it to be illegal, arbitrary, and against principles of natural justice, equity and fair play.After the Division Bench had passed its order, Amazon had requested the High Court to keep its order in abeyance for a week. However, the request was declined by the bench, also comprising Justice Jyoti Singh.It was in August last year, FRL entered into an agreement to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing units to Reliance Retail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ecommerce-giant-amazon-moves-top-court-on-future-reliance-deal-101613056990099.html

It also granted emergency authorisation to Covaxin, a vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech, for its use under certain circumstances as the vaccine is still undergoing Phase 3 trial.Read | India should be very, very proud: WHO’s praise amid falling Covid-19 casesIndia kicked off vaccination drive on January 16 after conducting two dry runs across the country to understand the mechanisms and identify possible issues expected to be encountered.

Considering the magnitude of the population...it's something the Government of India should be very, very proud of,” Roderico Ofrin, WHO’s India representative, was quoted as saying by ANI.Also read | 2,072 Indians died of Covid-19 around the world, minister tells Rajya Sabha“Bringing that diligence, discipline and vigour into their response to the vaccination campaign, we have seen it's been so successful.

India has also vaccinated more than 7 million people since the programme began on January 16, in the world’s largest vaccination drive against Covid-19.Ofrin also added a word of praise for Gujarat. “Hats off to Gujarat government for taking the review amid pandemic for information and better evidence to tweak their responses, which they have, especially during the second wave that happened,” he said.This is not the first time that the global health body has praised India. On February 6, it had said that the country has shown great progress in significantly driving down the number of Covid-19 cases.

11-02-2021||India||Don't make farm laws a prestige issue: Sachin Pilot to Centre||Urging the Centre not to make the agri laws a "prestige issue", senior Congress leader Sachin Pilot on Thursday asserted that the government must let go of its "stubbornness" to immediately repeal the legislations, and said that when the BJP could not convince its allies like the Akali Dal and the RLP on the issue, how can it expect the farmers to accept the laws.A day ahead of former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi's visit to Rajasthan to raise the voice of the farmers against the farm laws, he said that the Centre should withdraw the laws and after thorough consultation with farmers and states, come up with a new set of legislations which the tillers would themselves want and is not something that is forced upon them.In an interview with PTI, Pilot slammed the BJP for stating that the Congress had made a "U-turn" on the farm laws, saying it was the BJP which was prone to making 'U-turns', while his party was consistent on all issues.While the Congress supported agri reforms, it did not back laws which are "contrary to the interest of the farmers", said the former Rajasthan deputy chief minister, who addressed two kisan panchayats in Dausa and Bharatpur recently, which saw a massive turnout."First of all, they (BJP) made a U-turn on Aadhaar, then on GST, MGNREGA, FDI and so many issues. The Congress said we want to get new investments (in the agri sector) and technological inputs, want more 'mandis', liberalise the system, but never said we will make laws contrary to the interest of the farmers," he said.Stressing that the government should set aside its "ego'' and let go of its "stubbornness" to repeal the laws, Pilot said almost all political parties and even the BJP's allies - be it the Akali Dal or Hanuman Beniwal's Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) - opposed the laws. Both the Akali Dal and the RLP quit the BJP-led NDA, opposing the farm laws brought in by the government."They were not able to convince their own NDA partners, how can they expect the farmers to be convinced by these laws and accept them," Pilot said."I don't think they should make it a prestige issue," the former Rajasthan Congress chief said.Asked if there could be a middle path or the repeal of laws was the only option, Pilot said the farmers have explicitly said that they want a complete withdrawal of the laws and the Congress stands firmly behind their demand.Criticising the three farm laws, Pilot said the first major problem with them is that they were made without consultation with any stakeholder as no farmer unions or state government was involved in the making of the laws."Clearly these three laws that the government has made are not in the interest of the farmers because they are protecting everybody but the farmer. You dismantle the 'mandi' system and remove the stock limits, you are obviously encouraging large conglomerates and huge companies who can manage and maintain huge granaries", which could lead to manipulation of the food grain market in the future, he claimed.Asked about the BJP's assertion that the 'mandi' system will stay and the law only provides more options to the farmers, Pilot said that the BJP had also claimed that the farmers' income will be doubled and ₹15 lakh will be transferred in the accounts of people, none of which happened."The law is in favour of a few individuals which will then control the sector. There is only so much food grain that is grown and harvested, if the government stops or drastically reduces procurement, where will the food security act go, from where will the food come for the supply for the PDS (public distribution system)," the 43-year-old leader said.He hailed the efforts of former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra for strongly opposing the laws and standing with the farmers while extending moral support to them in various places."Mr Gandhi vehemently opposed the laws and he is coming to Rajasthan to give support to the demand of the farmers to repeal these laws. He is touring three or four agrarian districts and will take part in many 'kisan sabhas' and will meet farmers and give support to their demands," he said of Gandhi's two-day visit to the state on February 12 and 13.Referring to the multi-layered barricading and iron nails studded on roads at the protest sites on Delhi's border points, Pilot said the farmers are sitting at the Delhi's borders for the last 80 days and not a single incident of violence took place as they were agitating on truly Gandhian philosophy, but had to face severe intimidation."What happened on Republic Day, every individual has condemned that. We have to investigate how that happened and now they have caught the main accused who is not a farmer," Pilot said, referring to the violence in Delhi during the protesting farmer's tractor rally on January 26."The huge deployment, nails being dug and barricading, gave a sense that the government is attempting to suppress the farmers by oppressive means," Pilot said.Demanding an immediate repeal of the farm laws, Pilot said if any new laws are to be made, the government must first consult the stakeholders, have a robust discussion in Parliament and after extensive deliberation come up with a new set of legislations which the farmers would themselves want and they are not forced on them.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh demanding the rollback of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-make-farm-laws-a-prestige-issue-sachin-pilot-to-centre-101613054137219.html
11-02-2021||India||Govt won’t use WhatsApp, other social media for salary communication||The Centre has decided to rule out its plan to allow WhatsApp and other social media platforms for salary communication of employees under its new labour codes amid privacy concerns and fears that the measure would further legitimise social media for official communication.Union labour secretary Apurva Chandra told Livemint on Thursday that the “anomaly will be corrected and the Centre will remove WhatsApp and other social media platforms from wage communication draft notification.” Chandra said that the government valued privacy concerns of employees adding that WhatsApp and other social media would be excluded from the final standing orders.This update comes exactly a month after the Union labour ministry was considering feedback on a fresh provision of sending intimation regarding all payments through electronic mode under draft standing orders on manufacturing, mining and services sectors, an official told news agency PTI on January 11.In December last year, the ministry had circulated two draft standing orders on the services sector and manufacturing and mining sectors. “All payment including wages to the workers shall be paid by crediting in the bank account of worker on electronic mode or digital form. Intimation... to a worker shall be sent to him through Short Messaging Service (SMS) or e-mail or social media communication, such as WhatsApp or by issuing a slip,” the orders read.However, people had expressed apprehensions that this measure would allow organisations to display the financial and personal details of their employees on social media platforms which could be accessed by everyone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-won-t-use-whatsapp-other-social-media-for-salary-communication-101613053785677.html
11-02-2021||India||Loss of ₹1.8 cr a day at toll booths due to farmers' protest: Nitin Gadkari||Public funded toll plazas at highways are facing an estimated loss of approximately ₹1.8 crore per day due to farmers' protests, the Centre informed Parliament on Thursday.Toll collection across Punjab and Haryana and Delhi NCR region has been suspended since December due to the ongoing protests against the three farm laws, which cleared by Parliament last year.In a written response to a question in the Lok Sabha by BJP MP PC Gaddigouda, Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari said: "Due to farmers’ protest, some of the fee plazas are non-operational, thereby the NHAI is unable to collect user fee from the road users. In case of public funded fee plazas, an estimated remittance loss is approximately ₹1.8 crore per day."According to credit rating agency ICRA, the farmers’ agitation has seen nearly ₹600 crore loss in toll collections in states of Punjab, Haryana and Delhi-NCR with ₹9300 crore of debt at risk, thus far.ICRA Ratings, in its report issued last month, had said that around 52 toll plazas [includes both public funded and BOT (built, operate and transfer)] for national highways (NHs) operated in Punjab, Haryana and Delhi-NCR have been directly or indirectly affected due to farmers’ agitation.Apart from this, the revenue loss in the state highways projects in these regions will be an additional burden, it noted.“The average toll collection per day at these plazas is estimated at ₹7 crore. Until January 26, 2021, these national highway toll plazas would have incurred an estimated revenue loss of around ₹560 crore out of which ₹410 crore is estimated for BOT Concessionaires. Out of the ₹9,300 crore of impacted rated debt, ₹8550 crore of debt is at a high risk of default while ₹750 crore is rated as investment grade with low to moderate risk of default. Some of these entities also have debt service reserves (DSRAs) of around three months in place to use for such exigencies; however, this would have been completely used up by now," said Rajeshwar Burla, Vice President, Corporate Ratings, ICRA.The inability to collect toll for a continuous period of 24 hours and exceeding an aggregate period of seven days in an accounting year due to agitations/ strikes would be considered an indirect political event under the force majeure clause, ICRA noted."In such cases, with the costs attributable to such events, beyond the insurance cover, one half of such excess amount is likely to be reimbursed by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), covering around 25% of the loss of revenue incurred by the affected projects. As per ICRA estimates, this would amount to around Rs100 crore until January 26, 2021. Further, the concession period shall be extended in proportion to the loss of fee on a daily basis," it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/loss-of-rs-1-8-cr-a-day-at-toll-booths-due-to-farmers-protest-nitin-gadkari-101613053294415.html

Without doubt there are newer threats on the horizon, but the hard reality is that the legacy challenges have not quite gone away,” Naravane said in his inaugural address at a seminar on Multi-Domain Operations: Future of Conflicts, organised by the Centre for Land Warfare Studies.The army chief said the challenges had only grown in scale and intensity.Talking about multi-domain operations, chief Naravane said India needed to address the challenges posed by adversaries in stand-off deterrence. “We need to develop capacities to strengthen our own anti-access prowess as well as develop proficiencies to overcome the anti-access capacities of the adversary to strengthen our defensive framework as also to add punch to our offensive poise.”He said platforms such as tanks, fighter jets and surface combatants, which were once the mainstay of 20th century battlefield, were rendered relatively less significant in the face of emerging battlefield challenges in newer domains.“We have seen how the very imaginative and offensive use of drones in Idlib and then in Armenia-Azerbaijan challenged the traditional prima donnas: the tanks, the artillery and the dug in infantry,” the army chief said.“We have also seen how disruptive technologies are now driving doctrinal cycles like never before. It may not be inaccurate to infer that technology itself is steadily emerging as a core combat capability,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-punch-to-offensive-poise-says-army-chief-amid-newer-threats-101613052009723.html

11-02-2021||India||GHMC polls: TRS wins mayoral posts with AIMIM extending last-minute support||Telangana elected its first female mayor to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) on Thursday, since the creation of the state in 2014. The ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) candidate Gadwal Vijayalakshmi along with deputy mayor Mothe Srilatha Reddy, also from the TRS, won a tightly contested election. Vijayalakshmi defeated the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) candidate Radha Dheeraj Reddy for Thursday’s historic win.AIMIM’s contributionThe first citizen of Hyderabad was elected by a show of hands. The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) extended support to Vijayalakshmi’s nomination at the eleventh hour. The Asaduddin Owaisi-led AIMIM had retained power in all of its 44 seats in the elections to the GHMC, held on December 1 of last year. Owaisi tweeted his congratulations to the TRS for winning the posts of mayor and deputy mayor, adding that public works will be a core area of concern for the GHMC. He also thanked TRS for offering AIMIM the post of deputy mayor.“Congratulations to the newly elected Mayor & Deputy Mayor of GHMC. Hope that, under their leadership, Hyderabad will be taken to new heights and public works will be actively taken up in areas that need them the most, including Old City of Hyderabad,” Owaisi tweeted.The support extended by the AIMIM to the TRS was a last-minute switch. At around 12:30pm on Thursday, a few hours before the voting was supposed to be held, the AIMIM announced it was dropping out of the GHMC mayoral polls, much to the surprise of the TRS’s main rival the BJP.GHMC polls vs the mayoral electionsThe GHMC elections on December 1 last year witnessed a close fight between the K Chandrashekar Rao-led TRS and the BJP. In the 150-member GHMC council, a party needs to win 76 seats to command an absolute majority. The TRS won 56 and the BJP with 48 seats came a close second but both failed to attain majority. The AIMIM won in all of its 44 seats and Congress fared the worst with just two seats under its belt.The TRS was hopeful of winning the mayoral elections because it had 38 co-option members, i.e. members to the municipal corporation who had been appointed due to their interests, experience, or skill sets. The BJP had the support of only two such members and the AIMIM had 10. The number of members taking part in Thursday’s vote stood at 193. The TRS required 97 votes to grab the two top posts. After combining the votes of 56 elected corporators and 32 co-option members, it fell short by nine votes, raising the bar of the contest for the BJP. However, the AIMIM dropped out of the race at the very last minute, even though they had initially fielded two candidates, and extended support to TRS helping them win both posts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ghmc-polls-trs-wins-mayoral-posts-with-aimim-extending-last-minute-support-101613050221656.html
11-02-2021||India||Nitin Gadkari to launch India's first CNG tractor tomorrow||India's first-ever diesel tractor, converted to Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), will be formally launched by the Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways, Nitin Gadkari on February 12.The conversion, carried out jointly by Rawmatt Techno Solutions and Tomasetto Achille India, will help farmers increase their income, by lowering the costs and help to create job opportunities in rural India. Union Ministers Dharmendra Pradhan, Narendra Singh Tomar, Parshottam Rupala and General (Retired) VK Singh will also be present at the launch."The most important benefit for the farmer will be to save more than one lakh rupees annually on fuel costs, which will help them to improve their livelihood," read the press release by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways.Benefits of converting a tractor to CNG for a farmer are first, the test reports indicate that the retrofitted tractor produces more power/equal in comparison to the diesel-run engine. Second, overall emissions are reduced by 70 per cent as compared to diesel. Third, it will help farmers to save up to 50 per cent on the fuel cost as the current diesel prices are ₹77.43/litre whereas CNG is only ₹42/kg.CNG is a clean fuel as it has the lowest content of carbon and other pollutants. It is economical as it has zero lead and is non-corrosive, non-dilutive and non-contaminating which helps in increasing the life of the engine and it requires less regular maintenance. Also, it is the future as at present around 12 million vehicles are already powered by natural gas throughout the world and more companies and municipalities are joining the CNG movement every day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitin-gadkari-to-launch-india-s-first-cng-tractor-tomorrow-101613050253088.html

The implementation tool kit is in furtherance to original code signed on September 4 last year which includes feedback from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on the issues of conflict of interest and prohibited content.Officials from the Information & Broadcasting Ministry said that they will review the implementation tool kit and respond accordingly. The ministry is also working on its own parallel code that will overarchingly govern all over the top (OTT) platforms. Union minister Prakash Javadekar told Parliament last week that guidelines for OTT platforms have almost been finalised.Regulation of OTT platforms became a sore point for the government after various complaints were filed against a few shows released on Netflix and Amazon Prime. The latest being the political TV show Tandav on Amazon Prime. Complainants said the show disrespected religious sentiments. The government also sought a response from the makers of the show. The cast and crew have since apologised.The code states that the signatories set up an “Internal Committee within their Grievance Redressal System” to address complaints by users, government bodies or regulators. “Each Signatory has undertaken to constitute an Advisory Panel to decide on the complaints when the complainant is (a) dissatisfied with the decision of the CCD/Internal Committee and (b) requests an escalation in respect of the complaint filed with the CCD/Internal Committee,” the tool kit states.The signatories may also have independent members on their advisory panel. “Advisory Panel shall comprise no less than three (3) members. It is suggested that the Advisory Panel shall consist of at least an equal number of Independent Members (vis-à-vis the Signatory’s internal members),” IAMAI has said. “The Signatories have agreed to adhere to all applicable laws of the land.”IAMAI head of public policy Bhanupreet Saini said that the toolkit addresses key areas to standardise procedures for all signatories. “This offers clear and standard procedures on how to address grievances, including the setting up of a complaints committee. All the signatories have also agreed to abide by the law of the land and submit to regular compliance audits,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/netflix-amazon-prime-other-digital-platforms-adopt-self-regulation-tool-kit-101613050032614.html

As a result of our government's decisions, a new confidence is being built among common farmers. And due to this (confidence) farmers have achieved a record production," Singh said."In 2017, the prime minister had vowed to double farmers' income by 2022. This was not an easy resolve ....against the backdrop of this, the three farm laws were enacted last year," he said.The new laws aim at fetching fair price for farmers' produce and give them liberty to sell it wherever they wish, the Union minister further said.But "people with vested interests" created confusion over the three laws, spreading misconceptions such as markets run by Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees and Minimum Support Prices (MSP) will be abolished and farmers' lands will be mortgaged, Singh alleged.The prime minister had stated categorically in Parliament that neither any APMC Mandi has closed after the new laws came into force, nor has the MSP regime ended, he said, adding that rather the MSP has increased.Under the new laws, agricultural produce will be up for sale and not the land, the Union minister stressed.Saying that Mahatma Gandhi considered villages as the soul of India, Singh said development of rural areas was the government's priority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-ready-for-talks-can-amend-farm-laws-if-needed-rajnath-singh-101613049764014.html
11-02-2021||India||Domestic flight ticket rates set to rise as Centre relaxes cap on price bands||The ministry of civil aviation on Thursday extended the cap on domestic flights' price bands till March 21 but it allowed the airlines to increase the upper and lower cap on the fares by up to 30%.The Centre had imposed a cap on domestic airfare after resumption of flights on May 25 last year, following a two month suspension of services imposed due to the lockdown, to curb the spread of Covid 19.As per the order issued by the civil aviation ministry on Thursday, airlines will be allowed to charge more from passengers as the government has allowed a substantial increase on the upper and lower limits of the price bands.For flights with duration between 90 to 120 minutes, the lower fare cap has been increased to ₹3,900 from ₹3,500, while the cap on maximum chargeable fare has been increased to ₹13,000 from ₹10,000.At present, the government has allowed domestic flights to operate up to 80% of their capacity.Replying to a question in Parliament on Wednesday, Union civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri said fare band on domestic flights can't be a permanent feature and it is expected that when airlines, which are now operating at 80 per cent of their pre-Covid capacity, resume their full services, they won't need fare bands.The Centre fixed fare bands when airlines resumed their services in May 2020, after the national lockdown. In this process, the ministry determined the ceiling price of tickets so that passengers were not overcharged."The floor and ceiling price was an extraordinary measure which was necessitated by an extraordinary situation which we found ourselves in. It is designed to ensure that airlines in a situation of limited availability did not charge exorbitant prices. It is not our intention and can not be in an open market deregulated situation to have the fare band made a permanent feature," the minister had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/domestic-flight-ticket-rates-set-to-rise-as-centre-relaxes-cap-on-price-bands-101613049288872.html

The Prime Minister had also said that if there were any flaws in the laws, there is nothing wrong in amending them but the farmers would have to come up with convincing points.“Yesterday while addressing the House, the PM said that the Opposition is talking about the agitation but not about the content and intent of the farm maws.

She started opposing the CAA and saying she will never allow it. The BJP always fulfils the promises it makes. We have brought this law and refugees will get citizenship."As soon as the Covid-19 vaccination process ends the process of granting citizenship under CAA will begin," he said, addressing a rally here in the bastion of the Matua community.Matuas, originally from East Pakistan, are weaker section Hindus who migrated to India during the Partition and after the creation of Bangladesh. Many of them have been accorded Indian citizenship but a sizeable section of the population has not.Shah said Banerjee will not be in a position to oppose the implementation of the CAA as she will cease to be the chief minister after the assembly polls likely in April-May this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/caa-will-be-implemented-after-covid-19-vaccination-ends-says-amit-shah-101613047585599.html

And because of this dissent, we will be called 'andolanjeevi' and 'parjeevi’,” he said in the Rajya Sabha.Also read| Parliament LIVE: Centre never paid tributes to the protesting farmers who diedHere’s a list of thing he claims the government is denying about the economic slowdown:1. He slammed the big numbers in the budget and asked the government to give out realistic numbers which would be a natural and mechanical growth after coronavirus induced slowdown. The government has projected a 14.8% gross domestic product for 2021 while Chidambaram limited it between 9.4 -8.4% based on the arithmetic.2. Asking the government to withdraw the budget, he said major numbers are suspect in this year's budget including the capital expenditure of ₹51,000 crore. “Where did the rest of the money go?” he asked.3. Chidambaram expressed concern over no mention of the defence sector for the first time in the budget speech even as the allocation to the health sector was reduced.4. He urged the government to help people and migrant labourers by providing cash transfers and ration, else he warned that the poor will wake up and in a non-violent, peaceful manner, show what should be done.5. The Congress leader claimed that the government failed to stimulate the growth and will drag GDP three years back.6. The former finance minister compared GDP figures from the last few years and questioned the growth after 2017-18, which was ₹131 lakh crore. “Since then what has happened? In 2019-20, it was a slower crawl to ₹145 lakh crore and in 2020-21, the year that is about to end, the first half is about ₹60 lakh crore and the year may end at about ₹130 lakh crore, which means we are back to where we were in 2017-18,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-the-rich-of-the-rich-by-the-rich-chidambaram-tears-into-union-budget-101613046466207.html

11-02-2021||India||Kamal Haasan’s MNM makes him permanent president of party||Actor-politician Kamal Haasan’s Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) on Thursday resolved to make him the next chief minister of Tamil Nadu as also the party’s permanent president with all powers vested in him to decide on alliances. Among the 25 resolutions that the fledgling party passed in its day-long general council meeting was that of seeking that the inquiry process into former state chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s death be expedited.Haasan has positioned himself as an alternative to the two Dravidian parties, AIADMK and DMK, with a poll plank of fighting against corruption. The other resolutions include bringing out a white paper before the polls on the state’s debts, opposing the 8-lane Chennai-Salem expressway and condemning the Centre for promoting Hindi and Sanskrit. MNM also condemned the delay in booking the accused in the Pollachi sex assault case and the delay in deciding on the release of the seven convicts in the 1991 Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. MNM, which was formed in 2018, secured a 3.7% vote share in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Several former bureaucrats and social activists have joined Haasan’s party.With its resolution on Jayalalithaa death probe, the party has joined the Opposition chorus on the same. DMK chief MK Stalin has said multiple times that if voted to power, his party would conduct a probe into the “mystery” as several questions were raised over the death. The former AIADMK chief died after a prolonged hospitalisation. The ruling AIADMK formed a one-man commission led by retired justice Arumughaswamy in 2017. Stalin blames the Palaniswami-led government for the staggered proceedings. The judicial probe was one of the demands of O Paneerselvam to merge his warring faction with chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami. After Jayalalithaa’s death, Paneerselvam resigned as chief minister to make way for her close aide VK Sasikala, only to rebel against her later. With Sasikala’s return after her four-year imprisonment and her plans to reclaim the AIADMK, the issue of Jayalalithaa’s death looms over the forthcoming polls in Tamil Nadu slated for April- May. The justice Arumughaswamy committee has so far been extended nine times after examining more than 100 witnesses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kamal-haasan-s-mnm-makes-him-permanent-president-of-party-101613041515114.html
11-02-2021||India||2 expenditure observers to curb money power in Tamil Nadu polls||The Election Commission of India says it will send two special expenditure observers to Tamil Nadu to keep a check on money distribution to influence poll outcomes, an acute problem in Tamil Nadu politics. The announcement was made in Chennai by the chief election commissioner, Sunil Arora, after his two-day visit to check the poll-bound state’s readiness for the exercise.“We want to conduct an inducement-free and Covid-19 safe election,” Arora said.In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, ECI cancelled elections for the Vellore parliamentary seat in Tamil Nadu after more than ₹10 crore was found in cash at a warehouse owned by a political party member. Income Tax officials seized ₹137 crore in unaccounted cash from across the state, days ahead of the Lok Sabha and assembly by-polls. Similarly, in 2017, by-polls in prestigious RK Nagar assembly seat—previously represented by former chief minister J Jayalalithaa--were cancelled twice on bribery charges.“We rescinded polls in Vellore and twice in RK Nagar, which is the harshest action taken by the election commission in any state,” Arora said at a press conference.In its previous visit in December too, the delegation focused on the influence of money, goodies and liquor in the polls.Tamil Nadu will have additional 25,000 polling booths these elections, taking the total number of booths in the state to 93,000. Poll timing will also be extended by an hour. By-poll for Kanyakumari parliamentary seat--left vacant after the death of Congress MP Vasanthakumar, who succumbed to coronavirus last year-- will be conducted along with the polls for 234 assembly seats in the state.On Wednesday, Arora-led election panel met with political parties, which were united in their demand for a single-phase assembly election in the state.The ECI said it was considering their suggestion to hold state polls in April due to heat, examinations and Tamil New Year.“It will be before May 24 when the current assembly term expires,” Arora said.He, however, ruled out parties’ request for counting of votes a couple of days after polling."We explained to the parties that we can't do this when we are conducting polls in five other states, which may be conducted in several phases. Results of one state will affect the voting pattern in another state," Arora said.Also Read: Election fervour in Kerala, Tamil Nadu likely to peak with PM Modi’s visitHe said the panel had received mixed feedback from political parties on enabling postal votes for people with disabilities, health issues and senior citizens. He said some parties were apprehensive of the facility’s possible misuse.He said postal ballots will be implemented so that specified group of voters can vote from home.The principal opposition party, the DMK's petition against postal voting is pending in the Madras high court.The ECI said it was unhappy with the state’s excise department. Following the presser, the team headed to neighbouring Union Territory of Puducherry, which is also going to polls this year in the same cycle as Tamil Nadu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-expenditure-observers-to-curb-money-power-in-tamil-nadu-polls-101613039409831.html

11-02-2021||India||In India-China border disengagement plan, Galwan model is the template||Nine months after being locked in an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation in the East Ladakh sector, the armoured units of Indian Army and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) started withdrawing from north and south banks of the frozen Pangong Tso on Wednesday evening, paving a way for peace and tranquillity to be restored all along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China.While Defence Minister Rajnath Singh issued a statement on the “phased, coordinated and verifiable” pullback by the two armies in Rajya Sabha today, it was a measure of confidence on part of the Narendra Modi government to ensure that Indian Army stood-up to the PLA through the polar winter in East Ladakh. The disengagement exercise on both banks of Pangong Tso was a result of multiple rounds of back-channel negotiations with external affairs minister S Jaishankar and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, guided by PM Modi, working behind the scenes. The ground positions were negotiated by the two Corps Commander-rank officers and the framework, through the diplomatic channel.Top government functionaries said the fundamental principle behind the disengagement was that both armies go back to their permanent bases as existed in April 2020. This means that while PLA will withdraw to the Srijap sector, east of Finger 8 mountainous spur on the north bank, the Indian Army will withdraw to the permanent base on Finger 3 named after Lt Colonel Dhan Singh Thapa, the legendary military commander who was awarded the Param Vir Chakra after the 1962 war.The same rule has been applied to the southern bank of the lake where both armies are going back to their permanent bases in Chushul (Indian Army) and Moldo (PLA).“The Galwan model has been replicated on both the banks. After the June 15 Galwan clash, both sides had withdrawn to the permanent bases with no patrolling from side till such time patrolling protocols have been framed. After the withdrawal is completed and confidence-building measures initiated by both armies, the two sides can decide on coordinated, joint or staggered patrolling,” said a senior official in the know of the entire exercise.A person familiar with the understanding reached between the two sides said once the withdrawal of armour, artillery and troops is completed from Pangong Tso, the two sides will initiate negotiations on disengagement from patrolling point 15 (Gogra) and 17 (Hot Springs) area, north of Pangong Tso.#WATCH: Indian Army video of ongoing disengagement process in Ladakh. pic.twitter.com/kXjr0SiPN2The disengagement and subsequent de-escalation from Pangong Tso was achieved after quiet backchannel conversations between the two sides after the Xi Jinping regime had tested the Indian Army during the polar winter in East Ladakh with temperatures touching below 40 degrees centigrade. It is a major victory for the Modi government as pushing the PLA back to its base on the Srijap sector from Finger 4 was no mean achievement as the latter wanted a military leg up on Indian Army.The Indian negotiating position got a great boost after NSA Doval along with Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat and Army Chief Mukund Naravane planned and managed to place the Indian Army troopers on the Rezang La Rechin La alignment on Kailash Ranges on August 29-30, 2020 despite valid fears of an India-China conflict. Just as the Chinese PLA tried to enforce the 1959 LAC line by aggression on Finger 4, the Indian side countered by achieving their military objective of holding up the Kailash Range line as per Indian perception of LAC.Despite both India and China spending millions in military deployment on East Ladakh, the Modi government managed to restore status quo ante without ceding an inch of land, a point emphasised by defence minister Rajnath Singh in Parliament. Restoration of status quo ante on LAC will not only add to Indian Army and Modi government’s military credibility but also persuade President Xi Jinping to restrain his Western Theatre Commander to undertake any military misadventure in future. After the 2017 Doklam and 2021 Pangong Tso on-going resolution, the new western theatre commander will have to think many times before undertaking unilateral change on the LAC. The Indian Army is watching.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-india-china-s-border-disengagement-plan-galwan-model-is-the-template-101613036016063.html

Though the company said the leak was plugged effectively, fishermen and local people alleged that it started affecting marine life in the periphery of sea.TTPL was closed temporarily after the oil spill. District authorities planned to shift people living near the factory after a nauseating smell filled the air.The oil leak was first noticed by some fishermen on Wednesday and they immediately alerted the company which plugged the leak. TTPL chairman AR Rasheed said the spill was caused due to a rupture in a furnace oil pipeline to the company and roughly 5,000 litres were spilled and a portion of it reached the sea through a drainage line.Also Read | Kerala CM junks opposition allegations of backdoor appointments in govt serviceThe carcass of a big sea turtle washed up on Veli beach on Wednesday night, creating panic. Fishermen alleged that fish and other marine creatures were destroyed. But marine experts said the death of the turtle can’t be immediately attributed to the spillage because such creatures inhabit the deep sea. Officials said the real cause of death will be ascertained only after an autopsy.“The government on Thursday constituted a three-member panel to inquire the mishap. Our initial inquiry suggests that a rupture in an old pipeline triggered the leak. TTPL will compensate the affected as per the government directive,” said Rasheed. Employees of the company joined local people and fishermen to clean up the beach at several places. The Coast Guard’s help was also sought to clean up the beach and the sea.District collector Navjot Khosa, who visited the affected areas, prohibited fishing in the area and restricted tourists and others for two days. She said top-soil along the affected stretch will be removed. The coast guard also said it was monitoring the situation.“The neglect on the part of TTPL was quite visible. It was noticed by fishermen in the sea and their inquiry led to the company. Officials noticed the leak only after their alert,” said Jerin Peter, a local, adding the fisher community was the worst-affected. He said many people complained of breathing problems.Congress and BJP workers carried out a protest march before the company seeking action against officials and compensation to the affected. The pollution control board has also pulled up TTPL. TTPL extracts rich minerals from the sand and manufacture titanium dioxide pigment from the limonite abundantly found along the south Kerala coast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-orders-probe-into-oil-spill-from-titanium-factory-to-sea-101613037795272.html
11-02-2021||India||India will not allow an inch of its territory to be taken by anyone: Rajnath||India and China have reached an agreement on disengagement in the North and South bank of Pangong lake in eastern Ladakh that mandates both sides to cease forward deployment of troops in a "phased, coordinated and verifiable" manner, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh announced in Parliament on Thursday, in a breakthrough after a nine-month border standoff.Sharing details of the pact to defuse the tense military face-off in eastern Ladakh that severely strained ties between the two Asian giants, Singh also assured the Rajya Sabha that India has not conceded anything in the sustained talks with China. India will not allow even an inch of its territory to be taken by anyone, he said.The defence minister said implementation of the pact will "substantially restore" the situation to the one which existed prior to the standoff that erupted on May 5 last, adding the two sides have agreed they should achieve complete disengagement at the "earliest" and abide fully by the bilateral agreements and protocols.Making a statement in the Upper House a day after China announced the disengagement process, Singh said both sides have agreed to remove structures that had been built since April last in North and South bank areas, and put in place a temporary moratorium on military activities including patrolling the traditional areas.The defence minister said under the agreement the Chinese People's Liberation Army(PLA) will keep its troops in the North bank area to east of Finger 8 and the Indian troops will be based at their permanent base at Dhan Singh Thapa Post near Finger 3 in the Pangong lake areas, a major site of friction between the two large armies.Also Watch| ‘We’ve lost nothing’: Rajnath Singh on disengagement along LAC with China﻿﻿He said the implementation of the pact started on Wednesday and it was agreed to convene the next meeting of senior commanders of both sides within 48 hours of completion of the disengagement in the Pangong lake area so as to resolve all other remaining issues."I am happy to inform the House today that as a result of our well thought out approach and sustained talks with the Chinese side, we have now been able to reach an agreement on disengagement in the North and South bank of the Pangong lake," the defence minister said.The border standoff between the Indian and Chinese militaries erupted on May 5 following a violent clash in the Pangong lake areas and both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry even as the two sides continued military and diplomatic talks."The agreement that we have been able to reach with the Chinese side for disengagement in the Pangong lake area envisages that both sides will cease their forward deployments in a phased, coordinated and verified manner." "The Chinese side will keep its troop presence in the North bank area to east of Finger 8. Reciprocally, the Indian troops will be based at their permanent base at Dhan Singh Thapa post near Finger 3. A similar action would be taken in the South bank area by both sides," he said.The defence minister said patrolling will be resumed in the areas only when both sides reach an agreement in diplomatic and military talks that would be held subsequently.He said these are mutual and reciprocal steps and any structures that had been built by both sides since April 2020 in both North and South bank areas will be removed and the landforms will be restored."I want to assure this House that in these talks we have not conceded anything. The House should also know that there are still some outstanding issues with regard to deployment and patrolling at some other points along the Line of Actual Control(LAC) in eastern Ladakh," he said."These will be the focus of further discussions with the Chinese side. We have agreed that both sides should achieve complete disengagement at the earliest and abide fully by the bilateral agreements and protocols." Noting that the Chinese side is fully aware of India's resolve by now, he said it is India's expectation that the neighbouring country will work with the Indian side in full sincerity to resolve these remaining issues."I would like this House to join me in paying gratitude to our armed forces who have shown grit and resolve under these extremely harsh climatic conditions of Ladakh which has resulted in the present agreement," he said."Our Nation will always remember the sacrifices made by our brave soldiers which has been the foundation of this disengagement at Pangong Tso lake." The defence minister exuded confidence that the entire House, irrespective of political affiliations, is united together for upholding the country's "sovereignty, unity, territorial integrity and national security"."And further, this House is one in sending out the same message demonstrating the strength and unity of our Nation to the entire world," he said.In the nine rounds of military talks, India had specifically insisted on withdrawal of Chinese troops from Finger 4 to Finger 8 on the North bank of Pangong Lake. The mountain spurs in the area are referred to as Fingers.On its part, the Chinese side was insisting on withdrawal of Indian troops from several strategic peaks on the southern bank of the lake. Around five months back, Indian troops occupied a number of strategic heights in the Mukhpari, Rechin La and Magar hill areas around the southern bank after the Chinese PLA attempted to intimidate them in the area.China on Wednesday said the Chinese and Indian frontline troops at the southern and northern bank of the Pangong Tso started "synchronised and organised disengagement" from February 10 in accordance with the consensus reached by both sides at the ninth round of China-India Corps Commander- Level meeting. The ninth round was held on January 24 and it lasted for around 16 hours.Both sides had rushed a large number of battle tanks, armoured vehicles and heavy equipment to the treacherous and high-altitude areas of eastern Ladakh region after tension escalated following a deadly clash in the Galwan Valley in June last.Twenty Indian soldiers were killed in the fierce hand-to-hand combat on June 15 in Galwan Valley, an incident that marked the most serious military conflicts between the two sides in decades.China is yet to disclose the number of its soldiers killed and injured in the clash though it officially admitted to have suffered casualties. According to an American intelligence report, the number of casualties on the Chinese side was 35.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-will-not-allow-an-inch-of-its-territory-to-be-taken-by-anyone-rajnath-101613036019538.html

11-02-2021||India||Government has failed to stimulate demand: P Chidambaram||Congress leader P Chidambaram told the Rajya Sabha on Thursday that the government has failed to stimulate demand for growth in the country and the GDP will go back to the figures of three years ago because of "incompetent economic mismanagement".He claimed that the budget for 2021-22 has failed as even a small amount of cash transfer has not been given to the poor and the rations are not being continued with."Every economist in the world has said we have to stimulate demand and the best way to stimulate demand is to put money in the hands of people. This government has failed on that account. I repeat the charge. You are still not learning the lessons of the last 36 months. I am afraid that as a result of your not learning the lessons, another 12 months will be lost and the poor will suffer and suffer greatly," the former finance minister said in the Upper House of Parliament.He said the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) in 2004-05, in constant prices, was about ₹32.42 lakh crore and when the Congress-led UPA demitted office in 2013-14, it was a little more than three times at ₹105 lakh crore."Since then what has happened? In 2017-18, it was ₹131 lakh crore. In 2018-19, it crept up to ₹139 lakh crore. In 2019-20, it was a slower crawl to ₹145 lakh crore and in 2020-21, the year that is about to end, the first half is about ₹60 lakh crore and the year may end at about ₹130 lakh crore, which means we are back to where we were in 2017-18," Chidambaram said.He alleged that the country has witnessed three years of "incompetent economic mismanagement"."The honourable finance minister took exception to my using the word incompetent. I cannot use a harsher word in Parliament. I am using the mildest word available to me. Three years of incompetent economic mismanagement means that at the end of 2020-21, we will be exactly where we were in 2017-18," the Congress leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-has-failed-to-stimulate-demand-p-chidambaram-101613035309293.html

"The water level is rising so teams were shifted to safer locations. The operation has resumed with limited teams,” personnel of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), was quoted as saying by ANI.Before this, Uttarakhand’s director general of police Ashok Kumar had said that people have also been asked to vacate the areas downstream, ANI had reported. Local police also said that the water level in the river is rising and people living in nearby areas are being alerted.“We had reached a distance of 6 metres and then realised that water is coming there. Had we continued, there would have been issues as rocks are unstable. Excavators would have fallen. So, we have suspended drilling operation for time being,” Ujjwal Bhattacharya, NTPC’s project director, was quoted as saying by ANI earlier.Aparna Kumar, deputy inspector general of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), had said earlier in the day that rescue operations were underway inside Tapovan tunnel in Chamoli. "There is a possibility that some more people could be stuck inside the tunnel. NTPC team is using vertical drilling to find their whereabouts," Kumar was quoted as saying by ANI.Also watch | Disturbing visuals of workers getting washed away in UttarakhandITBP’s troops are helping to construct a bridge across villages disconnected in Chamoli and which will be used to transport ration. Rescuers had begun drilling inside the 2.5km Tapovan tunnel in Chamoli to rescue more than 35 workers trapped there after Sunday’s flash flood, news agency Reuters said.According to Reuters, soldiers have made only halting progress in four days and after clearing more than 100 metres of mud, rocks and debris, relief workers on Thursday sent water tankers and generators deep into the tunnel to assist in drilling. They are trying to search for signs of life in smaller tunnels and rooms branching off from the main passage, Reuters reported citing officials said.Meanwhile, the death toll after the flash flood in Chamoli district has risen to 34, out of which 10 have been identified, and 204 people are still missing, ANI had reported earlier in the day. The news agency also cited the State Secretariat as saying that the two people, working with the Rishi Ganga company and said to be missing, have reached their homes.The people who are unaccounted for since Sunday's disaster are mostly workers at the Tapovan Vishnugad hydroelectric project and at the smaller Rishiganga dam, which was swept away by the barrage of water.A glacier broke in Chamoli’s Tapovan-Reni area on Sunday, which led to massive flooding in Dhauliganga and Alaknanda rivers as bridges and roads were swept away.The Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) has said in an analysis that more than 85% of Uttarakhand’s districts are hotspots of extreme floods and associated weather events. The council said in its analysis the frequency and intensity of extreme flood events in Uttarakhand have increased four-fold since 1970. Flood related events such as landslides, cloud bursts, glacial lake outbursts, etc. have also increased four-fold during this period, causing massive loss and damage, it added.Chamoli, where the glacial breach disaster took place last Sunday, Haridwar, Nainital, Pithoragarh and Uttarkashi districts are the most vulnerable to extreme floods according to the analysis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rescue-ops-stopped-temporarily-in-chamoli-after-rishiganga-s-water-level-rises-101613034944533.html
11-02-2021||India||With AIMIM's support, TRS wins Hyderabad Mayor, deputy Mayor posts||Gadwal Vijayalakshmi of Telangana Rashtra Samithi was on Thursday elected Mayor of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation, thanks to the strategic support from the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) at the eleventh hour. Another TRS corporator Mothe Srilatha Reddy from Tarnaka division was elected Deputy Mayor. She defeated Shankar Yadav of the BJP.Vijayalakshmi, who represents Banjara Hills division of the GHMC, is the daughter of TRS parliamentary party leader K Kesava Rao. She defeated the Bharatiya Janata Party candidate Radha Dheeraj Reddy, corporator from R K Puram division.She is the first woman Mayor after the formation of Telangana state in 2014 and the second woman to occupy the chair after the formation of GHMC in 2009, the first one being Banda Kartika Reddy of the Congress.Both Vijayalakshmi and Srilatha were chosen by TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and their names forwarded to the party in a sealed cover. The names were announced by TRS working president K T Rama Rao at a meeting of the newly-elected TRS corporators at the GHMC premises.TRS corporator from Khairatabad, P Vijayalakshmi, who was the front-runner for the Mayor post, walked out of the meeting in protest. She did not take part in the voting.The elections to the GHMC held on December 1 witnessed a close contest between the TRS and the BJP. The TRS won only 56 seats in the 150-member GHMC council and was 20 seats short of the absolute majority.The BJP finished a close second with 48 seats. The AIMIM retained its strength of 44 seats, which it had in the previous term. The Congress ended up with just two seats.Though the TRS was 20 seats short of the majority mark, it was hopeful of winning the Mayor and deputy Mayor posts with the help of 38 co-option members, including the party MPs, MLAs and MLCs who registered their vote in GHMC limits.The BJP had only two co-option members so the chances of winning the Mayor and deputy Mayor posts were very bleak. Interestingly, the AIMIM, which has 44 seats and 10 co-option votes, announced that it would also field candidates for the two posts, making the contest more interesting.Including the co-option members, the total number of members taking part in the voting on Thursday was 193 and the TRS required 97 votes to grab the top posts. However, it had only 88 votes – 56 elected corporators and 32 co-option members and it made the contest tight.However, a few minutes before the election of Mayor and deputy mayor was held at 12.30 pm, the AIMIM announced that it was dropping out of the contest and was extending support to the TRS, much to the shock of the BJP.As a result, the TRS could get 100 votes (56 of TRS and 44 of AIMIM) and it could walk away with both the Mayor and deputy Mayor posts comfortably, without banking the co-option votes.Earlier, the oath taking ceremony of the newly elected corporators of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) was completed with Presiding Officer Swetha Mohanthy conducting the proceedings. Election Observer Sandeep Kumar Sultania monitored the proceedings.The members took their oath en masse in four different languages, Telugu, Urdu, Hindi and English.Expressing happiness over her election as Mayor, Vijayalakshmi thanked KCR and KTR for reposing faith in her. “As a woman Mayor, my first priority is to ensure safety and security to women in the city and develop Hyderabad as a global city,” she said.BJP legislator from Hyderabad T Raja Singh said the TRS had dug its own grave by taking the support from the MIM. “It is nothing but a betrayal of faith of the people of Hyderabad. In the coming assembly elections, the TRS will have to pay a penalty for the same,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-aimim-s-support-trs-wins-hyderabad-mayor-deputy-mayor-posts-101613034244056.html

He underlined the need for consensus in the polity. Modi said while numbers are needed to form the government, the country is run on consensus. “Politics for us is the means to achieve a national policy. As I said earlier, the government may run with a majority, but nations are run with consensus,” he said in his address to BJP lawmakers on the death anniversary of the party’s ideologue Deen Dayal Upadhyaya. “The idea of political untouchability is not in our culture. The country has rejected this idea. In our party, importance is given to the worker even as we reject dynasty.”Modi said BJP’s critics such as late former President Pranab Mukherjee, former Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi and Nagaland’s S C Jamir have been honoured for their contribution to nation building. Mukherjee was given the highest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna, Gogoi and Jamir have also been awarded Padma Bhushan, the third-highest. “They were neither part of the BJP nor even allies of the party. But it was our duty to honour their contributions,” said Modi.Also Read | Election fervour in Kerala, Tamil Nadu likely to peak with PM Modi’s visitModi said differences with political opponents should not come in the way of extending courtesy and respect. He said freedom fighter Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was given the honour he deserved and tribute was paid to the country’s first home minister, Vallabhbhai Patel, by getting the world’s tallest statue made for him in Gujarat. “...Baba Saheb [Bhimrao] Ambedkar [the architect of the Constitution] got the Bharat Ratna [in 1990] when a government was formed with the BJP’s support,” Modi said.Earlier this week, Modi made an emotional speech in the Rajya Sabha when three of the four opposition lawmakers retired. Modi, while bidding farewell to the Leader of the opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad, broke down while recalling his response to a terror attack.Modi said the BJP has imbibed the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi--love and compassion.On self-reliance, Modi, who has earlier given the slogan of “vocal for local”, said the lawmakers must take stock of the things that they use to assess how many of these are made abroad. “The entire country is awakened to the idea of Aatma Nirbhaya Bharat [self-reliant India]. We are on the verge of reaching 75 years of independence. I call upon every one of you to carry out 75 tasks that serve society as a tribute to our 75 years of Independence.”Modi said transformational changes were taking place in the field of infrastructure to make the lives of citizens easier. He spoke about the growing volume of digital transactions and said India is witnessing changes in every sphere including defence with the focus on made in India weapons and fighters like Tejas.“In 1965 during the India-Pakistan war, India had to depend on other countries for weapons... Deendayalji said at that time that we have to build an India that is self-reliant not just in agriculture but also in defence and weaponry. We took the decisions that were deemed difficult in the country and we took them with everyone.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-does-not-believe-in-political-untouchability-sayspmmodi-101613032634317.html

11-02-2021||India||India to see average salary increase of 6.4 per cent in 2021: Survey||Salaries in India are projected to rise by an average of 6.4 per cent in 2021, marginally higher than the average actual increase of 5.9 per cent in 2020, according to a Willis Towers Watson survey.According to Willis Towers Watson's latest Salary Budget Planning Survey report, an average salary increase of 6.4 per cent in 2021 translates to a median increase of 7 per cent."As companies in India respond to the economic implications of the COVID-19 crisis, there is an increased optimism on business recovery, but it is yet to translate into the salary increment budget," said Rajul Mathur, Consulting Head – Talent & Rewards, Willis Towers Watson India.Mathur further said that with compensation budgets lower than previous years, companies are likely to prioritise allocation towards protecting critical and high skilled talent. "Through 2021, we can continue to expect greater emphasis on pay for performance and pay linked to business output," Mathur said.As per the survey, on average, 20.6 per cent of the salary increase budget is being allocated to top performers, which represent 10.3 per cent of the employees in India."This implies that for each INR 1 allocated to an average performer, INR 2.35 is allocated to a top performer and INR 1.25 is allocated to an above average performer," the survey said.The survey further noted that median salary increase at the executive level for 2021 is projected at 7 per cent, a slight decline from 7.1 per cent in the previous year.For middle management, professional and support staff, a decrease from 7.5 per cent in 2020 to 7.3 per cent in 2021 is projected.The Salary Budget Planning Report is compiled by Willis Towers Watson’s Data Services Practice. The survey was conducted online in October/November 2020 and received over 18,000 sets of responses covering over 130 countries worldwide.A comparison of projected salary increases across key markets in Asia Pacific this year shows that Indonesia is projected at 6.5 per cent, China at 6 per cent, Philippines at 5 per cent, Singapore at 3.5 per cent and Hong Kong at 3 per cent.Of the surveyed companies in India, 37 per cent have projected a positive business revenue outlook for the next 12 months, up from 18 per cent in Q3 2020. However, recruitment is yet to pick up.The study showed that only 10 per cent of the organisations in India plan to add new headcount compared to 14 per cent last quarter.A sector wise analysis shows that, high tech, pharmaceuticals and consumer products and retail, project a median salary increase around 8 per cent -- more than the general industry projection.The financial services and manufacturing sector projects a 7 per cent increase in 2021, while the BPO sector is at 6 per cent. The energy sector is expected to see the lowest increase of 4.6 per cent.“All sectors witnessed varying levels of impact due to Covid-19. Some sectors such as hospitality, aviation, travel and tourism were hit harder than the others. Sectors such as pharma, FMCG, e-commerce and high-tech have experienced growth and this is reflective in their hiring plans and salary budgets for 2021," said Arvind Usretay, Director, Rewards, Willis Towers Watson India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-see-average-salary-increase-of-6-4-per-cent-in-2021-survey-101613024676707.html

Flood related events such as landslides, cloud bursts, glacial lake outbursts, etc. have also increased four-fold during this period, causing massive loss and damage.Chamoli where the glacial breach disaster took place last Sunday, Haridwar, Nainital, Pithoragarh, and Uttarkashi districts are the most vulnerable to extreme floods according to the analysis.The findings are from the CEEW report titled: Preparing India for Extreme Climate Events released in December which highlighted that even with a 0.6 degree C rise in temperature over the past century, India is facing devastating consequences. CEEW has coupled information available from globally validated data sheets with data from other sources like the India Meteorological Department, World Meteorological Organization, and Press Information Bureau.Also Read | Rescue teams begin drilling operations at Uttarakhand flood siteThe team developed a gridded exposure sheet of climate events; and a geo-spatial analysis of extreme climate events using coarse grain resolution temporal maps.CEEW programme lead Abinash Mohanty said, “The recent devastating flash flood in Uttarakhand is further proof that the climate crisis can no longer be ignored. In the last 20 years, Uttarakhand has lost more than 50,000 hectares of forest cover, leading to micro climatic changes in the region. This, in turn, has triggered a rise in extreme climate events in the state. A focus on land use-based forest restoration could not only reverse the climate imbalance but also help promote sustainable tourism in the state. Equally important would be climate proofing of infrastructure, investments, and policies. This is no more an option, rather a national imperative to tackle such extreme events and ensure minimal loss and damage.”The report had found more than 75% of India’s districts are hot spots of extreme climate events and estimated that 97.51 million people are exposed to extreme floods in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-85-uttarakhand-districts-hot-spots-of-extreme-floods-analysis-101613031554384.html

There is no protocol, they can come like a normal person and participate in the rituals," IG said.This comes after the All India Congress Committee (AICC) General Secretary and in-charge of Uttar Pradesh Priyanka Gandhi Vadra announced that she will take a holy dip at Sangam in Prayagraj on the occasion of Mauni Amavasya.The Congress leader will also participate in that Magh Mela at Sangam.According to sources, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will first stay at Anand Bhawan, from where she will proceed to Sangam."No political program has been planned during her visit. She will return to Delhi in the evening," said the sources.However, contrary to the sources' claim, the actions of UP Congress in-charge cannot be seen without a political prism. Her plans and programs are always designed with a motive keeping the image of the party in mind.Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is the sole face of Congress in Uttar Pradesh, where the party is trying to regain the political ground lost almost three decades ago.The holy dip seems like a nod to the Hindutva cadre in the state.

"Jai Shri Ram chant is an insult to Mamata Banerjee. Why? So many people take pride in this chant. Why do you get insulted by this slogan? Because you have to appease one section for votes," Shah said. "If slogans of Jai Shri Ram are not raised here, will it be raised in Pakistan?" the BJP leader said launching the party's 'poriborton yatra' from Coochbehar."This yatra is not to change the chief minister, not to replace a minister or an MLA. This 'poribirton yatra' is to change the situation of Bengal, to stop border intrusion. We will make a state where a bird will also not be able to cross the border," he saiComparing Modi's politics of Vikas and Mamata Banerjee's politics of Vinash, Amit Shah said, "Mamata's focus is only making her nephew the next chief minister. Had Dilip Ghosh not been there, she would have announced her nephew as the next chief minister. But now she is scared.""In 2017, Mamata Banerjee had said BJP will get zero in West Bengal. But then you gave 18 seats to BJP. Now, she is looking for seats — from where she can contest," Amit Shah said, referring to Mamata's recent announcement that she would contest from Nandigram as well after Suvendu Adhikari joined the BJP.Talking about the Centre's Budget allocation to West Bengal and its future plan to convert North Bengal into a major tourist hub, Amit Shah said, "Bengal worships Devi Durga but for that you have to go to the court. Bring us to power and it will be a land of both Ram Navami and Durga Puja."The incident of Netaji's birth anniversary celebration where Mamata left the stage after she was greeted with 'Jai Shri Ram' slogans was also mentioned by Shah. "Do you want a government which fights with the Centre. But didi only fights with Modiji. At least she could not have fought on Netaji's birth anniversary celebration," Amit Shah said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-too-will-chant-jai-shri-ram-when-election-ends-amit-shah-in-bengal-101613029824226.html

Speaking at the ‘Samarpan Diwas’ programme in Upadhyaya’s memory, PM Modi said that Upadhyaya’s views are relevant even today.“Deendayal Upadhyaya ji was like the head of this vast family of ours. He continuously gave inspiration to our family. All of you have read his works and have achieved success in your lives by following his principles,” PM Modi said. He added that Upadhyay’s works feel fresh even today, further saying that the more one follows the right-wing ideologue’s works, the more points of view he comes across.“Today, Upadhyaya ji’s views are as relevant as they were during his days. In fact, they will continue to be relevant in the coming time as well,” the Prime Minister said. He added that Upadhyaya’s views will be relevant whenever there is a question on the welfare of humanity. Quoting a Sanskrit shloka, PM Modi said, “Through power, one can get only limited respect. One will get respect only if he is actually influential. However, a wise person is respected everywhere. Deendayal ji was a living example of this.”Upadhyaya, he further remarked, is also an example of how a political leader should conduct himself in social life. PM Modi further explained how several of Upadhyaya’s views are in line with various policies of the central government.Born on September 25, 1916, in Mathura, Deendayal Upadhyaya, was a leader of the Bharatiya Jan Sangh, a forerunner to what is the present BJP. Besides PM Modi, BJP national president JP Nadda was present at the ‘Samarpan Diwas’ event. Union home minister Amit Shah, meanwhile, paid his tributes to Upadhyaya in Guwahati, Assam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/his-views-relevant-even-today-pm-modi-pays-tribute-to-deendayal-upadhyaya-101613027101783.html

He added Madhav’s tone was “unpleasant and aggressive” during the meeting at the India Foundation’s office in New Delhi.Basit said Madhav, who was also in charge of the erstwhile state, said that Pakistan should forget about Kashmir and worry about Gilgit-Baltistan and Pakistan occupied Kashmir. “He said Pakistan was wasting time and it is only a matter of time that Article 370 would be abrogated from Kashmir since it was part of the BJP’s manifesto,” Basit said.ALSO WATCH | J&K DDC poll results: Omar slams BJP; Ram Madhav says 'Centre's policy won'﻿In August 2019, Parliament passed the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, which led to the reading down of Article 370 and Article 35 A that gave the region special status and laid down conditions for domicile rules. The state was also bifurcated into two union territories.Also Read | A roadmap to reform democracy: OpinionBasit claimed Madhav gave Islamabad an insight into what was to come. He added Madhav referred to Pakistan as a terrorist state. “He kept saying that Pakistan is a terrorist state and fosters terrorism. I said it is not as simple as you think things are.” Basit said Madhav refused to listen, “...I got a clarity into the mindset of the BJP and what their policy there will be.”Basit referred to the BJP’s target of winning 44 seats in Jammu & Kashmir in 2014. He added the BJP’s stance regarding Pakistan’s engagement with the separatist Hurriyat Conference got the party support of Jammu Hindus and helped it win 25 seats in the region for the first time and to become the second-largest party in Jammu & Kashmir.Basit referred to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, and how its Muslim wing, the Muslim Rashtriya Manch, also played a role and launched Indian Muslims in Kashmir. He added he could not meet Madhav after the BJP formed a coalition government with the People’s Democratic Party in Jammu & Kashmir. “There was no pleasantness or liking for each other ...It is not important whether I like someone or not but I have to convey my point and understand the other’s point of view,” Basit said. He added he has mentioned the meeting in his upcoming book Hostility.Madhav said the details about the meeting have been made public without his consent. “We had a long meeting but I was never aggressive. I was only putting across India’s view point with firmness.

The content and incidents mentioned in the letters claimed to have been planted in Rona Wilson’s electronic devices were corroborated in the charge sheet by other oral, documentary and technical evidence submitted with the charge sheet. This is also evident from the activities of Rona Wilson who visited the densely-forested area of Abhujmad in Chhattisgarh that is considered to be a base for Maoist fighters.The official said highly incriminating oral and documentary evidence has been collected which has already been submitted along with the charge sheet and a cogent case with entire evidence against the accused has been submitted before the trial court.Investigating officials said that videos were taken of all the evidence seized by the Pune Police from Wilson’s residence, which included hard disk, CDs, laptop, mobile phones, memory cards, etc. These were enumerated in a seizure memo following due procedure following which a strict “chain of custody” was maintained. The evidence was sent to Regional FSL Pune for further examination. The report did not indicate any instance of tampering with digital devices.The Pune Police and the NIA, which later took over the investigations, have submitted three charge sheets against 22 accused persons including 6 who are still on the run and none of them has been granted any relief including bail by courts though India has a highly robust judicial system and the accused persons get the best possible opportunity to represent their case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-ploy-govt-rebuts-claim-that-letters-were-planted-in-wilson-s-laptop-101613023127438.html
11-02-2021||India||China to move to east of Finger 8, no patrolling in disputed area: Rajnath Singh||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday told Parliament that India and China reached a consensus on disengagement of their frontline soldiers on the north and south banks of Pangong Tso, areas that have been at the centre of the current border tensions in eastern Ladakh. Singh said as part of the agreement on disengagement, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) will move its forces to the east of Finger 8 on the north bank, and the Indian Army will move to its base near Finger 3. The minister said India and China also agreed to temporarily suspend their regular patrolling activities on the north bank. “The Chinese side will keep its troop presence in the north bank area to east of Finger 8. Reciprocally, the Indian troops will be based at their permanent base at Dhan Singh Thapa Post near Finger 3. A similar action would be taken in the south bank area by both sides,” he said. The minister said these are mutual and reciprocal steps and structures that built by both sides after April 2020 in both north and south bank areas will be removed. Also Read | India-China standoff: All you need to know about disengagement on Pangong TsoHe told Rajya Sabha that both armies agreed to pullback forces in a “phased, coordinated and verifiable manner.” He said within 48 hours of “full disengagement” in these areas, senior Indian and Chinese commanders will meet again to discuss further disengagement at other friction points. This is the first significant movement in negotiations to ease tensions in more than eight months—disengagement in Galwan valley took place in early July 2020 but it did not progress in other areas. The minister’s statement comes on the back of limited withdrawal of front-line troops by the Indian and Chinese armies from the Pangong Tso area on the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC). The development has turned the spotlight on how the broader disengagement plan will unfold in other flashpoints where rival soldiers are deployed eyeball to eyeball and where previous attempts to reduce military tensions have failed. “It has also been agreed to have a temporary moratorium on military activities by both sides in the north bank, including patrolling to the traditional areas. Patrolling will be resumed only when both sides reach an agreement in diplomatic and military talks that would be held subsequently. The implementation of this agreement has started yesterday in the north and south bank of the Pangong Lake. It will substantially restore the situation to that existing prior to commencement of the standoff last year,” he said. The Finger Area was until now the toughest part of the disengagement process. “I want to assure this House that in these talks we have not conceded anything. The House should also know that there are still some outstanding issues with regard to deployment and patrolling at some other points along the LAC in Eastern Ladakh. These will be the focus of further discussions with the Chinese side. We have agreed that both sides should achieve complete disengagement at the earliest and abide fully by the bilateral agreements and protocols. By now, the Chinese side is also fully aware of our resolve,” Singh said. The mutual pulling back of tanks and infantry combat vehicles from heights on the southern bank of Pangong Tso began on Wednesday a fortnight after military commanders of the two armies agreed on January 24 to push for an early disengagement of their frontline troops. The Chinese People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) aggressive forward deployments in the eastern Ladakh theatre have hindered the Indian Army’s patrolling patterns in several areas including Depsang, Finger Area on the northern bank of Pangong Tso, Gogra and Kongka La. Regaining access to several areas that are now difficult to reach due to actions by the Chinese army along LAC is critical, experts said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-to-move-to-finger-8-no-patrolling-in-disputed-area-rajnath-singh-101613023093938.html
11-02-2021||India||Odisha to amend FRBM Act for additional borrowing||The Odisha government plans to amend the Odisha Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2005 that would enable it to avail an additional 2% fiscal deficit of Gross State Domestic Product from the current level of 3.5% now.Finance department officials said the additional 2% fiscal deficit includes unconditional borrowing of 1% of GSDP and the balance 1% depending upon the implementation of four sectoral reforms, each carrying weightage of 0.25%. The decision would give an additional leeway to the state government to go for higher borrowing for meeting its rising capital.In 2016, the state had last amended the FRBM Act raising the level of fiscal deficit to 3.5% of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) from 3%, giving it an additional leeway to go for higher borrowing for meeting its rising Capex (capital expenditure).Odisha finance secretary AKK Meena said the state may resort to borrowing in the 2021-22 financial year. "We can borrow up to 5% fiscal deficit of the Gross State Domestic Product," he said. This additional borrowing would enable the state government to meet higher resources requirement for Covid-19 management, maintain the standards of service delivery to the public, compensate the shortfall arising out of GST implementation (GST compensation Shortfall), and maintain the level of Capital Expenditure on infrastructure projects in the State.The amendment of the FRBM Act comes at a time when the revenue growth has not been spectacular and the central devolution to the state has come down. Though the 15th Finance Commission kept devolution to states unchanged in its interim report for 2020-21, the cumulative share contracted marginally to 41% from 42% after the number of states was reduced to 28 because of the reorganisation of Jammu & Kashmir into two Union Territories.While Odisha has so far seen a shortfall of over ₹10,840 crore in the net tax and duty proceeds in 2020-21, the devolution of central taxes and duties to Odisha in the coming financial year 2021-22 will be ₹3,048.99 crore lesser than the tax devolved to the state in 2019-20.Economists said states like Odisha which despite being financially prudent over last few years would face an unprecedented situation in the post-Covid state. "We are now in a situation in which there is a high deficit, high borrowing, high expenditure, less revenue, and less growth. All states have to increase fiscal deficit level otherwise they can't fulfill their promises. The state governments in many poll-bound schemes would not be able to announce new schemes out of their own resources for the next 2-3 years," said Pratap Jena, associate professor of National Institute of Public Finance and Policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-to-amend-frbm-act-for-additional-borrowing-101613022060924.html

Assembly speaker P Dhanapal first issued the notices in 2017 saying they brought the prohibited items banned in the state since 2013 into the House.“When there are no clearly laid out rules and what constitutes the breach of privilege and what punishment it entails, it could not be stated that the petitioners ought to have obtained permission from the first respondent [speaker],” the court said. It added that administrative authorities must exercise their discretionary powers reasonably. “The court is concerned with the manner in which the decision has been passed. It means that the second respondent [secretary of the assembly] will be able to make the same decision again in the exercise of the discretionary power vested with it. Such a decision should not be arbitrary and inconsistent with Article 19 [freedom of speech] of the Constitution of India.”Also Read | Tamil Nadu parties united in call for single phase state electionsThe DMK lawmakers moved the court saying the fresh notices were issued to them to prevent them from participating in the assembly proceedings and raising questions on the management of the Covid-19 pandemic.Stalin said the state government could have shown a similar concern in preventing gutkha sales. “We took gutkha packages to the assembly to indicate the huge number of banned gutkha sales in Tamil Nadu,” said Stalin. “They say the sale is still going on. gutkha government’s game is going to end soon.” Tamil Nadu is due to go to the polls in April and May this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/court-quashes-privilege-notices-issued-to-stalin-17-other-dmk-lawmakers-101613022253363.html

Modi will arrive in Chennai on February 14 to inaugurate several infrastructure projects, including a new Metro rail stretch in the city, and the Cauvery-Gundar river-linking project. Later in the day, he will fly to Kochi to inaugurate a new Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited’s (BPCL) plant.The PM had visited Assam and West Bengal last week.Modi’s visit comes at a time when the BJP’s senior ally in the state, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) is in some distress over the return of VK Sasikala, a close aide of late J Jayalalithaa. After serving a four-year jail term in Bengaluru in the disproportionate assets case, Sasikala came to Chennai on Tuesday following a 23-hour long roadshow, positioning herself as AIADMK general secretary-- a post she held after Jayalalithaa’s death in December 2016, till her imprisonment in February 2017.While she was in prison, her former loyalist, chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami and his deputy O Panneerselvam buried their differences, merged their factions, and expelled Sasikala from the party. Palaniswami is the chief ministerial candidate of the alliance, who reiterated that Sasikala would not be taken back into the party fold after meeting PM Modi in New Delhi last month.The PM will have a brief interaction with BJP leaders after his public programs. Besides the PM, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to be in Villupuram to attend a function organised by the party’s Mahila Morcha. Party chief JP Nadda will also visit the state in late February. The AIADMK-BJP combine is pitted against the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)-Congress alliance which has been out of power since 2011.In Kerala’s Kochi, after inaugurating the new complex of BPCL, Modi will interact with core committee members of the state unit and discuss poll strategies, said BJP Kerala unit president K Surendran on Wednesday. The party has asked the state unit to sink its internal differences and make use of opportunities and bag the maximum seats.This time, the party’s national leaders will be campaigning extensively in Kerala despite the saffron party being a distant third in the state’s bipolar politics. Its recent performance in the local body elections, however, has given it some hope.The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) mustered around 15% of votes in the local polls, and the party thinks it could win a few seats if it improves its vote share. The one seat it won (Nemom in Thiruvananthapuram) in the last assembly elections in 2016, was the party’s only notable poll performance in the state so far.“We have classified assembly seats according to our strength. We will expose both, Congress and CPI (M), which are allies at many places including in neighbouring Tamil Nadu. Besides their double standards, we will raise Sabarimala issue, gold smuggling and other corruption cases,” Surendran told the Hindustan Times.Also Read: Big projects for poll-bound states in budget: Kapil Sibal alleges biasMeanwhile, Congress leaders have asked former party chief Rahul Gandhi, who is also an MP from Wayanad in north Kerala, to campaign extensively in the state. During the last parliamentary election in 2019, the Congress won 15 of the 20 seats in Kerala, the party’s best performance in any state. During the campaigning then, Gandhi did not criticise the Left government too much. But Congress leaders have now asked him to go all-out against their arch-rivals in the state.Gandhi will address the concluding session of opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala’s ‘Aiswarya Kerala Yatra’ on Feb 23 in the state capital. “He will be the star campaigner in the state. Priyanka will also join him during the roadshow,” said PCC general secretary KP Anil Kumar.“Both, left and Congress, are facing an existential crisis. This time Gandhi will have to shed his gloves and go after the political rival in the state. Gandhi pitching tents in Kerala will augur well for the party. It will also help end the factional feud in the state unit,” said senior journalist and political commentator John Mary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/election-fervour-in-kerala-tamil-nadu-likely-to-peak-with-pm-modi-s-visit-101613021352362.html

He said that during the ninth round of Corps Commander-level military talks, it was decided that both the sides will remove forward deployments in a phased and coordinated manner.The minister said that India has always emphasised on maintaining bilateral ties and is committed to maintaining peace and tranquility along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Singh said both sides agree that complete disengagement under bilateral pacts and protocol should be done at the earliest.He told the Rajya Sabha that China’s People's Liberation Army (PLA) will pull back to east of Finger 8 and Indian Army will move to its permanent base near Finger 3. The commanders of both sides will hold a meeting following the completion of disengagement in the Pangong area, Singh said.The defence minister assured the House that India has not lost anything and informed there are still some outstanding issues regarding deployment and patrolling on LAC.India had rushed frontline tanks and armoured vehicles to the strategic heights held by its soldiers on the southern bank in September last year, in response to intimidating moves by the PLA.Also Read | India-China standoff: All you need to know about disengagement on Pangong TsoHis remarks come a day after the Chinese defence ministry said that both sides have begun disengaging on the southern and northern banks of Pangong Tso.

11-02-2021||India||India-China standoff: All you need to know about disengagement on Pangong Tso||Indian and Chinese troops have begun disengaging on the southern and northern banks of Ladakh’s Pangong Tso, China’s defence ministry announced on Wednesday. Here is what we know about the matter:• People familiar with it in India said both sides were pulling back armoured elements from heights around the frozen lake. • There was no official word from India’s defence ministry or foreign ministry on the development, which came against the backdrop of a nine-month military standoff in the Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) that has taken bilateral ties to an all-time low.• Defence minister Rajnath Singh is due to make a statement on the development in Parliament on Thursday. This is in line with the convention that such key issues are first taken up in the House when it is in session.• In a statement on the Chinese defence ministry’s website, spokesperson Senior Colonel Wu Qian said,“The Chinese and Indian frontline troops at the southern and northern bank of the Pangong Tso Lake start synchronised and organised disengagement from February 10.”Also Read | Rajnath Singh to address India-China Ladakh standoff in Rajya Sabha today• It added the move is in accordance with the consensus reached by both sides at the 9th round of China-India Corps Commander Level Meeting.• The reference was to a meeting of military commanders held on the Chinese side of the Moldo-Chushul border meeting point on January 24.• Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said in a similar statement that troops from both sides had begun to “conduct simultaneous and planned disengagement” at Pangong lake in line with the consensus reached by the Chinese and Indian foreign ministers at a meeting in Moscow last September and the ninth round of commander-level talks.• Wang hoped the Indian side will work with China to meet each other halfway, strictly implement the consensus reached between the two sides and ensure the smooth implementation of the disengagement process.• Both statements gave no details of the disengagement process.• The Indian Army occupied a series of key heights to prevent the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) from grabbing territory on the southern bank of Pangong Tso in a stealthy midnight move on August 29, 2020. • The Indian side’s control of ridgeline positions on the southern bank allows it to dominate the sector and keep an eye on Chinese military activity. These positions are scattered across Rezang and Reqin passes, Gurung Hill and Magar heights, while the PLA also holds some features on the southern bank.• Last September, India rushed frontline tanks and armoured vehicles to the strategic heights held by its soldiers on the southern bank, in response to intimidating moves by the PLA.Also Read | Pullback raises hope but India set to keep close eye on China• Following the ninth meeting of the military commanders, a joint statement said the two sides had “agreed to push for an early disengagement of the frontline troops”, and to hold the 10th round of the commander-level meeting “at an early date to jointly advance de-escalation”.• LAC passes through Pangong lake, parts of which are controlled by Indian and Chinese troops. Both sides also patrol the waters of the lake in special boats.• This is the second attempt to disengage frontline troops to resolve the standoff that began last May. • Disengagement in Galwan valley took place in early July, but it didn’t progress in other areas. • India has consistently pushed for comprehensive disengagement at all friction points and restoration of the status quo ante of early April 2020.• The announcement of disengagement by the Chinese side was markedly different from the resolution of the military standoff at Doklam in 2017. • At that time, both countries issued simultaneous statements on troop withdrawals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiachina-standoff-all-you-need-to-know-about-disengagement-on-pangong-tso-101613021113623.html
11-02-2021||India||TRS, BJP in direct contest in GHMC mayor, deputy mayor elections today||Elections for the post of mayor and deputy mayor of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) are scheduled to be conducted on Thursday. An hour after the newly elected corporators of GHMC take oath, elections for the mayor and deputy mayor will be conducted at 12.30pm. The posts have become a matter of prestige for the ruling K Chandrashekar Rao led Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is also contesting for both the posts this time. The term of the present council of GHMC expired on February 10.What were the results of the GHMC polls?In the GHMC polls held in December 2021, TRS won 56 out of the 150 seats while the BJP won 48 seats. Asaduddin Owaisi's All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) won 44 seats while the Congress finished a distant fourth with just two seats. In the 2015 GHMC polls, the TRS had won 99 seats and also secured the mayor and deputy mayor posts unanimously. But this time, securing the positions of mayor and deputy mayor is an uphill task for the party.How are the elections for the post of mayor and deputy mayor held?A total of 193 people will vote to elect the new GHMC mayor and deputy mayor. This includes 150 corporators and 43 ex-officio members. For the election to be held, a quorum of 50% attendance is compulsory and whichever candidate secures more votes will be elected for the posts.The TRS has 32 ex-officio members (local members of Parliament and MLAs) of the GHMC and the BJP has 2 ex-officio seats.Who could be the likely winner?TRS is likely to grab both the positions as with the ex-officio members, the party’s tally would go up to 88 (56 councillors+ 32 ex-officio members). BJP’s tally would go to 50 (48 councillors+ 2 ex-officio members). AIMIM could emerge as the deciding party as it has 44 councillors and 9 ex-officio members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trs-bjp-in-direct-contest-in-ghmc-mayor-deputy-mayor-elections-today-101613018996130.html
11-02-2021||India||Evidence fabricated in Bhima Koregaon case? What prompted Rona Wilson’s plea||Activist Rona Wilson moved the Bombay high court on Wednesday seeking the quashing of criminal proceedings against him for allegedly fomenting violence in Bhima Koregaon near Pune in 2018. It came after an American digital forensics consulting company concluded that fabricated evidence was planted including in a laptop and thumb drive seized from Wilson’s residence in April 2018. Here is all you need to know about the matter:• In his petition, Wilson’s lawyer has attached a copy of a digital forensic report from Arsenal Consulting, whose contents were first reported by the Washington Post.• The firm found that malware had been installed in Wilson’s computer on June 13, 2016, after someone using the email account of Varavara Rao, who is one of the accused in the case, sent a phishing mail to Wilson.• National Investigation Agency spokesperson Jaya Roy said the digital extracts they have submitted in court along with the charge sheet were examined at Regional Forensic Science Laboratory, Pune, which shows no evidence of any malware in any laptop/device.Also Read | Bhima Koregaon case: Bombay HC rejects Gautam Navlakha’s default bail plea• The hack was technically not sophisticated and appears to be inspired by Soviet-era espionage, cyber-security experts said.• Arsenal used tools to decrypt and parse NetWire logs and Quickheal database fragments. The report claimed that the firm was able to reconstruct the events of how Wilson’s computer was compromised, which also included synchronising files between Wilson’s computer and another server.• NetWire logs are files that contain keystrokes and other information such as browsing history, saved passwords, composed emails, and editing documents.• Forensic images of digital devices along with final reports are provided to accused persons as mandated by the Code of Criminal Procedure.• Investigating officials said that videos were taken of all the evidence seized by the Pune Police from Wilson’s residence, which included hard disk, CDs, laptop, mobile phones, memory cards, etc.• These were enumerated in a seizure memo following due procedure following which a strict “chain of custody” was maintained. The evidence was sent to Regional FSL Pune for further examination. The report did not indicate any instance of tampering with the digital devices.• Wilson’s petition argued that in light of the Arsenal report, any prosecution against him or the other co-accused (15 other prominent activists, academics and lawyers) would be a “travesty of justice”.• Analysing the forensic images obtained from the Toshiba hard drive inside Wilson’s computer as well as a SanDisk Cruzer Blade thumb drive that was attached to it, the report stated that the attacker copied documents into the thumb drive on March 14, 2018, and later created a warren of dummy folders containing dummy data “so that the victim would not stumble upon them”.• The forensics report suggested the attackers deployed a commonly used strategy known as spear phishing. The attackers send an email that appears to be from a trustworthy source, convincing the target to click on attachments that deliver what is known as the exploit or the piece of code that opens a backdoor and ultimately allows for malware to be installed.• A NetWire remote access trojan was installed on Wilson’s Hewlett Packard Pavilion notebook once he clicked on what he thought was a mere Dropbox link. This allowed the attacker to conduct surveillance and plant incriminating documents, the report said.• Arsenal Consulting, a Massachusetts-based digital forensics firm, surmised that Wilson’s computer was compromised by the same attacker for 22 months between 2016 and April 17, 2018, when electronic evidence was seized by the Pune Police on suspicion of his alleged links with the violence that erupted in Bhima Koregaon village in Maharashtra on January 1, 2018, during the bicentennial celebrations of a British-era war commemorated by Dalits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/evidence-fabricated-in-bhima-koregaon-case-what-prompted-rona-wilson-s-plea-101613019793074.html

Chinese investor Shunwei Capital is a small stakeholder of the company at present, and its stakes are being bought by other companies, Aprameya confirmed.Koo is an India registered company with Indian founders. Raised earlier capital 2.5 years ago. Latest funds for Bombinate Technologies is led by a truly Indian investor 3one4 capital. Shunwei (single digit shareholder) which had invested in our Vokal journey will be exiting fullyWhat is Koo? Which ministers have already joined this made-in-India app?"Koo is an India registered company with Indian founders. Raised earlier capital 2.5 years ago. Latest funds for Bombinate Technologies is led by a truly Indian investor 3one4 capital. Shunwei (single-digit shareholder) which had invested in our Vokal journey will be exiting fully," he tweeted.We have got more love than we expected. Our systems are facing more load than ever. Thank you for placing your trust in us. Our team is working on overdrive to fix it. We request your patience and support through this time. Let's do this together!As India and San Francisco-headquartered Twitter is engaged in a face-off over Twitter's "inaction" to take action against account "inciting genocide", Koo has got a shot in the arm as several ministers having huge Twitter following have opened accounts on Koo as well. Some government departments, including the ministry of electronics and information technology, opened their accounts on Koo. In fact, the accounts are quite active as the Meity published its initial reaction to Twitter's blog post on Koo.In this backdrop, a Chinese investor on board can sully the image of the homegrown app. But that has been already taken care of as Koo has recently raised about ₹30 crore fund from a clutch of investors, including 3one4Capital, which is backed by former Infosys CFO Mohandas Pai.The new app saw a huge load in the past few days in what is being called as 'Koo coup'. "We have got more love than we expected. Our systems are facing more load than ever. Thank you for placing your trust in us. Our team is working on overdrive to fix it. We request your patience and support through this time," Aprameya tweeted.Koo was founded in March 2020 by Aprameya and Mayank Bidawatka. It was one of the winners of Aatmanirbhar App challenge 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/koos-chinese-investor-will-be-exiting-fully-says-app-cofounder-101613014367500.html
11-02-2021||India||On Twitter-India row, US says committed to supporting democratic values||A day after the government held a meeting Twitter officials over its request to block multiple handles that were spreading ‘misinformation’ about the farmers’ stir on the microblogging site, the United States on Wednesday said it is committed to backing democratic values across the world."What I would say generally, is that around the world, we are committed to supporting democratic values including freedom of expression. I think when it comes to Twitter's policies we would have to refer you to Twitter itself," US Department of State spokesperson Ned Price was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Also Read: In meeting with Twitter, ministry mentions Greta's toolkit, US Capitol violenceThe remarks come in the backdrop of the tussle between the government and Twitter over blocking of over 250 accounts. The government is believed to have handed over a list of 1,300 URLs (for accounts as well as posts) in its two orders following the violence in the national capital during the farmers’ tractor rally on Republic Day.On Wednesday, Twitter published a blog post explaining its move to not block some of the handles. The social media firm said, “...we do not believe that the actions we have been directed to take are consistent with Indian law,” adding, that keeping with their “principles of defending protected speech and freedom of expression” they have not taken any action on accounts that consist of news media entities, journalists, activists, and politicians. “To do so, we believe, would violate their fundamental right to free expression under Indian law,” the blog read.Soon after the blog was published, the ministry of information and technology took to domestic social media platform Koo, which is becoming popular by the day, to express its disappointment over the “unusual” blog as it came hours before the two partes were to meet over the issue.Later in the day, representatives of the ministry and Twitter’s global policy and safety teams met where the Meity “secretary expressed his deep disappointment” about Twitter’s response. “In India, its Constitution and laws are supreme. It is expected that responsible entities not only reaffirm but remain committed to compliance to the law of land,” the ministry said in a statement after the meeting.Twitter said that it was seeking legal option. “We will continue to advocate for the right of free expression on behalf of the people we serve. We are exploring options under Indian law — both for Twitter and for the accounts that have been impacted,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-twitter-govt-row-in-india-us-says-committed-to-supporting-democratic-values-101613014092866.html

Farm union leaders, under the umbrella body Samuykta Kisan Morcha (SKM), said that they were still protesting the central leadership failed to offer any alternative to the three farm laws enacted in September last year.Follow latest updates farmers protest hereThe two sides have held 11 meetings so far to end the impasse over the legislation but the talks have remained largely inconclusive as the protesting farmers are bent on their demand of a complete rollback of the three contentious laws and legal guarantee for Minimum Support Price (MSP) while the government has ruled out the repeal of laws but has offered to make amendments.Here’s a look at the latest on farm stir*Farmers have decided to intensify their demonstration against the agricultural laws and have called for a “rail roko” programme on February 18. On February 14, SKM will also hold a candle march as a tribute to the soldiers who lost their lives in the Pulwama attack in 2019. “Rail stop programs will be held on February 18... across the country,” farmer leader Darshan Pal said.*In a video message cited by news agency PTI, SKM leader Darshan Pal claimed it is "absolutely clear" that the new legislation will do away with government mandis (wholesale markets) and farmers will be left at the mercy of private mandis where big corporates will sell and buy will have monopoly.*Following PM Modi’s remark in the Rajya Sabha that a new breed of people has emerged in the country who cannot live without an agitation, Pal said, the Prime Minister termed those protesting against the farm laws as 'andolanjivis'. "The truth is that we are struggling on genuine issues of farmers for the past six months and have not raised any issue or demand beyond it," he was quoted as saying.*As the farmers’ continue to camp at Delhi borders, key routes have remained closed for nearly two and a half months leading to traffic disruption in the national capital.

11-02-2021||India||In meeting with Twitter, ministry mentions Greta's toolkit, US Capitol violence||After Twitter on Wednesday issued a blog clarifying why it did not take action against certain handles, prompting the ministry's reaction of "strong displeasure", both sides communicated through a virtual meeting in which the ministry of electronics and IT referred to the toolkit that was shared by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. The secretary of the ministry also referred to Twitter's action in the wake of US Capitol violence and said in comparison with that, the microblogging platform's action after Republic Day violence was inadequate.> Monique Meche, vice president, Global Public Policy, Jim Baker, deputy general counsel and vice president (legal) represented Twitter at the meeting. Mahima Kaul who was Twitter's India public policy director resigned a few days ago. The Twitter delegation met the secretary of the ministry Ajay Sawhney virtually.> The meeting was sought by Twitter after the ministry warned of penal action against Twitter for not dragging its feet to act against Twitter handles which the ministry said were using hashtags related to "farmer genocide".> Twitter in its blog post said it took action against over 500 accounts in India after being persuaded by the ministry. But it did not take action against handles of political entities, journalists, politicians and activists because that would violate 'freedom of speech', Twitter said.> IT secretary told Twitter representatives that India has a robust mechanism for protection of freedom of speech and expression. But freedom of expression is not absolute and it is subject to reasonable restrictions as mentioned in Article 19 (2) of the Constitution of India. "Various judgments of the Supreme Court have also upheld this from time to time," the ministry said in its statement issued late on Wednesday.> The secretary also told Twitter that it is free to formulate its own rules in India, as any other business entity does, but Indian laws which are enacted by Parliament must be followed irrespective of Twitter’s own rules.> The hashtag of 'farmer genocide' was an incendiary and baseless hashtag, the secretary said and made it clear that the ministry was not pleased with Twitter's "unfortunate" decision of not removing content pertaining to 'farmer genocide' from its platform.> Twitter's action after Capitol Hill violence in the US was more stringent than what it did after Republic Day violence. The ministry expressed its disappointment over this differential treatment.> Twitter was told that it was not siding with 'freedom of expression' but was encouraging those who seek to abuse the freedom to provoke disturbance to public order.> The toolkit shared by Greta Thunberg was also mentioned to Twitter. The ministry told Twitter that the toolkit proved that a strong social media campaign was being planned outside India and Twitter was one of its platforms for mobilisation. It was unacceptable, the ministry said.> The ministry also questioned how Twitter officially allows fake, unverified, anonymous and automated bot accounts to be operated on its platform.Twitter leadership affirmed their commitment towards following Indian laws and rules. They also expressed their continuing commitment towards building their services in India. They have also requested for better engagement between Government of India and Twitter’s global team.The toolkit is being investigated by the Delhi Police as it said a copycat execution of the plan mentioned in the toolkit took place in Delhi at farmers' protest. A toolkit is a social media document which explains an issue and action plans. Greta Thunberg tweeted it while she extended her support to the ongoing farmers' protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-meeting-with-twitter-ministry-mentions-greta-s-toolkit-us-capitol-violence-101613008794798.html

11-02-2021||India||No change in policy on Jammu and Kashmir, says US||The United States on Wednesday said that there is no change in its policy on Jammu and Kashmir."I want to be very clear there has been no change in US policy in the region," State Department Spokesperson Ned Price told reporters in view of a tweet from the South and Central Asia Bureau of the State Department which welcomed the resumption of 4G mobile internet in Jammu and Kashmir."We welcome the resumption of 4G mobile internet in India's Jammu & Kashmir. This marks an important step for local residents and we look forward to continued political & economic progress to restore normalcy in J&K,” tweeted the South and Central Asia Bureau of the State Department.High-speed mobile internet was restored on February 5 in the entire union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, exactly one and a half years after it was snapped in August 2019 when the Centre had abrogated the special status of the erstwhile state.According to a 2019 Congressional Research Service report of August 2019, a longstanding goal of US policy in South Asia has been to prevent India-Pakistan conflict from escalating to interstate war. This meant the United States has sought to avoid actions that overtly favoured either party. Over the past decade, however, Washington has grown closer to India while relations with Pakistan continue to be viewed as clouded by mistrust, CRS report said.On a question related to Twitter shutting down some accounts in India, Price said, "Well, I think what I would say generally is that around the world – and this goes back to what I was saying before – we are committed to supporting democratic values, including freedom of expression. I think when it comes to Twitter's policies, we'd have to refer you to Twitter itself."Responding to a similar question, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at her daily news conference, "Of course, we always have concerns about crackdowns on freedom of speech, freedom of expression happening around the world and when it doesn't allow people to communicate and peacefully protest."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-change-in-policy-on-jammu-and-kashmir-says-us-101613007056844.html
11-02-2021||India||Farmers still agitating because Modi govt has failed to give 'alternative': SKM||Farmers are still agitating because ministers of the Modi government have failed to present any "alternative" to the three new agri laws, the Samuykta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of 41 farmer unions, said on Wednesday.The SKM is leading the protest against the three central farm laws at several border points of Delhi.On Prime Minister Narendra Modi's address in Lok Sabha, SKM leader Darshan Pal said that union leaders have only been raising the "genuine" issues of the farmers."The agitation has been continuing because the ministers of the Modi government have not been able to come up with any solid alternative to the new laws or the MSP (minimum support price), despite 11 rounds of talks," Pal said in a video message.It is "absolutely clear" that the new laws will finish government mandis (wholesale markets) and private mandis where big corporates will sell and buy will have monopoly, he claimed."What is the problem and your (prime minister's) objection if both the mandis remain," Pal said referring to one of the new farm laws of the Centre.He said that the prime minister termed those protesting against the farm laws as 'andolanjivis' (professional protesters), and that they raised different issues and "misguided" the farmers."The truth is thate we are struggling on genuine issues of farmers for the past six months and have not raised any issue or demand beyond it," said the SKM leader.Pal said that the farmers and people of the country should not be taken in by the prime minister's speech in Lok Sabha and continue to strengthen the agitation against farm laws."I want to say to the farmers and the people to understand what Modi said in Parliament and not be taken in by his statements about the leaders of the farmers agitation," he said.Prime Minister Modi said in the Lok Sabha that the government and Parliament have great respect for farmers who are voicing their views on the three farm bills, and made it clear that those who want to continue with the old agriculture marketing system can continue doing so.Replying in Lok Sabha to the discussion on the motion of thanks to the President's address to the joint sitting of Parliament, Modi staunchly defended the three contentious farms laws and attacked the opposition for "misleading" farmers.Seeking to allay apprehensions on the farm laws, Modi said neither any agriculture 'mandi' (market) has shut down after the three laws were enacted nor has the MSP stopped, rather the MSP has only increased which no one can deny.The prime minister also said the government has offered to discuss clause by clause of the three farm laws and if there are any shortcomings it was ready to make changes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-still-agitating-because-modi-govt-has-failed-to-give-alternative-skm-101613005229865.html

11-02-2021||India||SC lets off rape accused after he agrees to marry complainant in 6 months||A man from Punjab on Wednesday earned freedom from the Supreme Court on condition that he would marry the woman, the complainant in a case against him , within six months. If he breaks his promise to marry the woman, who is now in Australia, he would be sent to jail, the top court warned.“Remember, we will send you to jail if we find that your proposal to marry her is just a ploy to get rid of the criminal case against you,” an SC bench, headed by CJI SA Bobde, told the lawyer who represented the man while staying his arrest.The bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, recorded the lawyer’s statement that the man’s parents had also signed an agreement promising to get their son married to the woman, and pack him off to Australia.In this case, the man faced charges of rape and cheating on a complaint by the woman. She alleged that he had a relationship with her on the pretext of marriage. The man and the woman met each other in Australia in 2016 where both were studying. While the woman belonged to a scheduled caste, the man was a Jat Sikh, an upper caste. According to the FIR lodged by the woman in Amritsar, the man convinced her to enter a relationship with him, promising that he would persuade his parents to agree to their marriage . In 2018, the man returned to Amritsar. The woman used to travel to India to meet him and their relationship continued until July 2019 when the man told her that his parents were against their marriage.This prompted the woman to file a complaint with the NRI Wing of Punjab Police, which conducted a preliminary investigation and finally lodged an FIR invoking charges of rape and cheating under the IPC.Claiming the relationship was consensual, the man sought protection from arrest but the Punjab and Haryana high court denied him relief, taking note of serious allegations by the complainant that he had threatened her he would publish photographs of her on social media if she did not withdraw the FIR.On Wednesday, advocate Shakti Paul Sharma, appearing for the man, presented before the bench a compromise deed, which stated that the two would be married within six months and that the man would travel to Australia to live with the complainant.The bench initially said it would grant bail only after he marries the woman. The lawyer, however, cited restrictions on flights from Australia to India due to Covid-19. The court then stayed the arrest of the man and also made the woman a party to the matter. The case will be heard next after four weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-lets-off-rape-accused-after-he-agrees-to-marry-complainant-in-6-months-101613005573547.html
11-02-2021||India||In Lok Sabha, Opposition targets govt for ‘tepid budget’||Initiating the discussion on the Budget for fiscal 2021-22, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Wednesday attacked finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman for slashing key allocations, calling it a tepid budget that ignored the interests of the middle class.“The government has come out with a budget which deceives people with respect to the allocation in defence and health sectors. Lal Bahadur Shastri had said ‘Jai Jawan Jai Kisan’. The contribution of this budget is ‘Na Jawan na Kisan’,” Tharoor said.He said the “tepid budget ignored the middle class in their hour of need”. “You’ve given them an increase in fuel prices...Soon, banks will have to provide fuel loans,” he said.Quoting poet Rabindranath Tagore, Tharoor said: “You cannot cross the sea by merely staring at the water.” He added that the budget had abdicated the government’s responsibility to the “weakest in our economy” and “fundamental expectations” of the nation.On February 1, Sitharaman presented her third budget, boosting capital expenditure in an attempt to nurse the pandemic-ravaged economy back to health.The minister said the budget was founded on improvements to health and wellness, physical and financial capital and infrastructure, and inclusive development of aspiring India.Tharoor said: “Bharat should be atmanirbhar (self-reliant), not bharatwaasis (Indians)”, adding that the government had left the common people to their own devices. “That is not the atmanirbharta we need.”Responding to the MP from the principal Opposition party, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Meenakshi Lekhi said India had once been languishing in the “fragile five” club and is now among the “top five economies of the world”. India was counted among the “ fragile five” in 2013 by Morgan Stanley, which coined the term to describe emerging economies that relied too much on foreign investment for growth. Lekhi said: “When we are called the underdogs, we win the match. That’s what the budget has done.”Trinamool Congress’s Saugata Roy said the budget had done nothing for the common man and the need was to put “ money into the hands of the people”.DMK’s Dayanidhi Maran said the budget should have offered some income tax breaks. “People have lost jobs, they are sitting at home. The budget should have given some income tax relief during this time of crisis.”In a written reply to the Lok Sabha earlier, minister of state for commerce and industry Som Parkash said, “There is no proposal to bring in changes to FDI rules for e-commerce sector in India, at present.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-lok-sabha-opposition-targets-govt-for-tepid-budget-101613005324265.html
11-02-2021||India||‘Give me a finger of my son...’: Emotions run high as rescuers toil to reach trapped tunnel workers||With flood waters receding slowly and the height of the slush in NTPC Limited’s tunnel in Tapovan shrinking, rescuers said on Wednesday they were making steady progress in reaching the 37 men trapped in the tunnel. For families of people believed to be buried in a barrage nearby, hope was dimming.As the rescue operation mounted after Sunday’s flash flood in the town in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district entered the fourth day, several families gave up hope of reuniting with their missing kin and instead pleaded with rescuers to retrieve at least the bodies. The disaster has left at least 34 people dead, and the number of missing was 170 as of Wednesday night.“Give me even a finger of my son and I’ll return to my village to cremate him,” a tearful Ram Daman Singh, father of welder Vijay Singh, feared to be buried in the barrage, begged army officers on Wednesday afternoon.Like Vijay Singh, dozens of workers at NTPC’s hydroelectric project are believed to be buried several metres under debris in the barrage close to the entrance of a tunnel where multiple agencies have been working round-the-clock for over 72 hours.Difficult to retrieve bodiesOn Tuesday, a rescue team used ropes to wade into the slush, but soon abandoned the effort.Benudhar Nayak, commandant of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police’s First Batallion, who is overseeing the operations along with teams of the National Disaster Response Force and the Army, said there was no chance of recovering bodies from the barrage for the time being.“The slush in the barrage is over 20 metres deep since the plant’s construction work was ongoing... The rescuers will themselves sink. Even if they do enter the slush, they won’t be able to recover bodies,” he said.The officer said that while the rescuers have spared no efforts to retrieve bodies, they’ll now have to wait for an “opportune time” to resume the effort. “Maybe when the slush hardens, we will attempt again.”But when the slush hardens, the retrieval could be more difficult, said NTPC workers who survived the tragedy.“There was tons and tons of cement in the barrage. The flood brought it all down. Now, the slush is mixed with cement and it is getting watered aswell. When it all dries up, the bodies will be amidst concrete, and not slush,” said Devendra Lal Khanila, a junior electrician and leader of the workers’ union.While about four dozen workers were inside the network of tunnels when the flood hit Sunday, many more were in the barrage area. This barrage is also a point where workers washed away from another hydroelectric plant a few kilometres up the river are believed to be stuckTunnel work slow but steadyWith retrieval of bodies from the barrage unlikely for now, rescuers focused on making inroads into the tunnel. Until Tuesday evening, Nayak said, rescuers had cleared slush up to 110 metres into the 240-metre-long subsidiary tunnel. One batch of workers are believed to be trapped at a distance of around 100 metres from the point where the subsidiary tunnel meets the main tunnel.On Wednesday, Nayak said, much of the work was undone with slush from inside the tunnel occupying the cleared area. “But now there is less water in the tunnel than before. So the ground is getting a bit harder, easing our operation...We hope that people inside are still alive,” said Nayak.Ganga Singh, an ITBP constable, said another positive aspect was that the height of the slush has shrunk. “There are more air pockets inside the tunnel and more space to work now. Through the night, we worked with two earth movers inside, unlike earlier when only one would go in,” said Singh.On Tuesday, rescuers made an abortive attempt to use camera-fitted dronesto locate those trapped inside.“The conditions inside are very hostile for survival, but we usually stay hopeful for six days even in these circumstances,” an army lieutenant colonel, requesting not to be named, said about the chances of survival of the trapped men.Families losing hopeWhile families of those trapped in the tunnel understood that the rescue attempt was time-consuming and waited in accommodation provided by the local government, kin of workers believed to be buried in the barrage landed up at the site in large numbers on Wednesday. A helpdesk set up here on Tuesday evening to address their concerns wasn’t enough to keep them patient.“My brother Jitendra Kumar was outside the tunnel when the flood hit. He made a video call to me at 10.25am. When he called again at 10.34am, I failed to take his call. My family has been constantly asking me if he is alive. How do I tell them that I may have to return without even his body. The officials here have ...asked me to return home, saying that it could take two-four months to find his body,” said Pawan Kumar, a man who arrived here from Doda in Jammu and Kashmir.Others sounded more desperate. Mrityunjay Kumar from Patna said his brother, assistant engineer Manish Kumar, was married just two months ago. “Please deploy the army, the navy, anyone. At least give me my brother’s body,” he said in tears.The kin of missing workers held a protest in Raini village on Wednesday accusing the authorities of not carrying out the rescue operations properly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rescuers-toil-to-reach-trapped-men-hope-dims-for-kin-101613004827518.html
11-02-2021||India||One accused killed in encounter in Kasganj||One of the suspects in the killing of a police constable on Tuesday evening was shot dead in an encounter with the police in Kasganj district of Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday, the police said. The encounter took place hours after a two-member police team that went to Nagla Dhimar village to serve a warrant on an alleged liquor mafia kingpin was attacked — a constable beaten to death and a sub-inspector seriously injured.The man killed in the encounter was identified as Elkar Singh, the brother of the suspected kingpin, Moti Singh Dhimar, according to the police.“Elkar Singh was shot dead in a police encounter on Wednesday morning at Nagla Dhimar village under Sidhpura police station of Kasganj district. The main accused, Moti Singh Dhimar, and a few others are absconding, and a search operation is being conducted,” said Kasganj superintendent of police (SP) Manoj Sonkar.“Elkar Singh had a criminal past, and four cases were registered against him at Sidhpura police station in Kasganj. Similarly, 11 cases were registered against his brother, Moti Singh Dhimar, the main accused,” Sonkar added.The constable killed by the suspected gangsters was identified as Devendra Jasawat and the injured sub-inspector as Ashok Pal. “The sub-inspector and the constable were taken hostage by the mafia before the brutal attack. The accused took away the service revolver of the sub-inspector. About half-a-dozen goons were believed to have attacked the policemen with sharp weapons,” the Kasganj SP said.The constable’s body was found in a field after a search on Tuesday night. The injured sub- inspector was found in another place with his uniform torn and service revolver missing. He was referred to an Aligarh hospital because he had serious injuries.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has ordered stringent action against the suspects, including the invocation of the National Security Act. “The state government has zero tolerance for crime and criminals. Strict action {should} be taken against those guilty without any compromise on the law-and-order situation in the state,” the chief minister said in a statement released after the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-accused-killed-in-encounter-in-kasganj-101613004689236.html
11-02-2021||India||Farm groups to hold ‘rail roko’ on February 18||The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) — an umbrella body of around 40 farmer groups — on Wednesday announced a nationwide “rail roko” programme on February 18 as it decided to scale up its agitation against three contentious farm laws at a meeting of its senior representatives.SKM also said it will hold a candle march and other programmes on February 14 to remember the 40 troopers who were killed in the 2019 Pulwama terror attack; and on February 16, observe the birth anniversary of Sir Chhotu Ram, a prominent pre-Independence Jat leader.“Rail stop programmes will be held on February 18 from 12- 4pm across the country. From February 12, all road toll plazas in Rajasthan will be made toll free,” farmer leader Darshan Pal said in an SKM statement that gave details about their plans.The decisions came on a day when Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in Lok Sabha that the government has “great respect” for farmers, and attacked the Opposition for “misleading” them on three laws that aim to liberalise the farm sector. Modi, while backing the laws, also reiterated the government’s stand to discuss them clause by clause and make changes, if needed.“I want to ask all the farmers whether the new law has taken away any right, any system from them. I can understand the Opposition protest if these laws were compulsory. But the new laws are not compulsory for anyone. This is optional and farmers should go where they get more profit. So, there is no reason to protest,” Modi said in the Lower House.Reacting to PM’s speech, Darshan Pal, said: “PM said he respects farmers which is why ministers have been appointed for talks with farmers. But the truth is that despite 11 rounds of talks, no substantial changes were offered in the laws. He said that farmers are being misled but we have been fighting for issues of farmers and not any other matter. We urge PM to understand our issues.”On Wednesday, over 40 artists from Punjab performed at the protest sites on the Singhu and Tikri borders, where tens of thousand of farmers have been camped since November 26.Though the sentiment at the protest sites has largely been against Deep Sidhu, an actor-turned-activist who was arrested as one of the alleged perpetrators of the violence at Red Fort on January 26, when a tractor rally organised by the farm unions descended into chaos, a small group of young farmers in Singhu also put up posters in support of Sidhu and asked that the cases against him be withdrawn.Regarding the posters, an SKM member said they were not associated with the banners. “As far as disagreements with the leadership is concerned [on Deep Sidhu and Lakha Sidhana], people can have their own opinions and they have a right to register dissent.” Sidhu was arrested by Delhi Police on February 9.Farmer leader Rakesh Tikait, a spokesperson for Bharatiya Kisan Union (Tikait), on Wednesday stressed on the need for unity among farmer groups. “We are united in our struggle against the farm laws and the government should not be under any illusion [of a rift].”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-groups-to-hold-rail-roko-on-feb-18-101613004499989.html
11-02-2021||India||Laws not binding on farmers, says PM; repeats offer for talks||Prime Minister Narendra Modi stressed on Wednesday that the new farm laws passed in September were optional and not binding on farmers, who, he said, can still sell their produce wherever they earn more profits and not necessarily to corporate entities.The PM invited protesting farmers to resume a dialogue, saying changes could be introduced in the legislation if any problems indeed existed, even as he supported the agricultural reforms and told the Lok Sabha: “As long as our small farmers don’t get empowered, full freedom will not be achieved.”Thousands of farmers have massed on the borders of Delhi since November 26 to press their demand for a repeal of the three laws that ease restrictions in farm trade, allow traders to stockpile large quantities of food, and lay down a national framework for contract farming.The farmers say the laws will erode their bargaining power, leave them at the mercy of big corporations and could lead to the dismantling of government-run agricultural markets, called mandis, and a system of MSPs for agricultural produce.“After the enactment of the new laws, neither the mandis have closed nor MSP has stopped, but more crops have been bought under MSP,” Modi said in his reply to the motion of thanks on the President’s speech to Parliament.He also lashed out at “andolanjeevi” (people who live off protests) for “maligning the sanctity” of the farmers’ protests and maintained that the long-pending agricultural reforms will usher in new opportunities, investments and help open up new markets for farmers.“I want to ask all the farmers whether the new law has taken away any right, any system from them? I can understand the Opposition protest if these laws were compulsory. But the new laws are not compulsory for anyone. This is optional and farmers should go where they get more profit. So, there is no reason to protest,” Modi told lawmakers as Congress MPs staged a walkout.Congress MPs including their floor leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury repeatedly tried to counter the PM during the speech as former party president Rahul Gandhi stood quietly. This is the second time Modi spoke at length about the farm bills after his reply in the Rajya Sabha on Monday in which he emphatically said, “MSP was there, MSP is there and it will be there.”In the Lok Sabha, the Prime Minister argued about the need for farm reforms. He maintained that the nation’s annadatas (food gviers) must prosper and not depend on government aid. Modi said agricultural reforms were “important and required” and the government will “continue to try to tackle the challenges in the farm sector”.“The changes are required for small and marginal farmers. We are unable to invest as per requirement. When investments will increase, employment will increase, new opportunities will come. No one wants our farmers to be stuck in poverty. As long as our small farmers don’t get empowered, full freedom will not be achieved.”Hitting back at Congress leaders who said the farmers hadn’t asked for the laws, Modi said status quo will ruin the nation and listed examples of social reformers Raja Ram Mohan Roy and Ishwar ChandraVidyasagar and his own government’s record to defend proactive measures.“This country made a law against dowry even as no one asked for it. No one wanted a law against triple talaq but we did it. no one had asked for laws against child marriage or to give property rights to daughters, but these laws were made as they are needed for a progressive society,” the PM said.“People didn’t ask for Ayushman Bharat or Swachh Bharat,” he said referring to the government’s health insurance scheme and cleanliness mission. “If farmers don’t want new system, they can stick to the old system.”Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has alleged that the government had created monopolies in several sectors and the farm laws will help only a handful of industrialists close to the PM.Modi didn’t mention Gandhi’s name, but countered the allegation. “We believe in progressive politics and not regressive politics. If the country needs a public sector, then private sector too, is important. We must trust our young people. And it is not correct to slam every entrepreneur. Will the IAS officers run everything,” the PM said, referring to the government’s decision to sell stakes in Air India and other public enterprises.Modi referred to mythological characters such as Raja Janak to underline how even the kings had been involved in agriculture. But while he said that he “respects” farmers’ sentiments, he lashed out at people whom he has termed andolanjeevis. “...What is the relation of these demands to farm protests? Real protestors don’t do like this. This is how an andolanjeevi acts. This is a matter of concern for all who believe in democracy.”Modi also narrated a story of an official who held a post of supplying cigars to late British PM Sir Winston Churchill and wanted a salary hike many years after Independence to underline how old systems often lose relevance and need changes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/laws-not-binding-on-farmers-says-pm-repeats-offer-for-talks-101613004275080.html
11-02-2021||India||28 people, a majority of them Christians, booked in a month||Chhatar Singh Katre, a teacher in a small village school run by the government in Madhya Pradesh’s Balaghat district organized a get-together and a prayer meet on January 27. The occasion, his daughter said, was to celebrate her college admission.Before the programme started on January 27, the police reached the spot, and detained Katre, and his friends Mahendra Nagdeva J Nathan; all three were taken to the police station for interrogation, and subsequently arrested for luring and coercing people for conversion.All three remain in jail, their bail please having been rejected by the Balaghat sessions court.Katre’s daughter Kalyani Katre said, “My father organized the meet for me and now he is in jail for no reason. The case was registered against him and two others on the complaint of a person who was booked 10 years ago for assaulting and harassing my father and others for participating in a religious programme.”Raghunath Khatarkar who is investigating the case at Lalbarra police station of Balaghat district, said the complainant Hemant Thakre recorded his statement before the court and accused Katre and two others of offering him ₹10,000 for conversion. “In the name of God, they also tried to scare people that something bad would happen to them.”In a month since the enactment of the Madhya Pradesh Freedom of Religion Ordinance to regulate interfaith marriages and conversion, 28 people have been booked and at least half of them are Christians, according to police records.The ordinance, which replaces the MP Freedom of Religion Act 1968, came into force on January 9. State home department data shows that eight cases have been registered in eight different districts in a month, and 28 people named. While four cases are against nine Muslims for allegedly forcing women to change their religion for marriage, another four were against 19 Christians for luring and coercing people to change their faith through prayer meetings, police reports showed.“Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan called it a Beti Bachao campaign of the state government. Out of total of eight cases, the complainants in five cases are women. The ordinance was introduced to regularize conversion and to stop illegal activities taking place in the name of conversion. Police are arresting people after preliminary investigation so no one should be worried about anything,” said Vishwas Sarang, cabinet spokesperson and minister of medical education department.With 67% of those booked being Christian, members of the community have accused the state government of targetting social workers. “Now, people are afraid of organising prayer meet because some anti-social elements are creating ruckus and making false accusations of conversion against our people,” said Jaistar Sarbhang, president of the Christian Welfare Foundation, Balaghat.Meanwhile, Muslim organisations said that the law was being used to renew old case of marital discord between inter-faith couples. Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, MP, president, Hazi Haroon said, “Police are renewing the old cases to target the members of Muslim community, especially of middle and lower middle class.” However, Hindu organisations said that the law has proved successful in halting illegal conversions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/28-people-a-majority-of-them-christians-booked-in-a-month-101613004085403.html

We welcome India’s emergence as a leading global power and its role as a net security provider in the region,” said US State Department spokesperson Ned Price during a press briefing on Tuesday.Meanwhile, the US also expressed concern at China’s attempts to “intimidate its neighbours” against the backdrop of the India-China border standoff. The US will stand with friends and partners to advance security and prosperity across the Indo-Pacific, Price said in response to a question on the Biden administration’s position on China’s efforts to encroach on India’s territory.Key members of the Biden administration, such as secretary of state Antony Blinken have identified China as one of the main concerns for the US while supporting the strong position taken against China by former president Donald Trump.However, they have signalled the new administration’s handling of the issue will not be as confrontational as the approach adopted by Trump.Price said the US is closely monitoring the India-China standoff.“We are concerned by Beijing’s pattern of ongoing attempts to intimidate its neighbours.

11-02-2021||India||Rabi sowing at an all-time high||After a bountiful kharif season because of a good monsoon, planting of rabi or winter-sown crops has expanded beyond the normal acreage, holding out hopes of a bumper harvest.According to data released by the farm ministry, sowing of rabi crops has crossed last year’s all-time-high area sown at over 65.2 million hectares so far. This is higher than the normal acreage of 62 million hectares for the season and 1.6% higher compared to area sown a year ago.Area sown under wheat, rapeseed, mustard and gram has reached an all-time high, surpassing records, data shows.Wheat has been sown on 33.7 million hectares, surpassing last rabi season’s all-time high of 33.6 million hectares. Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra have shown an expanded area under wheat, making up for less area under wheat in Punjab, Rajasthan, UP, Bihar and Gujarat.In Madhya Pradesh, the area under wheat has increased for three consecutive years, from 5.3 million hectares during 2017-18, to 6 million hectares during 2018-19 and 8 million hectares during 2019-20. This year, so far, the area cultivated under wheat in the state has increased further to 8.8 million hectares.The area under coarse cereals has however lagged 8.2%, including under major rabi cereals like jowar, maize and barley.The area cultivated under gram has surpassed last season’s all-time high area sown of 10.7 million hectares to stand at 10.9 million hectares because of higher plantings in Maharashtra and Gujarat. The area under rapeseed and mustard, the main winter oilseeds has increased by 6.7% to 7.3 million hectares. This is the highest ever area cultivated under rabi oilseeds. “Rajasthan so far has the largest area under rapeseed and mustard, accounting for 35-40% of the total area sown in India,” according to the Centre For Monitoring Indian Economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rabi-sowing-at-an-all-time-high-101613003757061.html
11-02-2021||India||Vista avenue project given heritage panel nod: Centre||The Centre has received clearance from the Heritage Conversation Committee (HCC) for the second phase of the Central Vista redevelopment project that involves restructuring of the Central Vista Avenue in New Delhi, the government informed Parliament on Wednesday.In January, the committee, headed by the additional secretary of the ministry of housing and urban affairs, approved the first phase of the redevelopment, the construction of the new parliament building.“Prior approval of the Heritage Conservation Committee is taken for every project of the Central Vista redevelopment, wherever applicable, before construction work commences. Clearance of Heritage Conservation Committee has been obtained on 11.01 2021 for construction of new parliament building and for Central Vista Avenue Projects on 02.02.2021. For other projects, it will be obtained, wherever necessary,” Union housing minister Hardeep Puri said in written reply to a question from Congress MP KC Venugopal in the Rajya Sabha.Puri added that the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) will be temporarily housed in the refurbished Janpath Hotel building and will finally be shifted to a new building to be built at the plot where Jamnagar House once stood.The “heritage building” that houses the “National Archives” will be retained, the minister added, and the National Museum move to “retro-fitted North and South Blocks.”In his question, Venugopal asked the housing minister “whether a detailed heritage audit was conducted prior to initiating the bidding process.”The Supreme Court earlier this year, dismissed a clutch of petitions against the redevelopment project while holding that the government and its agencies fulfilled all legal requirements in altering the land use of the seven plots in the area, and in obtaining the environmental clearances for constructing the new Parliament building.In a 2:1 majority verdict, the SC held that the government must seek a “formal written prior permission” of HCC before commencing development work on plot number 118 (where the new 60,000-sq ft Parliament building is expected to come up).The committee includes officials from the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), NDMC, Delhi Development Authority (DDA), Archeology Survey of India (ASI), Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), Delhi Urban Art Commission (DUAC), National Museum and experts from the Delhi University and the School of Planning and Architecture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vista-avenue-project-given-heritage-panel-nod-centre-101613002204169.html
11-02-2021||India||SC issues notice to Maharashtra officials over Avni killing||The Supreme Court on Wednesday issued contempt notices to top officials in the Maharashtra government for violating its order to declare no reward for killing the man-eater tigress Avni and to not celebrate the killing. The tigress was shot dead by a hunter during a late night operation in November 2018.Raising questions over the procedure followed in shooting down the tigress, a petition filed by wildlife enthusiast Sangeeta Dogra claimed that there is enough in the post-mortem report of the tigress to show that she was not a man-eater.Dogra further stated in her petition that on September 11, 2018, the Supreme Court while permitting Avni (T-1) to be put down, said: “The efforts to tranquilize and capture T-1 tigress will be continued and if unsuccessful, it shall be eliminated by shooting to avoid any further loss of human life. The Chief Conservator of Forests, Yavatmal is authorized to carry out the above order. He shall not declare any prize or any similar incentive for the responsible person.”Despite the clear instruction by the court, Dogra claimed in her contempt petition that within days of the killing, the villagers arranged a felicitation function on November 14, 2018 and presented a silver statue of the tigress along with a cash reward to the shooter involved in the killing.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde issued notice on the contempt petition to Principal Secretary, Maharashtra, Vikas Kharge, Principal Chief Conservator Forests (Nagpur), Deputy Conservator of Forests, Pandharkawada district, and Member Secretary, National Tiger Conservation Authority.“First we need to examine your plea that the dead tigress was not a man-eater. Second, they (contemnors) flouted our order that they shall not celebrate or reward anyone for killing the tigress. We will issue notice as our order is clearly violated,” said the bench, which also comprised justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.Dogra claimed that the post-mortem report did not indicate presence of nails, hair or teeth of human beings in the stomach. According to her, if the dead tigress was a man-eater, these would have been found because they remain in a predator’s stomach for around six months. The bench asked Dogra to submit proof to this effect and adjourned the matter after two weeks.The tigress is believed to have killed at least 13 villagers in Maharashtra’s Pandharkawda and Ralegoan regions of Yavatmal district for over one-and-a-half years. The six-year-old tigress was shot dead after a massive hunt and her two cubs, relocated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-issues-notice-to-maharashtra-officials-over-avni-killing-101613002004549.html
11-02-2021||India||Indian, Chinese armies begin pullback at LAC||Indian and Chinese troops have begun disengaging on the southern and northern banks of Pangong Tso, China’s defence ministry announced on Wednesday even as people familiar with the development in India said both sides were pulling back armoured elements from heights around the frozen lake.There was no official word from India’s defence ministry or foreign ministry on the development, which came against the backdrop of a nine-month military standoff in the Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) that has taken bilateral ties to an all-time low.Defence minister Rajnath Singh will make a statement on the development in Parliament on Thursday, in line with the convention that such key issues are first taken up in the House when it is in session.In a statement on the Chinese defence ministry’s website, spokesperson Senior Colonel Wu Qian said: “The Chinese and Indian frontline troops at the southern and northern bank of the Pangong Tso Lake start synchronised and organised disengagement from February 10.”He added: “This move is in accordance with the consensus reached by both sides at the 9th round of China-India Corps Commander Level Meeting.” The reference was to a meeting of military commanders held on the Chinese side of the Moldo-Chushul border meeting point on January 24.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said in a similar statement that troops from both sides had begun to “conduct simultaneous and planned disengagement” at Pangong lake in line with the consensus reached by the Chinese and Indian foreign ministers at a meeting in Moscow last September and the ninth round of commander-level talks.“We hope the Indian side will work with China to meet each other halfway, strictly implement the consensus reached between the two sides and ensure the smooth implementation of the disengagement process,” Wang added.Both statements gave no details of the disengagement process.Also Read | Pullback raises hope but India set to keep close eye on ChinaIn New Delhi, people familiar with the disengagement plan said on condition of anonymity that both sides have started pulling back armoured elements – tanks and infantry combat vehicles – from heights on the southern bank of Pangong lake.Troops are still holding positions on strategic heights, the people said. No withdrawal of troops has taken place in the Finger Area on the northern bank of the lake, the people added.One of the people cited above said the Indian side would proceed with extreme caution in view of China’s actions during the standoff, including attempts to unilaterally alter the status quo at Pangong lake last August.The Indian Army occupied a series of key heights to prevent the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) from grabbing territory on the southern bank of Pangong Tso in a stealthy midnight move on August 29, 2020. The Indian side’s control of ridgeline positions on the southern bank allows it to dominate the sector and keep an eye on Chinese military activity. These positions are scattered across Rezang and Reqin passes, Gurung Hill and Magar heights, while the PLA also holds some features on the southern bank.Last September, India rushed frontline tanks and armoured vehicles to the strategic heights held by its soldiers on the southern bank, in response to intimidating moves by the PLA.Following the ninth meeting of the military commanders, a joint statement said the two sides had “agreed to push for an early disengagement of the frontline troops”, and to hold the 10th round of the commander-level meeting “at an early date to jointly advance de-escalation”.LAC passes through Pangong lake, parts of which are controlled by Indian and Chinese troops. Both sides also patrol the waters of the lake in special boats.This is the second attempt to disengage frontline troops to resolve the standoff that began last May. Disengagement in Galwan valley took place in early July, but it didn’t progress in other areas. India has consistently pushed for comprehensive disengagement at all friction points and restoration of the status quo ante of early April 2020.The announcement of disengagement by the Chinese side was markedly different from the resolution of the military standoff at Doklam in 2017. At that time, both countries issued simultaneous statements on troop withdrawals.Former Northern Army commander, Lt Gen (retired) DS Hooda, said: “On the face of it, the disengagement is a positive step. I think we will have to wait for details of the process, whether it includes all military presence or only heavy equipment.”Vipin Narang, associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said: “Let’s see what happens. Any movement toward disengagement is good, but it has to be real and sustained, and verified not just in Pangong but eventually elsewhere as well. It can’t be China pretending to disengage and India pretending to believe it.”Qian Feng, of the National Strategy Institute at Beijing’s Tsinghua University, described China’s announcement as a positive move.“The agreement between the two sides to withdraw troops before the Chinese lunar calendar’s Spring Festival is good news, not only to avoid a continued decline of Sino-Indian relations but also to ease tensions along the border...and reduce the possibility of friction and conflict in the short term,” Qian said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-chinese-armies-begin-pullback-at-lac-101613001599181.html
11-02-2021||India||Evidence planted, says activist Rona Wilson after forensic firm’s analysis||Activist Rona Wilson, accused of fomenting violence in Bhima Koregaon in 2018, moved the Bombay high court on Wednesday seeking the quashing of criminal proceedings against him after an American digital forensics consulting company concluded that fabricated evidence was planted in the electronic evidence, including a laptop and thumb drive, which was seized from his residence in April 2018 and on the basis of which he was arrested two months later.Denying the claims of the report, National Investigation Agency (NIA) spokesperson Jaya Roy said: “The digital extracts which we have submitted in the court along with the chargesheet were examined at RFSL (Regional Forensic Science Laboratory, Pune), which shows no evidence of any malware in any laptop/device.”The petition, filed by Wilson’s lawyer Sudeep Pasbola, attached a copy of a digital forensic report from Arsenal Consulting, whose contents were first reported by the Washington Post. It also sought the constitution of a special investigation team to analyse the electronic evidence and compensation for wrongful detention.Arsenal Consulting, a Massachusetts-based digital forensics firm, surmised that Wilson’s computer was compromised by the same attacker for 22 months between 2016 and April 17, 2018, when electronic evidence was seized by the Pune Police on suspicion of his alleged links with the violence that erupted in Bhima Koregaon village in Maharashtra on January 1, 2018, during the bicentennial celebrations of a British-era war commemorated by Dalits.The firm found that malware had been installed in Wilson’s computer on June 13, 2016, after someone using the email account of Varavara Rao — who is one of the accused in this case — sent a phishing mail to Wilson. A NetWire remote access trojan (RAT) was installed on Wilson’s Hewlett Packard Pavilion notebook once he clicked on what he thought was a mere Dropbox link. This allowed the attacker to conduct surveillance and plant incriminating documents, its report stated.“The report of Arsenal Consulting is an attempt to tarnish the investigation and the evidence collected therein,” an official close to the investigation and who did not wish to be named said.The forensics report suggested the attackers deployed a commonly used strategy known as spear phishing. The attackers send an email that appears to be from a trustworthy source, convincing the target to click on attachments that deliver what is known as the exploit, or the piece of code that opens a backdoor and ultimately allows for malware to be installed.Analysing the forensic images obtained from the Toshiba hard drive inside Wilson’s computer as well as a SanDisk Cruzer Blade thumb drive that was attached to it, the report stated that the attacker copied documents into the thumb drive on March 14, 2018, and later created a warren of dummy folders containing dummy data “so that the victim would not stumble upon them”.These incriminating documents were delivered to Wilson’s computer by NetWire and no other means, the report stated.“The essential evidence in the case is electronic evidence. There is no mention of arms or ammunition. The Arsenal report examined 10 of the letters and found that they were planted. Wilson was not aware of these documents, nor did he open them. In our opinion, this punches a hole in the prosecution’s case,” said Mihir Desai, one of the lawyers in the Bhima Koregaon case.“The report of Arsenal Consulting is sufficient grounds for quashing of the FIR and chargesheet against Wilson and his co-accused,” a senior counsel who represented Wilson said.Other documents that Wilson reportedly authored were saved to a PDF format using either Microsoft Word 2010 or 2013, neither of which versions were installed in his computer, the report added. It also found that the same attacker had also launched a similar malware attack against other co-defendants of this case over a period of four years.“Arsenal has connected the same attacker to a significant malware infrastructure which has been deployed over the course of approximately four years to not only attack and compromise Mr Wilson’s computer for 22 months, but to attack his co-defendants in the Bhima Koregaon case and defendants in other high profile Indian cases as well,” the report stated.Wilson’s petition argued that in light of the Arsenal report, any prosecution against him or the other co-accused — there are 15 other prominent activists, academics and lawyers, among others — would be a “travesty of justice”.“In view of this, any further prolonging of the case against the petitioner and the co-accused will be an absolute and continued travesty of justice, apart from sanctifying the abuse of process of law and will lead to further violation of the petitioners and co-accused fundamental rights,” the petition read.Investigating officials said that videos were taken of all the evidence seized by the Pune Police from Wilson’s residence, which included hard disk, CDs, laptop, mobile phones, memory cards, etc. These were enumerated in a seizure memo following due procedure following which a strict “chain of custody” was maintained. The evidence was sent to Regional FSL Pune for further examination. The report did not indicate any instance of tampering with the digital devices.Forensic images of digital devices along with final reports are provided to accused persons as mandated by the Code of Criminal Procedure.Arsenal used tools to decrypt and parse NetWire logs and Quickheal database fragments. The report claimed that the firm was able to reconstruct the events of how Wilson’s computer was compromised, which also included synchronising files between Wilson’s computer and another server.NetWire logs are files that contain keystrokes and other information such as browsing history, saved passwords, composed emails and editing documents.The hack was technically not sophisticated and appears to be inspired by Soviet-era espionage, cyber security experts said.“Going by Arsenal Consulting’s findings, the technical methods of compromise seem crude. However, the overall mechanism is strangely reminiscent of the methods used by unrelenting and aggressive Russian intelligence agencies. They are known to place kompromat (compromising material like child pornography) inside the computers of unwitting activists, dissenters and opponents,” said Pukhraj Singh, a cyber threat intelligence analyst.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/evidence-planted-says-activist-rona-wilson-after-forensic-firm-s-analysis-101613001233930.html
11-02-2021||India||Tussle intensifies: Twitter, govt at odds over blocking||Twitter on Wednesday said that it complied partially with the government’s requests to block access to accounts, but let others — particularly those by journalists, activists and politics — remain since the directions were “not consistent with Indian law”, prompting the government to express “disappointment” during a meeting with top executives of the social media company later in the day.Twitter’s blog, which gave details of its actions, said: “...we do not believe that the actions we have been directed to take are consistent with Indian law.” And, it added, “in keeping with our principles of defending protected speech and freedom of expression, we have not taken any action on accounts that consist of news media entities, journalists, activists, and politicians. To do so, we believe, would violate their fundamental right to free expression under Indian law.”The statement, released on Wednesday morning, prompted an initial response from the ministry of electronics and information technology (Meity) — significantly, on Koo, a home-made social media website meant to rival Twitter — and appeared to signal an escalation of a confrontation brewing for over a week.Throughout the day, several government officials expressed dismay with Twitter’s actions, echoing remarks from last week when the government said the company was not in a position to judge its directions and had to follow them.Representatives from the ministry and Twitter’s global policy and safety teams met later, where the Meity “secretary expressed his deep disappointment” about Twitter’s response. “He took this opportunity to remind Twitter that in India, its Constitution and laws are supreme. It is expected that responsible entities not only reaffirm but remain committed to compliance to the law of land,” Meity said in a statement after the meeting in the evening.A government official, who asked not to be named, said Twitter cannot pick and choose which accounts to block. A second official, who asked not to be named, however, was more reconciliatory, saying that the company appeared to have “taken down 95% of the accounts and posts” the government flagged.HT reviewed Twitter’s disclosures to the Lumen database — a nonprofit repository meant to track online censorship — on the Indian government’s requests and found that the company had removed 702 URLs in all. These included posts as well as accounts.The government is believed to have handed over a list of 1,300 URLs (for accounts as well as posts) in its two orders.The first government official quoted above said: “We respect freedom of expression, but it comes with reasonable restrictions. Hesitatingly taking action or begrudgingly taking down accounts is unacceptable.” The government, this person said, was seeking legal options while exercising restraint.On its part, Twitter too said that it was seeking legal option. “We will continue to advocate for the right of free expression on behalf of the people we serve. We are exploring options under Indian law — both for Twitter and for the accounts that have been impacted,” it said.The confrontation between the two sides started in the aftermath of the January 26 violence in the Capital during the farmers’ protests. The government first ordered Twitter to block 257 accounts citing emergency powers under section 69A of the IT Act, targeting accounts that it said were inciting violence during the protests.On Wednesday, it elaborated further on why it defied the government orders and only partially restricted accounts: “Out of these (orders), two were emergency blocking orders that we temporarily complied with but subsequently restored access to the content in a manner that we believe was consistent with Indian law,” it said.Legal experts say that at the heart of this dispute could be the nature of section 69A, which is opaque. “Under section 69A, and particularly rule 16, a company is under obligation of confidentiality, so we don’t actually know what reasons were cited by the government in its orders. It is not untenable for a private company to refuse to comply with directions under this section if it believes the direction is not consistent with law,” said Amber Sinha, technology lawyer and executive director of Centre for Internet and Society.Sinha added that the government has broad powers under Section 69A, and there is a lack of clarity around the functioning of a Review Committee that is meant to evaluate the proportionality of emergency orders issued by invoking this section.While the action has been partial, the company has still taken down hundreds of accounts, its blog post said.The company said it took three steps to partially address the government’s directions: it reduced the visibility of certain hashtags “containing harmful content”, took enforcement action – “including permanent suspension” against over 500 accounts, and blocked from access in India several of the others identified by the government.A Twitter spokesperson said the company had no further comment when asked to share details of what hashtags it acted against, which accounts it blocked on its own for misuse of its rules, and which accounts had been withheld in India.Internet freedom activists said Twitter has typically pushed back strongly against governments in refusing to censor content, at times even defying laws in the United States, where the company is based. “There are a couple areas where they are much less restrictive than others, for example, when it comes to so-called terrorist content like the Hezbollah that US considers a terror group, and nudity and sex work. These are areas where they are not as restricting and these particular examples are interesting because they are pushing up against US law,” said Jillian C York, director for International Freedom of Expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, in an interview to HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tussle-intensifies-twitter-govt-at-odds-over-blocking-101613000979987.html
11-02-2021||India||Choice for government: Fuel tax cut or inflation?||Revenue receipts from Union excise duties have proved to be the silver lining in the 2021-22 Budget, as far as central taxes are concerned. Not only does the government hope to collect, as per Revised Estimates (RE), more than what its Budget Estimates (BE) projected in 2020-21, the 2021-22 (BE) numbers project union excise duties to be the only tax head where 2021-22 (BE) numbers are greater than 2020-21 (BE) numbers. To be sure, 2021-22 (BE) collections are expected to be lower than 2020-21 (RE) collections on this head. Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Wednesday ruled out any cut in excise duty. His remark came on a day the price of petrol rose to an all-time high of .87.60 a litre in Delhi. The diesel rate rose to .77.73 per litre in the city.1. Rising fuel tax rates contributing to higher excise duty collectionAfter most indirect taxes were subsumed into the Goods and Services Tax (GST) post 2017, the bulk of union excise duties are receipts from taxes on petroleum products, primarily petrol and diesel. In 2021-22, the reason for a sharp jump in union excise duty collections is not a spike in consumption of petrol-diesel but an increase in tax rates. As oil prices fell, the government chose to keep retail prices of fuel roughly constant, and enhanced excise duties – a move that shored up revenue receipts.However, the use of these duties on petrol and diesel to boost revenue receipts might come at the cost of higher inflation in the economy as oil prices strengthen, provided the government does not cut excise levies. But doing so may hit revenue receipts. Here are four charts which explain this trade-off.2. Tax component of petrol-diesel prices has been increasing in the post-Covid-19 periodThe petroleum ministry provides disaggregated data on the various components of the price of petrol and diesel in the country. This shows that the tax component of both petrol and diesel prices increased significantly in the post-Covid-19 period. Government taxes accounted for.37.8 and .28 per litre in petrol and diesel prices on April 1, 2020 (a few days after India declared a lockdown to slow the pandemic). This has increased to .52.9 and .43.1 by February 1, 2021.The 2021-22 Budget has not reduced duties on petrol and diesel. What it has done instead is shift the special excise duty to the newly created head of agriculture, infrastructure and development cess; .2.5 per litre on petrol and .4 per litre on diesel will now go to this. There is no change in retail prices.3. International oil prices have been rising gradually, adding to the petroleum price rallyInternational crude prices fell sharply after the pandemic, as economic activity and fuel consumption plummeted with lockdowns and travel restrictions across the globe. Oil prices have started regaining momentum with vaccine roll-outs across the world. Price of India’s crude oil basket has increased by 26% to $54.79 per barrel between November 2020, when most Covid-19 vaccines were approved, and January 2021. It is this rise in international crude prices which has been driving petrol-diesel prices in the past few months.Although, oil prices are still significantly lower than what they were before the pandemic erupted, they are expected to increase compared to what they were in 2020. If international crude prices continue their upward trajectory, base price of petrol and diesel will keep increasing, which will entail another source of tailwinds in addition to higher taxes.Higher fuel prices, along with growing economic momentum, could add to inflationary pressuresAs international crude prices increase, petrol-diesel prices will continue to increase if tax rates do not change. If Covid-19 infections in the advanced countries drop sharply with vaccinations, oil demand and therefore prices could increase from their current levels. In January, Goldman Sachs estimated Brent crude oil price to reach $65 by middle of 2021 as demand boosts from the roll-out of Covid-19 vaccines and there is limited increase in supply from OPEC+ countries. This will entail an upward pressure on overall inflation numbers. Because fuel prices affect household budgets both directly (travel expenses) and indirectly (transport costs), they can have a significant cascading effect on prices. Experts have been pointing out that businesses might have been reluctant to pass on such costs to consumers when the economy was not doing well.However, this could change with the economy picking up momentum. The latest monetary policy resolution of the Reserve Bank of India highlighted these concerns.Given the centrality of petroleum products in the government’s fiscal calculations -the Budget assumes a very high excise duty collection and lowest petroleum subsidies ever – a sharp rise in global oil prices could force the economy into an unenviable trade-off between fiscal balance and inflation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/choice-for-government-fuel-tax-cut-or-inflation-101612984663746.html
11-02-2021||India||More berths, aisle markers as railways rolls out AC 3-tier economy coach||The Indian railways on Wednesday said it has rolled out its first air conditioned three tier economy class coach, which it hailed as the "cheapest and best AC travel in the world”."In this new passenger coach, where modern passenger amenities have been taken to a new peak, the passenger capacity has been increased from 72 to 83 berths," the Rail Coach Factory said in a statement on Wednesday.The LHB Three Tier Coach was designed by Rail Coach Factory (RCF) Kapurthala and work on its design started in October 2020 with the approval of the Ministry of Railways, the production unit said.These coaches will feature an “economical” AC 3-tier Class in between the current AC 3-tier and non-AC Sleeper Class, RCF said.“Many innovations have been incorporated in the design of this coach. For increased passenger space, the high voltage electric switchgear presently installed on board has been shifted below the under frame for the first time in Indian Railways, thereby increasing the passenger capacity by introducing 11 additional berths in these coaches,” a statement from the ministry said.Each coach is provided with a wider and one disabled friendly toilet entry door, which is a new initiative, it noted.The coach also has an increased headroom in the middle and upper berths. Public address and passenger information systems have also been installed as a part of passenger facilities in these coaches.“Ambience and ease of access into the coach has been improved by aesthetically pleasing and ergonomic entrance. The interior of the coach has luminescent aisle markers, illuminated berth indicators integral with night lights with luminescent berth numbers," RCF said.Series production of these coaches will start from this month.“This new 3-Tier Air-Conditioned Economy Class coach is a symbol of aspirational India bringing AC travel to a larger number of people and enhancing the capacity of our express trains. Undoubtedly, now every rail journey will become a journey of pleasant memories,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-berths-aisle-markers-as-railways-rolls-out-ac-3-tier-economy-coach-101612981462320.html
11-02-2021||India||Pullback raises hope but India set to keep close eye on China||The limited withdrawal of frontline troops by the Indian and Chinese armies from one of the key frictions points on the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh on Wednesday has turned the spotlight on how the broader disengagement plan will unfold in other flashpoints where rival soldiers are deployed eyeball-to-eyeball and where previous attempts to reduce military tensions have failed.The mutual pulling back of tanks and infantry combat vehicles from heights on the southern bank of Pangong Tso a fortnight after military commanders of the two armies agreed on January 24 to push for early disengagement has raised hopes of a solution to the 10-month military standoff.Also Read | India to continue talks with China for disengagement: Minister in Lok SabhaThis is the first significant movement in negotiations to ease tensions in at least eight months -- disengagement in Galwan valley took place in early July 2020 but it did not progress in other areas.According to officials and experts monitoring the border row, India will keep a wary eye on the developments taking place in the area as the process unfolds.PATROLLING RIGHTS IN DEPSANG AND FINGER AREA The Chinese People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) aggressive forward deployments in the eastern Ladakh theatre have hindered the Indian Army’s patrolling patterns in several areas including Depsang, Finger Area on the northern bank of Pangong Tso, Gogra and Kongka La.Regaining access to several areas that are now difficult to reach due to actions by the Chinese army along LAC is critical, experts said.“On the face of it, the disengagement is a positive step. I think we will have to wait for details of the process, whether it includes all military presence or only heavy equipment and aspects such as future patrolling pattern in vacated areas. It is hoped that this is a part of a more comprehensive agreement covering all areas in Ladakh,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd).PLA’s deployments in forward areas in Depsang have hindered access of Indian soldiers to routes including the ones leading to Patrolling Points (PP) 10, 11, 11-A, 12 and 13. Also, before PLA grabbed positions on Finger 4, the Indian Army would patrol right up to Finger 8, which New Delhi considers within Indian territory.The Indian claim line in this sector extends to Finger 8, while the Chinese claim is up to Finger 4. The two are about 8km apart.China on Wednesday said that frontline troops of the Chinese and Indian armed forces have begun to disengage at the southern and northern banks of Pangong lake in line with the consensus reached at the 9th round of corps commander-level talks on January 24. No withdrawal of troops has taken place in the Finger Area on the northern bank, said one of the people cited above.Also Read | Rajnath Singh to make a statement in Rajya Sabha on Ladakh situation tomorrowIndia has pushed for comprehensive disengagement at all flashpoints and restoration of status quo ante of early April 2020 during the ongoing military talks with China.“The 10th round of military talks is expected to be held soon. Aspects related to disengagement will be discussed during the dialogue. Verification will be a critical aspect of the disengagement process, which is likely to take place sector-wise and in phases,” said an Indian official who asked not to be named.REALITY OR ILLUSION?Some experts warned that China could not be trusted, and India should be extremely cautious in dealing with the neighbour during the disengagement process.“They (the Chinese) are masters in creating optical illusion. Their withdrawal from southern heights of Pangong Tso could be a decoy move. They must withdraw to a distance from where swift build up is not possible. De-escalation of the military build-up to a sufficient depth is more critical than disengagement,” said Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd), also a former Northern Army commander.He said the Chinese forces must retreat to such a depth that doesn’t allow them to surprise the Indian Army and reoccupy strategic locations.“On the one hand, PLA is trying to show that it is withdrawing from the heights on the southern bank. On the other, China is building villages on our borders. It‘s a ploy as those villages house soldiers. These areas will serve as logistics hubs to support future ingress and will minimise troop build-up signatures,” Jaswal added.India has made all preparations to hold ground in Ladakh for an extended duration. On January 12, Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said that the Indian Army was prepared to hold its ground in eastern Ladakh “for as long as it takes” to achieve national objectives in case the ongoing military and diplomatic talks with China are prolonged.“Resolving the border row is a priority. But nothing will be done in a hurry,” said a second official on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pullback-raises-hope-but-india-set-to-keep-close-eye-on-china-101612980667499.html
11-02-2021||India||Will collegium impasse cost India chance to get woman CJI in 2027?||A stalemate in the Supreme Court collegium over one name may cost the country the opportunity to have its first woman Chief Justice of India (CJI) in 2027.The five senior-most judges in the top court, who make up its collegium, have failed to arrive at a consensus on elevating justice Akil A Kureshi, currently chief justice of the Tripura high court, as a judge in the apex court, people familiar with the development said on condition of anonymity.The collegium, which is headed by CJI SA Bobde, has met at least three times in last one month to decide on names of judges for elevation to the apex court, but each time, according to these people, it has been unable to decide on any name simply because of the lack of consensus on justice Kureshi, the second senior most judge across all of India’s high courts.Also Read | Supreme Court stays HC order directing schools to give free gadgets to poor students, claim cost from Delhi govtAnd that has cast a long shadow over the timely elevation of justice BV Nagarathna from the Karnataka high court, who, if elevated now, could become India’s first woman CJI in 2027.The other judges in the collegium are justices NV Ramana, Rohinton F Nariman, Uday U Lalit and AM Khanwilkar. The people familiar with the matter added that one of the members of the collegium has insisted that justice Kureshi’s name be sent along with the names of others whose elevation is being recommended. With the collegium, which recommends names to the law ministry, not arriving at a consensus on his name, its other recommendations have been held up too.The law ministry has the option of sending the recommendations back to the collegium for review, but if the collegium resubmits them, it has to approve the names -- although there is no time frame mandated for this approval, which means it can delay the process indefinitely if it so desires.The top court currently has a vacancy of four judges out of the sanctioned strength of 34 judges. Five more judges will retire by the end of this year, including one out of the only two woman judges.Justice Kureshi’s current posting, in Tripura, also raised eyebrows when it was made. He was appointed as a judge in the Gujarat high court in 2004, and he is scheduled to retire in March 2022, at the age of 62. Supreme Court judges retire at 65, and judges get an automatic extension of three years once elevated to the apex court. As a judge in the Gujarat high court, justice Kureshi heard several important and politically sensitive cases, including the one concerning the killing of extortionist and gangster Sohrabuddin Sheikh in an encounter.In May 2019, the Supreme Court collegium recommended justice Kureshi ‘s appointment as the chief justice of the Madhya Pradesh high court, but the central government expressed its reservations. This prompted the collegium to modify its recommendation in September 2019 and transfer justice Kureshi to a different high court -- as chief justice of the Tripura high court, relatively a much smaller high court than Madhya Pradesh’s.The prolonged disagreement within the collegium has not only created uncertainty over elevation of justice Kureshi and other senior high court judges, but it has also led to a state of suspense whether India could get its first woman CJI, justice Nagarathna.If elevated without much delay, justice Nagarathna, who was appointed a judge of the Karnataka high court in February 2008, could succeed justice Surya Kant as CJI in February 2027, and occupy the post until 29 October, 2027. She will otherwise retire as a high court judge in October 2024. Justice Nagarathna’s father, Justice ES Venkataramiah, was CJI for a few months in 1989.HT has learnt that if the current impasse continues and the possible elevation of justice Nagarathna is delayed further, her chances of becoming the first woman CJI may get diminished further.Apart from her, the elevation of Punjab and Haryana high court chief justice Ravi Shanker Jha, whose parent high court is Madhya Pradesh, is also stuck owing to the dissonance over justice Kureshi’s elevation.Other names in the zone of consideration for their elevation to the SC include Calcutta high court chief justice TB Radhakrishnan, Gujarat high court chief justice Vikram Nath and Delhi high court chief justice DN Patel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-collegium-impasse-cost-india-chance-to-get-woman-cji-in-2027-101612980666758.html

We had alerted all the district magistrates to issue appeals to anyone whose friends or relatives had travelled to Uttarakhand, especially Chamoli. Throughout the day, we have been coordinating and collating information,” Rana said.“Teams of the National Disaster Response Force, State Disaster Response Force, Indo-Tibetan Border Police and the Army is working round the clock. We are in touch with them and gathering information. Along with this, we are also collecting photographs of all the missing people from UP and checking with Uttarakhand authorities about their safety. Simultaneously, we are also besieged with calls from kin of the missing who are aware we are here,” Rana said.Goel said the emergency control room established by the state government in various districts received information about 93 missing people till Wednesday. Out of them, 23 were rescued or located and three were dead.Among the 67 missing people, 31 are from Lakhimpur Kheri, 12 from Saharanpur, five from Shravasti, four from Gorakhpur, two each from Kushinagar and Rae Bareli and one each from Amroha, Azamgarh, Bulandshahr, Chandauli, Deoria, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Mathura, Mirzapur, Moradabad, Shahjahanpur and Sonbhadra.A report from Lakhimpur Kheri said district magistrate Shailendra Kumar Singh confirmed the death of Awadhesh and Suraj. The bodies were recovered from the debris at the Tapovan hydro power project in Chamoli.Awadhesh’s body was brought to his village on Tuesday night, while the body of Suraj was expected to arrive early Thursday morning. Both of them had been working at the Tapovan project as labourers.Nighasan tehsil officials visited the family members of Awadhesh on Wednesday to assure them all assistance. The last rites of Awadhesh were performed at his native village on Wednesday.Rana, along with UP's Ayush minister Dharam Singh Saini and minister of state for revenue and flood control Vijay Kashyap, had rushed to the hill state on Tuesday to aid the relief and rescue work. The ministers, after meeting Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, had camped in Haridwar.A team of Uttar Pradesh officials is also camping in Joshimath and Dehradun. They include administrative and police officials from Saharanpur, Bijnor, Lakhimpur Kheri and a flood expert from the relief commissioner’s office.Officials said many families panicked despite the fact that their relatives were more than 300 kilometres away from the site of disaster in ChamoliTake Imran Khan's father Ikram Hussain from Moradabad, for instance. Ikram, who does odd jobs for a living, feared for his son's safety after being unable to reach him since the news of the glacier burst spread.“I was unable to reach my son, his mobile was switched off and I panicked and called the helpline numbers. However, I later came to know that my son was about 350 kilometres away from the site of the glacier burst. It was just that since the power supply in the village was affected, he couldn't charge his phone and that's why we had become apprehensive,” he said.Similarly, Kusum, whose brother-in-law is in the army and posted some 350 kilometres away from the Chamoli site, said, since there was no connection with the army man for two days, the family panicked."But now all is well.

11-02-2021||India||UK variant of Covid-19 more cardiotoxic for younger adults, children: Doctor||The UK variant of Covid is more cardiotoxic, causing damage to heart muscles than the currently circulating strains as more positive cases and deaths caused by the infection are reported in the UK among the younger population and kids, said Dr Aarti Kinikar, head, paediatric ward, Sassoon General Hospital.She was speaking about rare and complicated Covid case studies during a presentation at the collector’s office on Wednesday.Dr Kinikar also said that the lesson learnt during the H1N1 pandemic came handy for Covid treatment of kids.Dr Kinikar who presented the first proven case of vertical transmission of Covid in the country, said, “The UK variant is found to be more cardiotoxic and younger adults infected with Covid are reporting cardiac arrest.”“More cases and deaths are being reported among younger adults and kids post the new UK variant which was detected last year. We need to read more and get more information as the virus is still evolving,” she said.Describing one such complicated case, Dr Kinikar said, “In this case, while the mother tested RT-PCR negative twice, the baby had tested positive for the same. The mother had reported flu-like symptoms following 38 weeks of gestation. On day seven after the delivery of the child, the mother tested negative through RT-PCR and also negative for antibodies while the baby tested RT-PCR positive for the swab samples collected through placenta and cord stump or umbilical cord.”“In the following RT-PCR tests the baby tested positive for the infection and tested negative for antibodies on day ten after birth while the mother has now tested positive for antibodies. Later on the 21st day, the baby tested positive for antibodies. This just shows that the mother had infected the child when she was asymptomatic and had caught the infection just a few weeks before the delivery,” she said.Antibodies are proteins which act as immune cells and are produced by the body to fight against invading viruses and bacteria. The presence of antibodies shows that the body has been fighting against the particular virus or ‘foreign invader’.Dr Kinikar said this was the first proven case of vertical transmission of Covid in the country which was later also published in an international journal.“We collected the swab samples from the placenta and the umbilical cord to establish vertical transmission which we did not do during the H1N1 pandemic. We learnt our lessons and so we did the required test this time. We have had several cases of vertical transmission thereafter in all the cases the baby was safe,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/uk-variant-of-covid-more-cardiotoxic-for-younger-adults-children-101612977128479.html
