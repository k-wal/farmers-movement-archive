Ultimately, all newspapers, TV channels and radio stations have little choice but to serve as the "throat and tongue" of the party. Control of the media has only increased since Xi Jinping became the country's supreme leader in autumn 2012," he wrote.On Friday, the National Radio and Television Administration (NRTA) of China barred the broadcasting of BBC World News on the mainland claiming that it has done a "slew of falsified" reporting on issues such as human rights violations in Xinjiang based on interviews of victims surviving "re-education camps."Global Times, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) government's mouthpiece, said that the British broadcaster is responsible "for falsified reporting" on China's handling of the coronavirus in the country.The move came after the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that "BBC has made some false reports" on human rights abuses against Uyghurs in Xinjiang after the British broadcaster reported systematic rape in so-called re-education camps.The United States and European Union (EU) have condemned the Chinese action of banning BBC.The EU said China should reverse its ban on BBC World News as it violated both the Chinese constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-chinese-media-outlet-truly-independent-of-ccp-report-101613494671567.html

Before Tharoor, several leaders of the party have accused the government of robbing people by increasing the fuel prices. The Congress party on Monday had demanded an immediate rollback of the hike in the prices of these fuels and stated that the Centre was insensitive towards the problems of the common people.Taking to Twitter, Tharoor shared a cartoon of yoga guru Ramdev doing a sirsasana or a headstand in front of a board showing the price of petrol at ₹90 per litre. “If you took yoga lessons from Baba Ramdev, you too could see petrol prices at 06 rupees a litre!” the Thiruvananthapuram lawmaker posted explaining his point.Earlier in the day, Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala explained the taxation and pricing system of petrol and diesel and alleged that the central government had earned ₹20 lakh crore in the last six years. Sharing a price list on Twitter, he accused the Centre of ‘fuel loot’.If you took yoga lessons from BabaRamdev, you too could see petrol prices at 06 rupees a litre! pic.twitter.com/zatuS6t6csCongress’s former president Rahul Gandhi also said that the price hike was meant for robbing the people and ensuring ‘development of only two’. “Modi government is determined. To keep on looting the public. And doing development of only two,” his tweet translated from Hindi read.Gandhi’s ‘development of only two’ is seen as a follow up to his ‘Hum Do, Hamare Do’ jibe in Parliament last week. The Wayanad MP had targeted the Centre over the ongoing farmers’ protest against the three new farm laws by saying that the country was being run by only four people with a ‘Hum Do, Hamare Do’ approach.Petrol and diesel went up for the eighth consecutive day on Tuesday. According to oil marketing companies, petrol was hiked by 30 paise while diesel there was a 35 paise surge in the price of diesel. Petrol price in Delhi was nearly ₹90 per litre while diesel stood at ₹79.70. In Mumbai, prices of petrol and diesel were at ₹95.75 and ₹86.72 respectively.Rajasthan saw the highest surge in petrol prices across India with ₹99.87 being charged for one litre. Diesel in the state went up to ₹91.48 per litre. This comes despite the Congress-led government levying the highest Value Added Tax (VAT) on fuel in the country. VAT on both these fuels had been cut by 2 per cent in the state in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-you-took-yoga-lessons-from-ramdev-tharoor-s-jab-over-fuel-price-hike-101613493135460.html

The stadium will be a new benchmark in global stadium design for hockey, offering one of the finest spectator experiences in the world," said Patnaik, who also launched various infrastructure development projects worth ₹4,915 crore in the district during his stay in Rourkela.Also read: Karnataka imposes restrictions on travel from Kerala amid Covid spike in B'luruThe stadium will be a model of green, functional, cost-effective design. Designed to deliver the best match-day atmospheres in the world, each seat will have uninterrupted sightlines and the spectators will be closer to the pitch than at any other hockey stadium in the world, said state officials. The stadium would be completed within a year and would host matches of 2023 Hockey World Cup along with the Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar.In 2018, Odisha hosted the Men’s Hockey World Cup in Bhubaneswar's Kalinga stadium in which Belgium emerged as the champion after beating the Netherlands in the finals. India finished sixth in final ranking after getting eliminated in the quarterfinals. In 2014, Odisha hosted men's Hockey Champions Trophy.CM Patnaik, who laid foundation stones of 17 hockey astroturfs last year in as many blocks of the Sundargarh district, said hockey is the identity of Sundergarh. "The hockey players of Sundergarh have earned fame for the nation. Hockey spirit is in the air and water of Sundergarh,” he said.The chief minister's largesse for the tribal-dominated district Sundargarh fits with the BJD's gameplan of strengthening its base in the tribal area where the party has lost its popularity since the 2017 panchayat polls. Of the 35 zilla parishad seats, the party won 14 seats in 2017 panchayat polls and won just 2 MLA seats in 2019 Assembly polls. Its main rival, the BJP, won the MP seat as well as two Assembly seats. The BJP also won the Sundargarh zilla parishad polls in 2017.Ahead of Tuesday's visit, the party had dispatched 90 MLAs and 17 ministers to Rourkela deploying them in almost all gram panchayats and asking them to show Patnaik's speech through giant LCD screens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-cm-lays-foundation-stone-of-india-s-largest-hockey-stadium-in-rourkela-101613490647236.html

"It is up to the people of the state to decide if they want a lockdown or live freely with some restrictions. Wear face masks and avoid crowds or else (you) will need to go into a lockdown again," Thackeray said, according to news agency PTI.Before this, Mumbai’s mayor Kishori Pednekar urged the citizens to follow Covid-19 norms and said that the city might head again towards a lockdown if the citizens do not follow Covid-19 rules. The increase in the number of Covid-19 cases was reported in the city ten days after the local trains, considered to be the lifeline of Mumbai, were restarted for the general public from February 1.Maharashtra’s deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar also has warned that the state government might have to take some ‘harsh’ decisions as, according to him, people have stopped following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. The chief minister asked officials to ensure that safety norms like wearing face masks in public and social distancing are followed and authorised them to take action against offenders. He also asked them to regularly sanitise and disinfect public places. “People may have become complacent but the authorities should not (drop guard)," Thackeray said during a virtual review meeting with divisional commissioners and collectors, according to PTI.Also read | Rising cases of Covid-19 in Kerala, Maharashtra cause of concern: GovtNon-implementation of the standard operating procedures regarding Covid-19 safety is a serious issue, Thackeray said and stressed the need for contact tracing of each patient in areas where cases are rising. "The administration should contact commercial establishments and organisations and check if they are following SoPs. Wherever necessary, declare containment zones… Contact tracing must be done in a targeted manner. At least 20 contacts of each patient should be traced and tested," the CM suggested.Thackeray said people will need the police’s permission for organising weddings, adding that local authorities should keep a vigil on crowding and take immediate action wherever necessary. Banquet hall owners should be punished if anybody is found without a face mask inside the venues, he said. The chief minister said agitations, public meetings and processions should not be permitted given the present Covid-19 situation.Authorities should cancel permits and licences of halls and auditoriums where safety SoPs are not followed during marriages and other social functions, he said. The chief minister directed that field hospitals should be monitored to check if all facilities are functional. He also said that mobile vans should be used in rural areas to increase the number of Covid-19 tests.The state has recorded 2,071,306 cases of the coronavirus disease and related 51,591 deaths to date.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thackeray-warns-of-another-lockdown-amid-rising-covid-19-cases-101613489738971.html

16-02-2021||India||Amid fall in India's Covid-19 cases, 3 states see a surge||Karnataka, Maharashtra and Kerala are now on the verge of becoming the new coronavirus disease (Covid-19) hotspots in India. Despite the country seeing a consistent decline in its daily cases and surge in recoveries, with several districts reporting no daily cases or deaths, the situation in these three states is worrying. The Union ministry of health and family welfare on several occasions highlighted that Maharashtra and Kerala account for more than 70 per cent of the total active cases in India and has urged for increased surveillance.“Kerala and Maharashtra with 61,550 and 37,383 active cases respectively account for 72% of the total active cases in the country,” Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said on Tuesday.Also Read| Karnataka imposes restrictions on travel from Kerala amid Covid spike in B'luruMeanwhile, two new Covid-19 clusters have erupted in Bengaluru city, a sign that the overall situation in Karnataka might decline again. The state government has already allowed offline classes for students of sixth, seventh and eighth grades from next week in the backdrop of the surge in daily cases.1. KarnatakaThe state has registered nearly 946,000 cases of the coronavirus disease till now of which 12,267 people have died and 926,664 have been discharged. On Monday, 368 new cases and two more related deaths were added. Since the past few months, Bengaluru and other areas of the state have been seeing a significant rise in infections. As many as 258 people detected positive in Bengaluru on Monday and the state’s two new deaths were reported from the city.The emergence of two new Covid-19 clusters in Bengaluru has led to fear of an incoming wave of cases. Forty-two students of a nursing college in RT Nagar tested positive. While the SNN Raj Lake View Apartment in the Bommanahalli area added 103 cases after a function was held in the clubhouse of premises. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) called these two clusters as isolated incidents while the civic body’s commissioner Manjunath Prasad termed them as a wake-up call for the IT city of India.Amid the worrying trend, the Karnataka government announced on Tuesday that all those who have arrived from the neighbouring state of Kerala will compulsorily be subjected to RT-PCR tests. While the BBMP said that anyone coming from Kerala should produce a negative RT-PCR test before entering Bengaluru.2. MaharashtraMaharashtra, which continues to be among the worst affected states in the country, is adding more than 3,000 Covid-19 cases on a daily basis. More than 4,000 cases were reported on Sunday—the highest ever in nearly 40 days. As the state government lifted several Covid-19 curbs such as reopening of schools, resumption of train services along with other modes of transport and organising social and cultural functions—the graph is on the rise again.In Mumbai, family functions and vacations at nearby tourist destinations are now becoming the new super-spreader events, according to doctors. The resumption of local trains, which are the main mode of commuting in Maharashtra’s capital, has also proven to be a significant contributor to the rise in cases. More than 600 cases were added on Sunday—the highest since January.Also Read| ‘In people’s hands’: Mumbai mayor’s warning on lockdown amid Covid-19 surgeGiving indications that Maharashtra might go into lockdown again, Mumbai’s mayor Kishori Pednekar appealed to the people to abide by all coronavirus related norms. Meanwhile, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had stated that the state government would have to take more stringent measures as people were not following the protocol.3. KeralaIndia’s first-ever case of the coronavirus disease was reported in Kerala in January last year. In the initial months, the state had set an example for the entire country as it had managed to contain the spread of the Covid-19 outbreak. However, there has been a rise in the number of daily cases in Kerala with the Union health ministry adding that the situation is concerning as the state has been among the maximum contributors towards the country’s daily Covid-19 caseload.NITI Aayog member (health) VK Paul said on Tuesday that the number of RT-PCR tests had gone down in the state and there was a need to substantially increase them. “If we look at Kerala, the increase in the number of cases can be traced since the time of festivals,’” he added during the health ministry’s press briefing.However, the state government has maintained that the high number of infections has been a result of the robust surveillance and reporting mechanism. “The rise in the number of cases in the state is due to a robust surveillance and reporting system. We managed to delay the peak of the pandemic and upgraded the threshold of our health system,” state health minister KK Shailaja had said in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-fall-in-india-s-covid-19-cases-3-states-see-a-surge-101613488102031.html

The employees from working in multi-national companies, Hotels, resorts, Lodges, homestays in Karnataka, should get the RT PCR test done at their own cost,” the circular added.Apart from these restrictions, the government has decided to declare any hostels, boarding or residential ,educational institutions with a cluster of five or more cases, a containment zone.Residents should not be allowed to have visitors or relatives on campus in educational institutes without obtaining permission from the Covid nodal officers and a list of students travelling to and from Kerala to hostels and colleges should be maintained by a competent authority, read the circular.New ClustersAfter a long gap of four months, a cluster was reported in Bengaluru. 42 students of Manjushree College of nursing in RT Nagar tested positive for the virus on Saturday. Eighteen students from this college have been admitted to Victoria Hospital for treatment, while the remaining students have been asked to self-isolate in the hostel.A day after that BBMP commissioner N Manjunatha Prasad visited the college and ordered that the campus be sealed.The BBMP commissioner said in the second cluster in SNN Raj Lake View apartment, the number of cases shot up to 103 on Tuesday. “We tested 1,058 residents of the apartment complex and 103 have tested positive. Ninety of these patients are over 60 years of age. However, many of them are asymptomatic, they are constantly monitored, and necessary medical care is being provided,” said Prasad.According to him, a function held in the apartment’s clubhouse was a catalyst in the spike. He said the event acted as a ‘super spreader’. He said that six BBMP teams have been deployed in the apartment complex to test the remaining residents.“There is a concern, but no panic. We will get over this,” he said.Prasad spoke with RWAs in the city via video conferencing on Tuesday morning. He said that the emergence of the clusters is a wakeup call for Bengaluru.During the meeting, he appealed to the RWAs to act as a watchdog for the BBMP to keep a check on all those with Covid-like symptoms.The civic agency chief also asked apartment residents not to organise any closed-door functions because an infected person could be a super spreader in case a function is organised in an air-conditioned environment. In case of open-air events, social distancing and masks should be mandatory, he added.“Bengaluru has come a long way in the fight against Covid by bringing the numbers from 6,000 cases per day to 100-200 cases per day. We want to contain any further spread. He said there is no need for panic,” he said.He also asked apartments to regulate outsiders coming into buildings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-imposes-restrictions-on-travel-from-kerala-amid-covid-spike-in-bluru-101613485157152.html

16-02-2021||India||SC dismisses plea for return of MPLAD funds donated to PM CARES||The Supreme Court Tuesday dismissed a plea seeking direction to the Centre to return ₹365 crore donated by MPs from MPLADS fund to PM CARES Fund for tackling exigencies emerging from the Covid-19 pandemic.A bench of Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian said it is not inclined to entertain the petition and dismissed it.Advocate Dushyant Tiwari, appearing for petitioner Tushar Gupta, said that ₹365 crore were donated by lawmakers from Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) in the PM CARES Fund, in contravention of the guidelines.Tiwari referred the RTI reply to buttress his claims and said that development work was hampered due to the diversion of the funds.The plea filed by Gupta sought appropriate direction to the central government to return the entire donated amount in the bank account in which MPLADS funds are transferred every year.The scheme's objective is to enable MPs to recommend developmental work "with emphasis on the creation of durable community assets based on the locally felt needs to be taken up in their Constituencies”, the plea said.It said that right from inception of the Scheme, durable assets of national priorities -- drinking water, primary education, public health, sanitation and roads -- are being created.“It is pertinent to note that in the month of March 2020, various MP’s have donated MPLAD Fund for the pandemic and as per information a total number of 339 MP’s have contributed a total of ₹365 crore from their MPLADS to the Central pool for measures towards tackling exigencies in India emerging from the effect of the pandemic,” the plea added.The petition said that in April 2020 the MPLADS funds were suspended for two financial years -- 2020-2021 and 2021-2022.Gupta referred to the RTI reply and said it raised few important questions and doubts related to the donation of the MPLAD Fund for the purpose of Covid-19.The plea sought direction to the MPs to re-prioritise the earlier recommended works so that the incomplete work can be completed from the un-utilised amount available with the district authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-dismisses-plea-for-return-of-mplad-funds-donated-to-pm-cares-101613482941838.html

16-02-2021||India||Biplab Deb's 'BJP in Nepal' comment upsets Kathmandu, draws 'formal objection'||Nepal has conveyed its “formal objection” to India over Tripura chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb’s remarks about expanding the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) influence to Sri Lanka and Nepal and forming governments there.Deb, who is no stranger to controversy, created a flutter when he told an event held in Agartala on February 13 that Union home minister Amit Shah had purportedly talked about plans to expand the BJP's influence in neighbouring countries.Responding to a tweet from a Nepalese citizen on Deb’s comments, Nepal’s foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali said on Tuesday, “Noted. Formal objection has been already conveyed.” Gyawali didn’t give details.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that Nepal’s ambassador in New Delhi, Nilamber Acharya, had spoken on phone with Arindam Bagchi, joint secretary (North) in the external affairs ministry, to convey Nepal’s reservations over the chief minister’s remarks and to seek clarification. Bagchi is responsible for relations with Nepal and Bhutan.Also read: 'Mumbai might head towards lockdown if Covid-19 norms not followed' - MayorThere was no immediate response from Indian officials on the matter. The external affairs ministry has not made any comment so far on the chief minister’s remarks.While addressing the event in Agartala, Deb had referred to comments purportedly made by Shah during a visit to Tripura some time ago when he was the BJP president.Video footage of the event showed Deb, who spoke in a mix of Bengali and Hindi, saying, “We were talking during a meeting at the state guest house when Ajay Jamwal (BJP's zonal secretary for the northeast) said the BJP was in a good position as it was in power in many states. In reply, Amit Shah said Sri Lanka and Nepal are still left. We have to take the party there and win there as well.”Deb also spoke of purported plans to take the BJP to the “whole world”.The chief minister’s remarks came against the backdrop of efforts by India and Nepal to mend ties that were hit by a border row last year. Nepal was irked when India opened a strategic road to Lipulekh on the border with China – a region claimed by Kathmandu. It responded by issuing a new map that showed the areas of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura, all within India, as Nepalese territories.Back-to-back visits to Nepal by the Research and Analysis Wing and Indian Army chiefs and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla helped put ties back on an even keel. Foreign minister Gyawali travelled to New Delhi last month to co-chair a meeting of the bilateral joint commission with external affairs minister S Jaishankar.The people cited above said both sides are keen on ensuring that the controversy over Deb’s remarks does not assume larger dimensions.Deb’s remarks have also been widely reported in Sri Lanka though there has been no formal comment from Colombo so far.Following criticism of Deb’s comments, the BJP said it has been spreading Indian culture and philosophy in different countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/biplab-deb-s-bjp-in-nepal-comment-upsets-kathmandu-draws-formal-objection-101613483333161.html
16-02-2021||India||India set to clear some new investment proposals from China in coming weeks: Report||India is poised to clear some new investment proposals from China in the coming weeks as frosty relations between the two neighbouring countries thawed amid an easing in border tensions, said three government officials with knowledge of the matter.Last week, India and China began disengagement from the Pangong Tso area, in the Ladakh region of the western Himalayas, following a nearly nine-month-long standoff after the worst clash between the neighbouring countries since 1962.At the height of the tensions, India framed various policies targeting China, including blocking the nation from participating in government tenders, compelling any Chinese company investing in India to seek approvals and banning dozens of Chinese apps.The foreign investment rule change by the Indian government said investments from an entity in a country that shares a land border with India would require government approval, markedly slowing investments flows from China.Watch: Indian & Chinese troops disengage from Pangong lake area in LadakhThe rule change had put in limbo over 150 proposals from China worth more than $2 billion, hurting the plans of Chinese companies in India.Among the proposals delayed was China's Great Wall Motors' acquisition of a General Motors' plant in India."We'll start giving approvals to some greenfield investment proposals, but we will only clear those sectors which are not sensitive to national security," one of the officials said.The officials, who asked not to be named as the discussions are private, did not give details of the proposals they plan to clear in the coming weeks.The prime minister's office did not immediately respond to an email seeking comments, while the home ministry did not respond to an email, call or message.The government will also look to clear some other brownfield projects - new investments in existing projects - that are not a risk to national security after the first round of clearance to new investments, the above officials said.The government is also considering allowing some investment from Chinese firms in certain sectors via the "automatic" route, or without government scrutiny, said the officials.The officials said investments for stakes of up to 20%, in "non-sensitive" sectors, may revert to the automatic route for nations with which India shares land borders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-set-to-clear-some-investment-proposals-from-china-in-coming-weeks-report-101613482640878.html

This will be the state’s message to the ruling BJP. No CAA in Assam,” Congress state president Ripun Bora told journalists on Tuesday.Lok Sabha MP Pradyut Bordoloi said the memorial will highlight peoples’ struggles against the law.“After winning the election, we shall make a memorial for the anti-CAA peoples’ movement that has been going on in Assam for the last few years. It will highlight the peoples’ struggles, sacrifices, protests, songs and paintings which they expressed to oppose the legislation,” Bordoloi said in a statement.On Sunday, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said in Assam that the party will not allow the implementation of the CAA in the state at any cost if voted to power in the coming assembly polls due in April-May.Addressing a rally in Sivasagar, he said the legislation was a BJP ploy to divide the people of Assam.“We are wearing a ‘gamocha’ (traditional Assamese towel) today where letters CAA have been written and marked with a cross. It signifies that come what may, CAA won’t happen. Illegal immigration is an issue, but Assam’s people have the capability to resolve this problem together with talks,” Gandhi had said.There is fear among a large section of people in Assam that if the CAA is implemented it would lead to large scale influx of people from Bangladesh.Stressing that Congress will uphold and defend the Assam Accord (signed in 1985 after a six-year agitation against illegal immigrants from Bangladesh), Gandhi had said the BJP was trying to do away with the Accord, divide the state and implement CAA.The anti-CAA protests were spearheaded by several groups and led to the creation of two regional parties - Assam Jatiya Parishad and Raijor Dal - both of which have decided to contest the coming polls together.The Congress has formed a ‘grand alliance’ with All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), Anchalik Gana Morcha and three Left parties. Despite Congress pleas for a joint front against BJP, both Assam Jatiya Parishad and Raijor Dal have refused to join hands with the alliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-to-build-anti-caa-movement-memorial-if-voted-to-power-in-assam-101613482707995.html

The death toll on Tuesday rose to 58, out of which 11 bodies have been recovered from a tunnel of NTPC's Tapovan-Vishnugad hydropower plant.On February 7, a glacier burst in the Tapovan-Raini area in Chamoli, triggering massive flooding in the Dhauliganga and Alaknanda rivers.

SDRF has also put an alarm system to detect the rise in the level of water. It will also alert the authorities in case the water level rises. "Tonnes of the debris is stuck inside the tunnel. There is a limitation to the amount of work that can be done," PK Tiwari, the commandant of NDRF, had said."Bodies are being recovered with caution so as to return them to their family members," Ujjwal Bhattacharya, NTPC’s hydropower project director, had earlier said, according to ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-disaster-challenges-progress-during-rescue-operation-101613481768697.html

Party general secretary and parliamentary party leader V Vijay Sai Reddy announced that he would take out a padayatra in the city on February 20 in protest against the privatisation of the steel plant.Reddy said he would walk for 22 km from Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation office to the steel plant gate at Kurnmanna Palem to highlight the issues of steel plant workers.He said he would take up the issue with the Centre and make all out efforts to see that the Visakhapatnam steel plant is not privatised.YSR Congress party president and chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy will be visiting Visakhapatnam on Wednesday to interact with the steel plant workers and extend his support to their cause.A YSRC leader familiar with the development said the chief minister was suspecting that the TDP was planning to create unrest in Visakhapatnam, at a time when the government was planning to shift the executive capital from Amaravati to Visakhapatnam.Early Tuesday morning, the Visakhapatnam police swooped down on the TDP office where Srinivas was on hunger strike, bundled him into a van and took him to the Krishna Institute of Medical Sciences at Sheelanagar where he was admitted.The TDP leader refused to take treatment and said he would continue with the fast on the hospital bed itself.In the afternoon, TDP president Chandrababu Naidu called on Srinivas in the hospital and extended all support from the party. “It was unfortunate that not a single minister has bothered to call on the fasting TDP leader and enquired about his health till now,” he said.Naidu demanded that the chief minister take the responsibility to lead the ongoing agitation for saving the prestigious Visakhapatnam Steel Plant from the threat of privatisation.He said Jagan should stop enacting dramas on the steel plant issue and take up the cause of thousands of workers. He alleged that YSRC leader Vijay Sai Reddy was trying to counsel the people stating that they should accept the reality about the privatisation of the steel plant.Describing the steel plant as the soul of Vizag, the TDP chief alleged that the YSRC leaders were hell bent on looting the 'soul' itself. “If Jagan has any love for Visakhapatnam, he should get the Obulapuram mines in Anantapur allotted for saving the Visakha Steel plant,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vizag-steel-plant-anti-privatisation-protest-pits-ysr-congress-against-tdp-101613480893263.html

16-02-2021||India||'Agitating farmers illegally tapping electricity, damaging roads': NHAI||The National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) has accused the agitating farmers of illegally tapping electricity from its streetlight connection to run their gadgets and appliances, including washing machines, heaters and TVs, besides damaging the road at the Ghazipur border on the under-construction Delhi-Meerut Expressway.The NHAI has urged the Uttar Pradesh government to get the road cleared in keeping with the terms and conditions of the State Support Agreement (SSA), which provides that barring reasons related to emergency, national security and law and order, no government agency or private individual will disrupt the highway project.The NHAI charges come amid the announcement by Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait that he would set up an air-conditioned office at the protest site, giving indications about the agitators readying for a long haul.Tikait, who has been sitting on the UP-Delhi border with thousands of his supporters for more than two months now, is also a member of the State Advisory Committee (SAC) under the UP Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC).The NHAI claims to have written several letters to authorities since December 16, 2020, bringing the issue to their notice and urging them to get the site vacated so that the expressway project could be completed as per the fixed timeline.“We have been regularly writing to the authorities for over two months now about the farmers having illegally occupied the expressway, stealing electricity from our street lights, damaging the road, etc. We have urged them to get the place vacated, but in vain,” said project director Mudit Garg.Also read: January meeting could have provoked PM Modi’s swipe at the IAS-led ‘babus’The state government, he argued, must order the site to be cleared as per the SSA entered into with it on May 5, 2015.One of the letters written by Garg to the Ghaziabad district magistrate, with a copy marked to UP’s chief secretary and regional officer, NHAI, on January 28, stated, “Farmers are making unauthorised use of the project’s streetlights for various purposes and things such as washing machines, heaters, tent lighting, mobile charging points etc.”“Tapping supply illegally from the streetlight,” he pointed in the letter, led to frequent damages of equipment like miniature circuit breakers (MCBs) etc, apart from causing fluctuations, damaging project’s high-quality streetlight lamps.The letter further said, “bitumen layer on around one-kilometre stretch from UP Gate/Delhi to Dasna had been completely burnt, because of farmers regularly burning bonfires on the dharna site. The road surface is in a very poor condition.”“Digging of roads to erect poles and put up tents and water flowing from the makeshift toilets set up on the site are also damaging the road,” the letter said.Garg said entry to the site has been completely blocked. “We do not know what is happening there on the project site. Protestors chased our men away when they managed to reach the place a few days ago,” he complained.Meanwhile, BKU state president Rajveer Singh Jadaun said, “We are not going to vacate the protest site, NHAI’s complaints notwithstanding, till the government withdraws the three laws.”“As for the charges about farmers stealing electricity from NHAI’s streetlight connection, our leader Rakesh Tikait has publicly said that government can always send its officials and give a separate power connection for the dharna site,” he added.UP Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) chief engineer, Ghaziabad zone, Pankaj Srivastav confirmed that farmers, or anyone else on their behalf, had neither taken a power connection for the protest site nor had anyone applied for one.“We are told that farmers are meeting their electricity requirements by tapping the streetlights line that is duly metered and causes no revenue loss to us,” he argued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/agitating-farmers-illegally-tapping-electricity-damaging-roads-nhai-101613480585803.html

Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said many as 87,40,595 Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered in the country till 1 pm, it said. Out of this, 85,69,917 people have received the first dose and 170,678 have been given the second dose of the jab, Bhushan said.As many as 70% of the registered healthcare workers have been administered with the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine in Rajasthan, Sikkim, Jharkhand, Mizoram, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Himachal Pradesh, Tripura, Bihar and Chhattisgarh, Bhushan said during a press briefing. Eleven states and the Union territories, including Delhi, Punjab and Andhra Pradesh, have administered first Covid-19 dose to less than 50% of people, Bhushan added. Jharkhand, Gujarat, Odisha, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and three other states have reported frontline workers' vaccination coverage of over 40 per cent, he also said.Click here for complete Covud-19 coverageA massive vaccination drive is underway in India, during which authorities are inoculating millions of health workers and frontline workers in the first phase.

The personnel are braving deep slush and muddy waters to find the bodies in the Alaknanda river in districts of Chamoli, Tehri Garhwal, Pauri Garhwal and Rudraprayag.Of the 58 bodies, 48 have been recovered from Chamoli district, seven from Rudraprayag, two from Pauri Garhwal and one from Tehri Garhwal districts. Eleven of the bodies were recovered from the 1.7km long tunnel at the NTPC’s Tapovan project in Chamoli where a search and rescue operation is still on.Rescuers have been able to identify 31 of the 58 bodies recovered so far.SDRF inspector Praveen Alok, said, "The SDRF personnel are working tirelessly to find the bodies in the disaster site as well as the Alaknanda river facing difficulties like heavy muck and muddy water.""The two factors make it very difficult to spot bodies in a water body. The SDRF personnel are using binoculars to spot the bodies in the river and then drag them out from thick muck by walking into it. In some cases, they have to bring the body up to the road about one or one and a half km up," said Alok.He said most of the bodies found in the river are "swollen or missing some body parts which make it difficult to identify them."Rescuers are also finding severed limbs which are the most difficult to be identified. They have so far recovered at least 22 body parts from the Alaknanda river.Neeru Garg, deputy inspector general, Garhwal who is one of the officials monitoring the rescue operation said, "The police are collecting the DNA samples of all the bodies and body parts being recovered from the river.""As it is not easy to identify the bodies and body parts recovered, we are collecting their DNA samples to ascertain the identification. We are also collecting DNA samples of the family members of the missing people who have come to the disaster spot. DNA test is the ultimate and concrete way to ascertain the identification especially of the body parts," said Garg.The state police have also made a WhatsApp group with family members of the missing person as its members to help the police to identify the bodies.Nilesh Anand Bharne, deputy inspector general, (law & order) Uttarakhand police said, "We share the pictures of bodies focusing on their identity marks such as tattoos, jewellery or any other identity marks found with the bodies. It has helped us identify them."Bharne said, "Rescue workers had so far cremated 53 bodies and 20 human body parts complete with rituals and respect till Monday evening. Police have also registered 52 cases related to the missing people."“The rescue workers are working tirelessly to recover the remaining bodies. The family members can contact helpline numbers- 01372-251487 and 9084127503 for any queries or help,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-rescue-ops-in-uttarakhand-identifying-decomposed-bodies-a-big-challenge-101613478193998.html

The much-hyped project was initiated by the Ministry of Urban Development Government.The loopholes got exposed this winter when few feet of snow left the entire city crippled as the lanes, bylanes and the interior roads remained blocked for many days."There is nothing smart about Srinagar. It continues to remain underdeveloped. Apart from a concrete flyover, nothing much has changed. In winter, the city gets enveloped in a chilling dark atmosphere. For weeks, the snow remained on roads, fields, lanes and bylanes even though authorities claimed many things on Twitter," said Wajhaat Ahmad, a city resident.Another resident, Pir Bashir, said the power is still supplied on an hourly basis. "We live in the city, still it doesn't look like any big city after dark. Our city cant match with other cities of the country as many parts get plunged into darkness after evening every day."Shoaib Ahmad, who runs a hotel in the old city, said that the city has many lakes and streams in the surrounding but 24-hour portable water supply is still a dream.Also read: January meeting could have provoked PM Modi’s swipe at the IAS-led ‘babus’"For years, we have been hearing of laying of underground wires, still the electric poles and the dangling wires on our roads resemble entangled looms. Nothing has changed in the old city despite claims that it would be decongested. The open drains are a constant eyesore besides being responsible for various infectious diseases."Officials, however, say once the projects get completed the city, which is summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir, will present a different look.Chief Executive Officer (CEO) SSCL (District Development Commissioner Srinagar) Shahid Iqbal Choudhary said that a host of new projects are being taken up and the work on 21 ongoing projects is under execution under the 140-crore smart city project. "A large number of projects have already been cleared and many are underway."Giving details of the ongoing projects, he said the projects include installation of street furniture and road signages across the city, development of green corridors, the establishment of hawker zones, development of parking spaces at Residency Road and underneath the JCRB flyover, development of cycle tracks, smart street lighting across the city, smart water metering, ICCC-Smart Data Center (for civic services, traffic management and disaster response integration)."The ongoing projects also include setting up of GIS (property development approval) system, grievance management emergency response system, Discover Srinagar One-Stop mobile application, development of bio-toilets at major nodes, upgrading of entire fire services apparatus of the city, installation of 10 new Variable Message Display panels and beautification of spaces underneath the JCRB flyover, among other ongoing projects under execution at an estimated cost of ₹140 crore."He said that the Grievance Management Cell (Community Engagement) will be inaugurated on February 20. "Work on the Smart Data Centre and the Integrated Command and Control Centre is going on in full swing and is expected to be completed soon. The deadline for many projects is March 31.""Projects like smart water metering, intelligent traffic management system and development of parking spaces and hawker zones to decongest roads aimed at enabling smooth traffic movement in the city are underway. For the smart water meter, further funding of ₹50 crore is being made towards the project to cover the entire city (the funding will be in addition to ₹45 crore already provided to JSD for the project)."Choudhary said that another hawker zone will be established in the city soon. "The Srinagar Municipal Corporation (SMC) has been asked to submit a list of concerned hawkers."DC Srinagar said the projects proposed under consideration of the SSCL include community facilitation centres, libraries and gymnasiums at various places across the city, construction of cycle track with footpath and green belt from Bemina Bypass Chowk to Shalteng, equipment of old SMG and Sheikhbagh multilevel parking with smart facilities, development of transport nagar connected to fruit mandi on bypass, and upgrading of facilities at Parimpora Bus Stand, among others."Development of parks, parking slots, drinking water points and bio-toilets at identified spots around Dal and Nigeen lakes (proposed by the LAWDA); and development of water filtration plants, installation of real-time water quality monitoring systems for entire Srinagar and establishment of a helpdesk for water-related issues and e-billing facility".Choudhary said the new projects include a state-of-the-art lab for testing sludge parameters and solid waste and building material testing lab at Achen dumping site, recycling plant for polythene generated in the city and elsewhere, cycle sharing scheme, surveillance cameras, smart city fibre connectivity with ICCC and PCR, ICCC Building & Smart Parking Solution, RVMs, e-Governance Service as a centralised framework, and sludge digesters."Out of the total 50 schools identified to be developed as smart schools, 25 will be developed by the Education Department through R&B Department and 25 schools by the SMC. The district administration is also taking up 100 Anganwadi Centers in the city for modernisation under Smart City. The modernisation of these centres will be done on the lines of smart schools. Similarly, the primary healthcare infrastructure in the city will be modernised and process for the modernisation of several PHCs have been started."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/officials-say-prestigious-projects-under-srinagar-smart-city-near-completion-101613476000302.html

Bhargava said that the South African variant of the coronavirus was detected in four people who came to the country last month. “In India, the South African strain of Covid-19 has been detected in four returnees from South Africa. All travellers and their contacts tested and quarantined,” Bhargava said during the Union health ministry’s press briefing.Listing out further information about the returnees with the South African variant (B.1.351), Bhargava said that one was from Angola, one from Tanzania and the remaining two were from South Africa. The National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune was attempting to isolate and culture the variant strain, he added.A returnee from Brazil had tested positive for the Brazilian variant of Sars-Cov-2 in the first week of February and the person along with their contacts had been tested and quarantined, the ICMR chief said during the briefing. Like the South African variant, the Brazilian one was also being isolated and cultured at the NIV in Pune, he said.Also Read| Rising cases of Covid-19 in Kerala, Maharashtra cause of concern: GovtAccording to ICMR, the Brazilian variant of Covid-19 had emerged in the early part of January. Also referred to as the P.1 lineage, the variant has increased transmissibility and has spread to 15 countries till now.Meanwhile, 187 returnees have tested positive for the United Kingdom variant of Covid-19 in India till now since its detection in December last year. “All confirmed cases are quarantined and treated. Their contacts have been isolated and tested. Neutralisation potential with the UK variant of the virus is there with the vaccine that we have,” Bhargava said.We have done disembarkations, mandatory RT-PCR tests for travellers coming from UK.

She said the Mission gave her a soft loan of ₹10,000 to buy a sewing machine and trained her in making masks that were in high demand to prevent the Covid-19 spread.“Now I make 250-300 masks daily and earn up to ₹800 daily. My children also help me. Demand for masks opened a new livelihood for us. Kudumbashree taught us how to change with times,” said Ajith, a school dropout and mother of three.Ajith is not alone. The Mission, which is also involved in running canteens, organic farming, stitching, packing, has helped many like her. Kudumbashree has 4.3 million members, who have made 7.9 million cotton masks, 10,000 litres of hand sanitisers, and thousands of face shields as they diversified to meet the demand for them generated because of the pandemic.Also Read | Covid-10: Kerala, Maharashtra remain cause of concern, says health ministryThe home-delivered subsidised food from Kudumbashree’s Janakeeya hotels was an instant hit. In cities like Ernakulam and Thrissur, it also started online a food delivery app.Mission officials said they procure cloth from wholesalers, cut them at a master unit and supply them for stitching with specifications. Most of the government agencies and hospitals buy these finished products in a packet of 10 masks for ₹180. The masks are the most sought after, say traders.Kudumbashree, which was set up in 1998, has opened many such venues for women, including access to credit through micro-finance and confidence to initiate and operate new group enterprises. “Recently, we modified a State Road Transport Corporation bus and converted it into a canteen at West Fort in the state capital. With a minimum sitting facility, we are doing a roaring business. The stamp of Kudumbashree attracts many,” K Shailaja, a member running the Kudumbashree Pink Cafe.The Mission spent ₹6 lakh in converting the old bus rented for ₹20,000 monthly and set up a kitchen inside. “For me, Kudumbashree is a symbol of purity and confidence,” said P K Dineshan, a jewellery firm employee as he was having his chicken biryani at the cafe.Kudumbashree Mission executive director S Harikishore said the members took the challenge head-on. “Besides creating opportunities for themselves in troubled times, they rose to the occasion upholding social responsibility. They played a key role during the pandemic. The [Mission] members’ commitment and hard work are key to its success.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keralas-kudumbashree-mission-helps-women-offset-livelihood-losses-due-to-covid-101613474156456.html

Vijayendra has been accused by others in the party for running a “parallel government”.Yatnal also said that Yediyurappa and Vijayendra play the Lingayat card only to their benefit.“Whenever Yediyurappa gets an indication from the top that there is a threat to his chair (position), he uses the Veerashaiva-Lingayat issue to his advantage. His son (Vijayendra) too does so on similar lines,” Yatnal had said.The developments are adding to the 77-year-old chief minister’s problems who has had to part the high office unceremoniously on his previous three stints.Also Read | Youth Congress polls tell story of internal dynamic in Karnataka CongressHis souring relations with the BJP central leadership have not helped. Yediyurappa’s fourth-term in office has been rattled by dissent within the party and his government that has been made worse by the Covid-19 pandemic. The health crisis has dealt a serious blow to Karnataka and its finances. With reductions in fund inflow from the Centre, Yediyurappa has barely been able to announce any new schemes or programmes due to the cash crunch.Even though Karnataka has been one of the highest revenue contributing states in the country, the Centre has not been able to transfer the benefit back to the southern state for flood relief or help its fledgling economy.Yatnal, among others, has used this opportunity to target the chief minister even as the Opposition remains a mute spectator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmshould-order-probe-into-corruption-charges-against-karnataka-cmsiddaramaiah-101613473496477.html
16-02-2021||India||Govt liberalises India’s geospatial sector. Here’s why||The Union ministry of science and technology has released a new policy for the geospatial sector in the country, a move aimed at liberalising geospatial services. Private companies can now conduct surveying and mapping without prior approvals and share the data for various everyday applications.What is geospatial data?Geospatial data represent objects on the surface of the earth, both natural and manmade. It can be both static, like the location of permanent structures, or dynamic like the ones used by food delivery apps to help users track their orders.Also Read: Centre deregulates geospatial data and map-making in IndiaWho controls India’s geospatial data?Currently, the geospatial sector in India is mostly under the control of the Centre and several central agencies like the Survey of India. The previous geospatial policy requires prior approval for collection, storage, use, sale, dissemination of geo-spatial data and mapping. Private companies need to go through a complicated system of approvals from different government departments as well as the defence and home ministries, making the entire process cumbersome. The old policy looked at geospatial data as important solely for defence purposes and therefore a strict restriction was necessary to protect internal security.What changes will the new policy bring?Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted on Monday that the new move will help bolster Indian start-ups, private and public sectors, and research institutes. He hashtagged one such tweet as Freedom2mapIndia, which is exactly what the new policy has the potential to usher in. Once the bureaucratic procedures required for mapping geospatial data are done away with, businesses heavily reliant on geospatial data for day to day operations, like e-commerce, will be able to use it for their concerns, which in turn will boost employment.The reforms will unlock tremendous opportunities for our country’s start-ups, private sector, public sector and research institutions to drive innovations and build scalable solutions. This will also generate employment and accelerate economic growth. #Freedom2MapIndia pic.twitter.com/OoN1rDTwoWThe government estimates that the new guidelines will boost the geospatial data sector to a value of ₹1 lakh crore by 2030, create jobs for 2.2 million people, and have a multifold impact on the economy.Infrastructural development too needs access to accurate geospatial data but if the task of mapping the entire country is left to the defence forces alone it can get overwhelming and marred by delays. The new policy, however, restricts terrestrial mapping and surveying to only Indian entities—both public and private.

He alleged that the attackers were armed with iron rods and destroyed furniture at random.The incident which was captured by several security cameras also exposed the infighting in the ruling party in the region. Ghosh alleged that stones were hurled at him but he escaped unhurt.Officers from the Englishbazar police station rushed to the spot. “We have received a complaint and a probe is on,” an officer from the police station said on condition of anonymity.In 2016, Ghosh won the assembly seat as an independent candidate supported by the Congress and the Left Front alliance. Chowdhury resigned from the post of chairman of Englishbazar municipality after Ghosh joined the TMC and the latter was made the new chairman.“Chowdhury and Das led the attack. Their followers tried to kill me. The duo is trying to stop my political activities. The goons threw stones at me, ransacked my office and vandalized some two-wheelers parked outside the house. I am going to inform the state leadership,” Ghosh said.Das dismissed the allegation and said the violence was the fallout of a quarrel that took place in Ghosh’s neighbourhood.“On Monday morning, there was a quarrel between Chottu Saha, a local businessman, and Ghosh’s wife. Some followers of Ghosh allegedly thrashed Saha for quarreling with her,” said Das.“The businessman’s wife lodged a complaint at Englishbazar police station. In the evening, Ghosh was spotted with the youths who allegedly thrashed the businessman. This led to another quarrel. The allegation against me and Krishnendu Narayan Chowdhury is completely baseless,” said Das.TMC’s Malda district unit president Mausam Noor said, “I am in Delhi but I have heard everything. Top leaders of our party have been informed. They will take action.”Chowdhury was not available for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-mla-in-bengal-s-malda-accuses-ex-minister-youth-leader-of-vandalism-101613472068745.html

16-02-2021||India||Hundreds of Indians en route to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait stranded in UAE||Hundreds of Indian workers en route to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have been stranded in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) after the other two countries tightened Covid-19-related travel restrictions, with many reluctant to avail of free tickets to return home. The UAE is the key transit point for Indian workers travelling to several West Asian countries and the Dubai airport handled 4.3 million Indian passengers last year, a majority of them travelling to or from Mumbai and New Delhi. The Indian workers were stranded in the UAE after Kuwait banned the entry of non-citizens for two weeks from February 7, and Saudi Arabia suspended the entry of people travelling from 20 countries, including India, on February 4. The move followed a rise in the number of new Covid-19 cases in both countries. Last week, the Indian embassy in Abu Dhabi advised Indian citizens not to travel to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait via the UAE, and also asked travellers stranded in the UAE to return home. On Tuesday, minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan said stranded Indians in need of help should approach Indian missions in the UAE. “Stranded Indian nationals on their way to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait via UAE who may require assistance for repatriation to India are advised to contact our Consulate in Dubai or Embassy at Abu Dhabi,” he tweeted. Though there are no official figures for the number of stranded Indians, the Gulf News newspaper reported that Indian community groups have “recorded the appeal for support from more than 1,000 stranded passengers, most of whom hail from Kerala”. A majority of the stranded passengers were headed to Saudi Arabia. Saji Cheriyan, a leading member of the Indian community, said he had offered shelter in Fujairah to around 400 stranded blue-collar workers, some of whom had been stuck for more than 10 days. An online campaign has been launched to seek support for people from Karnataka stuck in Dubai, the report said. The Indian consulate in Dubai told Gulf News that free tickets would be offered to those who can’t afford to buy them, using funds from the Indian Community Welfare Fund. However, the mission received less than 50 requests for free tickets till Monday. “Many of them don’t want to leave as they somehow want to proceed to their country of residence as soon as the travel restrictions are lifted. Some are also happy and thankful that their [UAE] tourist visas have been extended till March 31,” Cheriyan said. A large number of Indian workers employed in West Asian countries, who came home amid the pandemic last year, have begun returning after the easing of Covid-19-related travel restrictions. Many Indian workers have been going back to Saudi Arabia to renew their “iqama” or residence permits. The Indian government too has reached out to West Asian countries to ease restrictions and facilitate the return of Indian workers. West Asia is home to nearly nine million Indians, one of the largest concentrations of the diaspora, and Saudi Arabia and the UAE account for close to six million Indians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hundreds-of-indians-en-route-to-saudi-arabia-kuwait-stranded-in-uae-101613470316492.html

And when the members of the Hindu Munnani, accompaniedby the volunteers from the SRJTK approached him, W S Habib gifted a cheque for ₹1,00,008, taking the fund raisers by surprise."I want to foster communal amity between Muslims and Hindus. We are all children of god. I donated the sum with this belief," Habib, a property developer, told PTI.He said he was pained to see Muslims being painted as anti-Hindus or anti-India by some sections.Pointing out that there was nothing wrong in donating for a good cause, Habib remarked, "I wouldnt have donated to any other temple but the Ram temple is different as decades-old Ayodhya dispute came to an end."The Hindu Munnani, which is also involved in the campaign, said road shows are being held in various parts of the state to raise funds."All those whom we approached willingly donated. A gentleman who suddenly emerged from the crowd presented a cheque for ₹50,000.The response from Ram bhakts is overwhelming," A T Elangovan, Hindu Munnani's Chennai president, said.According to K E Srinivasan, Chennai organiser of Dharma Jagran Manch a wing of RSS not only the affluent in the society but also the poor contributed."At Perambur, for instance, cobblers and other sections came forward to donate ₹10," he said.At Kodungaiyur when the members solicited funds for the temple construction, shop keepers contributed their mite.An enthusiastic seller of vermilion (kumkum) near a temple, who happened to be a Muslim, gave ₹200 for the cause.The Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam has already appealed to the devotees to donate liberally.Janakalyan, a spiritual and cultural service organisation, is utilising its office with several prominent personalities to contribute towards the initiative, its city secretary V Subramanian said.The Supreme Court in November 2019 settled the decades-old dispute and paved the way for the construction of a Ram Temple by a Trust at the disputed site at Ayodhya.It had then directed the Centre to allot an alternative 5-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a new mosque at a "prominent" place in the holy town in UP.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had on August 5, 2020 laid the foundation stone for the construction of a grand temple at Ayodhya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chennai-muslim-businessman-donates-rs-1-lakh-for-ayodhya-ram-temple-101613469597992.html

16-02-2021||India||After 21.5% fall in 2020, Indian ad spends to rise 23% in 2021: Report||Advertising spends across media platforms in India will grow by 23.5 per cent in 2021 to ₹80,123 crore in 2021 after a sharp 21.5 per cent decline in the pandemic-hit 2020, a media buying agency estimated on Tuesday.Terming the estimates as “not optimistic, but realistic”, GroupM South Asia's chief executive Prasanth Kumar pointed out that they will still be lower as compared to the nearly ₹83,000 crore achieved in 2019.Weeks before the announcement of the pandemic, the agency had estimated a 10.7 per cent growth in ad spends for 2020 to ₹91,641 crore.India's rank slipped by one notch to being tenth in the overall ad spends across the world and the handsome growth in 2021 will help it regain the 9th spot, the agency said, adding that from a share in incremental spends, the country will be at the sixth spot.Unlike the global experience, where digital is gaining ground very fast, the ad spends in India will also have incremental spending happening on television, it said, adding that print media will also hold its 16 per cent share of the overall pie in 2021, he said.In India, digital will have a 40 per cent share in incremental ad spends as against the 90 per cent levels seen globally, it said.TV's share will slip marginally in the ad spends on the back of an 18 per cent growth, but the medium will continue to be at the numero uno spot with a 45 per cent share, it said, adding a 28 per cent growth will lead digital mediums to gobble up TV's share.When asked about the lack of measurement in certain genres within TV, Kumar said the TRPs played an important role and the absence of the data presented its own set of challenges. He added that once the system comes back, it will aid advertisers.Kumar said we have witnessed a month-on-month upturn in the industry starting from the July-September quarter last year, and the momentum will continue in 2021 with the gradual easement of the lockdown measures, seasonal spends and big-ticket events like IPL.The global ad spends are estimated to see a rise of 10 per cent in 2021 as per the agency's estimates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-21-5-fall-in-2020-indian-ad-spends-to-rise-23-in-2021-report-101613468649194.html

16-02-2021||India||Farmers’ protest: India tries to dispel misgivings among British lawmakers||India on Tuesday sought to dispel misgivings among British lawmakers about the farmers’ protest and the government’s willingness to address all concerns, even as it contended that “vested interests” abroad were trying to fuel the agitation through misinformation.The Indian government’s views were reflected in an open letter issued by the Indian high commission in London to British MP Claudia Webbe, who has repeatedly raised the handling of the farmers’ protest by New Delhi in the UK Parliament and outside. Webbe is the MP from Leicester East, which has one of the largest percentages of people of Indian-origin.The Indian mission said the information about the farmers’ protest was being shared with Webbe to “dispel any misgivings with regard to the objectives of the reforms, the ability of those having reservations to protest peacefully and the willingness of the Government of India to address all concerns in a manner most acceptable to the protesting farmers’ unions”.Also Read | Delhi Police ask Zoom to share details of farm stir ‘toolkit’ meeting“The efforts continue - but Government of India is more than aware of efforts by vested interests abroad to fuel the protests through misinformation and incendiary assertions that are not helpful in progressing the dialogue between the protesters and Government or addressing the issues through the democratic processes that our people have traditionally relied on,” the open letter added.Webbe and Labour Party MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi have been at the forefront of UK MPs who have raised the farmers’ protest. Over the past two days, Webbe tweeted in support of the protesting farmers and Disha Ravi, the 21-year-old activist arrested over a toolkit used to organise the protests.The Indian mission’s letter said Webbe, as the representative of British citizens of Leicester East, including many connected to India through family and business ties, would have been “most welcome to convey any apprehensions of the community” that she represents to the high commission in London.“We would have been able to comprehensively and in detail provide clarifications to assuage the concerns of your constituents with regard to the recent path-breaking Indian farm laws, against which a small section of India’s farming community has been protesting,” the letter said, repeating the position taken by the external affairs ministry in response to the farmers’ protest being raised by other countries.The Indian mission said the reforms, “intended to protect and empower farmers in India”, were based on “inputs from experts and recommendations by committees that have analysed the specific challenges of the agricultural sector in India over the last 20 years”.Also Read | Deep Sidhu, accused in Republic Day violence, remanded to 7-day police custodyIt added that the farm laws were discussed and debated in Parliament and their “benefits have started reaching more than 100 million small farmers instantly”.“With the section of farmers having reservations, 11 rounds of talks have been held. Though Government of India has suggested numerous ways to address their apprehensions, including postponing implementation of the Acts or amendment of the same, these options have been summarily rejected by them,” the letter said.The Indian high commission also said the farmers participating in protests have been “treated with utmost respect and restraint by the government and security forces – more than may have been the case in similar situations elsewhere in the world”.The letter also provided a detailed brief on the three farm laws against which the farmers have been protesting since late November last year.It said that during the Covid-19 lockdown, there was an urgent need to “allow free direct marketing outside the mandis in order to not only facilitate the farmers in selling their produce near [the] farm gate at remunerative prices but also decongest the mandis”, and that the “demand suppression and logistics and supply chain breakdown only accentuated the need to liberalise the ecosystem”.In the face of pressure from British MPs, UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab had raised the farmers’ protest with his Indian counterpart during a visit to New Delhi in December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-india-tries-to-dispel-misgivings-in-uk-101613467616237.html

16-02-2021||India||Chhattisgarh: Deputy Sarpanch killed, 2 injured by suspected Maoists in Bastar||Maoists allegedly killed a former deputy sarpanch and injured two others during a kangaroo court (Jan Adalat) in Amujhmad area of Naryanpur district of Bastar region, police said on Tuesday, in yet another case of increasing targeting of panchayat body heads, who are considered a link between the villages and the administration.The increasing killing of villagers in Maoist-infested areas in the jungles of Bastar division comes at the time when the number of encounters with left-wing extremists has come down by around 40% in the past one year. Also, there have been reports of a dip in the recruitment of cadre for Maoists. Experts believe that all these factors have caused some desperation among Maoists, who are now attacking villagers to create a scare.In this case, the police said the two injured have been admitted to a district hospital and the deceased body has been brought to district headquarters for postmortem.“The incident took place on Monday evening in Temrugaon under Benur police station. Shatrughan Korram, 34, former deputy sarpanch of Temrugaon, was shot dead by an unknown group of people in Chalka weekly market and fled after the attack,” said inspector general of police, Bastar range, Sunderaj P. The injured were Ramesh Yadav (57) and Batti Karam (35).Superintendent of Police ( SP), Narayanpur, Mohit Garg, there were pamphlets from Maoists Bayanar Area Committee claiming that Korram was a police informer and he would be killed like his father was shot dead in 2007.“Police team has been sent to the incident site and dead body recovered. Search parties were also sent but Maoists fled,” the SP said.On January 24, a deputy sarpanch was killed allegedly by Maoists in the Kondagaon district of Bastar region. Similarly, on January 6, a sarpanch of a village in Chhattisgarh’s Bastar district was killed by Maoists at his home.Senior police officers believe that Maoists want to create an environment of fear among villagers which can help them increase recruitment.“There has been a decrease in recruitment of sentries in 2017-18. The other very important factor behind recent killings is that there is total indiscipline in the ranks of Maoists, with local cadres now killing people without even taking the approval of senior cadres. And lastly, there is total ideological disarray with movement becoming an armed war with no ethics,” a police officer, who was not willing to be named, said.Also Read: 15 former Maoist couples marry on Valentine's Day in Chhattisgarh’s DantewadaThe tribal activists have condemned the continuous killing of civilians.“I don’t know why Maoists are killing villagers but this should be stopped. If Maoists claim they are here for tribals why are they killing them? Maoist should answer this question?,” said Soni Sori, a Bastar-based activist.Bela Bhatia, a human rights activist, also condemned the recent killing and said that any capital punishment should be condemned.Last Saturday, Maoists in Chhattisgarh have allegedly issued a threat to five people, including journalists, accusing them of pro-corporate and pro-government activities.Chhattisgarh police, which are yet to establish the veracity of the threat, have cited it as another evidence of Maoists' growing ‘frustration’ in the region.As per the records of Chhattisgarh police, total of 36 policemen lost their lives in Maoists' attacks in Bastar in 2020 while total 46 civilians were killed in 308 incidents of Maoists perpetrated violence in Bastar last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-deputy-sarpanch-killed-2-injured-by-suspected-maoists-in-bastar-101613465647027.html

The Delhi Police have alleged that the duo along with another accused Shantanu Muluk attended the virtual meeting organized by Poetic Justice Foundation on Zoom.“Based on the course of action decided in the Zoom meeting, Nikita, Shantanu, Disha and others collaborated together to draft the Toolkit document. The document that they drafted had secessionist and pro-Khalistani content embedded into it through links and texts,” the police said in a statement.The police claim that it was Ravi who shared the toolkit with Swedish environmentalist Greta Thunberg and later asked the latter to delete the Twitter post carrying the document after its details accidentally got into the public domain.“The main aim of the toolkit was to create misinformation and disaffection against the lawfully enacted government. The Toolkit sought to artificially amplify the fake news and other falsehoods and also sought to precipitate action on 26th January,” the police statement read.Jacob admitted to participating in the Zoom meeting but she has denied sharing any information with Thunberg and asserted that the document was an “informational pack” and was not meant to incite violence.Ravi was on Sunday sent to five days in police custody by a Delhi court while non-bailable warrants have been issued against Jacob and Muluk. The two have filed anticipatory bail petitions and the Bombay High Court is expected to take up the matter later today.The Delhi Police has also written to messaging application WhatsApp (owned by Facebook) to get the details of the WhatsApp group created by Ravi on December 6, according to news agency ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-police-ask-zoom-to-share-details-of-farm-stir-toolkit-meeting-101613465281015.html

In an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana, the Sena said the government has shown its weakness by doing so.The editorial heaped praise on Moitra and said she has made the government sweat. It added the government is “scared of a woman”.Moitra wrote to the Delhi police commissioner on February 13 seeking removal of the armed security personnel outside her home days after she took on the government in Lok Sabha and said the country is in under a state on “undeclared emergency”. She wrote that “it appears to me that I am under some sort of surveillance”. Moitra called herself an “ordinary citizen”, who does not require security cover.Also Read | ‘PM Modi’s andolanjeevi remark is insult to freedom movement’: Shiv SenaThe editorial questioned what kind of culture does the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) want to bring in politics. “If they are treading on the path that nobody else should remain except them, then they have not understood the mood of the people.

Even if the government has the machinery to monitor, the battle will not stop.”The editorial said Moitra has ripped the government’s veil.Sena leader Sanjay Raut said the Centre was keeping an eye on Moitra after she exposed the BJP government. He backed Moitra over her right to privacy and said that her questions to the Delhi police on why she is being given protection without seeking it are valid. “Mahua Moitra has complained that she is under surveillance and it is done through various means. We are also under surveillance because the government holds the strings of various agencies...”There was no immediate response from the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sena-backs-tmc-mp-mahua-moitra-over-her-right-to-privacy-101613463115984.html
16-02-2021||India||What led to a dramatic fall in Covid-19 cases in India? Experts debate||The trajectory of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in India has left open a gamut of theories for experts. What seemed like an inevitable escalation in the cases, rising at a pace quick enough to overtake the United States, fizzled out within three months and displayed India as an interesting case study.Are the natural factors like innate human immunity and the country's topography at play or did the stringent measures of compulsory use of mask and hefty fines for breaking the rule prevent deaths from Covid-19 large scale? Or has the urban India secured herd immunity which is controlling the tally from again touching a red mark?In whatever direction India has moved, it is clear that the country's once sinking health care system has reported a grasp over the disease as reports of burdened and overstretched hospitals have not surfaced from any part of the country.Daily new cases being reported in India at present are only around 12% of the country’s peak. India has so far not seen a second wave of infections, unlike most other big countries. New cases in the US stopped dropping after the first wave when the new cases were 64% of the first peak (and the second wave began).Among the top explanations lies - preexisting immunity from previous similar viral infections.Experts suggest that Indians may have some preexisting protection from the virus.Dr Daksha Shah, a government epidemiologist explained NPR how Malaria, typhoid, dengue fever are all endemic in India. "People with robust immune systems are more likely to survive here in the first place, Shah said.Also read | Covid-19: Why India is on the right track now"Plus, more than half of the population is under age 25. They're less likely to die of Covid-19 and more likely to get it asymptomatically," Shah said.“If the Covid virus can be controlled in the nose and throat, before it reaches the lungs, it doesn’t become as serious. Innate immunity works at this level, by trying to reduce the viral infection and stop it from getting to the lungs,” said Jameel, of Ashoka University.This is especially true because new research suggests that people who got sick with one form of the virus may be able to get infected again with a new version. For instance, Vineeta Bal, who studies immune systems at India’s National Institute of Immunology, pointed to a recent survey in Manaus, Brazil, that estimated that over 75% of people there had antibodies for the virus in October — before cases surged again in January.India's infections began to plummet in September, shortly after India was witnessing a crippling surge in cases, as people feared the toll it was taking on the country's economy. Now, the country is reporting about 11,000 new cases a day, compared to a peak of nearly 100,000.The second explanation by the experts points towards a dubious herd immunity claim. Some large areas have reached herd immunity — the threshold at which enough people have developed immunity to the virus, by falling sick or being vaccinated, that the spread begins to slacken, Bal said.However, even if herd immunity in some places is partially responsible for the decline, the vast Indian population as a whole remains vulnerable — and must continue to take precautions.Also read: The Covid-19 story across the country’s districts“If we don’t know the reason, you could unknowingly be doing things that could lead to a flare-up,” said Dr. Shahid Jameel, who studies viruses at India’s Ashoka University told Associated Press.The progress in combating the viral contagion in India has been worthy of study by experts to help other countries determine the methodology for bringing the cases down.India has reported nearly 11 million cases and over 155,000 deaths. Some 2.4 million people have died worldwide.Soon after the disease spread, India moved swiftly to bring a lockdown in place. The streets ran empty and markets once bustling with people were left deserted for weeks, except the essential stores for helping people stock up on ration.The cases didn't go down. Only increased.So in consultation with medical fraternity and experts, the government made the mask mandatory for people.A report by NPR quoted health policy expert Genevie Fernandes who said mask mandates are one of the things that may have helped bring down India's Covid-19 caseload. The worst-affected states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Delhi among several displayed stringency in asking people to wear masks whenever they step outside. Non-compliance with the instruction carried a hefty fine."...In this particular case, the police, the monitoring, enforcement, that was ramped up. Every time they fine a person 200 rupees, they also give them a mask to wear," Fernandes told NPR.But experts have noted the situation is more complicated since the decline is uniform even though mask compliance is flagging in some areas.Could India be underreporting the cases? Or manipulating the death toll?The Associated Press stated that India, like other countries, misses many infections, and there are questions about how it’s counting virus deaths. But the strain on the country's hospitals has also declined in recent weeks, a further indication the virus's spread is slowing.When recorded cases crossed 9 million in November, official figures showed nearly 90% of all critical care beds with ventilators in New Delhi were full. On Thursday, 16% of these beds were occupied.That success can't be attributed to vaccinations since India only began administering shots in January — but as more people get a vaccine, the outlook should look even better, though experts are also concerned about variants identified in many countries that appear to be more contagious and render some treatments and vaccines less effective.According to the serosurvey - a nationwide screening for antibodies by Indian health agencies - estimated that about 270 million, or one in five Indians, had been infected by the virus before vaccinations started — that’s far below the rate of 70% or higher that experts say might be the threshold for the coronavirus, though even that is not certain.“The message is that a large proportion of the population remains vulnerable,” said Dr. Balram Bhargava, Indian Council of Medical Research chief said.The urban city sphere versus rural hinterlands diagnosis by the experts tells an interesting tale, backing the plummeting cases with reason.The screening showed that more people had been infected in India’s cities than in its villages, and that the virus was moving more slowly through the rural hinterland.“Rural areas have lesser crowd density, people work in open spaces more and homes are much more ventilated,” said Dr. K. Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India told Associated Press.If some urban areas are moving closer to herd immunity — wherever that threshold lies — and are also limiting transmission through masks and physical distancing and thus are seeing falling cases, then maybe the low speed at which the virus is passing through rural India can help explain sinking numbers, suggested Reddy.With the reasons behind India's success unclear, experts are concerned that people will let down their guard. Large parts of India have already returned to normal life. In many cities, markets are heaving, roads are crowded and restaurants nearly full.Can this spark another slew of infections and mark the virus' return? Will India's second return because of the country's own lack of learning? The above-stated factors will be able to explain better.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-led-to-dramatic-fall-in-covid-19-cases-in-india-experts-debate-101613455249126.html

The petitioners had stated their aim was to protect the constitutional right to life, by preventing these platforms from abusing their freedom of expression.The top court had issued a notice on this petition, filed against the Union of India, ministry of information and broadcasting and Internet and Mobile Association of India, on October 15 last year. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for Centre, informed the bench that a related matter is pending before the court and if both matters are tagged, Centre may file a common response.The bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian said, "We hope that you are taking this issue seriously" to which Mehta responded that the process is already underway. The apex court was even about to allow the petitioners to withdraw their petitions and move a representation to the government.However, Additional Solicitor General KM Nataraj who appeared along with SG said, "to what extent we (Centre) can regulate is still under contemplation. Whether legislation is needed has not been finalised." The bench then asked the Centre to first put on affidavit what they propose to do.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hope-you-are-taking-it-seriously-supreme-court-asks-centre-for-response-on-pil-seeking-regulation-of-ott-platforms-101613462243835.html

He also bifurcated the base price, excise duty, value added tax (VAT), profit of oil companies and the price paid by the common man.In the tweet posted in Hindi, the Congress general secretary said the base price of diesel is ₹33.46 per litre and that of petrol is ₹31.82 per litre. However, for the common man petrol costs ₹89.29 per litre and diesel costs ₹79.35 per litre, said Surjewala. He attributed the wide ranging gap between the base price and market price to the significant amount of tax imposed by the government on fuel. Tax on diesel amounts to ₹46.24 per litre, while on petrol it is ₹57.29 per litre, he claimed in the tweet.डीज़ल की लागत सिर्फ़ ₹33.46/लीटरपेट्रोल की लागत सिर्फ़ ₹31.82/लीटरपर देशवासियों के लिए-डीज़ल की क़ीमत ₹79.35/लीटरपेट्रोल की क़ीमत ₹89.29/लीटरकारण-डीज़ल पर मोदी टैक्स ₹46.24/लीटरपेट्रोल पर मोदी टैक्स ₹58.24/लीटर6 साल में मोदी सरकार ने 20 लाख करोड़ कमाए।#FuelLoot pic.twitter.com/IezAmwe12aThe petrol and diesel prices increased for the eight consecutive day on Tuesday.

A total of 1,187 people were arrested for the offences.The report stated that seized articles in connection with the cases included 32,080 bottles of Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL), 10,874 bottles of beer and 1,795 litres of country liquor besides 480 kg of ganja, 3.5 kg brown sugar, 2,159 bottles of cough syrup and 6,125 capsules of other drugs.The department administers the Nagaland Excise Act 1967 along with the Nagaland Liquor Total Prohibition (NLTP) Act 1989 and the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act 1985 in tandem.The NLTP Act, which prohibits possession, sale, consumption and manufacture of liquor, import and export thereof in the state, is a topic that often resurfaces for debate in the public domain on whether it should be given more teeth or be relaxed altogether.While a large section of people holds the view that prohibition was brought into force with good intention but its implementation has failed, the influential Nagaland Baptist Church Council (NBCC), which was pivotal in bringing about prohibition in the state, has recently reaffirmed its stand on the issue and urged the state government to seriously implement the law.Those against prohibition say it has only helped spurious liquor find its way into the state through the black market which consequently affects the health of the people who drink alcohol. They also argue that scrapping prohibition would ensure better quality of liquor at cheaper prices and also increase the government’s revenue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-dry-nagaland-over-1000-liquor-cases-registered-during-peak-of-covid-pandemic-101613459842557.html
16-02-2021||India||Contemplating 'some action' on regulating OTT platforms, Centre tells SC||The Centre Tuesday told the Supreme Court that it was contemplating "some action" on the issue of regulating OTT platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.A bench comprising Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, which was initially of the view that the petitioner should approach the government for the remedy, asked the government to file its response within six weeks to the PIL seeking OTT regulation by an autonomous body.At the outset, Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain said the Centre was contemplating some action on the issue of regulating OTT platforms.The CJI sought to know from Jain as to what would be the action from the government and asked him to file the response in six weeks while tagging the matter with the pending petition.The top court had on October 15 last year issued notices to the central government, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and Internet and Mobile Association of India.The plea filed by advocates Shashank Shekhar Jha and Apurva Arhatia also sought a proper board/institution /association for the monitoring and management of content on different OTT/Streaming and digital media platforms.“With cinema theatres unlikely to open anytime soon in the country, OTT/Streaming and different digital media platforms have surely given a way out for film makers and artists to release their content without being worried about getting clearance certificates for their films and series from the censor board,” the plea said.At present, however, there is no law or autonomous body governing the digital content to monitor and manage these digital contents and it is made available to the public at large without any filter or screening, it said.“Lack of legislation governing OTT/Streaming Platforms is becoming evident with each passing day and every new case that is filed on these grounds. The government is facing heat to fill this lacuna with regulations from the public and the Judiciary; still the relevant government departments have not done anything significant to regularise these OTT/Streaming Platforms,” the plea said.None of the OTT/Streaming platforms including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Zee5, and Hotstar have signed the self-regulation provided by Ministry of Information and Broadcasting since February 2020, it said.The ministry had earlier told the top court in a separate case that there is a need to regulate digital media and that the court may first appoint a committee of persons as amicus before laying down guidelines with respect to the regulation of hate speech in the media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/contemplating-some-action-on-regulating-ott-platforms-centre-tells-sc-101613460217295.html

16-02-2021||India||Odisha government ignorant about law on protection of heritage sites: BJP MP||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) parliamentarian Aparajita Sarangi has slammed the Odisha government for being ignorant about the central law on the protection of heritage sites and called the ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD)’s opposition to the draft by-law on Puri’s Sri Jagannath temple and other temples in Bhubaneswar politically motivated.“The chief secretary and BJD leaders including the chief minister [Naveen Patnaik] have written to the culture ministry demanding the withdrawal of the draft by-law on the Ananta Basudeva Temple in Bhubaneswar. [The] withdrawal...does not mean anything as any construction within a 100-metre radius of the protected monument is barred under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010. It is a central Act passed by Parliament and overrides everything else. The Act cannot be withdrawn,” said Sarangi on Monday.Sarangi added the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Framing of Heritage By-laws and other functions of the Competent Authority) Rules, 2011, have also set the necessary guidelines.Also Read | Six elephants die of bacterial disease in Odisha, highest in any sanctuaryShe said the Odisha’s culture director was part of the draft by-law preparation. Sarangi added it is possible that the Odisha government was unaware of the same. “Governance is a serious matter. There should be an application of mind, reading of the laws and understanding their implications. Immaturity in governance cannot be accepted by the people of Odisha.”Sarangi’s comments came a week after the Union culture ministry withdrew the draft heritage by-law for Puri’s Shri Jagannath Temple issued by the National Monuments Authority. Last month, the authority had come out with the draft for the 12th-century temple proposing the 100-metre area around it as a prohibited area under Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010. A further 200-metre area was proposed as a regulated area where constructions would need approval.BJD and BJP parliament members met union culture minister Prahlad Singh Patel and sought the withdrawal of the draft by-law on Sri Jagannath temple. Patel later said the draft was issued without the knowledge of the chairman of the National Monuments Authority (NMA). The NMA would now issue a revised draft by-law for the Jagannath Temple.The draft by-law for the Ananta Basudeva Temple threatens to spoil the state government’s plans for the beautification of the 11th-century Lingaraj temple located within 100 metres of the former. The state government plans to build a heritage complex, revive Bindu Sagar tank, develop a parking space and heritage interpretation centre.On Monday, chief secretary Suresh Chandra Mahapatra wrote to the Union culture secretary Raghvendra Singh demanding the withdrawal of by-law for Ananta Basudev and Brahmeswar temples in Bhubaneswar saying it has led to discontentment.“This kind of atmosphere in temples is bound to hurt the religious sentiments of lakhs of devotees. The largest congregation of devotees in Ekamra Kshetra will happen on March 11 on the occasion of Maha Shivratri festival. It is important to have a peaceful atmosphere and full co-operation of sevayats for conducting this Annual Maha Shivratri festival in which lakhs of devotees from all over the state participate,” Mahapatra wrote.Sarangi said the apprehensions that development works near the monuments will be affected were misplaced. “The bylaws will prove good for all. They are draft bylaws and not the final.” She cited demolitions around Jagannath temple and Lingaraj temple over the last two years and said the Archaeological Survey of India wrote nine letters to the state government and issued show-cause on the construction around the two temples without its permission. Sarangi added the state government did not reply to any of the letters. She said two firms from Noida and Bangalore have been given the contract for ₹800 crore for beautification plan of the two temples without any clarity on how they were chosen. “The government talks so much on transparency, yet there is no clarity.”Manas Mangaraj, the media advisor to the Odisha government, said the director of culture was never involved in any of the meetings over the preparation of the draft bylaws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-government-ignorant-about-law-on-protection-of-heritage-sitesbjpmp-101613459335838.html

Law doesn't differentiate between a 22-year-old and a 50-year-old. She was produced before a court which sent her to 5-day Police custody. It's false when people say that there were lapses in the arrest," news agency ANI quoted Shrivastava as saying.Ravi was arrested from Bengaluru on Saturday, and sent to five-day police custody when she was produced before a magistrate in Delhi. A number of activists and opposition parties had condemned the arrest and demanding that the 22-year-old should be immediately released.Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said on Twitter that authorities are feeling threatened by an "unarmed girl".The officers in Bengaluru police said they were informed about Ravi's arrest only after all procedures of the arrest were completed. Three senior police officers HT spoke to, said on condition of anonymity that Delhi police informed the local police about the arrest through officials of Karnataka cyber-crime cell, after the arrest was made.The Delhi Police had said on Monday that Ravi was arrested in the presence of her mother and the Station House Officer from the local police station. Addressing a press conference, Prem Nath, Joint Commissioner, Cyber Cell, Delhi Police had said that all precedures wrre followed.However, the operation of Delhi Police has come under scrutiny by legal experts and activists.A group of lawyers in Bengaluru has submitted a memorandum to the police, seeking explanation on the procedural lapses and the follow-up action by them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/breaking-disha-ravi-arrested-in-toolkit-case-as-per-procedure-false-to-say-there-were-lapses-says-delhi-police-commissioner-101613457870369.html
16-02-2021||India||AIADMK beyond caste and religion, says Palaniswami||Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami, accompanied by senior All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) leaders, on Monday conducted a mass marriage in Coimbatore district for 123 couples belonging to all faiths, a clear attempt by the party to distance itself from the Hindutva ideology of its ally, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“This wedding platform is a testament to the fact that the (AIADMK) party is beyond caste and religion,” Palaniswami said at the event.Although the AIADMK-led government has conducted mass marriages previously involving couples of different castes and religions, the party’s alliance with the BJP, which espouses the Hindutva cause, appears to have compelled the Tamil Nadu ruling party to reaffirm its secular stance.“The AIADMK is always on the side of minorities; our friendship is long-lasting which is what the chief minister has been conveying whenever he gets a chance with Muslim or Christian leaders,” AIADMK’s minority wing secretary, Anwhar Raajhaa, said. “We believe that unlike the 2019 parliamentary elections or subsequent civic polls, the minorities will support us as they did in the 2016 assembly elections (AIADMK under Jayalalithaa came to power for the second consecutive term).”All mainstream Dravidian parties that sprang from Periyar’s (EV Ramasamy) Dravidian movement pitched themselves as rationalist and non-religious parties, which did not believe in rituals, although some amount of religion and rituals has crept in over the decades.Palaniswami started his election campaign in December from a temple as the National Democratic Alliance’s chief ministerial candidate. On the campaign trail, he is often seen with vermilion on his forehead, although he has worn a skull cap too when addressing Muslim gatherings. He offered prayers at the Nagore Dargah and Vailankanni Church while inspecting cyclone damage in the region in December. A common theme at his campaign rallies is an assertion that minority communities will be safe under his government.The AIADMK and the BJP joined hands ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and managed to win just one of the 39 seats Tamil Nadu fills in the lower house. They will contest the assembly elections due in April-May as partners.Incidentally, the BJP state leadership was also in Coimbatore on Monday for an internal preparatory meeting.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was in Chennai on Sunday, is likely to address a political rally on February 25 in Coimbatore.The BJP launched a month-long vetrivel yatra (victorious spear march) in November to espouse the cause of Hindus, but political experts said the party failed to connect with local voters.There is a growing perception in the AIADMK that allying with the BJP could lead to the party alienating secular voters, a constituency carefully cultivated by late chief minister J Jayalalithaa through various social development programmes and non-religion based Dravidian politics.The votes of Muslims and Christians, according to the 2011 Census, make up about 12% of the total votes in Tamil Nadu.“Once they (Christians and Muslims) were divided, now they are united on an anti-Modi plank,” said political commentator Raveendran Duraisamy. “Secular Brahmins with a progressive outlook have also joined Christians and Muslims in opinion creation. This, coupled with Tamil nationalism, Dravidian nationalism and leftist ideology influences a major chunk of Hindu voters too. Palaniswami wants to dilute this.”The CM has been open about the mixed signals his party’s alliance sends out.Last Thursday, Palaniswami participated at a meeting of the Muslim community in Tirupur district ,seeking the support of Muslim voters and said that “alliances will change because they are formed for politics, but the party will never let go of ideology...No one needs to fear that they will be affected because of our alliances. We will require your support for our governance to continue.”The AIADMK government has supported the Centre’s laws such as the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA, and the abolition of the Muslim practice of Triple Talaq.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiadmk-beyond-caste-and-religion-says-palaniswami-101613457110322.html

These healthcare workers were given the first dose of the vaccine 28 days ago.It is mandatory to maintain a gap of 28 days for taking the second dose of Covid vaccine. Maharashtra has around 8 lakh healthcare workers and 5.8 lakh frontline workers registered on the centralised Co-WIN app.However, health officials again experienced technical glitches on Co-WIN app while starting with the second dose of the vaccine. The names of beneficiaries who had registered offline or manually were not found on Co-WIN app which affected the vaccination drive.Maharashtra’s health minister Rajesh Tope said that it was not a major issue and directives have been issued to upload these names."It is not true that those expected to get a second dose could not find their names on the Co-WIN app. The fact is only those beneficiaries who were registered offline or manually for taking the first shot of the vaccine could not find their names on Co-WIN app. It was found that these names will have to be uploaded on the app for which directives have been issued. It will be resolved soon," Tope said.Till Monday, a total 71,36,725 people were vaccinated. On Monday alone, the state has vaccinated 29,884 people including 9,556 healthcare workers and 15,649 frontline workers, according to the data released by the state health department.Maharashtra has seen a rise in Covid-19 cases for the last six days. Monday was the sixth consecutive day when the state reported 3,000 plus cases. The rise in cases started from February 10 when it reported 3,451 cases. Between February 11 and 15, it recorded 3,297 cases, 3,670 cases, 3611 cases, 4,092 cases and 3,365 cases respectively. This has alarmed the state authorities as Covid cases had hit a plateau for the last three months.The Covid-19 tally in Maharashtra, which is India’s worst affected state, stands at 20,67,643 including 51,552 deaths and 19,78,708 recoveries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-completes-covid-19-immunization-of-4-679-healthcare-workers-101613456834765.html

I am not aware what is coming up there,” said Shafaat Husain, the artist’s eldest son.Shafaat did not divulge details of where the rare collections were being housed. “What do you do with them?” he said.The paintings and other collections were shifted to Mumbai soon after Husain’s death in London on June 9, 2011, Aelay said.A peculiar feature of the Cinema Ghar was that while there were only two colours on the building’s elevation from outside – black and white with Husain’s trademark sketches carved out on the walls – the walls on the insides of the museum were huge canvasses of vibrant colours with several abstract and realistic paintings. The museum also housed a 50-seat cinema theatre, equipped with Dolby sound system and a library of nearly 2,000 books on art, cinema, music and science.There was also an exhibition hall to accommodate larger art pieces. A gallery with photos of Dada Saheb Phalke, Madhuri Dixit, and Tabu, along with video and digital albums of musicians from the Beetles to A R Rahman and Urvashi to Martha Graham, was also set up inside the museum.“It was a feast for art lovers to visit this museum and spend time there. I had an opportunity to picturise every part of Cinema Ghar. I had the privilege of having a cup of tea with Husain sir in this lobby and take his innumerable pictures. It is sad to know that this magnificent edifice is not to be seen any more,” says photographer K R Vinayan, who has made a pictorial book on Cinema Ghar.Married to Fazila, a Bohra Muslim from the city’s Hussaini Alam area, the artist remained close to Hyderabad. “He used to make surprise appearances in the streets of Hyderabad walking bare-footed; have a cup of an Irani chai at a street corner café in Secunderabad and take a stroll on the Tank Bund on the banks of Hussainsagar. Hyderabad was like his second home,” Mir Ayoob Ali Khan, a senior journalist, said. In 2006, when Husain received death threats in Mumbai, he considered shifting base to Hyderabad. “But he moved to Qatar for reasons known to him, and from there to London, where he passed away,” Khan said. Writer Anju Poddar, who was a close friend of Husain, also expressed regrets that the museum has been razed to rubble.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mfhusains-legacy-in-hyderabad-now-reduced-to-rubble-101613456039368.html

Here is what we know about the court proceedings in the matter:• “People in India have grave apprehensions about the loss of privacy. You may be a $2-3 trillion company, but people value their privacy more than that. And it is our duty to protect people’s privacy,” the court observed.• The court cited some reports to highlight concerns people had about their privacy. “You better clarify all this. People think that when ‘A’ messages ‘B’ and ‘B’ messages ‘C’, the whole thing is read by the Facebook,” the bench told the lawyers for the tech firms, issuing notices to them.• In January, WhatsApp renewed its terms of service and privacy policy, which were to initially come into effect on February 8, but have since been deferred to May 15. • The company said it will share details about users’ conversations with business accounts, and that accepting these terms were mandatory. Also Read | SC tells WhatsApp to give undertaking on data privacy• Anyone not agreeing to the terms will need to delete their accounts, the company said at the time, triggering a seeming shift by many to rivals such as Telegram and Signal. • WhatsApp and Facebook sought to argue that the apprehension over the privacy policy was a “red herring”.• The Union government, represented by solicitor general Tushar Mehta, urged the top court to scrutinise the 2021 policy instead of waiting for a high court to decide. • “Right to privacy is a fundamental right and they (WhatsApp and Facebook) must protect Indians’ rights. They cannot share data of Indians. They cannot compromise with the privacy right of Indians,” Mehta submitted. • Appearing for petitioner Karmanya Singh Sareen, senior lawyer Shyam Divan questioned WhatsApp over lowering the privacy standards. • He pointed out that since WhatsApp had deferred its new policy till May 15, the Supreme Court should decide its validity before that. • Senior advocates Kapil Sibal, Arvind Datar, Mukul Rohatgi, and Sidharth Luthra, who appeared for WhatsApp and Facebook, sought to emphasise that the social media entities were functioning within the bounds of the Indian laws.• During a hearing on Friday, the apex court shot down submissions by WhatsApp and its parent company Facebook that the apex court did not require to examine the 2021 privacy policy since the Delhi High Court was hearing a separate bunch of challenges to the same policy. • The bench took note that a previous petition raising similar issues regarding the 2016 privacy policy of WhatsApp was pending before a Constitution bench, and commented that it was not appropriate for a high court to deal with the issues that were already pending before the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-pulls-up-fb-whatsapp-over-privacy-key-takeaways-from-proceedings-101613451475124.html

16-02-2021||India||Third Scorpene class submarine delivered to Indian Navy||The Mazagaon Dock Limited (MDL) on Monday delivered the third Scorpene-class submarine to the navy after two years of sea trials. The submarine was launched in January 2018 for sea trials and will be commissioned as INS Karanj, said a naval officer.MDL chairman and managing director Vice Admiral Narayan Prasad (retired) and Rear Admiral B Sivakumar, Western Naval Command’s chief of staff officer (technical), signed the acceptance document.INS Karanj is India’s third of the six Scorpene-class submarines with superior stealth and combat capabilities. The diesel-electric attack submarine has been built under MDL’s Project-75 in collaboration with a French firm.Also Read | INS Viraat’s dismantling to be kept on hold, says Supreme Court to ownerThe first such submarine INS Kalvari was launched in October 2015 and commissioned in December 2017, five years behind the schedule. The second, INS Khanderi, was launched in January 2017 for sea trials and commissioned in September 2019. INS Vela was launched in May 2019 and is undergoing sea trials. INS Vagir was launched in November 2020 and is also undergoing sea trials. The sixth submarine INS Vagsheer is at the stage of outfitting.Scorpene submarines can undertake multifarious missions like anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare as well as intelligence gathering, mine laying, area surveillance, etc.Also Read | Indian military sees threefold increase in women personnel in 6 yearsThey are designed to operate in all theatres, with means provided to ensure interoperability.The state-of-the-art technology utilised for the construction of Scorpene class submarines has ensured superior stealth features such as advanced acoustic silencing techniques, low radiated noise levels, hydro-dynamically optimized shape, and the ability to launch an attack on the enemy using precision-guided weapons. The attack can be mounted with both torpedoes and tube-launched anti-ship missiles, at the same time as underwater or on the surface.The stealth of this strong platform is enhanced by the special attention given to various signatures. These stealth features give it invulnerability, unmatched by most submarines.“Two SSK submarines built by MDL in 1992 and 1994 are still in service after more than 25 years, a clear testimony of MDL’s quality of construction. MDL has also achieved expertise in submarine refits by successfully executing the medium Refit-cum-Upgradation of all the four SSK class submarines of the Indian Navy. It is presently carrying out the Medium Refit and Life Certification of INS Shishumar, the first SSK submarine,” said an MDL statement.“MDL has always been at the forefront of the nation’s progressive indigenous warship building programme. With the construction of the Leander and Godavari class frigates, Khukri class Corvettes, Missile Boats, Delhi and Kolkata class destroyers, Shivalik class Stealth Frigates, the SSK submarines and the Scorpene submarine under its belt, the history of modern day MDL almost maps the history of indigenous warship building in India.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/third-scorpene-class-submarine-delivered-to-indian-navy-101613446494802.html

We will form a department so that we can monitor and study all the glaciers through satellite,” he told news agency ANI.The minister’s statement comes as the toll due to the flash floods in Chamoli following the glacier burst last week has climbed to 58.

They will not attract a punishment as they were not followed by violence. What happened after the tweet? Was there any criminal act after my tweets?" Siddique said on behalf of Ranaut.He said the magistrate's court in suburban Bandra had erred in allowing registration of a FIR against Ranaut on charges including sedition.In October last year, Ranaut and her sister were booked for allegedly promoting enmity between communities through their remarks. The Bandra Police had booked them under Indian Penal Code's (IPC's) sections 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race), 295-A (deliberate acts hurting religious sentiments) and 124-A (sedition) and 34 (common intention).The first information report (FIR) was registered following orders from a magistrate's court in Bandra after Munawwar Ali Sayyad, a casting director and fitness trainer, filed a complaint referring to tweets and other statements of Ranaut and her sister.In an affidavit filed in the high court earlier this month, Sayyad had said that among other things, Ranaut and Rangoli promoted "hatred and contempt, and incited disaffection towards the Maharashtra government," through their tweets.The high court will continue hearing the arguments on February 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kangana-ranaut-seeks-quashing-of-fir-for-sedition-tells-court-her-tweets-did-not-incite-violence-101613445037840.html

On the occasion of Tuesday’s event, an announcement for the beautification of Chittora lake, Shravasti, too is expected.“King Suheldev had fought, defeated and killed the Ghaznavid general Ghazi Saiyyad Salar Masud in a famous battle held on the bank of Chittora lake in Bahraich in 1033. The battle was such that it is said that the whole of Masud’s army got eliminated in it,” a release issued by the UP government read.The complete project will include the installation of an equestrian statue of Maharaja Suheldev and the development of various tourist amenities like a cafeteria, guest house, and a children's park, an official said.Rajbhar community members, who consider Suheldev as their icon, constitute a significant percentage of the Purvanchal population and are regarded as the second politically dominant force to reckon with after the Yadavs in eastern Uttar Pradesh.Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) chief and former UP minister Om Prakash Rajbhar had parted ways with the NDA and distanced himself from an event to pay tributes to Suheldev in Ghazipur ahead of the Lok Sabha polls in 2019, protesting he was not invited for the event well in time.Also Read: UP woman burnt to death by family over interfaith relationship: CopsAfter the Modi government came to power, the government took several steps to popularise Suheldev. In February 2016, BJP chief Amit Shah unveiled a statue of Suheldev and also launched a book on him in Bahraich district near the Indo-Nepal border, where the medieval king enjoys a legendary status.The Modi government earlier released a postal stamp after Suheldev and named a superfast train, ‘The Suheldev Express’. The tri-weekly covers the breadth of India’s most populous state from Ghazipur in Purvanchal to Anand Vihar in Delhi. Suheldev was a brave and extremely religious person who had great respect for saints and Hinduism, BJP leaders said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-lay-foundation-stone-for-king-suheldev-s-statue-in-uttar-pradesh-101613444721341.html

Availability of comprehensive, highly accurate, granular and constantly updated representation of geospatial data will significantly benefit diverse sectors of the economy and will significantly boost innovation in the country and greatly enhance the preparedness of the country for emergency response. The availability of data and modern mapping technologies to Indian companies is also crucial for achieving the vision of AtmaNirbharBharat and a five trillion-dollar economy".The minister highlighted, "With the advent of publicly available geospatial services, a lot of Geospatial data that used to be in the restricted zone are freely and commonly available now and some of the policies/guidelines that used to regulate such information have been rendered obsolete and redundant.""What is readily available globally does not need to be regulated. For Indian entities, there would be complete deregulation with no prior approvals, security clearances, licenses, etc. for acquisition and production of geospatial data and geospatial data services including maps," he added.Vardhan pointed out, "All geospatial data produced using public funds, except classified geospatial data collected by security/law enforcement agencies, will be made accessible for scientific, economic and developmental purposes to all Indian Entities and without any restrictions on their use. Government agencies and others need to collaborate and work towards openlinked geospatial data"."Stakeholders benefitted will include practically every segment of society, from industry to academia to government departments", he emphasized.This is a transformative reform, the Minister added.Speaking on the occasion, Union Minister Jitendra Singh said that the Centre has taken a historic decision to completely deregulate Geospatial Map-making and unshackle the Geospatial sector in India for the first time. He said that the decision is an extension of a series of visionary reforms undertaken in the Space sector. He pointed out that today's announcement heralds the unlocking of geo-mapping from restrictive use to wider use in the interest of nation building and creating an AtmaNirbhar Bharat.Dr Jitendra Singh said, this is one more distinct example of removal of some of the colonial legacies that India was still grappling with and added that deregulation of Map-making is historic in the sense that Geo-Map is now going to be recognised as an instrument for development rather than only a tool for securing the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centres-historic-move-will-lead-to-rs-1-lakh-crore-geo-spatial-economy-vardhan-101613436745351.html
16-02-2021||India||Number Theory: What does mobility data tell us about the state of the economy?||The Indian economy is “on the verge of normality”, if the latest reading of Nomura India Business Resumption Index (NIBRI) were to be taken as an indicator. NIBRI reached 98.1 (provisional value) in the week ending February 14, where 100 signifies pre-pandemic level. It was at 95.9 the week before that.“Since its trough in April last year, NIBRI remained on an uptrend through 2020 that continued into Q1 2021 (NIBRI average: 94.7 from 86.5 in Q4 2020), reflecting fewer new pandemic cases”, said a note from Nomura economists Sonal Varma and Aurodeep Nandi. The note infers improvement in NIBRI as a sign of growing economic momentum, and predicts a 1.5% GDP growth in the quarter ending December 2020 and 2.1% in the March 2021 quarter. To be sure, the latest NIBRI numbers also indicate a moderation in labour participation rate (LPR), which is defined as the share of working age population working of looking for a job. LPR moderated 40.5% in the week ending February 14, compared to 40.9% the week before that.An HT analysis of Google’s community mobility data can complement the economic normalisation story being offered by NIBRI.Google Mobility data has been relatively flat since December 2020While mobility has been increasing continuously, its recovery is relatively slower when compared to NIBRI. To be sure, mobility levels had reached 90% of pre-lockdown values (median value for the day of the week in the January 3, 2020 to February 6, 2020 period) in December 2020 itself. Average monthly value of all movement increased by a large magnitude between September 2020 to December 2020. This trend reversed itself to show a small decline in January 2021 and there has been a smaller increase in the February 2021 (data up to February 9) value. This trend remains the same if mobility on account of residential movement and visits to grocery stores and pharmacies (essential activities) are excluded. The government announced significant relaxations from lockdown related restrictions beginning February 1. Read more: The number theory: Imagining India, 10 years from nowThey included allowing states to determine the size of gatherings, which earlier had a cap of 50% of hall capacity or 200 persons in closed spaces. Cinema halls were allowed to operate at 100% capacity compared to the 50% cap that was imposed when they were allowed to open from October 15. All kinds of exhibition halls, apart from Business to Business exhibition halls that were allowed to open earlier, were allowed to function. Swimming pools were similarly permitted for use of all compared to being restricted to sportspersons earlier. This suggests that the existing marginal deficit in mobility could be a result of self-imposed restrictions rather than official curbs.Restoration of mobility differs across activitiesThe overall mobility index used here – which measures visits to and length of stay at particular place as a percentage of pre-lockdown levels -- is an average of mobility for visits to six kinds of places: retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, parks, transit stations, work and residential. Each of these activities shows different levels of normalisation. Latest retail and recreation mobility index shows the lowest recovery, with activity levels at just 75.2% of the base value. Work related mobility was at 83.9% compared to 90.2% for transit. The relatively muted recovery in work related mobility is in keeping with the weakness in labour markets captured in other high frequency indicators as well. For example, both the manufacturing and services Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) noted a fall in employment in January, even though the pace of job shedding has been moderating.Read more: Number Theory: The data India needs to diagnose the economyGrocery and pharmacy head shows that visits to such places has more than recovered from the base value, with the latest value at 114.6%. Residential mobility continues to go down, suggesting that people are spending less time indoors, although it is still higher than the base value.Work-related movement low in most rich statesVisits to workplaces are farthest from pre-pandemic levels in some of the richest states -- such as Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat and Maharashtra – and the closest to pre-pandemic levels in some of the poorest state, such as Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Assam. However, there are exceptions. Work-related mobility in Chhattisgarh was 82.9% of the baseline, only higher than that in Punjab (81.1) and Delhi (75.9%), among major states. On the other hand, in Karnataka, the mobility levels in February are behind only the four states with the highest mobility levels listed above.Mobility levels not dependent on caseloadAnother interesting aspect of the mobility levels across states is that they do not appear to depend on how the state is faring in managing Covid-19 infections. Active cases per million population in Delhi were 63 on February 9, 6th highest among eighteen major states. But non-essential movement in Delhi in February (until February 9) is the lowest (78.9% of pre-pandemic levels). On the other hand, Kerala had the highest number of active cases per million population on February 9 (1927), but only the eighth lowest mobility level (90.3% of baseline) among major states in February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/number-theory-what-does-mobility-data-tell-us-about-the-state-of-the-economy-101613413925294.html
16-02-2021||India||India justice report| High vacancies, low budgets: what ails social justice delivery||Any overview of the justice delivery system must begin at the fact that several vacancies persist across its four main pillars — judiciary, police, prisons and legal aid systems — as the newly released India Justice Report (IJR) 2020 shows. But this is only the starting point. The report reveals that high vacancies are related to a number of factors from scientific utilisation of resources to budget allocation to training capacities.Let’s take a look at the current situation.According to the report which used 2019-2020 data from various government sources, in eight states there’s only one policeman for over 1,000 people. Out of 18 large and mid-size states, no state meets the benchmark of 20,000 people per subordinate court judge recommended by a Law Commission report. In the judiciary, on average, one in three judges in the High Court and one in four among subordinate judges were yet to be hired. In police, there’s a shortage of 18% constables and 29% officers nationally.In its second edition, the IJR 2020 tracks the rise and fall of each state’s capacity to deliver justice by offering a comparison to their performance recorded in IJR 2019. The report looks at 87 indicators across the four pillars, and creates an index based on a quantitative measurement of budgets, human resources, infrastructure, workload, and diversity across 18 large and medium sized states and seven small states. Thus, what we have is a granular understanding of the improvements and the shortfalls within each state as well as clear discernible trends nationally.Read more: Supreme Court notice to WhatsApp: ‘People value privacy more than money’The 2020 report shows that human resource deficits continue to stubbornly ail the justice system. High vacancy is arguably one of the biggest factors impeding its functioning and even when vacancies are filled they are often done so in junior ranks. As of January 2020, while only three states have constable vacancy above 30% as many as 9 states including Rajasthan, MP, UP and Bihar among others have officer vacancy above 30%. In IJR 2019, this figure stood at 6 states for both constable and officer vacancies above 30%. In the judiciary, we find that vacancies are higher in high courts as compared to subordinate courts; something that has persisted since 2016-17, as both reports indicate.Improve utilisation of fundsAcross judiciary, police and prisons, the lion’s share of all expenditure goes towards salaries leaving little margin for recruiting more personnel. In nearly all the states, the problem of budget inadequacy is juxtaposed with that of underutilisation of available funds. Uttar Pradesh, for instance, utilised less than 15% of its police modernisation fund and had among the lowest expenditure on training per personnel (about ₹3,300), but it recorded vacancies of 24% at the constable level and 40% at the officer level.Read more: Ahead of assembly polls, Sabarimala issue back on radar in KeralaTo be sure, there have been improvements in the justice system across states, in specific parameters. For instance, in Chhattisgarh, the number of officers in prisons rose from what we recorded in the previous report; at least 9 large and mid-sized states and two small states saw vacancies in the District Legal Services Authority secretary post come down to zero; and Jharkhand managed to improve the status of vacancies in 6 out of 8 key personnel positions across all pillars. IJR 2020 also finds that 21 states and Union Territories contributed 50% and above to the state’s legal aid spend as compared to only 16 states/UTs in IJR 2019. This indicates a realization of the need to support legal aid functions within the state.Turn the focus to trainingA well-trained workforce forms the backbone of the justice system. According to Common Cause, one of the civil society groups involved in the making of IJR 2020, between 2012 and 2016 only 6.4% of India’s total police force had undergone training. This means that over 90% deal with the public without any up-to-date training. Nationally, the spend on training is a meagre 1.13% of the total police budget. Without commenting on quality, the IJR finds that in states like Uttar Pradesh, which has hired more than 47,000 constables, there is a severe dearth of training institutes. Taken together, the picture that emerges is a police that remains understaffed and inadequately trained. In 28 states/UTs, a maximum of 1 out of 4 police personnel was trained. Similarly, in legal aid, only 6 states/UTs could train all their panel lawyers.Read more: Ex-CJI Ranjan Gogoi’s remarks on judicial system worrisome: Sharad PawarA serious analysis of the gains we can make by investing in justice delivery compared against the losses accrued by judicial delays, prison overcrowding, poor access to free legal aid and lawlessness might help us quantify the problem. But if it’s reform we’re looking for, a good place to start would be to fill the vacancies focusing on increased diversity.Valay Singh is the project lead of the India Justice Report 2020.

16-02-2021||India||India must set example in climate crisis fight: Bill Gates||Bill Gates, one of the richest men in the world, is focused on changing it. While the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation contributes significantly to funding medical breakthroughs, education, and poverty alleviation, Gates’s new book, How to Avoid a Climate Disaster, has an even larger purpose – to provide a plan to tackle climate change.“Because India’s going to suffer from climate change, it’s very important to set an example. It’s great that Modi came to the Paris event (Mission Innovation 2015). I hope he’s going to come to this big meeting in November in Glasgow, the COP26 (2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference),” Gates said in a video interview.He believes that though India might not be the first to reduce emissions, it can still push richer countries to meet their commitments. “When most people think about climate, they think about making electricity and about passenger cars mostly. They aren’t aware that there are many other sources of CO2 emissions. Electricity, transport, food, buildings and manufacturing are the biggest areas of emissions,” he said, stressing the need for “great innovators, great research, great policies” that will radically change all five of those areas in order to get to the ambitious goal of zero emissions that will stop the temperature from continuing to rise.Read more: Bill Gates-led fund raises another $1 billion to invest in clean techThe Microsoft founder believes innovations are required, especially in areas like the development of better seeds that need less water. “There’s a huge lack of investment in that. The latest Indian budget did increase the government’s R&D {research and development} capacities quite a bit and I see that in things like new seeds or health innovations or some climate related things,” he said, pointing out that climate change means that the south of India will suffer as the number of hot days increase.“Humans don’t thrive in very hot environments. And so India is just going to have to build a lot of air conditioning, which is going to use a lot of electricity, which, if we’re not careful, creates more emissions,” he said. “For the world to be at zero, it means that by 2050, when India’s building new buildings, it’s using green cement and green steel. If the rich countries don’t innovate down this green premium very dramatically then India has a right to say, ‘Hey we’re going to keep providing shelter and electricity and the rich world has to subsidise this if you want it to be green, but if that price is too high then it just won’t happen.’”Read more: ‘We may be back to normal in 2022’: Bill GatesHow will the country battle the endemic corruption that has led to the loss of green cover, and in some areas to consequent annual flooding?“One of the areas that India is leading is in digitizing a lot of activities. Over time, some of these government expenditures will be more visible. Now I do have some hope for that,” said Gates, who believes rich countries will ban the sale of gasoline-fuelled cars within the next 15 years.“You know China’s pushing these things partly because they don’t like local pollution. It did a good job in cleaning up the air in its cities. Now, it’s India’s turn. India and Pakistan have some of the most polluted air of any cities in the world. If you would look at the ranking, there are a few African cities in there but there are a lot of Indian cities,” he said, highlighting polluting coal plants.“It’s another reason you want to move cars to electric and you want to move power generation away from coal. Coal has a lot of health effects. Coal kills a lot of people. Not just in mining accidents. And yet, India has a lot of domestic coal,” he said, admitting that the necessary transition will be fraught as there are a “lot of jobs in coal”.Read more: 'Crazy and evil': Bill Gates surprised by pandemic conspiracies about himStill, Gates is certain India will pass more environmental regulations around local pollution. “India starts at a very tough situation in terms of its rivers and the amount of so-called faecal sludge management. But the government’s put a lot of energy in that, a lot of budget into things like ‘OK, how long will it take to clean up the Ganges?’ That’s how the government slowly but surely generally does things better. Now in the case of climate change, if slowly means a hundred years, we’ve got a problem,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-must-set-example-in-climate-crisis-fight-gates-101613422213615.html

16-02-2021||India||Karnataka police yet to file charge-sheets in 3 sedition cases filed a year ago||A year after filing sedition cases against a researcher, the mother of an 11-year-old school student and a 20-year-old activist, the Karnataka Police is yet to submit a charge sheet in any of the cases, officials and lawyers said.The police officers in charge of these cases said they were still evaluating evidence and seeking legal opinion on the cases, which has caused the delay in filing of charge sheets. The police have, however, filed charge sheets against three Kashmiri students arrested for circulating a video chanting pro-Pakistan slogans.Data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) shows that Karnataka registered the maximum number of sedition cases, 22, by any state in 2019 and was able to file a charge-sheet in 13 . This marked an eleven-fold increase in sedition cases registered in Karnataka in 2019 compared to 2018.These four cases become high-profile because of the accused, who, are now out on bail and have moved away from the limelight.The defendants in two of these three cases — 19-year-old activist Amulya Leona and mother of the 11-year-old, Najbunnisa — spent weeks behind the bars. As per the rules, in a sedition case, a charge-sheet should be filed within 90 days.‘Vasudeva Kutumbakam’On February 20, 2020, Leona was arrested on sedition charges for shouting “Pakistan zindabad” during a protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA, in Bengaluru. She spent 110 days in jail before getting bail.“Vasudeva Kutumbakam (the world is one family) is engraved at the entrance hall of the Parliament of India. Didn’t Amulya say the same thing?” asked Amulya’s lawyer BT Venkatesh.He said that before delivering her speech, Leona posted on her social media accounts the following message: “Hindustan zindabad, Pakistan zindabad, Bangladesh zindabad, Sri Lanka zindabad, Nepal zindabad, Afghanistan zindabad, China zindabad, Nepal zindabad... whichever country it may be, zindabad to all countries.”Leona and her family refused to speak on the case and a fellow activist said she has moved with her mother to another part of the state. Deputy commissioner of police, Bangalore west, Sanjeev M Patil, who is in charge of the investigation, didn’t answer calls. However, another police officer said on condition of anonymity that the department was evaluating he evidence.Not child’s playIn north Karnataka’s Bidar, more than a year (January 26, 2020) after a short clip of a children’s play in a school led to a sedition case, police are still examining electronic evidence.The school’s headmistress and a student’s mother were arrested on charges of sedition. The play was staged on January 21, 2020, and a video of the play went viral on social media a few days later. The mother of a student in the play and the school’s headmistress were arrested 10 days later.In the video, a student can be heard saying: “The government is telling Muslims to leave India and go... Amma, I’m scared. Where do we go, leaving our home, our country and our livelihood?”Once the video went viral, a member of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) filed a police complaint.“...for more than a week, about 85 students (aged between 9-12) of our school were questioned for more than five hours a day. The kids who were in the play had their pictures clicked,” said Thouseef Madikeri, CEO of Shaheen Educational Institute that runs the school.After spending 14 days in jail, the mother of the child was granted bail. “What the children have expressed is that they will have to leave the country if they don’t produce certain documents and except that, there is nothing to show that the student committed the offence of sedition...,” the judge at the lower court said.Bidar superintendent of police, Nagesh DL, said the investigations are still under way. He said a final call on the case will be taken only after the police receive legal advice.A PlacardMysuru-based researcher, Maridevaiah Shivanna left his family for over a month after a sedition case was slapped against him on January 9, 2020 — for organising a protest, where a person unknown to him held a placard reading “Free Kashmir.”“I didn’t know who she was. I don’t know where she came from. After the violence (on January 5, 2020) at JNU, we ...protested at the main gate,” he said.It was only a day later that Maridevaiah realised that the police were looking for him. “Since the students were being arrested in Bengaluru without bail, I was told by my family to leave the city...The thought that I had to abscond from my house for no fault of mine, it had taken a toll on me,” he said.Nalini, an alumna of the University of Mysore who held the poster, too was booked for sedition. She was unavailable for comment.When asked about the status of the case, a senior Mysuru police officer who asked not to be named said “permission for prosecution sanction” is awaited, which is mandatory for cases such as sedition. He said that charge-sheet will be filed after obtaining sanction.While the police are yet to file a charge-sheet in this case, Bidar police have filed one against three Kashmiri students arrested on charges of sedition. On 15 February 2020, the three students of KLE Institute of Technology were arrested on charges of sedition, for allegedly circulating a video of themselves chanting pro-Pakistan slogans.They spent 111 days in jail before the court granted them bail since the police failed to file a charge sheet within the stipulated 90 days. Hubbali police filed a charge-sheet in the case only on June 4, 2020.Lapse in supervision, says former police chief“If the police department is not able to file charge-sheets or doesn’t have the intent to file charge-sheets, what is the implied meaning? When you lodge an FIR in a spur of the moment, to send a loud message or to deter the accused or because of the political consideration, (and) when there isn’t enough material to prosecute, police often keep quiet,” said ST Ramesh, former director general and inspector general of Karnataka police. He added that the delay showed a clear lapse in supervision, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-police-yet-to-file-charge-sheets-in-3-sedition-cases-filed-a-year-ago-101613421766494.html
16-02-2021||India||Toolkit was only to educate people on farm stir: Nikita Jacob||Advocate and activist Nikita Jacob, who faces arrest for her alleged role in preparing a toolkit detailing digital support for farmers’ protests, has denied sharing any information with Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, while underscoring that the document was simply an “informational pack” and was not intended to incite violence.In her statement to the Delhi Police, which HT has seen, Jacob has accepted that she played a role in mustering support for the farmers’ protests on the social media and shared details with activists globally, but emphasised that there was nothing illegal about what she did.“The information contained in the toolkit does not in any manner incite riots or violence and is simply an information pack with information from various sources... No weapons, no violence, no mention of anything remotely violent in the toolkit or any of our communication,” the 30-year-old lawyer from Mumbai asserted.The toolkit, she said, sought to only educate those interested to learn more about the broader perspective involved in relation to the farmers’ current situation and fears, besides other public information and resource links for similar campaigns.Jacob, who is a volunteer of global environmental movement Extinction Rebellion (XR), told the Delhi Police that to prepare an informational kit for an ongoing movement was “natural and perfectly legal in a democracy guarded by a constitution as strong as ours.”Facing a non-bailable warrant (NBW) issued by a Delhi court, Jacob said the toolkit was being prepared by XR India volunteers for presenting the whole picture with a simple breakdown for an international audience. She told the police that the draft toolkit was shared on the XR WhatsApp group for comments and feedback before it was finalised on January 22, and circulated within XR networks whilst it primarily focused on the farm issues, the right to express dissent and the larger democracy.Jacob’s statement read that one of the XR volunteer partners, Fridays for Future, shared the toolkit with Greta Thunberg, seeking her solidarity with the protesting farmers in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/toolkit-was-only-to-educate-people-on-farm-stir-nikita-jacob-101613421378156.html
16-02-2021||India||Were informed about activist Disha Ravi's arrest later, says Bengaluru police||Senior officers in Bengaluru police on Monday said that they were informed about the arrest of 22-year-old Disha Ravi only after all procedures of the arrest were completed.HT spoke with three senior officers in the city, who said on condition of anonymity that Delhi police informed the local police about the arrest through officials of Karnataka cyber-crime cell, after the arrest was made.While addressing media in New Delhi, Prem Nath, Joint Commissioner, Cyber Cell, Delhi Police said that Disha Ravi was arrested in the presence of her mother and the Station House Officer from the local police station. He claimed that all procedures were followed.However, according to the city police, the information was passed on to the local police station and no officer was present during the arrest.The operation of Delhi police has come under scrutiny by legal experts and activists.Senior advocate Vikas Pahwa cited the Criminal Procedure Code to state that when an accused is arrested in another state, it is incumbent upon the arresting police to take assistance of the local police and to produce the accused with the case diaries, before a nearest magistrate for a decision on custody and remand. “Criminal Justice System requires every arrest to be judicially scrutinised at all levels. In this case, the Delhi Police has circumvented the law and violated the fundamental rights of the accused by depriving her even of legal assistance,” said Pahwa.Read more: Disha Ravi, Nikita Jacob and Shantanu created toolkit, say Delhi PoliceBengaluru-based lawyer Vinay Srinivasa said that a group of city lawyers submitted a memorandum to the police, seeking explanation on the procedural lapses and the follow-up action by the police.“According to the guidelines provided by the Delhi High Court following a 2018 case, an officer should inform the concerned local police station of the purpose of his visit on arrival; the arrested person must be given an opportunity to consult his lawyer before he/she is taken out of state; and the police officer must visit the local police station make an entry in the daily diary specifying the name and address of the person(s) being taken out of the state. Delhi police have violated all these HC guidelines,” added Srinivasa.But some believe it hasn’t violated any norms.Former additional solicitor general and senior advocate Sidharth Luthra said that in a case of arrest without a warrant, the fundamental requirement is to produce an accused before a judge within 24 hours in keeping with Article 22 of Constitution.“A 2014 judgment by the Delhi high court in Sat Prakash’s case has also clarified this position in law. Besides, if there is a procedural irregularity in making an arrest, a subsequent order of remand can cure it as per the legal provisions,” he added.Criminal lawyer MS Khan said: “There is no illegality or infirmity in the Delhi Police arresting Disha Ravi from Bengaluru and producing her before a magistrate within 24 hours.” The advocate added that once an accused is produced before a magistrate, the judicial officer can allow custodial interrogation for a maximum period of 15 days if there is adequate reason.Read more: Greta toolkit: After Disha Ravi, arrest warrants against Nikita Jacob, ShantanuFollowing the arrest, NGO Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Reforms (CJAR) issued a statement that Disha should have been produced before the competent court in Bengaluru for obtaining transit remand since she is being moved between states.“She was instead produced before the Duty Magistrate in Patiala House Court in Delhi – by no means the “nearest magistrate” as required by clause (2) of Article 22. She also did not have an opportunity to seek legal counsel nor was one provided to her, in breach of clause (1) of Article 22,” read a statement from CJAR.Disha was provided a legal aid lawyer before the Delhi court when she was sent to police custody for five days.The statement further added that the actions of Delhi police have made a complete mockery of the “procedure established by law” in depriving Disha Ravi of her right to life and liberty. “Such illegal actions by the Delhi Police would amount to kidnapping under the pretense of law.”“Disha was arrested without a warrant from the court since the FIR registered in this case disclosed cognisable offences. All procedures under the CrPC were followed and she was produced before the court of competent jurisdiction in Delhi within 24 hours,” said a Delhi Police officer on the condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-allege-lapses-demand-explanation-for-activist-s-arrest-101613420872783.html

It condemns the arrest of young environmental activist Disha Ravi without due procedures being followed. SKM demands her immediate release.”The group said that environmentalists like Ravi were aware of farmers’ issues. “India’s young environmentalists do understand and appreciate that unviable farming leads to unsustainable farming too...”On Saturday, Delhi police’s cyber crime unit arrested 22-year-old climate activist Disha Rai from her house in Bengaluru for allegedly sharing on social media the toolkit related to the farmers’ protest and brought her to Delhi.“...It is this inter-linkage between viability and sustainability that activists like Disha Ravi have understood in their extension of support for the farmers’ protests... Only those who do not understand the issues involved here will feign surprise at why people like Disha Ravi are supporting the movement,” the SKM added.Protesters also condemned Ravi’s arrest. Navkiran Natt, 29, a student-activist at Tikri border, said: “This is another attempt of the government to weaken the solidarity farmers’ protest has been receiving...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disha-ravi-s-arrest-attempt-to-weaken-our-movement-say-farm-unions-101613421229155.html
16-02-2021||India||2nd dose of Covid vaccines: 51% of those who got shots in first 2 days covered||Just over half the health care workers in the city who received a shot of the coronavirus vaccine during the first two days of the inoculation drive have returned for their second shot in the two days since the state government began administering the final dose of the jab, district data shows. So far, 4,047, or 51.1%, of health care workers have received the second dose of the vaccine, including 2,191 who turned up to get the second dose of the vaccine on Monday.Beneficiaries who received a dose of the coronavirus vaccine on January 16, when the nationwide inoculation programme kicked off, were eligible to get the second dose on Saturday. While 1,856 health care workers received the second shot on Saturday, experts said they hoped the turnout would significantly increase after the weekend.Read more: Amid rise in Covid-19 cases, Maharashtra minister looks at ‘3T formula’Both the vaccines being administered in the country, Covaxin and Covishield, require two doses be given four to six weeks apart, as per the national drug regulator. However, some data suggests that the vaccine by Oxford/Astrazeneca (whose Indian variant is covishield) has better efficacy if administered after 12 weeks.“There are a lot of messages going around among doctors and other healthcare workers that the immune response is better when the doses are given 12 weeks apart. This may be a reason many might want to wait till the six week cut-off to get the shot,” Dr Suneela Garg, professor of community medicine at Maulana Azad Medical College had told HT on Saturday.Meanwhile on Monday, nearly 15,000 people in Delhi received the first dose of the vaccines, across 265 centres. This puts the overall vaccine coverage — proportion of people who received the vaccines among those targeted — in Delhi at 56.4%. Government data shows that over half the people who were given the shots on Monday were front line workers, while the rest were those classified as “front line workers”.Read more: Recoveries from Covid-19 in Delhi exceed cases logged during the week“The number of health care workers coming to the centres is slowly going down, with more and more frontline workers, especially police personnel, coming to get the shots. We have asked the healthcare workers who haven’t received the vaccine yet to do so at the earliest because we have to end the drive for them on February 20,” said a senior district official.The Centre has set a February 20 deadline to vaccinate all health care workers who want to get the shots, and March 1 for frontline workers. An additional five days will be allowed for “mop-up” activity to immunise anyone who is left out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2nd-dose-of-covid-vaccines-51-of-those-who-got-shots-in-first-2-days-covered-101613418786358.html
16-02-2021||India||Activists say toolkits aren't the problem, 'objectives should be constitutional'||The arrest of 22-year-old Disha Ravi in connection with editing a toolkit that offered suggestions on how to support the farmers’ protests has thrown light on a tool often employed by the non-profit sector, advocacy groups, and even the United Nations to carry out digital activism over a range of issues.Activists from various organisations said they routinely used toolkits or resource kits, which were a standard operating procedure for advocacy and media outreach and did not constitute a crime as it was entirely up to people whether or not to follow what toolkits suggested.“The toolkit is the means to get a campaign going. It is all about social media as that is the medium of the young… These paperless campaigns in the digital format grab attention. So if you are trying to warn people not to use toolkits that is absurd,” said Goa Foundation director Claude Alvares who has been part of the Save Mollem campaign which started after the National Board for Wildlife approved the felling of 59,000 trees for development projects in and around the Bhagwan Mahaveer Wildlife Sanctuary and Mollem National Park last April.Goa Foundation also filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the High Court challenging these approvals.The campaign which began in June was conducted over several months — taking the shape of Facebook Live events, citizens’ letters to the authorities, signature campaigns, Twitter storms, artworks and performances, demonstrations and even a weekly documentary series on the wildlife of Goa.Toolkits were also created in the duration of the campaign, including one for citizens, which provided an overview of the proposed projects, a primer on the laws that governed protected forests, the official email addresses of the authorities to whom citizens could write to, and pointers on what their letters needed to address.Also Read: Effort to mislead global community- Pakistan on visit of foreign envoys to J-KAccording to Divya Narayanan, the campaigns director at Jhatkaa.Org, a digital platform to drive public engagement and volunteer movements on a range of issues, creating a toolkit is standard practice for running campaigns, especially social media campaigns.“A toolkit for a digital campaign is essentially a document that has information about the issue or a campaign and lays out ways in which people can lend support to the movement and solidarity online and offline. Social media posts are pre-drafted by campaigners/experts so that it’s easy for people to amplify the issue online without having to create content from scratch.”Also Read: Bengaluru counters Delhi Police on Disha Ravi’s arrest, say they were told laterNarayanan said that toolkits are often created in collaboration with civil society groups that come together for an issue. “We have co-created sample tweets, and other social media content with citizen groups to amplify issues like urban deforestation or air pollution in India,” she said.Meera Sanghamitra, an activist with the National Alliance of People’s Movements, said that movements utilised pamphlets and letters much before toolkits as a way to broaden their outreach and spread awareness over social justice issues.“Toolkits are a compilation of material available in the public domain. Oftentimes, everyone may not have the wherewithal to find the material and understand the issue, which is why campaigns and activists do the labour of putting together the material in an easy and accessible way, which is fact-based and verified,” Sanghamitra said.Also Read: In Kerala, protests against backdoor appointments in govt jobs intensifies“This criminalisation of ‘toolkit solidarity’ is outlandish. Primarily, it’s a clampdown on any form of solidarity between people,” she added.Asmita Ghosh, a communications specialist who has worked with both national and international non-governmental organisations over campaigns pertaining to gender and access to education, among other things, said that people are free not to comply with the asks in a toolkit if it does not speak to their concerns or align with their own values.“There can be a number of ways that a person can take part in any kind of activism. A social media toolkit may give sample posts or tweets, and this doesn’t mean that the integrity of a movement is compromised because, in today’s busy world, we campaigners need to make as easy for people to understand an issue and take action about it. Once they read and decide that they agree with what the message of the campaign is, we make it easier for them to take action by giving them sample tweets or Facebook posts that they can copy-paste to show their support for a movement,” Ghosh said.However, toolkits can also be used to spread disinformation and thus it is incumbent on a reader to be mindful of whether the toolkit is seeking participation in constitutional objectives, said Internet Freedom Foundation executive director Apar Gupta, who was one of the members of the Save the Internet campaign conducted some years ago on the issue of net neutrality.“It’s the objectives which define the desirability of a toolkit. For instance, if it’s towards a goal of climate justice or supporting the rights of farmers to protest, these are all constitutional objectives. If, on the other hand, a toolkit is advocating a high degree of disinformation or trying to create a fissure within society, then it’s not a goal that is not desirable for the proper functioning of a society,” Gupta said.Toolkits help unify the message which is necessary for any kind of amplification over social media platforms on account of their algorithms, Gupta added.“A social media platform prizes a certain level of conversation for it to then become visible to people who are not part of that conversation. It is important to unify in certain core ways through the use of hashtags, for instance, for the platform’s algorithm to prioritise it. If people tweet above a certain volume, it shows as a trend on Twitter, which then feeds the larger media ecology in which people can comment and participate in conversations… [and thus] become visible to constituencies which you want to sensitise to the cause you are espousing. In fact, the United Nations itself also communicates through toolkits that it has built around a range of issues like adolescent health care, access to education,” Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/activists-say-toolkits-aren-t-the-problem-objectives-should-be-constitutional-101613416595416.html
16-02-2021||India||Spam, scam calls and texts on govt radar||The Union government is planning a crackdown on spam and financial frauds that are perpetrated over phone calls and text messages, the communications ministry said in a statement on Monday, announcing work on a new platform to report unsolicited calls and messages and a new Data Intelligence Unit that will help coordinate between law enforcement agencies, banks and service providers.The announcement was made after Union minister for communications Ravi Shankar Prasad held a meeting on Monday to address rising consumer complaints that range from unsolicited text messages and calls to serious financial frauds through Vishing – a strategy in which suspects make calls pretending to be bank officials to access privileged information as passwords and account details.“In the meeting, the minister directed the officials to take strict action against erring telemarketers and individuals involved in harassment of telecom subscribers... Further, the minster observed that telecom resources are also being used to carry out financial frauds and dupe the common man of his hard-earned money. Clear directions were issued to the officials to take strict and tangible action to stop such activities immediately,” the ministry said in a statement.Read more: Centre issues fresh guidelines for offices. Here’s what you need to knowThe problem of Vishing has become so acute that the government is considering curtailing telecom operations in Jharkhand’s Jamtara and Haryana’s Mewat, two regions that have become hotspots from where such scams are being carried out, an official said, asking not to be named.India is among countries hit hardest by spam calls and messages. Caller ID service application Truecaller said Indians were, among people of 20 countries, the ninth most-affected, being targeted with close to 17 spam calls per month last year. While the overall number of spam calls decreased, Truecaller said in its Insights report, the number of scam communications jumped.Read more: SC sends notice to Twitter, Centre on regulating 'fake and seditious' content“Based on community feedback and internal reports, we have noticed a very particular type of scam in India that seems to gain traction each year. We are talking, of course, about KYC and OTP related scams... The scammers try to hook unsuspecting people using either phone calls or SMS and the tactic is always the same: they will try to get you to give up sensitive information about your financials or force you to you reveal a secret OTP with the ultimate aim of extracting money from your bank accounts or digital wallets,” it said.People in India can sign up for a Do Not Disturb (DND) registry that telemarketers need to take into account, but a lack of enforcement has meant that the problem of spam persists nonetheless. “The issue is not something which is very new,” an official aware of the plans said, asking not to be named. “There are couple of issues linked with it. One is unsolicited calls and messages even though there are TRAI guidelines. Those registered for DND also get these calls. This is a nuisance created by registered telemarketers.”Read more: Centre deregulates geospatial data and map-making in IndiaThe official added that there are certain unregistered people who also make such calls and need to be kept in check. “The other aspect is financial frauds,” the official added. “Such a nuisance is being created as people are misusing the telecom resource.” The official pointed out that recently, Jamtara and Mewat have become hotspots from where frauds are being carried out. “The minister has sought a technical solution. A subscriber should be able to register a complaint and it has to be investigated.”The Digital Intelligence Unit (DIU) will act as a nodal agency. “The DIU will coordinate with various LEAs (law enforcement agencies), financial institutions and telecom service providers in investigating any fraudulent activity involving telecom resources,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spam-scam-calls-and-texts-on-govt-radar-101613416117659.html
16-02-2021||India||Supreme Court notice to WhatsApp: ‘People value privacy more than money’||The Supreme Court on Monday told WhatsApp and Facebook that Indians valued their privacy more than the trillions of dollars the social media firms were worth, even as the companies sought to argue that the apprehension over a contentious new privacy policy was a “red herring”.A top court bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, decided to examine WhatsApp 2021 privacy policy by the messaging service and issued notices, saying the social messaging app needed to disclose the kind of user data that would be shared with other companies under its new policy.“People in India have grave apprehensions about loss of privacy. You may be a $2-3 trillion company, but people value their privacy more than that. And it is our duty to protect people’s privacy,” observed the bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.Read more: ‘If A messages B…’: Supreme Court tells WhatsApp to give undertaking on data privacyIn January, WhatsApp renewed its terms of service and privacy policy, which were to initially come into effect on February 8, but have since been deferred to May 15. The company said it will share details about users’ conversations with business accounts, and that accepting these terms were mandatory. Anyone not agreeing to the terms will need to delete their accounts, the company said at the time, triggering a seeming shift by many to rivals such as Telegram and Signal.During a hearing on Friday, the apex court shot down submissions by WhatsApp and its parent company Facebook that the apex court did not require to examine the 2021 privacy policy since the Delhi HC was hearing a separate bunch of challenges to the same policy.The bench took note that a previous petition raising similar issues regarding the 2016 privacy policy of WhatsApp was pending before a Constitution bench, and commented that it was not appropriate for a high court to deal with the issues that were already pending before the Supreme Court.Read more: Delhi high court seeks Centre's stand on plea against new WhatsApp privacy policyThe Union government urged the top court to scrutinise the 2021 policy instead of waiting for a high court to decide. “Right to privacy is a fundamental right and they (WhatsApp and Facebook) must protect Indians’ rights. They cannot share data of Indians. They cannot compromise with the privacy right of Indians,” Mehta submitted. Appearing for petitioner Karmanya Singh Sareen, senior lawyer Shyam Divan questioned WhatsApp over lowering the privacy standards. He pointed out that since WhatsApp had deferred its new policy till May 15, the SC should decide its validity before that. However, senior advocates Kapil Sibal, Arvind Datar, Mukul Rohatgi and Sidharth Luthra, who appeared for WhatsApp and Facebook, sought to emphasise that the social media entities were functioning within the bounds of the Indian laws. “This [2021] policy is applicable for the rest of the world, including India, except Europe because Europe has a specific law. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to these 27 countries in Europe and thus, there is a different policy. Once India also has a law in this regard, we will change accordingly,” Sibal and Datar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-notice-to-whatsapp-people-value-privacy-more-than-money-101613415842215.html
16-02-2021||India||Cops claim man mentioned in toolkit associated with ISI||The Delhi Police on Monday said they were probing how the name of Pieter Friedrich, who they claimed was associated with a module of the Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), figured in the toolkit that was tweeted by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg and is now being probed in connection with the violence during the January 26 farmers’ tractor rally.The police said the document aimed to spread misinformation, tarnish India’s image, and incite unrest.At a press briefing on Monday, police told reporters that the document that was tweeted and later withdrawn by Thunberg mentioned the name of Friedrich, who has been on the radar of the security agencies since late 2006 when he was associated with one Bhajan Singh Bhinder alias Iqbal Chaudhary, a leading proponent of the K2 (Kashmir-Khalistan) desk of ISI.Thunberg later posted an updated document.On Monday, an account that ostensibly belonged to Friedrich, tweeted: “‘Delhi Police on Monday unearthed the role of pro-Pakistan and Khalistan sympathiser Pieter Friedrich.’ For the record, not only do I not support Khalistan, but the Khalistan movement today appears to nothing more than a psy-ops project of the Modi regime.”On Saturday, Delhi Police’s cyber crime unit arrested 22-year-old climate activist Disha Rai from her home in Bengaluru for allegedly working on the toolkit related to the farmers’ protest, and brought her to Delhi.Top opposition leaders protested Ravi’s arrest, with some leaders directly accusing the Union government for muzzling dissent. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi quoted Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s famous couplet, “Bol ke lab azad hain tere...” to say that “Tell them that the truth is alive till now. They (the government) are scared, not the country. India won’t be silenced.”Activists from various organisations said creating a toolkit was standard operating procedure for advocacy and media outreach, and did not constitute a crime as it was entirely up to people whether or not to follow what toolkits suggested.“If you see the toolkit, it is a very carefully crafted document. It has sections on what hashtags to trend on a particular day, what action has to be taken, who is to be tagged, and who is to be followed. In the section - ‘ who is to be followed’ - there are certain names of established media houses, reputed fact-checkers, some NGOs and among those you’ll find one very incongruous looking name – Peter Friedrich,” DCP Manishi Chandra of the special cell claimed.“Bhinder’s name was also associated with arms and drugs smuggling,” he said, adding that they will investigate why Friedrich’s name was mentioned in the toolkit in the list of people who should be followed online.The police said that they were also probing if Disha Ravi and others contacted Friedrich through Mo Dhaliwal, the founder of Poetic Justice Foundation.Deputy commissioner of police (cyber cell) Anyesh Roy said the toolkit is not a static document but a dynamic one. “It has a large number of hyperlinks. They are links to various Google drives, Google docs and websites. One of the important websites is askindiawhy.com. This website has a lot of pro-Khalistan content,” Roy said.He said the document in itself has an action plan. “The toolkit was a private document to be shared among a limited number of people who would then influence public opinion. Having global icons to follow it, was to propagate it further. False narrative and pro-Khalistani propaganda was also to be propagated through this.”Activists condemned the action.“A toolkit is the most ordinary and commonplace of resources...we believe Disha Ravi and youngsters like her ought to be celebrated, not harassed and demonised,” said environmental activist G Sundarajan in Chennai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-named-in-toolkit-linked-to-isi-cops-101613415291225.html
16-02-2021||India||UP woman burnt to death by family over interfaith relationship: Cops||A Hindu woman was allegedly burnt to death by her family in Sant Kabir Nagar district in eastern Uttar Pradesh for being in a relationship with a Muslim man, police said on Monday, announcing the arrest of the victim’s father, brother and two other relatives, who hired a contract killer for the murder.Police officials said the family members have confessed to the crime, and a hunt was on for the contract killer who was purportedly paid ₹1.5 lakh to murder the 28-year-old woman, whose burnt body was discovered on February 4. The woman is believed to have been killed the previous night.Superintendent of police (SP) of Sant Kabir Nagar, Kaustubh, said the woman’s father, brother, brother-in-law and a fourth relative, have been arrested. During the course of interrogation, the father, a retired armyman, said that his daughter was in a relationship with a married Muslim man, the officer said. His daughter eloped on one occasion but returned and continued with the relationship despite the family’s objections, the father told police, according to the officer’s statement to reporters.Police recovered a container in which petrol was stored and a motorcycle that was allegedly used in the killing were also recovered, they added. The half-burnt body of the woman was first discovered at Jigina village under Dhanghata police station limits on February 4. The identity of the woman could not be ascertained at the time, police said, adding that several teams were formed to probe the case.With the help of the local police, surveillance, CCTV footage, a field unit and a dog squad, the body was identified as that of a woman of Jitwarpur village under Belghat police station limits in the neighbouring Gorakhpur district, the SP said. The father of the victim was then arrested.During interrogation, the father purportedly told police that he and his son-in-law hired a contract killer and paid him ₹1.50 lakh. On the night of February 3, the man allegedly took his daughter to a deserted spot where the killer and others arrived. When the woman raised an alarm, the accused tied her hands and put a cloth over her mouth, police said.Once she fell unconscious, the accused placed jute bags on her, poured petrol and set her on fire, the SP said. The four men -- identified as Kailash Yadav (father), Ajit Yadav (brother), Satya Prakash Yadav (brother-in-law) and Sitaram Yadav (relative) -- fled. The alleged contract killer was identified as Varun Tiwari and is at large, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-woman-burnt-to-death-by-family-over-interfaith-relationship-cops-101613413802816.html

Many civil surgeons and superintendents of medical colleges claimed that many eligible beneficiaries did not receive SMS on their mobile phones for the second shot of the vaccine today,” said Manoj Kumar, executive director of the State health Society, Bihar.“We have asked the respective facility in-charge to follow-up manually with those who are eligible for the second jab by calling up and reminding them. There is absolutely no hesitancy in taking the second jab,” added Kumar.Among those who did not turn up were some who had taken ill, while others were either on leave or out of station. A minor percentage of HCWs reported that they will take the second jab after a week or so, said Dr Binod Kumar Singh, superintendent of Patna’s Nalanda Medical College Hospital, where 47 out of 59 turned up to take the second dose on Monday.The Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH) reported 92.5% coverage, as 86 out of 93 HCWs eligible took the second dose on Monday, said its superintendent Dr IS Thakur.The Vardhaman Institute of Medical Sciences (VIMS) at Pawapuri in Nalanda reported 54% coverage as against its target of 131 for the second dose.As many as 40 HCWs were vaccinated at Sri Krishna Medical College in Muzaffarpur against, said its superintendent Dr BS Jha. The SKMCH had vaccinated 19 on the first day of the vaccination campaign on January 16.Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical College Hospital in Gaya and Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College Hospital in Bhagalpur reported second-day coverage of 80% and 51%, respectively.Second dose vaccination figures of AIIMS-Patna were not available as its superintendent Dr CM did not respond to phone calls or text message. As many as 100 HCWs had taken the first jab on January 16.Mondays and Thursdays have been earmarked for administering the second shot of vaccine in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/communication-woes-lead-to-low-turnout-for-2nd-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-in-bihar-101613414407570.html
16-02-2021||India||SC relief for journalist Siddique Kappan, gets bail to visit ailing mother||The Supreme Court on Monday allowed jailed journalist Siddique Kappan to travel to Kerala with a police escort to meet his ailing 90-year-old mother and return within five days. During his stay in Kerala, Kappan has been prohibited from giving any interview to any media organization, including social media, and will not be permitted to meet members of the public other than his relatives, doctors and persons connected with his mother’s health.Kappan is currently lodged at Uttar Pradesh’s Mathura jail following his arrest by the state police on October 5 last year while on his way to cover the gang-rape and death of a Dalit girl in Hathras. The police accused him of being an active member of the radical Islamic organization Popular Front of India (PFI).Based on material seized from him, the police charged him under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, and sedition under Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Lately, Kappan is being probed by the Enforcement Directorate over alleged money laundering.An application was moved on behalf of Kappan in a pending petition heard by the Supreme Court by the Kerala Union of Working Journalists (KUWJ). The organization told the top court that Kappan’s mother was on her death bed with doctors having given up hope of her survival. On an earlier date, arrangements were made at Mathura Jail to enable Kappan speak with his mother through videoconferencing. The mother was not in a position to talk.The prayer was opposed by the UP government, which sought time to reply to the application. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the state, said: “The mother (of Kappan) is not as serious as is being projected. It is really unfair for the petitioner to use mother’s ill-health as a ground to visit Kerala. A campaign is going on there at full swing and money is being collected in his name as if he is a martyr. Big posters are out and he will be paraded in public as if he is being penalized for being a freedom fighter.”Mehta requested the Court not to go by the emotional appeal of the petitioner.The three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde said: “This is not fair. We are willing to take the risk. This is the last opportunity for a person to see his mother. We are taking his request on face value and at the moment will consider it as truth. Howsoever a man, he is not likely to lie about his mother’s death . And if so, we will disbelieve him for all times to come in the future.”Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who appeared for KUWJ, told the court that the application raised a humanitarian plea and the state should not stand in the way. “Doctors have given up. No more drugs are being advised for the mother. They say, she may not be alive beyond the next few days.”To balance concerns of the state and the KUWJ, the court ordered: “We consider it appropriate to permit the prisoner, Siddique Kappan to visit his mother and return to the prison at the end of the fifth day after he is allowed to travel.”During this period, he will only see his ailing mother, not give any interview to any media including social media, not meet members of the public (except relatives, doctors or anybody in connection with his mother’s health), and shall be escorted by a team of officers of the Uttar Pradesh police, according to the order by the bench, also comprising justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.Sibal requested privacy when Kappan meets his mother at home. To facilitate this, the bench directed the police escort team to stay guard outside and not go inside the house. The bench indicated that this order “will not prejudice any contentions raised by the solicitor general” with regard to the pending matter filed by KUWJ challenging Kappan’s detention.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-relief-for-kappan-gets-bail-to-visit-ailing-mother-101613413431059.html

Some others, such as West Bengal, Goa, Tamil Nadu and Haryana, started the process on Saturday, which marked 28 days (the required gap between doses) after the first shots were given to people during the nationwide launch on January 16.In most states, the turnout on Monday was tepid, officials said.In West Bengal, only 7,273 people received second doses compared to close to about 15,000 people who received the first dose on January 16Read more: Amid rise in Covid-19 cases, Maharashtra minister looks at ‘3T formula’In Punjab, only four percent of those who received the first dose turned up on Monday. Out of 1,319 health care workers, who were scheduled to take second vaccine dose on Saturday, only 59 could get the doses.“Technical glitches hit the application on first day of second dose. Those who missed their second shot can still take the vaccine anytime between four to six weeks from their first dose” said Punjab’s nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Rajesh Bhaskar.According to officials, the planned sessions for second dose could not be created on the app, which resulted in problems in informing health workers about the timing. “We have informed the health ministry about the problems in the app,” Bhaskar said.In Jharkhand, from among the 3,085 recipients who got their first doses 28 days ago, only 2,405 turned up on Monday.Read more: Communication woes lead to low turnout for 2nd dose of Covid-19 vaccine in BiharIn Bihar, around 67% healthcare workers who were meant to take the second doses turned up. “The low turnout for second dose on the opening day was because of communication issues.

Additional chief secretary, Health and Family Welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said, till 2 pm around 32,000 health workers across Uttar Pradesh were given the second doses. He said 23,620 health workers were given first dose in the first round vaccination drive held on January 16.

But there is too much information, some of it not scientifically proven that it is beneficial to take the second dose with a longer interval beyond 28 days, because of which we haven’t had a lot of people taking the second dose in time,” he said.(With inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cowin-app-hesitancy-slow-down-booster-shot-drive-101613413370986.html

Some structures at a make-shift helipad are also gone. Observations towers, bunkers and shelters are being removed too. It’s part of the disengagement agreement,” said an official cited above.Disengagement between rival soldiers deployed on heights on the north and south banks of Pangong Tso began on February 10. The process will be over by the weekend, said a second official. Senior commanders of the two armies are likely to meet next week to discuss disengagement at other friction points in eastern Ladakh, the official said.PLA is retreating to its base east of Finger 8 on the north bank of Pangong Tso, while the Indian army is moving back to its permanent position near Finger 3. Neither side will patrol the contested areas in between until an agreement is reached through future talks.In a statement in Parliament on February 11, defence minister Rajnath Singh said that structures built by both sides after April 2020 at heights on both banks of the lake will be removed. PLA had set up scores of structures in the Finger Area including bunkers, pillboxes, observation posts and tented camps.Outstanding problems with PLA at Depsang, Hot Springs and Gogra - friction points on the contested border in eastern Ladakh - will be tackled after full disengagement in the Pangong Tso area.The outstanding issues relating to deployment and patrolling at the three friction points will be taken up within 48 hours of pullback of troops in the Pangong Tso area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disengagement-in-eastern-ladakh-s-pangong-tso-in-full-swing-may-be-over-soon-101613404392897.html

Two senior Congress strategists in Delhi corroborated the claims and said an IUML candidate will be backed by the Opposition bloc, UDF.Refuting speculations that the Congress and IUML might enter into an agreement to give Azad a seat from Kerala, national president of IUML Kader Mohideen told HT, “The seat will go to someone from Kerala. There are a lot of youngsters here and our party will select a qualified young man for the seat.”Also Read | ‘Highly productive’: LS Speaker Birla after end of first phase of Budget Session“Our party leaders have decided they won’t give it to any outsider. So, Ghulam Nabi Azad’s matter does not appear in our internal discussions,” Mohideen added.Three Rajya Sabha seats from Kerala will go for elections in April, before the state faces its assembly elections. As elected MLAs vote for Rajya Sabha through the method of proportionate representation, two out of the three seats will go to the ruling LDF and the Congress-led UDF will get just one seat.Two senior Congress strategists and Mohideen said that as per the arrangement the IUML will field a UDF-backed candidate for the Opposition’s seat.“We have a good understanding with the Congress. Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency was our traditional seat. But in 2019, we gave up our claims on that seat for Rahul Gandhi to contest,” Mohideen added.Ghulam Nabi Azad, who retired from the Rajya Sabha on February 15, could not be re-elected from J&K as there is no assembly in the Union Territory. Union home minister Amit Shah has told Parliament that statehood will be restored at an appropriate time.To be sure, Azad too said that he has no inclination to come to Rajya Sabha from Kerala. In an interview to HT, Azad said, “I don’t want to take away a seat from my friends in Kerala.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-ally-iuml-to-get-kerala-rajya-sabhaseat-101613376049567.html
