His condition was stated to be stable after surgery.Whether the explosion was triggered remotely using an IED or it was just some crude bombs that were kept in the bag which exploded when someone kicked it, is what officials are trying to verify.“Samples have been collected from the spot for forensic analysis. While a battery was found on the railway tracks, a piece of wire was found at a distance on the platform,” said an official.Hossain, who is the minister of state for labour in West Bengal, was critically wounded in a blast on Wednesday night when he went to the Nimtita railway station to board a Kolkata-bound train. At least 26 others were injured. Some had their limbs blown off and at least 15 of the victims had to be shifted to Kolkata.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee also pointed towards an IED blast saying: “Those who were with him have claimed that the blast was remotely controlled. Police is investigating so nothing concrete can be said as of now. But prima facie it appears that it was pre-planned,” she said.Officials said that there was hardly any light on the platform at that time. Some of the people who were walking with the minister said that they had spotted the bag which exploded.“It is clear from a video which was taken seconds before the blast that a man walking next to Hossain had alerted the people that there was a bag lying on the way. Seconds after the explosion took place,” said an officer.Banerjee has already ordered a high-level investigation into the incident by three state-run investigation agencies – the Criminal Investigation Department, Special Task Force and Counter Insurgency Force. CID officials have already rushed to the spot and inspected the platform and the railway tracks.While addressing a BJP rally, the party's state president Dilip Ghosh demanded a CBI probe into the bomb attack while other leaders of the party said in Kolkata that the probe should be done by the NIA.Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar has said that the probe should be done by the NIA.“I understand that the state government has formed a Special Investigation Team. But since the offence is under the Explosives Act, a very expert investigation is required. I am sure the National Investigation Agency (NIA), that has the required expertise to probe the matter, should be involved,” said Dhankhar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parts-of-wire-and-battery-found-from-blast-site-in-bengal-minister-stable-101613671713922.html

No decision has been taken in today’s meet. We will hold a meeting again on February 21. We are also consulting with our alliance partner DMK," news agency ANI quoted Narayanasamy as saying after the meeting."The BJP is behind all these things. They are all out to bring down a democratically elected government. This is an attempt to bury democracy," Narayanasamy further said.Soundararajan issued orders for the floor test just hours after taking oath as the new Lieutenant Governor of the poll-bound Union territory, succeeding Kiran Bedi, whose tenure was marred with multiple spats with the chief minister.The Congress-led Puducherry government has fallen into turmoil after four MLAs, including two ministers, resigned from their posts. This has brought down the party’s strength in the 30-member legislative assembly to ten, including the speaker, while its ally DMK has three representatives. The ruling alliance and the Opposition now have 14 members each in the House, just two short of the magic figure of 16.In her orders, Soundararajan, who is also the Telangana governor, said that the government has been reduced to a minority and should prove its strength on the floor of the legislative assembly. The order further stated that the meeting shall be confined to a "single" agenda, "namely whether the government of the incumbent chief minister continues to enjoy the confidence of the House." Voting shall take place by show of hands and the entire proceedings be videographed, as per the official release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/puducherry-floor-test-bjp-trying-to-topple-elected-govt-says-cm-narayanasamy-101613670683333.html

18-02-2021||India||'New laws, ending of J&K's autonomy affect rights of minorities': UN experts||India’s decision to scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and enact new laws could curtail political participation of Muslims and other minorities and lead to potential discrimination in employment and land ownership, two UN human rights experts said on Thursday.The concerns were expressed by Fernand de Varennes, special rapporteur on minority issues, and Ahmed Shaheed, special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, even as a delegation of 24 envoys wound up a two-day visit to Jammu and Kashmir to assess the ground situation.There was no immediate response from Indian officials to the comments by the special rapporteurs who are part of independent fact-finding and monitoring mechanisms of the UN Human Rights Council.In the past, India has bristled at adverse reports by UN special rapporteurs and described them as interference in the country’s internal matters.In a statement issued in Geneva, de Varennes and Shaheed said, “The loss of autonomy and the imposition of direct rule by the Government in New Delhi suggests the people of Jammu and Kashmir no longer have their own government and have lost power to legislate or amend laws in the region to ensure the protection of their rights as minorities.”Also read: ‘Won’t let Covid-19 get better of Mumbai’ - BMC updates norms to tackle pandemicThe experts said the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir was “established with specific autonomy guarantees to respect the ethnic, linguistic and religious identities of its people,” and it was the only Indian state with a Muslim majority.They contended the government had “unilaterally and without consultation revoked the constitutional special status of Jammu and Kashmir” on August 5, 2019, and passed “domicile rules which removed protections given to those from the territory” in May 2020. “Subsequent changes to land laws are further eroding these protections,” they said.They added, “The number of successful applicants for domicile certificates that appear to be from outside Jammu and Kashmir raises concerns that demographic change on a linguistic, religious and ethnic basis is already underway.”The new legislation “overrides previous laws which granted the Kashmiri Muslim, Dogri, Gojri, Pahari, Sikh, Ladhaki and other established minorities rights to buy property, own land, and access certain state jobs”.“These legislative changes may have the potential to pave the way for people from outside the former state of Jammu and Kashmir to settle in the region, alter the demographics of the region and undermine the minorities’ ability to exercise effectively their human rights,” de Varennes and Shaheed said.The special rapporteurs urged the government to ensure that economic, social and cultural rights of the people of Jammu and Kashmir are protected, and they are able to “express their political opinions and participate meaningfully in matters affecting them”.The experts also said they are in contact with the Indian government on this matter.India has said its decision to scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and to split the region into two Union territories was aimed at ending decades of poor governance and bolstering development and efforts to counter terrorism backed by Pakistan. The government has dismissed all criticism of its actions, saying they amount to interference in the country’s internal affairs, and also pointed out that the region’s special status was of temporary nature.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-laws-ending-of-j-k-s-autonomy-affect-rights-of-minorities-un-experts-101613670043473.html

Forest ranger of Bhadrak, Subas Nayak said the sarpanch of Govindpur gram panchayat informed him about the dead dolphin.“The dolphin was at least 5.5 feet long and did not have any injury mark. After inspecting the carcass, I was certain that it was a Gangetic Dolphin as it had a long, pointed snout that is characteristic of all river dolphins. Both the upper and lower jaw sets of long sharp teeth were visible even when the mouth was closed. We are carrying out a post-mortem of the carcass to know how it died,” said the ranger.DFO in-charge of Bhadrak Wildlife Division, Bikash Ranjan Das said in November last year a smaller female Gangetic Dolphin was found floating in Gobari river of Kendrapara district. “It may have travelled upstream from the sea or may have travelled from some other river. In 2005 too, we had found a Gangetic dolphin in Budhabalanga river of Balasore district,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/carcass-of-gangetic-dolphin-found-floating-in-odisha-river-101613664190070.html

Our party was weak in Punjab and we had a tie-up with Shiromani Akali Dal there. This time both the parties contested the polls separately and it resulted in a loss for us,” he said in Guwahati during a press conference.Also read: ‘Won’t let Covid-19 get better of Mumbai’ - BMC updates norms to tackle pandemicThe ruling Congress in Punjab has swept the municipal polls in the state winning most of the wards in the eight municipal corporations.“With regards to the farmers’ agitation, I have been in regular talks with the Kisan Union. The Central government is ready for a clause by clause talks on the farm laws and if anything is against the interest of the farmers, we are ready to discuss it,” the minister said.Tomar, who’s the BJP’s election in-charge for the upcoming assembly polls in the state in April-May, predicted a win for the party due to the policies of the incumbent state government in the past five years.“In Assam, instead of anti-incumbency, there’s pro-incumbency in favour of the ruling BJP government.

18-02-2021||India||No proposal to hike PDS prices of food grains under NFSA, says Piyush Goyal||The government currently has no proposal to hike the prices of foodgrains sold through ration shops under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), Union Food Minister Piyush Goyal said on Thursday.Currently, the government supplies highly subsidised foodgrains at ₹1-3 per kg to over 81 crore people through public distribution system (PDS).Under the NFSA, which was passed in 2013 during the previous UPA regime, there is a provision for revision of the issue prices of foodgrains every three years. However, foodgrains prices have not been revised since the introduction of the Act although economic cost has increased every year."At present, there is no such proposal before the food ministry to increase the prices of products given under the Food Security Act," Goyal said in a virtual press conference.And, the PDS prices of rice, wheat and coarse grains will continue to be sold at ₹3, ₹2 and Re 1 per kg, respectively, he said.The minister was responding to a query if the Centre has plans to hike the PDS rates as the Economic Survey 2021 has recommended increasing the prices of foodgrains sold under PDS to reduce food security bill.The government supplies 5 kg of subsidised foodgrains to each person per month through 5.5 lakh ration shops. NFSA has been rolled out across the country since November 2016.On the progress made in ration card portability, the minister said the work in this regard under the scheme 'One Nation, One Ration Card (ONORC)' began two years ago and today, the facility is available in 32 states and Union Territories.Under the ONORC plan, beneficiaries can lift their entitled foodgrains from any electronic point of sale device (ePoS)-enabled fair price shops of their choice by using their existing ration cards with biometric authentication.Goyal said, "Two years back, the work had begun when it was implemented in four states. In a short span of time, this facility has now been provided in 32 states/UTs covering about 69 crore beneficiaries."About 1.5 crore beneficiaries are taking advantage of the ration card portability facility, he added.Stating that four more states are expected to implement the ONORC by March 31, Goyal said, "The speedy work is in progress in Delhi, Assam, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal. Due to elections in Assam and West Bengal, there might be some delay of 2-3 months."The central government is in regular touch with the rest of the states where ration card portability is yet to be implemented and encouraging them to put necessary systems in place, he added.To ensure seamless service of ration card portability, a food ministry official said all ration cards given under the NFSA have been fully digitalised, Aadhaar seeding has been completed in 91 per cent of the ration cards and ePoS machines have installed in 4.9 lakh ration shops so far.On a monthly basis, 70 per cent biometric transactions are happening at ration shops, he added.On foodgrains procurement, the minister said there has been a substantial rise in wheat and paddy buying at minimum support price (MSP) directly from farmers in the past seven years.During 2020-21, the MSP payment was at "all-time high" as ₹75,000 crore worth of wheat was purchased from 43.46 lakh farmers, while ₹1.72 lakh crore worth of paddy from 1.54 crore farmers, he added.To ensure MSP reaches farmers, a senior food ministry official said states have been directed to make online payment via state or FCI portals.Even Haryana and Punjab have been asked to ensure online payments to farmers are done through e-mode from the upcoming season, he added.That apart, procurement through bio-authentication of farmers has been introduced in Uttar Pradesh. Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh are also keen to adopt bio-authenticated procurement which will ensure transparency and tracking end-use beneficiary.The ministry is also looking at monetisation of assets of the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and the Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC), which will lead to large investments in modernisation of warehousing and storage infrastructure, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-proposal-to-hike-pds-prices-of-food-grains-under-nfsa-says-piyush-goyal-101613661237227.html
18-02-2021||India||'Metro man' E Sreedharan: All you need to know about the engineer who is set to join BJP||Elattuvalapil Sreedharan, popularly known as the ‘Metro man’ of India, made headlines on Thursday by announcing to join the Kerala unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Sreedharan is an engineer by profession who retired as the chief of Delhi Metro and was involved with metro projects in cities of Kochi, Lucknow and Jaipur.E Sreedharan, an engineer who has worn many hats including that of a lecturer, was the person behind the country’s first metro service, Kolkata Metro. He has worked on the restoration of the picturesque Pamban Bridge, India’s first sea bridge, that connects Rameswaram to mainland Tamil Nadu. He was involved in the Konkan Railway project and, towards the tail end of his career, he was in charge of the Delhi Metro project and retired as its chief in 2011. He was awarded the Padma Shri in 2001 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2008.Sreedharan was a classmate of the former chief election commissioner T N Seshan, who is known for initiating groundbreaking electoral reforms. They both studied at the BEM High School and later at Victoria College in Palakkad, Kerala.In 2019, Sreedharan grabbed headlines when he wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking him not to agree to the Aam Aadmi Party-led Delhi government’s proposal to make metro travel free for women commuters. Since Delhi Metro was constructed with the help of a loan from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), he was worried about its repayments.“One shareholder cannot take a unilateral decision to give concession to one section of the community and push Delhi Metro into inefficiency and bankruptcy,” he wrote to the prime minister in June.Worried about a possible surge in the cost of commuting for other passengers, Sreedharan cited it as one of the reasons for not allowing travel concessions when he served as the chief. “Sir, when the first section of the Delhi Metro was to be opened, I had taken a firm and conscious decision that no one would be given any travel concession on Delhi Metro. This stand was taken to maximize revenues so that Metro fares could be kept low so as to be affordable to ordinary citizens,” he wrote in the letter.In 2018, Sreedharan had also criticised the prime minister’s ambitious bullet train project. In an interview with Hindustan Times, the ‘Metro man of India’ had said that "bullet trains are only for the elite...India needs a safe railway system." He commented that the project was "highly expensive and beyond the reach of the common people."The BJP has only one MLA in the 140-member Kerala legislative assembly and has been trying to make in-roads in the southern state as assembly polls are scheduled in April-May. The 88-year-old engineer, a household name in the state, told Hindustan Times on Thursday that his decision to join active politics is well thought out and that the BJP, he believes, is the only party that can do justice to the state of Kerala.“It is not an impulsive decision but well thought out one. I feel the BJP is the right party which can do justice to the state. Kerala has immense potential but I feel sorry about the state of affairs,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/metro-man-e-sreedharan-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-engineer-who-is-set-to-join-bjp-101613660331354.html
18-02-2021||India||No untoward incident amid ‘Rail Roko’, negligible impact on services: Railways||The four-hour long ‘Rail Roko’ agitation on Thursday called by farmers against the Centre's three agriculture laws ended without any untoward incident, the ministry of railways said on Thursday adding that the majority of the railway zones reported no incident due to the protest.Ahead of the protesting farmers’ call for a four-hour rail blockade across the country from 12 noon to 4 pm on Thursday, the railways tightened security and deployed additional forces across Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, according to officials aware of the development.The Railway Protection Force (RPF) had deployed 20 additional companies, or around 2,000 personnel, across the four states. Regulating trains means that the trains have either been cancelled, short terminated or re rerouted.In total 25 trains along the Northern Railways zones were “regulated,” railways said.“The Rail Roko agitation passed off without any untoward incident. There was negligible or minimal impact on running of the trains across the country. Train movement in all the zones is normal now,” the spokesperson for the ministry said.“Majority of the zones have not reported a single case of any stoppage of train by the agitators. Few trains were stopped in some areas of some Railway Zones but now train operation is normal and trains are being operated smoothly. While dealing with the Rail Roko agitation, utmost patience was exercised by all concerned,” he added.Within an hour of the agitation being over, the Railways said that all its services were running normally across the country.Farmer groups had called for a Rail Roko agitation on Thursday in a bid to amplify their protest against the three contentious farm laws. Samyukta Kisan Morcha, a united front of farmers’ unions, is spearheading the agitation.Earlier, farmers in Punjab had called for rail blockades across the state in September last year in protest against the farm laws, resulting in complete suspension of trains in the state for nearly two months. In November, amid the tussle between the Centre and the Punjab government over allowing the passage of trains in the state, the Railways claimed losses of nearly ₹1,200 crore in freight revenue with more than 2,225 goods trains suspended and 1,350 passenger trains cancelled and diverted.The railway ministry had also informed Parliament last week that it suffered losses of ₹1,462.45 crore in FY 2020-21 due to “various agitations/strikes including dharnas at platforms and near tracks”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-untoward-incident-amid-rail-roko-negligible-impact-on-services-railways-101613658165473.html

Last year, India extended urgent budgetary support of $250 million to the Maldives and provided another $500 million for the Greater Male Connectivity Project.Jaishankar will be in the Maldives during February 20-21 and have meetings with President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih and the ministers for foreign affairs, defence, finance, economic development and planning and infrastructure.He will also hold talks with Speaker Mohamed Nasheed, a key supporter of better ties with India, and meet political leaders.“During this visit, [Jaishankar] will review the entire gamut of our bilateral ties as well as progress of ongoing bilateral projects and hold discussions on the ongoing Covid-19 situation, including India’s continued assistance to the Maldives for its post-Covid economic recovery,” the external affairs ministry said.On his visit to Mauritius during February 22-23, Jaishankar will meet President Pritivirajsing Roopun and Prime Minister Pravind Jagnauth. He will also hold talks with foreign minister Alan Ganoo. Jaishankar will review bilateral ties, implementation of infrastructure projects by India and hold talks on bilateral, regional and global issues, including India’s assistance to Mauritius, the ministry said.Mauritius received 100,000 doses of Indian-made Covid-19 vaccines as a grant last month, becoming one of four Indian Ocean states to benefit from the “Vaccine Maitri” initiative.The Maldives and Mauritius are “key maritime neighbours in the Indian Ocean region and occupy a special place in [the] Prime Minister’s vision of ‘SAGAR’ (Security and Growth for All in the Region)”, the ministry said.Jaishankar’s visit is “testimony to the importance that India attaches to its close and friendly relations with the Maldives and Mauritius and is expected to lend further momentum to substantive cooperation and robust people-to-people ties between the two countries,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eam-jaishankar-to-visit-maldives-mauritius-this-week-to-review-bilateral-ties-101613658832129.html

Chaurasia hasn’t joined any party yet but there is speculation that he could return to the BJP.In the 2020 election, the LJP played the role of a spoilsport as it damaged the JD(U)’s prospects by fielding candidates in almost all the seats that the latter contested. While the JD(U) could win only 43 seats, the LJP itself won only one seat.Keshav Singh, who is said to be have been a confidant of Chirag Paswan, accused his former boss of selling the party. “We took the LJP to every nook and corner of Bihar but after he (Chirag) took over, he was instrumental in giving tickets to those involved in scams who went on to become Lok Sabha MPs. Very soon, he will be in jail as he is involved in an income tax scam,” said Singh.Meanwhile, the JD(U) has decided to celebrate chief minister Nitish Kumar’s birthday on March 1 as Vikas Diwas.The JD (U) chief said party workers will take to every village to highlight the development ushered in by Kumar. “Nitish Kumar has given a new identity to Bihar. He believes in the service of Bihar and Bihar is his family,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reality-check-for-chirag-paswan-as-more-than-200-workers-dump-ljp-to-join-jd-u-101613657315048.html

I feel the BJP is the right party which can do justice to the state. Kerala has immense potential but I feel sorry about the state of affairs,” Sreedharan told the Hindustan Times after party state president K Surendran announced his debut in politics.He will be given a membership during Surendran’s state-wide pre-poll yatra next week.A household name in the state, Sreedharan’s entry will be a big boost to the saffron party in Kerala where it is a distant third-runner. Surendran said he will be a candidate in the upcoming assembly elections.Leading a retired life in his ancestral house in Ponnani in Malappuram district, his decision has created enough ripples in political circles.“I have been staying in the state for the last ten years and have been observing the political climate closely. Both fronts, the ruling LDF and the opposition UDF, are interested in furthering their organisations. The state has immense potential but development takes a backseat. If I can do something positive, I will be happy,” he said.Also read: After 11-month shutdown, Kashmir train services may be partially restoredWhen asked whether any national leader talked to him, he refused to comment. But party insiders said national party chief JP Nadda and Union home Minister Amit Shah were in touch with him.When asked whether it was a late decision, he evaded a direct reply, saying if his decision can inspire others he will be happy. “The pace of development is very slow in Kerala. I love taking up challenges. Personally, I feel more eminent people should join politics and you can serve people better here,” he said, adding that he was all for healthy politics, not mud-slinging or gimmicks.He said the BJP has a different perspective when it comes to development and it attracted him to the party. “The Prime Minister is taking the country fast ahead and it is the duty of all to strengthen his hands,” he said. Sreedharan said he will give more emphasis on development-related issues.The railway civil engineer acquired the sobriquet of the 'Metro man' of India after he oversaw the launch of the metro rail project - a showpiece of the modern urban infrastructure. He retired as the chief of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) in 2011 but continues to be associated with many projects. He revolutionised the way urban India commutes.Sreedharan and former election commissioner TN Seshan were classmates in BEM High School, Palakkad. He graduated from the Government Engineering College, Kakinada and later joined the Indian Railways. Besides Delhi Metro, Lucknow Metro, Pambhan bridge in Rameswaram, Konkan railways and many prestigious projects carry his signature.In one of the earlier interviews with the HT, he said the underground metro line from Mumbai airport to Colaba was most challenging in his six-decade-long career. He was conferred several honours, including the Padma Shri and the Padma Vibushan.The ruling CPI(M) and the Congress said his political entry was unexpected. “It is his personal decision. But we feel he chose a wrong party in Kerala,” said Congress leader Mathew Kuzhalnadan. “His joining reiterates the fact people of calibre, credibility & concern for the development of the nation choose BJP,” tweeted Minister of State External Affairs V Muraleedharan.Political analyst J Prabash said his sudden entry will bring some kind of legitimacy to the BJP in Kerala. “A man of high integrity and status, he will be a good asset to the party. But in the highly political conscious state, it remains to be seen how it can translate into votes,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/metro-man-e-sreedharan-joins-bjp-says-party-can-do-justice-to-kerala-101613658191655.html

We were weak in Punjab and used to fight polls in alliance with Akali Dal. But we fought separately this time, which caused losses to us: Union Agriculture Minister NS Tomar pic.twitter.com/zTZD1yqQTcThe BJP’s total wipeout in the Punjab local body elections has been linked directly with the three legislations, as the state has been the epicentre of the anti-farm law protests. It has also never been the saffron party's stronghold. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), with whom the BJP governed Punjab as recently as early 2017, after which the Congress came to power, parted ways with it in protest against the laws. Harsimrat Kaur Badal, who was the lone SAD representative in the central government, resigned last September, just days after the passage of the laws.The Punjab local body elections saw the BJP suffer defeat even in Pathankot, which is considered its bastion. The party currently has three Members of Parliament (MP) from the northern state -- two in Lok Sabha and one in Rajya Sabha. Union minister Som Parkash, who, along with central colleagues Tomar and Piyush Goyal has been holding talks with the farmers’ unions, is the party’s Lok Sabha MP from Hoshiarpur, while actor Sunny Deol represents Gurdaspur in the Lower House. In both places, the party suffered heavy losses.Also Read | Congress steals the show in Majha, defeats BJP in PathankotOn Thursday, the protesting farmers held a four-hour nationwide rail blockade to put pressure on the central government to revoke the laws.

Kindly inform the office of undersigned whether your office has any objection in restarting the passenger services between Banihal-Baramulla section,” said the official communication on February 17.Yousuf told Hindustan Times that they would be announcing their final decision on February 21. “We will finalize the plan by February 21 to decide whether the train will run on February 22,” he said.The rail services were suspended on March 19, 2020 owing to the novel coronavirus pandemic.In winter during normal days, there used to be 24 services of which eight were end to end while rest used to originate/terminate at central Kashmir’s Budgam railway station.People familiar with the developments said that the authorities are considering starting one to and fro service between Banihal and Baramulla to begin with.“Only one train service between Banihal and Baramulla and vice versa has been approved for the time being,” they said.The shutdown of train service has resulted in a lot of losses to the railway authorities. In Kashmir rail used to have 100 percent occupancy. In summers, every day, 35,000 to 40,000 commuters use train services while in winters around 25,000 people travel daily by train.The train service in the valley has often been marred by political developments. In August 2019, the service was suspended and subsequently restored after 100 days following the Centre’s decision to abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution and to bifurcate the erstwhile state into two Union territories.During 2010 agitation, the services came to a halt after the coaches were damaged. In 2016, after the killing of Hizbul commander Burhan Wani, the services remained suspended for over six months.

18-02-2021||India||After Rajasthan, petrol crosses ₹100-mark in Madhya Pradesh||After Rajasthan, petrol price on Thursday crossed the ₹100 per litre mark in Madhya Pradesh after fuel rates were increased for the tenth day in a row.Petrol price was hiked by 34 paise per litre and diesel by 32 paise, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.While branded or additive-laced petrol, which attracts higher taxes, had crossed the ₹100-mark in some places in states like Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, regular petrol crossed the physiological mark in Sriganganagar town of Rajasthan on Wednesday, and on Thursday it went past that mark in Madhya Pradesh.In Anuppur of Madhya Pradesh, petrol is priced at ₹100.25 per litre and diesel at ₹90.35.Fuel prices differ from state to state depending on the incidence of local taxes such as VAT and freight charges. Rajasthan levies the highest value-added tax (VAT) on petrol in the country, followed by Madhya Pradesh.Madhya Pradesh levies 33 per cent plus ₹4.5 a litre and 1 per cent cess on petrol. On diesel, it charges 23 per cent plus ₹3 per litre and 1 per cent cess.After Thursday's price increase, petrol in Delhi costs ₹89.88 per litre and diesel ₹80.27.In Mumbai, petrol price rose to ₹96.32 a litre and diesel was priced at ₹87.32.Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had on Wednesday blamed output cut by oil-producing nations for the rally in international oil prices that have translated into higher retail rates in India.He urged Saudi Arabia and other global oil producers to ease production cuts, saying rising international oil prices are hurting economic recovery and demand.Demand recovery should take "primacy" over oil prices at least for the next few months, he had said.International oil prices have been on the boil since Saudi Arabia pledged additional voluntary output cuts of 1 million barrels per day in February and March under a deal between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies including Russia, a group known as OPEC .This has resulted in oil prices rising to USD 63 per barrel, the highest level in more than a year."The rising crude oil prices during the last few weeks is hurting the fragile global economic recovery due to significant demand contraction, which might even mirror the impact of COVID-19 in its initial stages," Pradhan had said at the 11th IEA IEF OPEC Symposium on Energy Outlooks.India, he said, had contained the inflationary pressures on several fronts but not those impacted by crude prices."The price-sensitive Indian consumers are affected by rising petroleum product prices. It also affects demand growth, which could potentially impact the delicate aspirational economic growth trajectory not just in India but in other developing countries as well," he said.Also, on Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi blamed India's over 85 per cent import dependence for the "burden" the common man was facing.In Sriganganagar, petrol price soared to ₹100.49 a litre on Thursday.The record price in Rajasthan is despite the state government late last month cutting VAT on petrol and diesel by 2 per cent.VAT on petrol, after the cut, at 36 per cent plus ₹1.5 per litre road cess is still the highest in the country. On diesel, the state levies 26 per cent and ₹1.75 per litre road cess.Diesel in Sriganganagar is priced at 92.47 a litre.In 10 straight days, prices have gone up by ₹2.93 per litre for petrol and ₹3.14 per litre for diesel.The relentless hike in prices has been criticised by the opposition parties including the Congress, that has demanded an immediate cut in taxes to ease the burden on the common man.Pradhan last week had told Parliament that the government is not considering a reduction in excise duty to cool rates from their record highs.Central and state taxes make up for 60 per cent of the retail selling price of petrol and over 54 per cent of diesel.The union government levies ₹32.90 per litre of excise duty on petrol and ₹31.80 a litre on diesel.Retail petrol rates have risen by ₹20.29 per litre since mid-March 2020, after the government raised taxes by a record margin to mop up gains arising from fall in international oil prices. Diesel rates have gone up by ₹17.98.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-rajasthan-petrol-crosses-rs-100-mark-in-madhya-pradesh-101613652429275.html

They also said that regard should be given to physical features, existing boundaries of administrative units, facilities of communication and public convenience.The members suggested that special attention should be given to the difficult terrains while carrying out the delimitation exercise.The other three associated member of the commission - National Conference leaders Farooq Abdullah, Mohammad Akbar Lone, Hasnain Masoodi - skipped the meeting. They had already informed Delimitation Commission chairperson Justice (Retd) Ranjana Prakash Desai in a letter about their inability to be present for the meeting.They also urged Justice Desai to go ahead with the delimitation process as the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019 is under judicial scrutiny."In our view, the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019 is palpably unconstitutional and has been enacted in disregard and violation of mandate and spirit of the Constitution of India and therefore not to be acted upon," the MPs said in the letter.The Delimitation Commission for Jammu and Kashmir was constituted by the Centre on March 6 last year to redraw Lok Sabha and assembly constituencies of the union territory in accordance with the provisions of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, which bifurcated the state into union territories of J&K and Ladakh.The union territory of Jammu and Kashmir came into being on October 31, 2019 after the state was reorganised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-delimitation-commission-holds-first-meeting-farooq-abdullah-and-other-nc-leaders-not-present-101613652028113.html

18-02-2021||India||Gender gap in employability improving with Indian digital revolution: Survey||Given the strategic changes that occurred during the pandemic year, a study revealed that youth employability has reduced due to growing demand for technology but the employability of women has improved with digital revolution.The youth employability stood at 45.9% consisting of highly employable resources, that is significantly lower than 46.2% in the previous year, according to the India Skills Report 2021 by talent management specialist Wheebox, in partnership with Taggd, CII, AICTE, AIU and UNDP.The study found that software and hardware knowledge is becoming a growing demand in industries ranging from travel and tourism to energy and manufacturing.This has fuelled a decline in employability among students for the second year in a row, after a jump in employability witnessed between 2016-2018, it added.However, the employability of women has improved to 46.8% compared to 45.91% of men, it added.“Finally Gender Gap in Employability is improving with the Indian Digital revolution. One great structural change that we found is that women participation is higher than in the previous 5 years.

The floor test, the LG said, is to be done by 5pm on February 22.In an official statement, the LG noted that both the ruling coalition and Opposition have a strength of 14 members each in the legislative assembly, thus necessitating a floor test in the 30-member legislative assembly, where 16 is the magic number. As per the statement, voting shall take place by show of hands and the proceedings will be videographed."The floor test in pursuance of the above directions shall be concluded by 5 pm on 22.02.2021 and the proceedings shall not be adjourned/delayed or suspended at any cost," the statement said.The development came just hours after Soundararajan took oath as Kiran Bedi’s successor and took charge as the Lieutenant Governor of the Union territory where legislative assembly elections are likely to take place in April-May. Bedi, who was removed from office in a sudden move Tuesday night, was frequently engaged in a tussle with chief minister V Narayansamy.Puducherry has been plunged into a political crisis following resignations of Congress MLAs from the Narayanasamy-led government. This has brought down the party’s strength in the legislative assembly to ten, including the speaker, while its ally Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) has three members in the legislative assembly.Since January, four Congress MLAs have resigned, two of whom have joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/puducherry-governor-orders-floor-test-in-the-legislative-assembly-on-feb-22-101613651146734.html

18-02-2021||India||Tamil Nadu custodial death case: Trial begins after eight months||The trial in the alleged custodial killings of P Jeyaraj and his son, J Bennicks, began on Thursday at a district court in Tamil Nadu’s Madurai even as their family has sought speedy justice. The two were picked up in June for allegedly keeping their mobile shop open beyond Covid-19 induced lockdown timings and tortured in custody.Lawyer Rajiv Rufus said nine accused were produced before the court on day one and the judge asked the public prosecutor to furnish details of the charges before adjourning the proceedings until February 22.Jeyaraj’s daughter, J Percys, said they want a speedy trial within two months and justice so that such killings are prevented. Percys and her mother, Selvarani, have filed a petition in the high court seeking the speedy trial. The trial in the case was to begin in November but was delayed as the accused were previously produced before Madurai’s chief judicial magistrate amid jurisdictional issues.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which took over the probe into the case in July, has charged the nine for wrongful confinement and murder.Selvarani, who lived with her husband and son, has since moved to Percys’s home in Puliyangudi, where the Tamil Nadu government has offered her a job. “It is still so painful for us. We have not told our mother about the details of the charge sheet. No one will be able to bear such details. She still has sleepless nights,” said Percys.The CBI’s charge sheet last year detailed the torture the two allegedly underwent for six hours in June at the Sathankulam police station. They were allegedly made to bend over a wooden table, wearing only their undergarments. Police allegedly beat them with lathis. A magistrate’s report earlier said their blood was found on the lathis, a table, and police station walls.Police picked up Jeyaraj on June 19 from his shop. Bennicks followed him to the police station to seek his father’s release. Selvaranai last saw her husband an hour before he was taken into custody when he had come home with a packet of milk and told her that he would return with Bennicks and have tea together.Selvarani last spoke to her son and husband over the phone when they were being taken to a court the next day where the magistrate did not question their visible injuries. Bennicks succumbed to his injuries on June 22, and Jeyaraj the next morning.The family was hoping to have Bennicks married by the end of the year. A close-knit middle-class family, they would speak to each other every day since they lived in different cities. Jeyaraj would call his three daughters thrice daily. “Now, I follow the same routine,” said Selvarani. “We cannot get them back, but we must get justice. Custodial deaths should end with my husband and son. It should not happen to anybody else.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-custodial-death-case-trial-begins-after-eight-months-101613647994039.html

"We will harvest as well as protest," said Tikait, in a warning to central government, ANI reported. "If they insist, then we will burn our crops. They shouldn't think that protest will end in two months," the new agency further quoted Tikait as saying.Since the last week of November, thousands of farmers mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh are camping at Delhi borders demanding Centre to three farm laws passed by Parliament. In the latet bid to intensify their protests, the farmers have given a call for 'rail roko' on Thursday.

The Tikri Border metro station is just near the farmers’ protest site.Earlier, farmer unions had called a "chakka jam" on February 6 and a "tractor parade" in Delhi on January 26, during which a section of protesters clashed with police, overturned vehicles while some hoisted a religious flag from the ramparts of the Red Fort.Also Read | Rail roko: Local train service unaffected in MaharashtraFarmers are agitating against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.Calling the agriculture reforms anti-farmers, the protesters are demanding a repeal of the laws. Agitating farmers claim that the new laws will weaken the minimum support price (MSP) system, despite the Centre seeking to assure them in vain that the MSP system was here to stay and the new laws would only provide more options for farmers to sell their produce.The government has held several rounds of talks with the leaders of the farmers but it failed to bring any resolution to the matter so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-will-harvest-as-well-as-protest-says-rakesh-tikait-vows-to-continue-stir-over-farm-laws-101613645078765.html

A third girl is critical in a hospital in Kanpur."Not only of the Dalit society, but the UP government is also crushing women honour and human rights. But they should remember that I and the entire Congress Party stand as the voice of the victims and will continue to provide justice to them," Gandhi said.Earlier in the day, locals in Unnao opposed the burial of the two minor girls demanding their bodies should first be handed over to the families.The villagers also protested the detention of four family members of the victims and sought a CBI inquiry into the deaths."The family members of the three girls took them to the common health clinic in the district in an unconscious state. Two of the girls were declared brought dead by the doctors, and one was referred to a higher center for treatment. Prima facie they show symptoms of poisoning," said Anand Kulkarni, Superintendent of Police, Unnao.The SP said there were no injury marks on the bodies of the girls, and the police are waiting for the post-mortem reports to determine their cause of death."We are trying to reconstruct the crime scene to get to the bottom of the matter. The investigation is underway. Police have deployed six teams to look into the matter, the villagers are being interrogated," Kulkarni added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-says-up-govt-crushing-honour-of-women-human-rights-101613628686072.html

It also issued notice to the News Broadcasters Association (NBSA), Network 18 and Times Now. According to Ravi, the police had pre-judged her guilt and had been putting out a “biased and defamatory narrative” about her role in violation of the Union home ministry’s guidelines. She has also sought a ban on private TV channels from publishing contents of her WhatsApp conversations.While Solicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta and Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Chetan Sharma, appearing for the police, said that no leaks were made by the police and they were ready to file an affidavit in this regard, senior advocate Akhil Sibal, appearing for Ravi, argued that police was behind the leakage of information.Sibal also sought a statement by police that no information on the case will be shared with the media in future. However, the SG opposed this and said that the demand was being made for media attention.In her petition, Ravi said that police had taken her mobile phone in their custody on February 13 and had forced her to provide them with credentials of her private accounts.“Thus, only Respondent No. 1 had access to the contents of the Petitioner’s private conversations and any leaks of the same necessarily constitutes the commission of a cognizable offence and is a violation of Petitioner’s dignity, reputation, and fundamental right to privacy, guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution,” the petition said.The 22-year-old activist was arrested on February 13 on charges of sedition, criminal conspiracy and intending to riot.

18-02-2021||India||PM Modi launches projects worth over ₹9,500 cr in poll-bound Assam||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday launched several connectivity projects worth over ₹9,500 crore in poll-bound Assam. Modi launched the Mahabahu-Brahmaputra project to improve inland water transport connectivity, laid the foundation stone of one bridge and performed ground-breaking ceremony (bhumi pujan) of another via video conferencing. “In the past few years, the amount of work that should have been done to improve connectivity on the Brahmaputra was not undertaken. The Mahabahu-Brahmaputra project has already started working on addressing that,” the PM said, while blaming previous governments at the Centre for neglecting road and waterways’ connectivity in Assam and the rest of northeast. Also Read | Cattle smuggling flourishing in Assam under BJP govt’s rule, alleges BaghelTo be implemented at a cost of ₹3,231 crores, the Mahabahu-Brahmaputra project involves the launch of Ro-Pax ferry services at three places on the Brahmaputra, construction of an inland water transport (IWT) terminal, tourist jetties at four places and launch of two e-portals for ease of doing business. The new Ro-Pax ferry service between Majuli and Neamati will reduce the 11 hours taken to travel between these two places to just one hour. The ferry service between North and South Guwahati will cover the three hours’ distance by road in 30 minutes and the service between Dhubri and Hatsingimari will reduce the eight hours of road travel to three hours. The IWT terminal to be constructed at Jogighopa is expected to boost the local economy with enhanced trade via the waterways. The tourist jetties to be set up at Pandu, Jogighopa, Neamati and Biswanath Ghat are likely to increase river-based tourism. The PM laid the foundation stone for the four-lane bridge over Brahmaputra between Dhubri in Assam and Phulbari in Meghalaya. To be constructed at a cost of ₹5,000 crore, the 19km long bridge over Brahmaputra will be the longest river bridge in India and is expected to benefit 2 million commuters. According to the Assam government, the bridge will improve connectivity among Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Manipur and Tripura and will reduce the distance between Dhubri and Phulbari from 205km to 19km. The distance which used to take six hours earlier will now be reduced to 20 minutes. Modi also performed the ‘bhumi pujan’ for the two-lane bridge on the Brahmaputra between Majuli, the world’s largest river island, and Jorhat. The bridge will connect Neematighat (in Jorhat) and Kamalabari (in Majuli). “The Majuli-Jorhat bridge will address a long-standing demand of the people of Majuli who will now have road connectivity as well. The Dhubri-Phulbari bridge will not just reduce distance between Assam and Meghalaya, but will improve connectivity of Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura to Assam and also reduce distance to Bhutan and Bangladesh,” the PM said. Foundation stone of the North East Data Centre at Guwahati, to be built at a cost of ₹350 crore, was also laid by the PM. The centre will act as a data hub for all states in northeast. Addressing the gathering, union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari announced the start of a road network project in Majuli worth ₹8,730 crore that will improve connectivity of the island with neighbouring towns. Thursday’s event is the continuation of the BJP-led state government’s recent announcements ahead of the assembly polls in Assam due in April-March. On January 23, the PM had addressed a rally in Sivasagar and distributed land allotment certificates to 106,000 landless families. On February 7, he had addressed another rally at Dhekiajuli, laid foundation stones of two medical colleges and launched the Asom Mala road network project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-launches-projects-worth-over-9-500-cr-in-poll-bound-assam-101613638085522.html

18-02-2021||India||Ramani's acquittal in defamation case vindication of women journalists: IWPC||The Indian Women's Press Corps (IWPC) on Thursday termed the acquittal of journalist Priya Ramani in a defamation case filed against her by former minister MJ Akbar as vindication of women journalists who have forever protested sexual harassment and shied away from unwelcome attention in the newsroom.Ramani had made allegations of sexual misconduct against Akbar in the wake of #MeToo movement in 2018. Akbar had filed the complaint against Ramani on October 15, 2018 for allegedly defaming him.A Delhi court had on Wednesday acquitted Ramani in the case, saying a woman has the right to put grievances before any platform of her choice even after decades.In a statement, the IWPC said it is delighted to welcome the court verdict declaring Ramani not guilty of defaming Akbar."Priya Ramani's courage as well as that of a key defence witness and journalist, Ghazala Wahab, in testifying against Mr Akbar has been characterised as vindication of the #MeToo movement in India, but it is much more than that," the women's press body said."It is a vindication of us women journalists, who have forever protested sexual harassment and assault and shied away from unwelcome attention in the newsroom. All we want is a safe working space, so that we can hold the outside world to account; instead, we often find that the predators are within," it added.The IWPC further said it applauds Ramani's determination not to give up, for breaking the silence around this issue."Fact is, even at the height of the #Metoo movement, only 20 women journalists decided to go public about their ordeal, consumed by a misplaced sense of honour. The IWPC hopes that women journalists across the country will find the courage to emulate Priya Ramani and Ghazala Wahab.

I have been staying in the state for the last ten years and observing the political climate. Both fronts, ruling LDF and opposition UDF, are interested in furthering their organizations. The state has immense potential, but development takes a backseat always. If I can do something positive, I will be happy,” said Sreedharan who is leading a semi-retired life in his ancestral home in Ponnani (Malappuram) district.Sreedharan wields a lot of respect and standing in Kerala and his entry could boost the BJP in the state where the party remains far behind the Congress and the Left Front.He said the BJP’s state leaders had approached him last week and he agreed to their request to join the party.“They suggested that I should contest in the upcoming assembly election. I agreed to this also. It is for the party to decide where I should contest,” he said adding he will be into healthy politics and Metro mannot interested in mere mudslinging or gimmicks.The BJP has an unwritten code of not giving tickets to contest an election to candidates who are above 75 years of age. Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa has been an exception to the unwritten rule.A retired civil engineer from Indian railways he revolutionised the way the urban people commute. The Pambhan bridge in Rameswaram, Konkan railways and the Delhi Metro are among the prestigious projects that carry his signature.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/metro-man-sreedharan-to-join-bjp-says-will-contest-kerala-elections-101613636353363.html

Steps have been taken one by one to re-establish multi-modal connectivity of Assam in the last 5 years," PM Modi said in his address while launching the 'Mahabahu-Brahmaputra' initiative.The Prime Minister also laid the foundation stone of Dhubri Phulbari Bridge today via video conferencing.Explaining the difficulties in development projects in Assam, PM Modi said, "Steps have been taken one by one to re-establish multi-modal connectivity of Assam in the last 5 years. The work related to connectivity on the Brahmaputra should have been done earlier. Because of this, connectivity in Assam and North East remained a challenge."With the blessings of Mahabahu Brahmaputra, fast work is now being done in this direction, the PM said. Praising the BJP-led government in the state and Centre, PM Modi said, "Over the years, the double-engine government of the Center and Assam have tried to reduce both the geographical and cultural distances of the entire region."The proposed Dhubri Phulbari Bridge will be located on NH-127B, originating from Srirampur on NH-27 (East-West Corridor), and terminating at Nongstoin on NH-106 in Meghalaya. It will connect Dhubri in Assam to Phulbari, Tura, Rongram and Rongjeng in Meghalaya.The bridge, to be built with a total cost of approximately ₹4,997 crores, will meet the long-standing demand of the people from Assam and Meghalaya who were depending on ferry services to travel between the two banks of the river. It will reduce the distance of 205 km to be travelled by road to 19 km, which is the total length of the bridge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assams-development-a-priority-says-pm-modi-as-he-flags-off-ro-pax-service-between-majuli-and-neamati-101613634785396.html

18-02-2021||India||Uttarakhand passes ordinance to give land ownership to daughters and wives||Uttarakhand government has passed an ordinance to give land ownership rights to daughters and wives of male landowners by amending the Uttarakhand Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act ahead of the budget session of the assembly.The ordinance was passed by the government at a cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat on Wednesday evening, an official privy to the matter said on condition of anonymity."Under the ordinance, the daughters will have ownership rights on the land owned by her father. Similarly, a wife will also be the joint owner of the land of her husband," the official said.He said that the move is aimed to "facilitate the women who are working in fields owned by their husbands or fathers especially in the hilly areas of the state. So far in Uttarakhand, the land ownership rights are transferred to men in the family which are then passed on to their sons."Traditionally in the hilly areas of Uttarakhand, men and their wives are involved in the farming on their land. However, men are largely involved in just heavy labour intensive work like ploughing the field while about 90% farming-related works are done by their wives. Despite that they don't have any ownership of that piece of land."Due to this, if any woman wants to take some loan for any farming related work on the field, they are denied because they don't have ownership of the land. Once this amendment is introduced in the aforementioned Act, they will also have the ownership rights of the land along with their husbands and take a loan," said the official.The cabinet also approved the decision to legalise residential and non-residential buildings that do not have their maps."The buildings would be legalised in a one-time settlement. For the residential buildings in the hilly areas, the application fees would be ₹2,500 and that in plain areas would be ₹5,000. For the non-residential buildings in hilly areas the application fees would be ₹5,000 and that in plain areas would be ₹10,000," said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-passes-ordinance-to-give-land-ownership-to-daughters-and-wives-101613634870610.html

Police said she edited a protest social media toolkit backing the farmers’ agitation against the Centre’s new farm laws, which seek to open up agricultural trade in the country, and later shared it with others “to tarnish India’s image” and incite unrest.Two other suspects in this case, a Mumbai-based lawyer Nikita Jacob and Beed resident Shantanu Muluk, have been granted protection from arrest by the Mumbai high court to enable them to approach a court in Delhi for relief.Also Read: Disha Ravi’s arrest is wrong | HT EditorialIn her petition filed on Thursday, Disha Ravi said the police had taken custody of her mobile phone on 13 February and compelled her to supply passwords to access her phone, email addresses, and social media accounts. “Thus, only Respondent No. 1 had access to the contents of the Petitioner’s private conversations and any leaks of the same necessarily constitutes the commission of a cognizable offence and is a violation of Petitioner’s dignity, reputation, and fundamental right to privacy, guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution,” the petition said.The petition will be taken up by the high court later in the afternoon. The Centre’s second most senior law officer, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, will appear for the Delhi Police.The activist cited a string of media reports that had appeared in recent days citing alleged contents from her WhatsApp contents, underlying that these one-sided reports based on the narrative put out by the police were defamatory in nature.Besides, the Delhi Police was also putting out posts on Twitter that are in violation of the Union home ministry’s guidelines issued in 2010 because these tweets “prejudge the guilt of the petitioner and disclose confidential and prejudicial information about the status of investigation stating that the petitioner was a “key conspirator in the document (toolkit’s) formulation & dissemination. She started WhatsApp Group & collaborated to make the Toolkit doc. She worked closely with them to draft the Doc”.“Such tweets constitute an opinionated and judgmental statement and significantly impinge on the right to privacy and fair trial of the petitioner,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-leaked-private-whatsapp-chat-disha-ravi-asks-court-to-stop-cops-media-101613631458005.html

We plan to export several million doses to Brazil," the company said in an emailed statement. "Pricing of Covaxin for international markets will be based upon supply timelines, purchase commitments and procurement volumes," it added.Bharat Biotech, which last Tuesday had told Reuters it may export doses of Covaxin to Brazil and the United Arab Emirates by the end of the week, did not name other countries and did not give exact figures on doses it expects to export.The company has also entered into an agreement with US drug developer Ocugen Inc for the commercialization of Covaxin in the United States, which has seen the most number of infections in the world.Covaxin is one of the two vaccines approved for emergency use in India, though efficacy data from its late-stage trial is yet to be published.Bharat Biotech expects results from an ongoing trial involving 25,800 participants in India only by March, though the country's drug regulator has called the vaccine safe and effective amid criticism from some doctors and health experts.Covaxin is currently being used by India in its vaccination campaign, which has already covered more than 9 million health workers, and aims to cover 300 million people by August. Bharat Biotech has supplied 5.5 million doses to the government and will sell an additional 4.5 million doses.India, with nearly 11 million coronavirus cases, has the second highest number of infections in the world, though some experts believe the worst of the disease has passed in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-biotech-seeks-covid-19-vaccine-approval-in-over-40-countries-101613631309684.html
18-02-2021||India||Quad to hold first ministerial meeting after Biden administration assumed office||The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad will on Thursday hold its first ministerial meeting since the Biden administration assumed office in the US to discuss practical cooperation for maintaining a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific. This will be the third meeting of the foreign ministers of the group that includes India, Australia, Japan and the US, and it is being held less than five months after the last meeting in Tokyo in October, signalling the Biden administration’s commitment to the Quad as a key formation in the Indo-Pacific. The virtual meeting will “provide an opportunity to continue the useful exchange of views from their last meeting in Tokyo” on October 6, 2020, the external affairs ministry said in a brief statement. The foreign ministers will “exchange views on regional and global issues especially practical areas of cooperation towards maintaining a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific region”, the statement said. External affairs minister S Jaishankar, Australian foreign minister Marise Payne, Japanese foreign minister Toshimitsu Motegi and US secretary of state Antony Blinken will also discuss efforts to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, addressing global climate change and other issues of mutual interest, the statement said. There had been speculation in some quarters on whether India would continue to work closely with the Quad following progress in its efforts aimed at disengagement with Chinese forces in Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC). After several rounds of diplomatic and military talks, India and China have agreed on disengagement on the northern and southern banks of Pangong Lake, one of the friction points in Ladakh sector. US state department spokesperson Ned Price told a news briefing on Thursday that the Quad is “critical to advancing our shared goals of a free and open Indo-Pacific and rising to the defining challenges of our time, including coordinating our efforts on Covid-19 response as well as climate change”. A statement from Japan’s foreign ministry said the four ministers will hold “wide-ranging discussions to advance practical cooperation” for a “free and open Indo-Pacific” and also discuss regional issues. Australia’s foreign ministry described the Quad as a “key pillar” of the country’s international agenda that complements other regional and multilateral engagement, including with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). “This dialogue will allow our nations to advance our shared interest in a secure and prosperous region. The Quad’s positive agenda will enable us to progress cooperation among four Indo-Pacific democracies across a range of areas, including to support the region recover from the economic and health impacts of Covid-19,” it said in a statement. At the last Quad ministerial meeting in October, the group pushed for a rules-based global order and peaceful resolution of disputes in the face of China’s growing aggression across the Indo-Pacific. Then US secretary of state Mike Pompeo had also indicated at the time of the meeting that Washington wanted to formalise and expand the informal group. While addressing the Quad meeting in Tokyo, Jaishankar said India and the other members of the group remain committed to a rules-based international order, “underpinned by the rule of law, transparency, freedom of navigation in the international seas, respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, and peaceful resolution of disputes”. The Quad was upgraded to the ministerial level in September 2019. Recent reports have suggested the Biden administration too is keen on further upgrading the Quad by organising a meeting of leaders of the four countries. Chinese officials have likened the group to a “mini NATO” and said its activities are aimed at targeting third parties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quad-to-hold-first-ministerial-meeting-after-biden-administration-assumed-office-101613631365201.html
18-02-2021||India||Modi’s leadership helped BJP gain ground across the country: Anurag Thakur||Union minister Anurag Thakur has said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government works for the development of all and that the biggest beneficiaries of its social welfare schemes are the sections misled by the Congress for decades. In an interview with Smriti Kak Ramachandran, Thakur also spoke about the government’s attempts to break the logjam over the farmers’ protests against the three farm laws passed in September and its commitment to doubling farm incomes. Edited excerpts:The agitation has continued despite the government’s assurances and outreach. Now it threatens to stoke unrest in the Jat-dominated areas...The government is committed to agriculture reforms and doubling the farmers’ income. The misleading of farmers by certain political parties led to this situation. The government believes in dialogue and will be able to resolve this through dialogue because this is in the interest of the farmers. From the government’s side, senior leaders including Union agriculture and home ministers have interacted with groups [of farmers] and we are open to the idea of meeting them again.How would you respond to the Congress’s criticism that the Budget is directionless?I think Rahul Gandhi‘s speech on the Budget exposed the Congress. They have nothing to say on the Budget; nothing to criticise. They are ill-prepared on the subject and they could not digest that the media, economists, industrialists, and even our critics said this is a great Budget. The market responded positively, not only on day one but for the last two weeks. We have seen a positive sentiment in the market.Also Read | Budget shows hope to build new, self-reliant India, says Anurag ThakurIs this an honest and transparent Budget that has not hidden our problems?Prime Minister Modi made it very clear that there should be no additional tax burden. There should be more transparency...the finance minister made sure that should happen. And even MPs [members of Parliament] from the Opposition parties appreciated this move of the government.Is there a shift of focus from the infrastructure to healthcare and education? How do you see the linkages in the economy for this?...we had hundreds of video conferences with various stakeholders to take their feedback during the pandemic...lots of Budget meetings also. One suggestion was about [increasing] the liquidity during the pandemic. That has been addressed with schemes like Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme, Subordinate Debt Scheme, and Income Tax refund of over ₹2 lakh crore, etc. In the pre-budget meetings, most of the stakeholders said there should be an increase in capital expenditure. And the government increased it by 34.5%... this will have a multiplier effect… more jobs will be created, and better infrastructure will be created. And you can monetise this in the future and repay your debt.Do you think welfare schemes will help the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the assembly polls over the next few months? And will they override the schemes run by the states?The states are getting more revenue share--from 32% to 41%. They have their own schemes. But the central schemes such as Ayushman Bharat and the PM Kisan Yojana have benefitted millions across states. For example, take the agriculture infrastructure cess, the more money generated will be spent in states.The BJP seeks to wrest power in West Bengal, and do you think it will emerge as an alternative in states such as Tamil Nadu and Kerala, which are not its strongholds?People are fed up with the aunt-nephew government in West Bengal. They are upset with the politics of appeasement and corruption. In other places, there used to be nepotism, here [West Bengal], the nephew [of chief minister Mamata Banerjee, Abhishek Banerjee] is running the government. We will do well in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Puducherry also because people in these states have seen the performance of the Modi government at the Centre and how effectively we have worked during the pandemic. In Kerala, we have lost hundreds of workers to political violence. At the same time, the local government is again indulging in politics of appeasement. Kerala has seen enough of communists, Congress, and corruption. Now they are looking for good governance and the BJP is the only alternative.The BJP is criticised for not having chief ministerial candidates and lacking leadership...Where were the faces in Haryana…in Maharashtra, we did not have a chief ministerial candidate. In Tripura, we were nowhere and in Assam, we were not that strong. Where was the leadership? It is the party’s ideology, clean governance and good governance. Modi’s leadership and charisma have helped the BJP gain ground across the country, from the East to the West, from the North to now the South.There is a perception that the government is cracking down on any kind of dissent...For us, national security and the security of Indians is the most important. You vote at 18. It is your action not the age, which forces you to face police action. And if you are trying to destroy the social fabric, then action should be taken.There also seems to be a disconnect between the government and social media companies...We have to see whether the social media platforms are being used for destroying the social fabric or misused for fulfilling the desire to do so. If so, the government has as per the law, every right to take action. If the government indicates the concerned platform to take action against those [destroying the social fabric] or give information, then it is as per the law.You have also been criticised for some of your election speeches. There is a study that says that BJP leaders have the most cases of hate speeches against them...The BJP believes in good governance. It believes in the agenda of development and we always contest elections on the issue of development. And we will contest future elections on the same agenda. And we have delivered. We have cut down the instances of stone pelting in Kashmir, cases of violence. and terror attacks in various parts of the country... The BJP believes in Prime Minister Modi‘s Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sab Ka Vishwas mantra. Post-elections also, you will see that the biggest beneficiaries of all the social welfare schemes have been those sections who have been misled by the Congress for decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modis-leadership-helped-bjp-gain-ground-across-the-country-anurag-thakur-101613630645036.html

His knowledge about the country will help in bettering the relationship between the two countries," said Jha.Jha's comment came after Giriraj Singh, while taking a swipe at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, tweeted in Italian."Caro Raul (Rahul Gandhi), Non esiste un Ministero della pesca separato in Italia. Viene sotto Ministero delle Politiche Agricole e Forestali," Tweeted the Minister which roughly translates to "Dear Rahul, There is no separate Ministry of Fisheries in Italy. It comes under the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry,"Earlier, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi while talking to the fishermen community in Puducherry had said, "Government passed three bills against farmers, the backbone of a nation. You must be wondering why am I talking about farmers at a meeting of fishermen. I consider you as farmers of the sea.

The report also stated that air pollution caused economic damages to the tune of ₹2 lakh crore in India, including about ₹12,365 crore in Bengaluru.The report titled “Greenpeace: Cost to Economy Due to Air Pollution Analysis 2021” was released by Greenpeace, a global climate action advisory group, on Thursday.“The cost estimator also estimated air pollution-related economic losses to be about ₹1,23,65,15,40,000 in six Indian cities. The damage is equally worrying in other Indian cities. An estimated 25,000 avoidable deaths in Mumbai in 2020 have been attributed to air pollution. Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad and Delhi estimated an approximate 12,000, 11,000, 11,000, and 54,000 avoidable deaths respectively due to polluted air,” Greenpeace said in a statement on Thursday.Also Read | How commuters are exposed to pollutionA cost estimator is an online tool that tracks the real-time health impact and economic costs of air pollution in major world cities, Greenpeace said.Indian urban centres are becoming increasingly congested due to migration for education, employment and better quality of life. But the increasing population has led to a rise in pollution levels due to the use of private cars, felling of trees to widen roads, construction of new housing and public infrastructure to accommodate migrant workers—both white and blue collar.Bengaluru has 9.4 million vehicles in an area of just around 820 square kilometres.Vehicular pollution is the single biggest reason for deteriorating air quality in India’s IT capital, followed by construction and other reasons, according to the government.While the Covid-19-induced lockdown brought some reprieve to the environment, lifting of restrictions has hastened the deteriorating quality of air, water and overall quality of life.“Despite recording relatively better air quality this year due to strict lockdown, air pollution continues to be a serious public health issue which also drastically impacts our economy. For the governments of the day, it is crucial that investments are made towards green and sustainable solutions. When we choose fossil fuel over clean energy, our health is put at stake. Polluted air increases the likelihood of deaths due to cancer & stroke, spike in asthma attacks and worsens severity of Covid-19 symptoms,” Avinash Chanchal, climate campaigner, Greenpeace India, said in a statement.Air pollution claimed 160,000 deaths globally in 2020, according to the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-120k-died-due-to-air-pollution-in-india-in-2020-greenpeace-101613628725846.html

18-02-2021||India||Indian president-elect of Oxford student union quits after racism row||Rashmi Samant, the first Indian woman to be elected president of the Oxford University Student Union, has quit after the emergence of old social media posts that were deemed to be “racist” and “insensitive”. The posts, mostly on Instagram, included one with a play on words about the Holocaust and a photo of her visit to Malaysia with the caption “Ching Chang”. Both were deemed offensive by Jewish and Chinese students. She also upset others by comparing imperialist Cecil Rhodes to Adolf Hitler in a Student Union debate, and for separating “women” and “transwomen” in an Instagram caption. Although Samant initially offered an apology for the social media posts, some of which dated back to 2017, in the form of an open letter, she quit as president-elect on Wednesday after facing continued criticism. She announced her resignation on Facebook, writing: “In light of the recent events surrounding my election to the Presidency of the Oxford SU, I believe it is best for me to step down from the role. It has been an honour to be your President-elect.” Also Read | Indian elected as Oxford University Student Union presidentSamant, an alumna of Karnataka’s Manipal Institute of Technology, was elected president of the student union last week. The student of MSc in energy systems at Linacre College received 1,966 of the 3,708 votes in the highest turnout for a student union election. She belongs to Manipal town in Udupi district. Her father, Dinesh Samant, is a businessman and her mother, Vathsala, a homemaker. Samant did her schooling in Udupi and graduated in mechanical engineering in 2020. She had positioned herself as an “inclusivity” candidate in the election and campaigned to “decolonise” the Oxford syllabus and to remove all statues proven to be imperialist, including that of Christopher Codrington at the Conference of Colleges. One Instagram post that showed her at the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin in 2017 was captioned: “The memorial *CASTS* a *HOLLOW* dream of the past atrocities and deeds.” Samant contended this was an attempt at punning on words that was hampered by the fact that she is a “non-native English student” and that she “wouldn’t even dare to be insensitive” about such a topic but the post led to her being accused of being “insensitive” by Jewish students. Another post showing her outside a Buddhist temple in Malaysia had the caption “Ching Chang”. Though Samant claimed the phrase translated from Mandarin to “eat the plants” and was a joke about her being unable to find any vegetarian food at the temple, Chinese students said the term was a reverse Google Translation not used by native Mandarin speakers. Samant upset others by writing “women, transwomen and men” – thus separating women from transwomen – in an Instagram caption and was accused of transphobia. She quit after facing pressure from the Oxford University Chinese Society, Oxford Campaign for Racial Awareness and Equality and the LGBTQ+ Campaign. The Oxford University Chinese Society (OUCS) responded to Samant’s initial apology by saying: “Regrettably, we have not yet heard anything directly from Rashmi Samant. Her long-overdue public apology does not seem sincere to the OUCS. In her apology letter, Rashmi seems to be avoiding addressing her mistakes directly, and it does not show her taking responsibility for her insensitivity to race or ignorance towards the trans-community. We cannot see Rashmi as the SU president we ‘rightfully deserve’ or trust.” However, the Free Speech Union defended Samant, saying it was disappointed to see her resign. “She has apologised for the things she said and that should have been enough,” a spokesperson for Free Speech Union told MailOnline. “Publicly shaming young people and hounding them from the public square just because they’ve said something a bit daft on social media will deter all but the most boring to get involved in student politics,” the spokesperson added. The Oxford Student Union Sabbatical Officers issued a statement to apologise for the “hurt and discomfort caused by the actions of the president-elect” and said: “Oxford SU has a no tolerance policy towards discrimination. Racism, transphobia, and anti-Semitism have no place in our organisation.” A by-election will now be held to choose a new student union president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-president-elect-of-oxford-student-union-quits-after-racism-row-101613628244954.html

Also this exercise would require collection of electronic evidence in form of conversations on WhatsApp and Telegram.As two years have elapsed and recovery of this electronic evidence would be difficult, the bench said, "No purpose will be served in continuing the proceedings. Accordingly the suo moto proceedings are closed."The Justice Patnaik Committee recorded in its report that the Director Intelligence Bureau was of the view that the then CJI Gogoi having taken several tough decisions relating to the National Register of Citizens (NRC), there was "strong reasons to believe that such judgments may have acted as trigger to make such allegations (of sexual harassment) against then CJI".Also, Justice Patnaik in his report said that some tough administrative decisions taken by then CJI to streamline the Registry of SC could also have acted as the trigger.However, in view of limited mandate given to the Committee, the three-judge bench said, "in view of the limited mandate under the April 24, 2019 order the report opines that it cannot really enquire whether decision of CJI on judicial side in sensitive matters triggered off the conspiracy against the then CJI as remit of the Committee was only to enquire allegations made by Utsav Bains. Also in view of fact 2 years have passed and recovery of electronic record is unlikely, specifically keeping in mind the scope of enquiry.... No purpose will be served in continuing these proceedings."The suo motu proceedings were initiated by a bench headed by former SC judge Justice Arun Mishra in April 2019. Later a lawyer Utsav Bains filed an affidavit making allegations of a conspiracy to malign then CJI hatched by persons in collusion with two dismissed employees of SC Registry. All his allegations were handed to Court in sealed cover and the same was forwarded to Justice Patnaik Committee.Following the hearing today, Court ordered the report submitted by Justice Patnaik to be placed in sealed cover.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-disposes-off-suo-motu-proceedings-against-former-cji-ranjan-gogoi-in-sexual-harassment-case-says-conspiracy-can-t-be-ruled-out-101613627495617.html

Tikait and other farmers’ leaders have been holding panchayats regularly in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and other areas in the national Capital region to gather support for the ongoing agitation.The railways have stepped up security and deployed 20 additional companies across Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal to prevent the protests from taking a violent turn. They have also appealed to farmers to ensure that the protest remains peaceful and no inconvenience is caused to passengers.High security was also seen at Haryana’s Palwal railway station and Ghaziabad Junction in Uttar Pradesh ahead of the blockade.A day before the ‘rail roko’ programme, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha had on Wednesday accused the Centre of trying to "counter and destroy" the farmers' movement against the new agricultural laws.Earlier this month farmer unions had called a 'chakka jam' and a 'tractor parade' in Delhi on January 26. The Republic Day protest had turned violent as clashes broke out between the police and protesters. A section of protesters also hoisted a religious flag from the ramparts of the Red Fort following which several cases have been registered and arrests have been made in connection with the violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-rail-roko-protest-rakesh-tikait-says-trains-aren-t-plying-anyway-101613626630408.html

18-02-2021||India||5 Indian-origin persons, Indian activist feature in TIME magazine's list of 100 emerging leaders||Five Indian-origin personalities, including Twitter’s top lawyer Vijaya Gadde and UK’s finance minister Rishi Sunak, and an Indian activist feature in TIME magazine’s annual list of 100 “emerging leaders who are shaping the future".The 2021 TIME100 Next, released on Wednesday, is an expansion of TIME’s flagship TIME100 franchise of the most influential people in the world and highlights 100 emerging leaders who are shaping the future.“Everyone on this list is poised to make history. And in fact, many already have,” Dan Macsai, the editorial director of the TIME100, said.Other Indian-origin personalities on the list are Instacart founder and CEO Apoorva Mehta, doctor and Executive Director of nonprofit Get Us PPE Shikha Gupta and founder of nonprofit Upsolve Rohan Pavuluri.Bhim Army chief Chandra Shekhar Aazad is also on the list.Sunak’s profile in the TIME feature says that a little over a year ago, the 40-year old was an “unknown junior minister in the British government” but after he was named to lead Britain’s Treasury last year, he “quickly became the benevolent face of the government’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, approving large handouts for many citizens whose jobs were disrupted by the virus.”Sunak has however also been criticised for advocating early relaxation of lockdown rules, the profile said."Nonetheless, Sunak remains the country’s most popular politician, according to the pollster YouGov. And he’s the oddsmakers’ favourite to be Britain’s next Prime Minister,” it added.On Mehta, 34, the TIME profile said that in the initial days of the Covid-19 pandemic, Instacart “faced a tidal wave of orders, as people with means opted en masse to pay the service’s workers to buy groceries for them.” Mehta describes that period as a “wartime moment,” it said.However, later Instacart also “faced new criticism about the way it treated its workers, including labyrinthine sick-pay policies, frequent rule changes for shoppers and demanding performance metrics.” Instacart continues its focus on expansion. “The smartphone is the supermarket of the future. We are going to help co-create that,” Mehta said in the TIME article.The TIME profile described Gadde, 46, as “one of Twitter’s most powerful executives” who was the one to convey the news to CEO Jack Dorsey that President Donald Trump’s Twitter account had been suspended following the Capitol attack of January 6.Dorsey "has delegated to her Twitter’s content-moderation decisions; she was the architect of the 2019 decision to ban all political advertising, and is responsible for the warning labels that Twitter applied to Covid-19 and election-interference misinformation in 2020."While Twitter is still home to much misinformation and harassment, Gadde’s influence is slowly turning the company into one that sees free speech not as sacrosanct, but as just one human right among many that need to be weighed against one another,” the TIME profile said.Aazad, 34, is the leader of the Bhim Army, which runs schools to help Dalits escape poverty through education and also “practices a distinct brand of assertiveness, sweeping into villages on loud motorbikes to protect victims of caste-based violence and organising provocative demonstrations against discrimination,” the TIME profile on him says.Aazad and the Bhim army also “spearheaded a campaign for justice” in the case of the fatal gang-rape of a 19-year old Dalit woman in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras.TIME said Gupta and her team stepped up to meet the growing demand for personal protective equipment for healthcare professionals at a time when there was a “leadership vacuum” from the White House.“In a crisis, small acts can make a big impact. And in extraordinary times, ordinary people, driven by service, can do extraordinary things. The early days of the Covid-19 pandemic were some of the darkest in America’s history. A leadership vacuum from the White House contributed to health care professionals across the country lacking the personal protective equipment they needed to stay safe and save lives,” it said.Gupta, who “wasn’t on the White House Task Force” or a governor or member of Congress, took action to solve the problem.Gupta leads the Get Us PPE organisation and along with a group of medical professionals and team members, the organisation helped distribute more than 6.5 million pieces of PPE to frontline workers.Pavuluri is the 25-year founder of the free online tool that helps users fill out bankruptcy forms on their own.TIME said that as the Covid-19 pandemic brought varied economic hardships to Americans, filing for personal bankruptcy was seen as an effective way to eliminate debt but entailed high legal costs and complex paperwork.Upsolve, which Pavuluri founded in 2018, has till date helped American users relieve more than USD 300 million in debt, the TIME profile of him said.“We’ve found a way to use technology to address a civil rights injustice at scale,” Pavuluri said in the TIME profile.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-indian-origin-persons-indian-activist-feature-in-time-magazine-s-list-of-100-emerging-leaders-101613625092634.html

Here is all you need to know about the price rise:• ₹100 per litre retail price of petrol in Sri Ganganagar is the first time the fuel was sold at rates in the three digits anywhere in the country. In Delhi, petrol retailed at ₹89.54 a litre.• Sri Ganganagar pays the highest rate for the fuel since it is the furthest from a nearby dispatching facility, which adds to transportation costs that are passed on to the consumer.• Taxes account for more than 60% of the pump price of fuel. Part of these is central taxes and part, those levied by the state. Also Read | Petrol price climbs to ₹89.88/L in Delhi, diesel crosses ₹80-mark• In the case of Delhi, data available on the Indian Oil website shows that central excise duty and state value-added taxes added ₹32.9 and ₹20.61 per litre to the cost of petrol. • The base price, freight and dealer commission amounted to just ₹35.78 per litre for petrol.

18-02-2021||India||Priya Ramani vs MJ Akbar case: 5 takeaways from the order||A Delhi court acquitted former journalist Priya Ramani in a defamation case filed by former Union minister MJ Akbar. The latter had sued Ramani after she accused him of sexual harassment. The court said that a woman has the right to voice grievance several years after the alleged crime took place. Hindustan Times' National Political Editor Sunetra Choudhury explains 5 key takeaways from the verdict.1- Victim had to prove her intention: At the outset, Priya Ramani has won this historic case against sexual harassment but the biggest takeaway is that a woman who was sexually harassed had to prove her motives, that she was not guilty of defamation and was not making false allegations. It took more than 2 years for Priya to clear the tag of being an accused. Why? Because at the height of the #MeToo movement in 2017, she wrote an article that revealed how years ago then journalist MJ Akbar had harassed her by inviting her to his hotel room for a job interview. Ramani's charges were actually the mildest. Witness Ghazala Wahab's testimony reveals serious charges of assault and even rape by a journalist working in the US, Pallavi Gogoi2- Didn't “do'” anything: The judgment is significant because it drives the message home that you don't have to touch someone inappropriately to sexually harass them. MJ Akbar tried to use Priya Ramani's words that he ‘didn't do anything' to his defense and claimed, she tarnished his reputation. However, the judgment came down on such predatory behaviour. 16 women came out publicly to say that Akbar harassed them and the court upheld them all, from physical rape to just making someone feel uncomfortable.3- Women & the workplace: Judge Ravindra Kumar Pandey makes a strong argument for creating a better workplace for women in India. He uses journalist Ghazala Wahab's testimony to make the point that prevention of sexual harassment is a woman's right and is the reason why women make up only 25% of the workforce. Ghazala, who was harassed by Akbar in the '90s, recalls in her testimony how she got no help from her seniors and was even afraid to tell her parents because they would just make her quit her career. Now all workplaces have to have Prevention of Sexual Harassment at the Workplace (POSH) complaint cells but women are still wary for this very reason.4- `Women have a right to complain even after decades': One of the biggest challenges in sexual harassment cases is that women often don't speak up immediately after they've been harassed. In the 91- page judgment, the allegations came to light two decades later, and yet the court believes the women making the allegations. The court didn't get distracted by the gaslighting that it was all a conspiracy to tarnish a brilliant journalist's image. In the end, the fact that she had a witness who backed her up was enough for the court to believe her. The court says women have a right to speak about their experiences on any platform, even decades later.Also Read: Journalist Priya Ramani acquitted in defamation case5- Court on Akbar: Not a man of stellar reputation: MJ Akbar as former union minister has a long CV that he uses as a weapon against Priya Ramani. That he's written several books, been editor of several newspapers, and therefore he is the victim of a grand slander campaign. The court simply says that the accounts of the women prove that he “is not a man of a stellar reputation.” The court goes on to say that however respectable such a man is, “a woman cannot be punished for raising voice against sex abuse on the pretext of criminal complaint of defamation”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priya-ramani-vs-mj-akbar-case-5-takeaways-from-the-order-101613621211188.html

The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), the umbrella body of 40 farm unions, has called for a peaceful protest between 12noon and 4pm, expecting to get support for the programme from across the nation.The railways, meanwhile, have stepped up security to prevent any untoward incident. Additional forces have been deployed across Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. The Railway Protection Force (RPF) has deployed 20 additional companies across the four states.“We appeal to everyone to maintain peace calling for peaceful protests so as not to inconvenience passengers,” a railway ministry spokesperson said.As farmers prep for the blockade, director general, Railway Protection Force, Arun Kumar said, "I appeal to everyone to maintain peace. We will be liaisoning with district administrations and will have a control room in place," according to news agency PTI."We will gather intelligence. States such as Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, and some other areas will be our focus" he said, adding that they want to persuade the protesting farmers to not cause inconvenience to passengers.“We have a four-hour window and we want it (rail roko) to get over peacefully," Kumar told PTI.An official, according to PTI, said that no decision has yet been taken on train movement in the backdrop of the rail blockade. "Once we get a better picture of the status of the protests and have identified sensitive spots, we will put in place a plan of action. We have around 80 trains which run through potentially sensitive areas and most of them would have passed through them before 12 pm," the official was quoted as saying.The SKM, meanwhile, criticized the government’s “attitude” and demanded that a solution to the farmers’ issues be arrived at without any further delay. "It is clear that instead of resolving the ongoing struggle's demands, BJP is trying its best to counter and destroy it...SKM vows that it will intensify the struggle and mobilise more farmers in its support," ANI quoted Darshan Pal of SKM as reading from a release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-call-for-4-hour-nationwide-rail-roko-protest-railways-steps-up-security-101613620133114.html
18-02-2021||India||Farmers’ protest: Union minister Sanjeev Balyan chairs meet on Jat outreach||Union minister and BJP’s Jat leader Sanjeev Balyan on Wednesday pinned the blame on the Opposition for prolonging the farmers’ agitation and said political parties that have lost the people’s mandate are using the farmers’ stir to remain relevant. “We will explain to the farmers that the issue is being politicised by those Opposition parties that were nowhere… the Congress and the RLD have begun joining rallies. The farmers must have also realised this by now,” he said after a meeting with his party colleagues at his residence here. A Jat leader who represents the Muzaffarnagar constituency in the Lok Sabha and is also the minister of state for animal husbandry, dairying and fisheries, Balyan was closeted with elected representatives from the Jat dominated areas of Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh a day after the party brass instructed them to reach out to the Khaps and dispel their resentment against the farm laws. Also Read | Farmers’ protest: Sugarcane hub western Maharashtra remains largely silentParty chief JP Nadda and Union home minister Amit Shah had met these elected representatives on Tuesday to draw up a plan to stem a possible Jat agitation. The minister, who emerged as the face of the Jat community after defeating RLD strongman Ajit Singh, said the government is committed to finding a resolution to the stir through dialogue. He also tried to dispel concerns about the new laws in UP, especially in the western UP area, where the party fears a fallout of the agitation. “Contact farming is already happening in western UP. Farmers decide the prices at which they will sell to the sugar mills; if they feel the prices are more in the open market, they are free to sell outside also. APMC Act has also not affected the sugarcane farmers…” he said. While farmers from the region have thrown their weight behind Rakesh Tikait who has emerged as the face of the farmers’ agitation, Balyan pointed out how his father Mahendra Singh Tikait had advocated the need for allowing farmers to sell anywhere in the country. Also Read | No invite to BJP leaders for any function till farm laws scrapped: UP panchayatWhile the farmers have threatened to intensify their stir, the government is pulling out all stops from ensuring that a mobilisation of the Jat communities across states does not take the shape of an anti-BJP force. “There is a view in the party that the Jat leaders failed to read the sentiment on the ground and the crisis that could have been nipped in the bud has now turned into a problem for the party. Now all efforts are being made to ensure that the agitation does not hurt the BJP in the upcoming elections in UP,” said a leader privy to the meeting. The meeting of the Jat leaders coincided with the BJP’s setback in the municipal elections in Punjab, the epicentre of the protests against the farm laws. While the Congress swept all seven municipal corporations in the state local body elections, the BJP had poor showing even in stronghold such as Pathankot. “There is a concern that the Jats, who are a considerable votebank for the party, can benefit our opponents. Tikait himself has political ambitions and he has, in the past, lobbied for a ticket (from the BJP). He is using the agitation for fulfilling his political ambition and that is what we will go to people with,” the functionary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-union-minister-sanjeev-balyan-chairs-meet-on-jat-outreach-101613620384705.html

The Mahabahu-Brahmaputra initiative will be launched. The foundation stone of 2 bridges will also be laid,” the PM had tweeted on Wednesday. According to a PIB release, the launch of Mahabahu-Brahmaputra, which aims to improve connectivity in the eastern states, will be marked by the inauguration of the Ro-Pax vessel operations between Neamati-Majuli Island, North Guwahati-South Guwahati and Dhubri-Hatsingimari. Foundation stone of Inland Water Transport Terminal at Jogighopa and various tourist jetties on Brahmaputra and launch of digital solutions for Ease-of-Doing-Business will also be a part of the initiative. “The programme is aimed at providing seamless connectivity to the eastern parts of India and includes various development activities for the people living around River Brahmaputra and River Barak,” said the release. The PM will lay the foundation stone for a four lane bridge over the Brahmaputra between Dhubri (on North Bank) and Phulbari (on South Bank). Also Read | Just 4% houses built this fiscal year in PM Modi’s rural housing planThe proposed bridge will be on NH-127B, originating from Srirampur on NH-27 (East-West Corridor), and terminating at Nongstoin on NH-106 in Meghalaya. It will connect Dhubri in Assam to Phulbari, Tura, Rongram and Rongjeng in Meghalaya. “The bridge, to be built with a total cost of approx ₹4,997 cr, will meet the long-standing demand of the people of Assam and Meghalaya who were depending on ferry services to travel between the two banks of the river. It will reduce the distance of 205km to be travelled by road to 19km, which is the total length of the bridge,” said the release. Modi will also perform bhumi pujan for a two-lane bridge on the Brahmaputra between Majuli, the world’s largest river island, and Jorhat. The bridge will be located on NH-715K and will connect Neematighat (on Jorhat side) and Kamalabari (on Majuli side). The construction of the bridge has been a long-standing demand of the people of Majuli who, for generations, have been dependent on the ferry services to connect with the rest of Assam. Thursday’s event is in continuation with the BJP-led state government’s recent announcements ahead of the assembly polls in Assam due in April-March. On January 23, the PM had addressed a rally in Sivasagar and distributed land allotment certificates to 106,000 landless families. On February 7, he had addressed another rally at Dhekiajuli, laid foundation stones of two medical colleges and launched the Asom Mala road network project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-launch-mahabahu-brahmaputra-initiative-in-assam-today-101613618464734.html
18-02-2021||India||Cattle smuggling flourishing in Assam under BJP govt's rule, alleges Baghel||Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel has alleged the BJP government in Assam has been running a "systematic syndicate" and said that cow smuggling is flourishing in the state."The situation in Assam is frightening due to the 5-year-old Sonowal government. Cow smuggling is flourishing under the government in Assam. BJP has been seeking votes in the name of cows countrywide but in Assam, it has been hand and glove in sponsoring and carrying out cow trade across the border with Bangladesh. In fact, the Sonowal government has been running a systematic syndicate," Baghel said."It is a fact that the meat export of Bangladesh has grown many folds in last few years. Ever since BJP has come to power in Assam in 2016, cow trade and exports of cow meat in Bangladesh have gone up by 211 per cent just in two years," he added.In January, Congress had appointed Baghel, General Secretary Mukul Wasnik, and Bihar MLA Shakeel Ahmed Khan as party observers of Assam in the view of upcoming state Assembly elections.Countering the Sonowal government for claiming that they are stopping this cow trade, Baghel asked -- "if it is true then where are the cows being kept, and which gaushala have they been kept at".He alleged that the task of cow protection has been given to the Animal Husbandry Department instead of the police."The Syndicate is not limited to just cow trading, the Sonowal government has broken all records in coal brokerage and illegal coal trading. Almost 500 trucks of illegal coal transportation are taking place every day. Besides this, there are syndicates dealing in bamboo, pan, fish etc," Baghel said.The Chief Minister said 16.42 lakh people were unemployed in Assam between 2016 and 2018 and this figure has increased to 20 lakhs in 2020."This implies that instead of giving employment, the BJP government has snatched jobs of around 5 lakh people. I am told that today, an estimate of 15 to 18 lakh youths have migrated from Assam, looking for job opportunities. In Assam, we have seen the closure of two big paper mills which left thousands unemployed, some even committed suicide," he said.Drawing comparisons between Assam and Chhattisgarh, Baghel said the BJP government is unable to provide the minimum support price (MSP) to the farmers."We are buying paddy from the farmers at MSP. Apart from MSP, we have started a new scheme called "Rajiv Gandhi's Kisan Nyay yojana", where we are paying ₹10,000 per acre to the farmers for paddy, sugar cane, and maize. Forget about anything extra, the Sonowal government is unable to provide MSP to the farmers and subsequently, they have to sell paddy at the rate for ₹900-1000 per quintal," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cattle-smuggling-flourishing-in-assam-under-bjp-govt-s-rule-alleges-baghel-101613610772047.html
18-02-2021||India||‘Facebook, Twitter can’t be accountable to state assemblies’: Centre to SC||The Union government on Wednesday submitted in the Supreme Court that Facebook or Twitter cannot not be made accountable before any state assembly, even as the Centre said that the social media platforms had the “powers to de-stabalise a country” and the “propensity to create law-and-order problems”.Representing the Centre, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said that only Parliament and its committees had the authority to deal with the issues pertaining to social media and intermediaries such as Facebook since a “national response” to this problem was required.“It would be hazardous if every unit of the Union of India starts examining these things. Facebook, Twitter etc. have powers to destabilise a country but the response has to be a national response. If there is a problem with the Facebook, the answer is not to allow a state assembly to take it up. We cannot have over two dozen assemblies using their subjective wisdom to deal with this problem,” Mehta told a bench headed by justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul.Read more: SC denies registering suo motu contempt against Rajdeep SardesaiAccording to the SG, apart from Parliament, no state government and assemblies were empowered to call upon Facebook or Twitter, through their functionaries, for recording their statements on oath, or to make any recommendation regarding social media because the power to legislate on this subject was only with the central government.The government’s submissions came as the bench, which also included justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy, was hearing a petition by Ajit Mohan, head of Facebook India. Mohan has challenged the summons issued to him by peace and harmony committee of the Delhi assembly, asking him to appear and answer some queries on the role of the social networking portal in the Delhi riots in February 2020.Experts said it will be a strange situation if a state government or assembly is told it cannot conduct an inquiry because the Centre is empowered to make the law on that subject.Read more: No link between Char Dham road widening and glacier burst, govt tells Supreme Court; hearing adjourned for 2 weeks“There is a huge difference between power to make laws, which is the legislative competence, and the enforcement of laws. A law can be made by the Central government but it is the states that have to apply those laws. How can a law be enforced without an inquiry or summoning certain individuals?” said PK Malhotra, former secretary, ministry of law and justice.“It would be a very strange situation if a state government cannot even initiate an inquiry only on the ground that the law is a central law.” he added.When the hearing began on Thursday, the bench asked Mehta to clarify if the Centre’s stand in this matter was that only the Parliament and parliamentary committees had the power to summon Facebook, WhatsApp or Twitter.The court pointed out that in the case of Delhi, an argument was made that inquiring into the riots was a law-and-order issue, which was outside the ambit of the Delhi assembly, and hence, Facebook India head could not have been summoned. “But what about other states where law-and-order is with them, unlike the peculiar position in Delhi? Or what if Delhi assembly wants to discuss something which does not relate to law-and-order? Is it your stand that the Central government is the sole repository of what Facebook does in India and no other state assembly can summon them for anything?” the bench asked Mehta.Read more: Supreme Court agrees to consider issue of priority vaccination for members of legal fraternity, issues notice to CentreMehta outlined his submissions and asserted that if there was no power to make a law on a subject, like social media in the present case, a state assembly lacked power to examine the issue or make any recommendation in that matter.“Can you (a state) regulate social media? If the answer is no, then you cannot summon anyone. Don’t even recommend something on which you don’t have legislative competence. The problem is global, uncontrollable but there has to be a national response and each assembly cannot be allowed to examine it,” Mehta replied.He added that Parliament was aware of the problem and a standing committee was already looking into it. “If you are more popular, you have more potential to create problem. And Facebook is very popular. It is not that the central legislature is not aware of the problem. A parliamentary panel is seized of all these issues,” said the S-G.Mehta also sought permission from the bench to file an affidavit on the Centre’s stand in the matter. The court gave him time till Monday to submit the affidavit and fixed the matter for hearing next week.Contending that since Facebook was already appearing before the parliamentary panel, the Delhi government and its Peace and Harmony Committee have complained that the social networking platform could not be allowed to “pick and choose” where to appear. They have added that Mohan was being called only as a witness and that he could not choose not to show up on conjectures about what could be asked by the panel. Later, the Delhi government told the bench that Facebook could even send anybody else from the firm if Mohan did not want to appear.Mohan, on the other hand, has underlined his “right to silence,” and that he was under no legal or constitutional obligation to appear before the assembly panel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facebook-twitter-can-t-be-accountable-to-state-assemblies-government-101613610284320.html
18-02-2021||India||A second toolkit was in works: Delhi Police||The Delhi Police on Wednesday said the activists involved in the creation of a social media toolkit on the ongoing farmers’ protests prepared a second document to organise a Twitter storm aimed at “creating unrest” in Delhi on February 4 and 5 with hashtags related to the violence during January 26 tractor rally, but could not execute it.Investigators said the second document was created by Nikta Jacob, Shantanu Muluk -- two activists who have been accused of creating and sharing the first document -- and and a UK-based activist Marina Patterson, who is allegedly linked with the global movement “Extinction Rebellion” also referred to as “XR”.According to its website, Extinction Rebellion is an international movement that uses non-violent civil disobedience in an attempt to halt mass extinction and minimise the risk of social collapse.“The plan mentioned in the second toolkit, however, could not be executed. We suspect it happened because the toolkit was accidentally tweeted by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg on February 3, the day Ravi shared it with her and coaxed her to act on it. Since the Google toolkit documents contained objectionable content, Ravi panicked, asked Greta to delete the tweet, took the admin rights and removed her name from the toolkit,” said a second senior police officer associated with the case, requesting anonymity.According to the officer, the investigating team has already written to Google seeking details of both toolkit documents to ascertain where they were actually created, who drafted and edited them, and with whom it was shared.The Delhi Police on Saturday arrested 22-year-old climate activist Disha Ravi from Bengaluru on charges of sedition, intending to riot and criminal conspiracy, for editing and creating a toolkit, essentially a Google document. The police have alleged that the toolkit was created to spread misinformation and incite unrest. They have also alleged that Disha shared the document with Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg who tweeted it but later removed it.Both Muluk and Jacob have been grated pre-arrest bail court.Activists from various organisations have said that creating a toolkit was standard operating procedure for advocacy and media outreach, and did not constitute a crime as it was entirely up to people whether or not to follow what toolkits suggested.Protests against the arrests of the activists continued on Wednesday with members of the Congress-backed NSUI demonstrating in Delhi, accusing the police of an “authoritarian crackdown”In a statement, NSUI president Neeraj Kundan said, “The government uses tough laws and misuses them to silence all dissenting voices.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-second-toolkit-was-in-works-delhi-police-101613610717926.html
18-02-2021||India||To enhance accountability, Cabinet clears changes to Juvenile Justice Act||The Union cabinet on Wednesday approved a raft of changes to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, or JJ Act, and plans to introduce measures to strengthen the set-up to protect the interests of children.The amendments, once approved by Parliament, will increase the role of district magistrates and empower them to undertake inspections of childcare institutions.Union minister for women and child development Smriti Irani said the move would enhance the accountability of those involved in the process of safeguarding children’s interests. “The decisions have been taken keeping in mind the need to increase protection of children,” she said.There have been reports of an increase in child abuse and trafficking during the Covid-19 lockdown. A substantial increase was noted in the number of distress calls received by 1098, the childcare helpline set up the ministry of women and child development, between March and August, a news report said.Read more: Israel researchers test drug to prevent severe Covid casesThe ministry implements a centrally sponsored Child Protection Services (CPS) Scheme for supporting children in distress conditions. Under CPS, financial assistance is provided to the states and Union territories, for, inter-alia, undertaking a situational analysis of children in difficult circumstances and for setting up and maintaining Child Care Institutes (CCIs) for providing rehabilitative services.The primary responsibility of the execution of the JJ Act rests with the states/UTs.The amendments include authorizing district magistrates and additional district magistrates to issue adoption orders under Section 61 of the JJ Act, in order to ensure speedy disposal of pending adoption cases and enhance accountability.District magistrates have been empowered under the Act, to ensure its smooth implementation, as well as put in place synergized efforts in favour of children in distress conditions, defining eligibility parameters for the appointment of child welfare committee members, and categorizing previously undefined offences as “serious offence.”According to Swagata Raha, a legal researcher based in Bengaluru, district magistrates already have a significant role to play when it comes to monitoring the implementation of the JJ Act.“It would be important to understand how they have dealt with those responsibilities, including holding review meetings and addressing grievances, and the challenges that have arisen before vesting them with additional responsibilities,” Raha said. “Prima facie, introduction of eligibility parameters for CWCs and clarifying undefined offences are necessary, but without looking at the actual amendments, it is hard to comment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-enhance-accountability-cabinet-clears-changes-to-juvenile-justice-act-101613610823797.html

Attached with the mails these officials received were documents that, if clicked, would install a malware on the system of the targets, giving the hackers back-door access, potentially allowing complete spying on the targets.Altogether, two emails were sent from @gov.in and @nic.in email addresses. “In both cases, GoI officials have been targeted through compromised email IDs of NIC (senders’ email domain: @gov.in and @nic.in) to make email users believe that these emails were genuine,” said an alert issued by at least one of the ministries that was affected. HT has reviewed a copy of the mail warning.Read more: ‘Another ploy’: Govt rebuts claim that letters were planted in Wilson’s laptop“The phishing emails were sent on February 10 to various officials across the ministries of external affairs and defence and others, with attached documents asking the recipients to click on the files. Soon after, NIC alerted the concerned branches of the potential security breach and notified all officials across ministries of the compromised emails,” said an official, who asked not to be named.NIC runs the official email service for the government, handing out addresses with the two domain names. Employees and officers under Union and state governments as well as those in state-owned companies are eligible for accounts. The process to obtain one follows a multilayer verification system that requires approvals by designated NIC authorities attached with the ministries these employees work for or come under.Read more: Over 2.9 lakh cyber security incidents related to digital banking reported in 2020HT could not immediately determine the total number of officials targeted, and if any computers were successfully breached. NIC, the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (Cert-IN), and the ministry of electronics and information technology (Meity) did not respond to questionnaires seeking details of those targeted, whether any systems were compromised and if investigations had been launched.A cybersecurity analyst who has worked with the government on investigating cyber attacks said that such methods have been seen in the past, in particular during a campaign in 2008-2009. “Dormant accounts of NIC were used to launch attacks against several top government officials at the time,” this person said, asking not to be named.At the time, mails from a compromised government domain email address were sent to at least 450 top officials, including to accounts used by the then Prime Minister’s Office, the national security adviser, and the external affairs ministry. The analyst quoted above was part of the team that investigated the campaign.Read more: Beware, Mumbai recorded more cybercrimes in 2020: Data“The latest attack seems very basic, but the attackers might have compromised one account using this technique and then gradually expanded their footprint,” added this person, after reviewing available details of the attack at HT’s request. Only a technical analysis can reveal who is behind the attack, the person cited above said, since similar methods can be deployed by a wide variety of adversaries.The campaign in 2008-2009, which lasted till late 2010, was suspected to have been carried out by hackers linked to China.Such phishing campaigns are not novel, and most organisations now sensitise their employees to not respond to or interact with emails from people they don’t know. But using a government domain email address expands an attackers’ ability to target a wide range of senior officials since official email distribution lists often do not accept mails from outside organisations.“Having access to a privileged email domain is always a great vector from an attacker’s perspective because this way, they are able to reach directly into the inbox of their targets and defeat filters that usually flag suspicious messages. This way, they can also chain attack, compromising one official after the other,” said Yash Kadakia, chief technology officer at Security Brigade, a cybersecurity firm that works with the government.By using this technique, attackers can reach officials even if they are not aware of their exact address. “It gives the attacker that ability to choose targets based on a particular profile, whose email addresses they may not have. For example, a phishing mail can be targeted to a mailing list used by an operation’s divisions to reach people involved in such roles,” Kadakia said.“The larger question to ask here is whether the government accounts were protected by two-factor authentication. An OTP (one-time password) for sign-in is one easy way to stop such attacks even if basic login credentials are compromised,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/phishing-attack-targets-officials-through-rogue-mail-from-government-id-101613605003186.html
18-02-2021||India||Just 4% houses built this fiscal year in PM Modi’s rural housing plan||About four out of every 100 houses targeted to be built this financial year under the Centre’s flagship rural housing scheme have been completed so far, according to government data. The lag is due to the Covid-19 lockdown, financial constraints and other issues, officials said.The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna-Grameen, or PMAY-G, was created to provide pucca house to every homeless poor in rural areas. While it has been consistent in chasing targets, this year, some large states have faltered.A senior official aware of the matter pointed out that the scheme, rolled out in November 2016, “has already completed 2.02 crore houses. And we are confident that we will cross the target of building 3 crore houses by March 2022, well before the deadline of August 2022.”A performance audit of the rural development ministry has flagged several issues, including the impact of Covid-19. HT has seen the audit report.Read more: Government chalks up plan to protect police evidenceAccording to latest government data, while the Centre has set the annual target of building 6.377 million houses in FY20-21, states have sanctioned only 3.557 million, or 56% of the target. Of these, only 265,250 (or 4.16% of the year’s target) have been completed.The slow place was flagged in the agenda paper of the ministry’s Performance Review Committee (PRC), which meets at regular intervals to take note of the progress and identify the bottlenecks in different projects.A senior rural ministry official pointed out that states that have contributed 40% of the costs of each house have faced cash crunch as they had to redirect funding to fight the pandemic. “...some states are not in a position to release the funds for housing scheme. But the situation will improve.”The states sanctioned just 56% of the targeted houses this year, a massive drop from FY19-20, when, against the Centre’s target of 5.976 million houses, the states sanctioned 5.966 million. The gap between targets and sanctions has widened from 440,000 in the previous financial year to 2.79 million in this one.Read more: Bengal minster injured in bomb attack in Murshidabad; rushed to hospital“The states of Chhattisgarh, Assam, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have huge gaps in pending sanctions, and need to expedite daily rate of sanctions to achieve the target,” said the report.Expressing concerns, the report said, “The pace of completion has slowed down drastically. This slow pace can be attributed to some factors like inactivity due to Covid-19, elections in few states, saturation of eligible beneficiaries from the SC and ST category, slow pace of working of remand module and lack of timely allocation of targets to districts.”The Centre’s performance audit, however, added that “while the lockdown due to Covid-19 was largely an unavoidable factor”, intense follow-ups are being done with the States/UTs which are lagging behind.While the ministry has asked states to beef up the completion rate of PMAY-G houses by March 31—a tough task by all measures—it has once again identified some big states that have pulled down the rate of completion to an abysmal low.“West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Odisha need to expedite daily rate of completion to achieve the target,” it said.MP minister Gopal Bhargava said the previous Congress government had “not made any provision for rural housing under PMAY in the budget for 2019-20” but the BJP government rectified it. “The MP government has set a target to provide housing to all by 2023 and we are sure of achieving it,” said Bhargava.A senior Trinamool Congress leader said on condition of anonymity that in “West Bengal, projects in several districts got delayed last year because of the Covid-19 pandemic and cyclone Amphan.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/just-4-houses-built-this-fiscal-year-in-pm-modi-s-rural-housing-plan-101613605128083.html
18-02-2021||India||Government chalks up plan to protect police evidence||With the mountain of evidence seized during police investigations and stockpiled in the Malkhanas of 16,670-odd police stations reaching unmanageable proportions, the ministry of home affairs has chalked out a plan to protect the assets, which are of considerable financial and evidentiary value, from decay, pilferage, theft and embezzlement.The report, Malkhana Management System, prepared by the apex police think-tank and approved by the MHA, has recommended the use of RFID tags, bar codes/QR codes, and 24x7 CCTV monitoring of the seized property kept inside theMalkhanas, which are the repositories of seized evidence. The plan has already been shared with states and Union territories.The Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD) report asserts that Malkhanas plays a key role in the criminal justice system.Read more: Popular Bengali actor joins BJP, another movie veteran and TMC MLA wants to quit“Failure to manage the evidence/seized property can affect the successful prosecution of criminal cases, resulting in law enforcement agency liability and loss of public confidence. The incidents of theft, replacement, pilferage, embezzlement and destruction of the seized property on account of the wholly unsatisfactory and unscientific methods of storage taint reputation of law enforcement agencies. At times, explosions have occurred due to unscientific storage of explosives atMalkhana,” said the report.It stated that items seized by the police or kept inside Malkhanas during pending trials or after convictions and which have not been disposed of should be kept in paper/plastic envelopes/containers with proper labels, a description of the items/items, quantity, case number, date of seizure, place from where it was seized, and name of the investigating officer.It suggested the installation of compactors in Malkhanas for ensuring safe storage. For QR coding of items, it has recommended following the Andhra Pradesh police model, which has put in place detailed standard operating procedure (SOP).Read more: Bengal minster injured in bomb attack in Murshidabad; rushed to hospitalThe management of Malkhanas, BPRD said, has become increasingly complex because of several factors: the large volume of evidence being collected, absence of adequate space and safe storage systems, preservation of biological/DNA-related material, and lack of training for personnel posted there.For example, currently, there are 599,000 items kept in Delhi’s 208 police stations. A Delhi Police officer, requesting anonymity, said there was no exact data of seizure on each item, but the maximum number of items were typically liquor and cars/bikes.“There could be around 15,000 to 20,000 vehicles in Delhi’s police stations,” the officer said.The arms and ammunition are also stored in Malkhanas. The BPRD has recommended proper tagging and lockers for these as well.Read more: BSF team seize smuggled snake venom worth ₹24 cr near Indo-Bangladesh borderAmong the seized property, vehicles usually occupy substantial space in police stations because of prolonged trials or because they have been left unclaimed by their owners. They are parked in the open and are prone to rapid natural decay on account of weather conditions as well as theft. BPRD has recommended using the Kerala Police model by creating centralised vehicle yards in each district of the states to park the seized vehicles.BPRD asked police forces to follow Supreme Court directions on storing seized and prohibited drugs in the police stations by creating a separate exclusive storage.With use of biological and technical evidence becoming ever important, the MHA think-tank has said that there should be a separate refrigerated storage at every police station for biological evidence and electrostatic bags with labels and tagging for electronic evidence.Read more: India rejects SGPC request for Jatha’s travel to Pak, cites threat to safetyIt said there was also an urgent need to revisit the police manuals/regulations in the light of changes in laws, forensics/technology, and judicial pronouncements to frame a written policy and bring out a procedural manual on maintaining Malkhanas.The report said if Malkhanas are maintained efficiently, it would reduce the burden on the state exchequer as a result of saving where evidence is stored and ensuring timely justice.“It is true that seized items are decaying in the police stations due to improper handling and training,” said N Rao, a retired Delhi Police deputy commissioner of police. “The police stations have limited space and items are not claimed by owners for years. Such a report by BPRD should be implemented for better management.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-chalks-up-plan-to-protect-police-evidence-101613605155608.html
18-02-2021||India||Petrol hits ₹100/L in Rajasthan's Sri Ganganagar, nears ₹90/L in Delhi||The price of petrol touched ₹100 a litre in a Rajasthan district and rose to record highs elsewhere, even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi criticised the governments that came before his for not doing enough to address India’s dependance on imports for oil, and petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan appealed to major oil producers to relax their self-imposed production cuts.The retail price of petrol crossed ₹100 per litre in Rajasthan’s Sri Ganganagar on Wednesday, the first time the fuel was sold at rates in the three digits anywhere in the country, as rising global crude oil prices and tight fiscal headroom appeared to limit the government’s ability to restrain the spike. In Delhi, petrol retailed at ₹89.54 a litre.The government has urged the oil producers’ cartel – the Organisation of Petrol Exporting Countries (OPEC) – as well as allies such as Russia to ease production cuts as higher prices are hitting demand and adding to inflation.“We witnessed the largest oil supply cut in history to match the massive global demand destruction ever... With the advent of Covid-19 vaccines and a better understanding of the pandemic, we are now witnessing the revival of economies and energy demand. We have to build back better collectively...,” petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan said at an international symposium attended by officials from several oil producing nations as well as representatives of the International Energy Agency and International Energy Forum, which organised the video conference.“We need to adopt a balanced approach at this juncture. It is in this spirit of allowing demand recovery to take primacy over crude prices, at least over the next few months, I am appealing for easing of production cuts by the key oil exporting countries, including the OPEC and OPEC Plus group. I have always maintained that prices should be reasonable and responsible, which means that we do not favour too low crude prices also,” he added.PM Modi, too, addressed the issue, though not specifically in the context of the price in Sri Ganganagar. “India imported over 85% of its oil needs in the 2019-20 financial year and nearly 53% of its gas requirement. Can we be so import dependent? I don’t want to criticise anyone but I want to say (that) had we focussed on this subject earlier, our middle-class would not have been burdened,” he said at a virtual function to inaugurate oil and gas projects in poll-bound Tamil Nadu.Read more: On rising petrol, diesel prices, Surjewala makes sharp attack at govt with 'fuel loot' tweetHe invited the “world to come and invest in India’s energy sector”, pointing out that the country is spending ₹7.5 lakh crore over the next five years to develop oil and gas infrastructure. By 2030, India will generate 40% of all its energy needs from renewable sources, the Prime Minister added.Wednesday’s spike reignited the debate over government taxes. Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot said in the state assembly on Monday that the Union government was “responsible for the high fuel prices by not reducing the taxes”.“If we reduce the taxes than our revenue will decline. In view of the public sentiments, despite the pandemic, the state reduced 2% VAT (value added tax) bringing a loss of ₹1,000 crore. Now, the Centre should reduce the taxes to lessen the burden on people,” he said.Taxes account for more than 60% of the pump price of fuel. Part of these are central taxes and part, those levied by the state. In the case of Delhi, data available on the Indian Oil website shows that central excise duty and state value added taxes added ₹32.9 and ₹20.61 per litre to the cost of petrol. The base price, freight and dealer commission amounted to just ₹35.78 per litre for petrol. In effect, almost 60% of what people pay for petrol is taxes.Read more: Petrol, diesel prices rise in Delhi for 9th day in a row, up by 25 paise eachSri Ganganagar pays the highest rate for the fuel since it is the furthest from a nearby dispatching facility, which adds to transportation costs that is passed on to the consumer.According to an official who asked not to be named, the government is not considering reducing the excise duty on fuel because of revenue concerns. “India’s fiscal deficit is quite high at 9.5% of GDP [gross domestic product] in 2020-21 because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Budget has also proposed ₹12 lakh crore borrowings in FY22 that would mean a high fiscal deficit of 6.8% next fiscal year. In these circumstances, the government has no space to immediately cut excise duties of petrol and diesel,” this person said, asking not to be named.SC Sharma, an energy expert and former officer on special duty at the erstwhile Planning Commission, said: “In spite of much lower global oil demand, the restricted supplies and production cuts by oil exporting countries are some of the major reasons for high oil prices... An increase of 27.5% within one-and-a-half month is too sharp even at a time when Covid pandemic is not subdued and a number of European countries are under partial lockdown.”“It is believed that a gradual production increase was part of the agenda with 0.5 million barrels per day in the January 4 meeting of OPEC. However, subsequent to the meeting Saudi Arabia announced 1 million barrels per day of voluntary oil production cuts. In a situation when markets are recovering globally, such a high production cut could be one of the reasons for a price spike in a short period of time,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petrol-hits-rs-100-l-in-delhi-nears-rs-90-in-rajasthan-s-sri-ganganagar-101613604967184.html
18-02-2021||India||Toolkit case: Nikita Jacob gets pre-arrest bail||The Bombay high court on Wednesday granted protection from arrest for three weeks to Mumbai-based lawyer Nikita Jacob, accused of helping edit a social media toolkit on the farm protests, even as Delhi Police said it was expanding its probe into the alleged plot to foment unrest in the Capital.Jacob, 30, applied for transit anticipatory bail after a non-bailable warrant was issued against her in Delhi earlier this week. The 30-year-old approached the high court after Delhi Police’s cyber crime unit raided her residence on February 11, and seized her computer and phone in connection with the toolkit.Another activist, Beed resident Shantanu Muluk, who is accused of creating the document, already received protection from arrest for 10 days by the high court on Tuesday; climate activist Disha Ravi is in jail in Delhi and faces charges of sedition, criminal conspiracy and intending to riot.Read more: Toolkit case: Some relief for activists as police defend actionThe police’s decision to charge Bengaluru-based Ravi has stoked allegations of muzzling dissent and procedural lapses – though the police have repeatedly denied these charges.“The applicant (Jacob) apprehends that she will be arrested at any point of time. She has to make arrangements to seek relief from a court in another state. Hence, this court is of the opinion that protection as sought by the applicant can be granted for a temporary period,” justice PD Naik said.The court said if Jacob is arrested in the three-week period, then she shall be released after furnishing a bond of ₹25,000. “There is nothing in the toolkit about violence, it is only for creating awareness about farm laws, it’s not for creating violence,” said Sanjukta Dey, Jacob’s lawyer.Delhi Police say the document, first publicised by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg on February 3 in support of farmers agitating against three central laws, aimed to spread misinformation, incite unrest and was linked to clashes in the Capital on Republic Day.Read more: Toolkit was only to educate people on farm stir: Nikita JacobOn Wednesday, Delhi Police said the activists prepared a second document to organise a Twitter storm aimed at “creating unrest” in the Capital on February 4 and 5 but could not execute it. Investigators said the second document was created by Jacob, Muluk and a UK-based activist identified as Marina Patterson, who is allegedly linked with the global movement “Extinction Rebellion” also referred to as “XR”. According to its website, Extinction Rebellion is an international movement that uses non-violent civil disobedience in an attempt to halt mass extinction and minimise the risk of social collapse.“The plan mentioned in the second toolkit, however, could not be executed. We suspect it happened because the toolkit was accidentally tweeted by Thunberg on February 3, the day Ravi shared it with her and coaxed her to act on it. Since the Google toolkit documents contained objectionable content, Ravi panicked, asked Greta to delete the tweet, took the admin rights and removed her name from the toolkit,” said a senior police officer associated with the case, requesting anonymity.Read more: Will ask ‘toolkit’ suspect why he was at Tikri on R-Day: CopsPolice said they will now focus on the woman identified as Patterson. “The UK-based woman joined them. She made a package and added to the document through hyperlink. The toolkit was accidentally published when she was simultaneously editing it. She wrote that police are attacking protesters... many injured, many disappearing and many individuals are already reported dead. This was created to mislead in future,” a second police officer said.Investigators also focused on a WhatsApp group named “International Farmers Strike” allegedly created on December 6 by Ravi. Police said Jacob joined the group on December 11 while pro-Khalistani group Poetic Justice Foundation (PJF) members joined it the following day.Read more: HT Editorial: Disha Ravi’s arrest is wrongMuluk was added on December 6 and the trio allegedly attended a virtual meeting by PJF on January 11.The activists denied the charges with Jacob’s lawyers telling the high court that the toolkit meant to provide digital support for the farmers’ protest and not violence.Muluk’s father Shivlal Muluk also told Beed Police that a computer hard disk and other items were seized from their house, allegedly without a search warrant, on February 12, according to PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/toolkit-case-nikita-jacob-gets-pre-arrest-bail-101613604838405.html
18-02-2021||India||24 diplomats visit J&K in third delegation since Article 370 move||A group of 24 foreign envoys began a two-day visit to Jammu and Kashmir on Wednesday under a government initiative to showcase efforts to restore normalcy and boost development in the union territory.This is the third group of diplomats to visit Jammu and Kashmir since January 2020 and the first since the government’s efforts to take envoys to the region was interrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic. The visit has been organised following the conduct of District Development Council (DDC) elections in November-December and restoration of high speed 4G mobile internet earlier this month.The group includes European Union (EU) ambassador Ugo Astuto, and ambassadors of key European states such as French envoy Emmanuel Lenain, Italian envoy Vincenzo de Luca, Swedish envoy Klas Molin, Irish envoy Brendan Ward and Dutch envoy Marten van den Berg. The neighbourhood was represented by Bangladeshi envoy Muhammad Imran.Watch: 24 foreign envoys reach J&K’s Srinagar to assess situationPeople familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity the group represents various geographical regions such as Africa, South America and Asean, and also included the envoys of Brazil, Cuba, Estonia, Finland, Tajikistan, Portugal, Malawi, Eritrea, Cote d’Ivore, Ghana, Senegal, Malaysia, Bolivia, Belgium and Kyrgyzstan.Tight security arrangements were put in place for the visit. A spontaneous shutdown was observed in Srinagar, and all business and commercial areas were closed.Soon after their arrival in Srinagar, the envoys headed for Magam in Budgam district on the outskirts of the city, where they met DDC and panchayat members and local residents. The envoys also witnessed “Block Diwas”, a public outreach initiative organised every week by the local administration, and we’re briefed on people-centric schemes being implemented by the government.“The visit to Budgam provided the envoys an opportunity to interact and hear directly from the public and local representatives about the functioning and empowerment of grassroots democratic institutions, devolution of power, developmental activities, and grievance redress mechanisms,” said one of the people cited above.The DDC chairman of Budgam, Nazir Ahmad Khan, who met the envoys with a group of DDC and panchayat members, said he had briefed the group about the panchayat system and the recent DDC elections.Read more: 'Impressive': Foreign envoys after visiting Jammu and Kashmir"I expressed appreciation for the civil and police administration for the peaceful conduct of the elections and the restoration of grassroots democracy.

However, a group of DDC and panchayat members of the PAGD were not allowed by the administration to meet the envoys."We are also elected members but we were not allowed to move out from our rooms to convey our viewpoint to the envoys," said a DDC member from Budgam who declined to be identified.In the afternoon, the envoys met different groups at the Sher-e-Kashmir International Conference Centre (SKICC) on the banks of the Dal Lake. During a meeting with members of civil society, some of the envoys asked the participants how they were selected for the meeting with the diplomats.Read more: Effort to mislead global community: Pakistan on visit of foreign envoys to J-KThe mayor of Srinagar, chairpersons of urban local bodies, Block Development Councils (BDCs) and DDCs outlined their vision for development-centric administration in the decentralised grassroots framework.The group also visited the Hazratbal shrine and meet a small group of local journalists in the evening to make a first-hand assessment of the situation in Jammu and Kashmir. A cultural event was also organised for the envoys in the evening.The president of the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Shiekh Ashiq, said his organisation didn’t receive any invitation to meet the envoys.Security was tight across Srinagar, and especially around the SKICC, where the envoys held their meetings.

18-02-2021||India||Israel researchers test drug to prevent severe Covid cases||Researchers from Israel claim to have developed a drug that can help modulate the immune system and prevent a cytokine storm – a condition in which the body’s immune response goes into an overdrive and starts attacking its own tissues and organs – in patients of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). It is the cytokine storm that leads to the deaths of most patients with the viral infection.The drug, which is inhaled just like asthma medication, has been administered to 35 Covid-19 patients in different doses at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center–Ichilov Hospital. The researchers said that there was a marked improvement in their oxygen saturation and respiratory rate after the drug was administered for five days.Read more: In one US city, coronavirus vaccines for everyone 18 and overThe last patient to have been administered the medicine is still under follow-up after which the researchers will publish the data, they said in an online press briefing on Wednesday.The drug uses enriched exosomes released by cell membranes for intercellular communication from a protein called CD24. This, the researchers hypothesise, prevents the inflammatory stimuli from interacting with the body’s immune cells as well as blocking the receptor that regulates the body’s immune response to the tissue injuries.“This gives us a lot of hope. However, we cannot say it is an effective drug till we have studies comparing the therapy with placebo in randomised control trial. Our solution is fast and efficient as it can be given nasally and goes directly to the lungs. It is also easy to produce. Once proven, we can supply it to the world within a few months,” said professor Nadir Arber, Director of the Integrated Cancer Prevention Centre at the hospital.Read more: When will Covid-19 vaccine be available in open market? AIIMS Director answersThe doctors have not seen any side effects of the drug in the 35 patients, they said. The researchers are currently looking at collaborations with other countries for the phase II and III trials of the drug.In pre-clinical trials on mice, the doctors also noticed that there weren’t any lung lesions, according to the research. In Covid-19 patients, the cytokine storm damages the lung tissue, which while healing hardens, leading to a condition called Fibrosis that reduces the capacity of the lungs.Watch: Covid update: India invites Pakistan; UK to infect volunteers; new flight rules||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/israel-researchers-test-drug-to-prevent-severe-covid-cases-101613593282769.html
18-02-2021||India||Bihar CM Nitish Kumar once again bats for caste-based census||Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Wednesday once again batted for caste-based census in the state.“I have been saying for a long time that once caste-based census must be done, as it will give a clear idea about the population of different castes. It will help in planning for them,” he said.Kumar said that he also sent two resolutions, passed by the Bihar Legislature, to the Centre in this regard. “It should be done once to clear the picture. It was done earlier, but since Independence it has not happened. Therefore, we need it to happen,” he said, while talking to the media at the party office.Kumar said that Bihar already has clearly identified backward classes and extremely backward classes since the days of Karpoori Thakur government. “We want the Centre to adopt the same for more benefit to the people. At present, there is only one category at the Centre,” he added.Kumar’s statement is significant in the wake of the Justice Rohini Commission’s proposal for sub-categorisation of reservation for other backward castes (OBCs) in the government sector. The commission has recommended splitting 27% reservation for the OBCs into different categories for equitable distribution of benefits among different sub-castes to ensure that the benefits reached the really deprived sections.The commission was set up in 2017 to look into the issue of sub-categorisation of within the OBCs. After several extensions, it submitted its report earlier this month, diving 2633 OBC castes in the Central list into four sub-categories for split of 27% quota into 2, 6, 9 and 10%.Though there is no official data available on the actual strengths of different castes, all the estimates are based on projections from old caste census, which was last done in 1931. There have often been demands for it and some initiatives were also taken, but it could not materialize, even as caste remained an overriding factor for getting the electoral arithmetic right. Only the economic data could come out.As per projections from figures of 1931 Census for specific Hindu castes and 1961 Census for all others, backward classes constitute 51.3% population in the state. Many political parties feel the numbers have changed and a fresh caste-based census is the need of the hour.Social economic and caste census (SECC) - 2011 was carried out by state rural development departments on instructions of central rural development ministry. However, caste data could not be made public citing discrepancies. Till date, census only makes count of religion and also the SC/ST population.In 2019, the Bihar Legislative Assembly had passed two government resolutions – one favouring caste-wise census in 2021 and another for continuing with the old 200-point roster system, which treats university as the unit, not the 13-point roster system that treats department as the unit.In 2020, ahead of the state elections, the Bihar Assembly again passed two resolutions – one against the contentious National Register of Citizens (NRC) exercise in the state and another for caste-based census in 2021.

How can we implement them?" said Sarma, also the convenor of the North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), the regional arm of the NDA.The recommendations go against many Supreme Court judgements, he said at the launch of his book, "Eta Saponar Pom Khedi (Chasing a dream)", comprising 25 of his speeches.The apex court had ordered that reservations cannot exceed 50 per cent, but the panel's report suggested more than that, he added."Why did the committee not consider Supreme Court judgements? The recommendations would have to be vetted by a legal committee. I think those were not recommendations, but their (panel's) expectations only," the BJP leader said.He, however, said that the BJP-led government is implementing the Clause-6 in its own way following the Constitution and the Supreme Court rulings.On February 11, Assam Governor Jagdish Mukhi said in the assembly that the state is still examining the Clause-6 report, prepared by Justice Biplab Kumar Sarma-led High-Level Committee (HLC) of the Union Home Ministry, and has not forwarded it to the Union government for consideration.Alleging that the government was "sitting idle" on the issue, the All Assam Students' Union (AASU) and Arunachal Pradesh Advocate General Nilay Dutta, who were part of the committee, on August 11 last year released the confidential report, saying that the public has the right to know the contents.As per the Clause 6 of the Assam Accord, Constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards, as may be appropriate, shall be provided to protect, preserve and promote the culture, social, linguistic identity and heritage of the Assamese people.The bone of contention since the signing of the Accord on August 15, 1985 has been the definition of Assamese people, which the committee tried to fix as the tribal, indigenous and all other Indian citizens residing within the territory of Assam as per the First Schedule of the Constitution on or before January 1, 1951 along with their descendants.Talking about the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, Sarma said the rules of the law, when framed, will have "striking balance" between advantages given to Hindu immigrants and interests of the Assamese people."My job is to strike a balance between Hindus and Assamese. I take pride as a Hindu. If you are a Hindu, then we will accommodate everyone who is not a threat," he added.He said that people believing in other faiths can also be a Hindu if they consider 'Bharat' as their motherland."I don't see any Hindu in the world as separate from me. My definition is cultural and for that, you may call me communal or chauvinist," he added.The BJP leader said India was not created in 1947, but it was created 6,000 years ago.On AIUDF chief Badruddin Ajmal, who has always been a target of Sarma, the senior BJP leader said that the Lok Sabha MP from Dhubri is alleged to have received funds from groups having links with Islamic terror groups.Ajmal heads All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) which has 14 MLAs mostly from the minority Muslims dominated areas of Assam at present. The party has teamed up with Congress and four other political parties to form a Grand Alliance against the ruling BJP in the assembly election likely to be held in March-April.Referring to the philanthropic activities on health and education sector by the Ajmal Foundation' set up by the AIUDF chief, Sarma said, "Do you want an IAS officer who is educated on funds from Islamic terror groups?"On his repeated usage of the phrase 'clash of civilisation' while referring to Ajmal, the minister said that it is just "a political word and not related to any person".Sarma said the BJP manifesto for the coming assembly election "will have a message of staunch nationalism with positive regionalism."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/panels-recommendations-far-from-legal-reality-can-t-be-implemented-himanta-101613592840585.html
18-02-2021||India||Uttarakhand fails to deliver early warning system 8 years after it was promised||Bharat Singh, a resident of Raini village was out with some more villagers on the hill behind his village on February 7 morning when they noticed a cloud of dust and ice heading for their village flowing through Rishi Ganga river with fierce speed.“I told myself it’s the glacier. The glacier is heading for us. We called company people (Rishi Ganga hydropower project 13.2 MW) frantically to warn them. They thought it was a joke. Then we realised Rishi Ganga project’s alarm system failed and in no time everything was engulfed,” said Singh.Warning systems failed both at Rishi Ganga and Tapovan Vishnugad hydropower project. A senior national thermal power corporation (NTPC) official at the disaster site said: “We had a system of dependence. We had an understanding that whenever water levels rise in Rishi Ganga project barrage, they communicate it to us and we inform projects downstream. But this time there was no time to respond. The volume of debris and ice was so massive alarm systems couldn’t trigger. It has now been decided that a government backed early warning system will be installed for projects here to monitor glaciers.”Watch: After Chamoli flood, why Char Dham road project is in spotlight: Ground Report“Some authorities are saying they knew a lake had formed on the glacier then why wasn't it shared with us? People are dying here and there is no warning? This winter was very warm and there was no snowfall here,” said Radha Devi of Raini village.The decision to install an early warning system comes nearly 8 years after the Union environment ministry had said in an affidavit that Uttarakhand urgently needed a flood forecasting network. An expert body appointed by SC in 2013 had observed that lack of disaster preparedness was a dangerous lacuna.Read more: Not just climate change, Chamoli disaster was human-inducedAn affidavit by MoEFCC dated December 17, 2015 said the EB headed by Ravi Chopra, director of Dehradun-based People's Science Institute had observed “very poor performance and a dangerous lacuna in terms of the disaster preparedness of existing as well as under construction hydro-electric projects. According to EB, the operation of barrages during extreme events leaves a lot of ambiguity as to when the gates should be fully lifted. Without any real time flood forecasting network or an automated weather station upstream and the possibility of massive landslides, blocking of the barrages is a hazard in June when the snow melt component is very high,” underlining that to mitigate the threat a real time flood forecasting network or automated weather stations are required. The probability of errant monsoon behaviour is only likely to increase with global warming, the affidavit had said.HT sent a query to MoEFCC on Monday as to why an early warning system hadn't been put in place in all these years. MoEFCC officials haven't replied to the query yet.Read more: 'No new lake, it's part of bigger one that caused Chamoli disaster': ExpertsIndia Meteorological Department doesn't yet have any weather monitoring stations in the higher reaches. “We don't monitor glaciers and avalanche warnings are normally issued by Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment of DRDO. We are trying to strengthen our network but as of today we don't have monitoring stations above 3500 metres,” said Anand Sharma, additional director general, IMD.“Early flood warning is definitely possible and should be implemented immediately. We need continuous monitoring of water levels, velocity and volumes in high valleys also. Indian Himalayas have 10,000 glaciers. Over 1000 are in Uttarakhand so it's not possible to monitor them individually. But we need remote sensing information and identification of hazardous ones where may be large lakes have formed. Avalanches also need continuous monitoring,” said DP Dobhal, retired geologist at Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology in Dehradun.“There can be a system of alarm triggering during high rainfall or high snowfall particularly in landslide prone zones just like the Tsunami warning system that exists,” said DS Pai.Read more: Visit Uttarakhand without fear: State govt to tourists after Chamoli disasterLocals say alarm systems in hydropower projects have often failed. For some the Feb 7 disaster brings fears of the 2013 flash flood experience.“It was peak of the Chardham yatra in June. Water levels started rising in the Alaknanda at around 6 pm. I was at home. My house is half km away from Alaknanda bank. There was no alarm whatsoever from the dam. By 5 am next morning the river had engulfed a part of our house. We later realised water levels had gone up because all the muck and debris that had been dumped on the riverbed by the hydropower project. Around 86 homes had been inundated by Alaknanda. We live in fear every day,” recollected Chandramohan Bhatt, Srinagar Bandh Apda Sangharsh Samiti head.In a letter to SC dated February 13, Ravi Chopra has written that implementing the EB's recommendation of a flood warning system could have saved hundreds of lives at Rishi Ganga and Tapovan Vishnugad projects.Read more: Wadia institute scientists visit Chamoli disaster site, explain what caused itThe EB report submitted in April 2014 had highlighted the potential threat of paraglacial zones (above 2500 metres), valleys north of the Main Central Thrust (MCT), and emphasized them as disaster-prone areas. The EB recommended that hydropower projects not be built in these valleys.“I have never heard of any alarm systems in dams or hydropower projects triggering. I don't think these projects have a system for early evacuation in the event of a disaster like we saw on February 7. We believe this is a case of criminal negligence. Despite several disasters killing thousands of lives, the state has failed to provide basic warning and disaster preparedness infrastructure,” said Vimal Bhai of Matu Jansangathan which works on environmental issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-fails-to-deliver-early-warning-system-8-years-after-it-was-promised-101613565935204.html
18-02-2021||India||Centre denies Char Dham road expansion link to Chamoli disaster||The Centre told the Supreme Court on Wednesday that the recent Chamoli tragedy had no link with the ongoing Char Dham road expansion project as alleged by the head of the High-Powered Committee in a letter written to the Supreme Court last week. The Committee was formed by the Supreme Court to examine the environmental damage resulting out of the project.The High-Powered Committee (HPC) Chairman Ravi Chopra in his recent letter dated February 13 said, “The recent disaster in the Rishiganga valley is located in the region north of the main central thrust (MCT), which is highly prone to landslides, flash floods and earthquake. A section of the defense road to the Indo-China border and a bridge across the Rishiganga river on that road have been swept away, lending credence to our argument for disaster resilience in the region. Vulnerability and disaster proneness of this region is bound to increase with extensive disturbances like deforestation, slope cutting, blasting, tunneling, damming of rivers, excessive tourism, etc. The cumulative impact of such activities on the nearby glaciers cannot be ignored.”Read more: 'No new lake, it's part of bigger one that caused Chamoli disaster': ExpertsThe letter further stated that several chronic landslide-prone locations and stretches, where the slope stability is precarious, exist on the three Char Dham highways identified by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) as defence feeder roads. The Ministry of Road, Transport and Highways (MoRTH) data submitted to the HPC have identified 161 sensitive locations in 574 km (on NH-94 Rishikesh to Uttarkashi, NH-58 Rishikesh to Mana and NH-125 Tanakpur to Pithoragarh), about one location every 3.5 km.Watch: After Chamoli flood, why Char Dham road project is in spotlight: Ground ReportThe Centre received Chopra’s letter on Tuesday and for this reason could not file its response to the same. On Wednesday, when the Court took up the Char Dham road project matter pending consideration in a petition filed by NGO Citizens for Green Doon, Attorney General KK Venugopal appeared for MoD seeking time for filing a response to HPC Chairman’s letter.“Yesterday we received the letter by the Chairman, HPC which he has written on his own behalf. These are unwarranted comments not based on facts. We would like to reply to it in two weeks,” AG Venugopal said. The bench of Justices RF Nariman, Hemant Gupta and BR Gavai adjourned the matter by two weeks at the request of the top law officer.Read more: Not just climate change, Chamoli disaster was human-inducedThe HPC had on December 31, 2020 given its approval for the expansion of the Chard Dham project roads after the MoD demanded these roads to have a double-lane carriageway width of 7 metre (or 7.5 metre in case there is a raised kerb) to facilitate movement of heavy vehicles carrying troops, self-propelled artillery and other heavy machinery by the Army. The Court had asked the HPC to consider this request of the MoD as the earlier prescribed width according to MoRTH notification was 5.5 metre. HPC Chairman refused to go with the majority view and gave a separate report along with two other members.In his letter to the SC, Chopra further stated that had the 2014 recommendation of an expert body (EB) chaired by him following the 2013 disaster in Uttarakhand been followed, the recent Chamoli tragedy could be averted.VS Khaira, chief engineer, regional office of ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) Uttarakhand and project in-charge of Char Dham road project, said, “We will submit our response to the points raised in the letter (by HPC Chairman) in two weeks’ time.”Read more: Wadia institute scientists visit Chamoli disaster site, explain what caused itChopra further stated in the letter that EB had recommended that hydro electric projects (HEPs) should not be built in these valleys “based on field visits, scientific publications, government reports and eye-witness reports” that provided evidence of irreversible damage to the Ganga river system’s Himalayan ecology.The EB’s recommendations were accepted by the Central Government and submitted to the top court in the form of an affidavit in 2014. “The flood-related concerns in all existing projects including shortcomings of Tehri Dam were also highlighted and recommendations were made by the EB to develop and install the flood warning mechanism. Had these concerns and recommendations been adopted, the massive loss of lives and property could have been avoided in the Rishi Ganga and Tapovan Vishnugad projects”, the letter states.Read more: Visit Uttarakhand without fear: State govt to tourists after Chamoli disasterFollowing the EB recommendation, the Supreme Court had stayed work on 24 proposed HEPs. But all under-construction projects continued their construction unhindered. “Instead of recognizing the sensitive nature of the area which is prone to disaster, the Union Ministries, MoRTH and MoD have been shifting their positions,” Chopra said in his letter referring to the SC judgment in 2013 in the Kedarnath tragedy case where it expressed concern that “with the mushrooming of large number of hydroelectric projects in the State of Uttarakhand…the cumulative impact of those project components like dams, tunnels, blasting, power-house, muck disposal, mining, deforestation etc. on eco-system, is yet to be scientifically examined.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-denies-char-dham-road-expansion-link-to-chamoli-disaster-101613591261625.html

The organization alleged the laws led to the harassment of a large number of Muslim men and hence there was a need to oppose the legislation.On January 6 this year, the Supreme Court had issued notice to the Centre and the states of Uttarakhand and UP on two petitions challenging the validity of the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Ordinance, 2020 and the Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion Act, 2018. One of the petitions was filed by CJP, run by social activist Teesta Setalvad.Read more: SC denies registering suo motu contempt against Rajdeep SardesaiThe NGO moved an application to amend its petition by including two other similar anti-conversion laws passed by Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh.

18-02-2021||India||Journalist Priya Ramani acquitted in defamation case||A Delhi court on Wednesday acquitted journalist Priya Ramani in a criminal defamation case filed by former Union minister MJ Akbar after she accused him of sexual misbehaviour during a work interview in December 1993, and emphasised in its judgment that the right to protect one’s reputation cannot be at the cost of a woman’s right to dignity.The court pointed out that even a person of high social standing can be a sexual harasser, and that a woman cannot be punished for raising instances of abuse.“The right of reputation cannot be protected at the cost of the right of life and dignity of woman as guaranteed in Indian Constitution under Article 21, and right of equality before law and equal protection of law as guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution,” additional chief metropolitan magistrate (ACMM) Ravindra Pandey said.“The woman has a right to put her grievance at any platform of her choice and even after decades,” the judgment stated.Shortly after the verdict, delivered at Delhi’s Rouse Avenue court, Ramani said it would “encourage more women to speak up”. Her lawyer Rebecca John said that the “path-breaking judgment” had upheld that “no truth is exempted from the purview of defamation; it has to be made for public good and in public interest.”Akbar’s lawyers said that they would comment only after studying the judgment.Read more: 'Priya Ramani stood up for all who screamed #MeToo': Twitter exultsIn October 2018, Ramani shared an article on Twitter which she had written in 2017 in Vogue India magazine following allegations of sexual assault and misconduct against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein made by several women as part of the Me Too movement in the United States. The article did not name MJ Akbar -- it described her experience of an interview with a newspaper editor for a reporter’s position -- but the Tweet did.Akbar, who was a minister in the BJP-led cabinet at the time resigned shortly after a host of women, besides Ramani, made allegations of sexual misconduct and harassment against him in the wake of the Me Too movement.He, however, filed a criminal defamation suit under Section 500 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), arguing that the incident was not as she described it in her article. He also said that a tweet by Ramani describing him as a “predator” had caused irreparable damage to his reputation.Read more: MJ Akbar defamation case: Judge quotes Mahabharata, Ramayana on importance of a woman's dignityAkbar’s lawyer Geeta Luthra argued that Ramani’s statements on Twitter were “per se defamatory” and questioned her decision to speak up several years after the purported incident. Luthra also pointed out during the course of the hearing—which spanned three years and saw two routine transfers of the ACMM—that Ramani had no evidence in the form of CCTV footage or phone records to back her claim.But the court, in its verdict, recognised that no legal remedies were available to Ramani when she was sexually harassed — the Vishaka Guidelines against sexual harassment, the Sexual Harassment of the Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act and Section 354 A which made sexual harassment a criminal offence, only came up in the subsequent years— and that many women opt not to complain even now due to the fear of stigma.“Most of the women who suffer abuse do not speak up about it for the simple reason of the shame or stigma attached with the sexual harassment. The sexual abuse, if committed against woman, takes away her dignity and her self confidence,” ACMM Dubey said.“The ‘glass ceiling’ will not prevent the Indian women as a road block for their advancement in the society, if equal opportunity and social protection be given to them,” the judgment stated.The judge accepted the argument put forward by John that the complainant MJ Akbar was not a man of stellar reputation on the basis of the testimonies put forward by Ramani and her witnesses, journalists Ghazala Wahab and Niloufer Venkatraman. Wahab had also levelled charges of sexual harassment against Akbar.“The court said I believe Priya Ramani, and I believe her truth… Not every truth is exempted from the purview of defamation. It has to be made for public good and in public interest. Given that sexual harassment at the workplace is one such truth, it was a defence we took and which the court upheld,” John said.“This is an exceedingly significant judgment because it upholds the dignity of women and finds that it is no less than the reputation of men in claims of defamation on account of accusations of sexual harassment or assault. The judgment also recognises that safety at the workplace is an extremely important feature for any woman to grow in her career, and that it is part of the fundamental right to life and livelihood,” advocate Mrunalini Deshmukh said.“However, as much as we must hail the victory as upholding women’s dignity and their safety at the workplace, it also puts a lot of responsibility on women to ensure that the law is followed and not abused,” she said.The case was first heard by ACMM Samar Vishal who was replaced by Vishal Pahuja in 2019. In a routine transfer late last year, Ravindra Pandey took over as ACMM of this court, which has been designated to fast-track cases against members of parliament and legislators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/journalist-priya-ramani-acquitted-in-defamation-case-101613588171536.html

18-02-2021||India||Popular Bengali actor joins BJP, another movie veteran and TMC MLA wants to quit||There were ripples in Bengal’s movie industry on Wednesday when Yash Dasgupta, a young and popular movie star, joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) while veteran actor and two-time Trinamool Congress (TMC) legislator Chiranjit Chakraborty wrote to chief minister Mamata Banerjee that he would quit politics if the party decided not to field him for the assembly polls to be held in March-April.A day after Bengal’s most popular actor and Bollywood veteran Mithun Chakraborty made headlines by hosting Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat at his Mumbai bungalow, stoking speculation on his return to politics, the Bengal unit of the BJP made noticeable inroads into Tollywood, as the state’s movie industry is popularly called since most of the studios are located in south Kolkata’s Tollygunge area. Chakraborty was a Rajya Sabha member of the TMC till he resigned from the Upper House in 2016.The BJP started to increase its presence in Tollywood soon after it won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019. On July 18 that year, as many as 13 actors joined the BJP in Delhi and Kolkata. While none of them are stars, all are popular faces on television or the big screen. For chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who has several actors among her former or sitting MPs and MLAs, this was embarrassing because most of those who joined the BJP criticised ruling party leaders of controlling the industry and not letting people work freely.“I am still young in the industry but I know that politics is not a bad thing. Politics is about change. If you want to change the system you have to be part of the system. I don’t want to remain just an actor. The BJP has always put its faith in the youth. I believe that I will get the opportunity to work,” said 35-year-old Yash Dasgupta after joining the party along with more than half a dozen actors, including Papiya Adhikari, a veteran.Dasgupta is known to be a close friend of TMC Lok Sabha member and popular star Nusrat Jahan. “Nusrat and I are good friends as actors. Our political identity has nothing to do with our friendship,” he said.The actors were welcomed into the BJP by national vice-president Mukul Roy, national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya and Rajya Sabha member Swapan Dasgupta at the party’s new media centre set up at a star-hotel in south Kolkata.“The BJP is not contesting the Bengal polls merely to capture power. We want to revive Bengal’s old glory that showed the path to the rest of the nation,” said Vijayvargiya.In an almost parallel development, Chiranjit Chakraborty, the TMC’s sitting legislator from Barasat in North 24 Parganas and who shared screen space with Mithun Chakraborty in several movies, told television channels that he had informed the chief minister about his desire to quit politics and return to acting if the party decides not to field him again.“When I was fielded for the first time in 2011, I told her that I do not belong to the world of politics. I did not want to contest in 2016 as well but she insisted that I must. I want to make it clear that I will never join any other party if I quit politics,” he said.Interestingly, speculations started since Tuesday about Prasenjit Chatterjee, another famous and award-winning actor.Anirban Ganguly, a senior member of the BJP’s think tank, met Chatterjee, the state’s most popular face among senior actors and son of former Bollywood superstar Biswajit, at the latter’s residence and presented the actor a copy of his book on Amit Shah. Since Biswajit joined the BJP in Delhi in January 2019, the meeting stoked rumours that his son, too, might join the saffron camp.Ganguly said the meeting had nothing to do with politics. “I met him at a personal level. Prasenjit is an icon in Bengal. Not everything should be judged from the political point of view. He has great regard for the Prime Minister and the Union home minister. We often meet eminent people only to interact and exchange views. Amit Shah started this,” Ganguly told HT.Till Wednesday evening, no TMC leader reacted to so many actors joining the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/popular-bengali-actor-joins-bjp-another-movie-veteran-and-tmc-mla-wants-to-quit-101613585867092.html
18-02-2021||India||India calls for 'fresh' trade talks with US||India has called for a “fresh package” for trade talks with the United States and the new Biden administration that will go beyond, this time, the “nitpicking” and the constant shifting of goalposts that had bogged down the last round of discussions with the Trump administration.India and the United States had failed to agree on a deal that was pared down considerably in expectations to a “mini” agreement — also called an “interim” deal — to allow for a quick resolution of some long-standing issues that could pave the way for a more ambitious free trade agreement at a future date.Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal said Wednesday he will “engage with the new USTR (US trade representative) to try and put together a fresh package. I think the old one is now off the table. We’ll have to all look afresh at different ideas and see how our engagement in the future can, really, course-correct some of the problems that we’ve seen in the past”.Goyal and his US counterpart, Katherine Tai, the nominee for USTR have yet to meet or hold talks yet primarily because she had yet to be confirmed by US senate.Read more: To work towards inclusive Indo-Pacific, Quad to hold 3rd ministerial meet todayThe last round of trade talks between Goyal and Robert Lighthizer, who was the USTR for former President Donald Trump, had failed despite clear expectations of a resolution being close at hand. Goyal, in fact, had one stage expressed optimism that a deal was just a few phone-calls away.Indian officials have long complained, but privately, the Trump administration had kept adding to their list of asks and, pushing away an agreement every time it looked imminent.“I think the last time around when we were discussing, we were nitpicking with very small issues and changing the goalposts in every subsequent conversation,” Minister Goyal said at a virtual event hosted by the US-India Business Council (USIBC), conveying India’s frustration for the first time perhaps in such sharp terms.Read more: Kamala Harris as vice president further cements India-US ties: White House“I do hope this time around we can look at the big picture,” he said. “We have to sort out some of the issues which are much more relevant to a larger engagement and leave some of the small things, which earlier were kind of dealbreakers and therefore, a lot of management bandwidth or political bandwidth was going into very small issues. I think we need to leave those aside and move into the orbit of a much greater engagement.”Trade differences have been the single largest drag on India-US bilateral ties. They have withstood the growing trajectory in every other sphere and aspect of the multi-faceted engagement spanning across a wide spectrum, everything from cooperation on space to healthcare to defense and IT.The Trump administration had terminated India’s special benefits under a US trade programme to force India to give US companies access to its dairy sector and free medical devices from price regulations. Other elements got tacked as the US side tried to maximize its gains.Read more: US leaders dial Indian counterparts; talk cooperation in defence, Indo-PacificMinister Goyal spoke briefly about one of them, US demands on pharmaceuticals and medical devices. “Your American pharma companies are unhappy about our desire not to allow evergreening of pharma products, and they change the molecule a little bit and they call it a new innovation”.Goyal was referring to incremental modifications pharmaceutical companies make to their existing medicines to qualify them for higher prices as “new inventions”, a process called “evergreening”. India does not recognize them these minor changes as inventions worthy of higher prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-calls-for-fresh-trade-talks-with-us-101613584022675.html

18-02-2021||India||Priya Ramani acquitted in MJ Akbar defamation case: What court said||Journalist Priya Ramani was acquitted by a Delhi court this afternoon over a defamation case filed by former Union minister MJ Akbar, whom she accused of sexual misconduct in 2018, at a time when the #MeToo campaign was sweeping across the globe.The court underscored that most women do not speak about harassment for the social stigma attached to it. “Right of the reputation cannot be protected at the cost of the right of a woman’s reputation guaranteed under Article 21,” the court said.Ramani, in a 2017 Vogue India article, detailed her experiences with a former boss, whom she called a “sexual predator”. Ramani, however, did not name MJ Akbar in the article. A year later, in 2018, Ramani named MJ Akbar in a tweet. The article led to more women coming out with their stories, alleging harassment at the hands of Akbar. Akbar, who was a junior minister in the first Modi government, filed a criminal defamation case against Ramani. The minister resigned shortly thereafter.The court’s top five observations:1) Two epics have been written to show the importance of dignity of a woman2) Sometimes even the victim does not understand as to what is happening. Despite going through extreme cruelty, the victim chooses to stay quiet.3) The court accepts the fact that complaint is not lodged due to the social stigma. The court said most women do not talk about the sexual harassment to prevent her dignity as she also has a family and has to go through the trauma.4) The court said that the victim has a right to put her grievance even after years and decades.5) The right of reputation cannot be protected at the cost of the right to dignity; right of reputation can't be weighed over the right of the life of a woman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priya-ramani-acquitted-in-mj-akbar-defamation-case-what-court-said-101613558090013.html

He also inaugurated the Chittaura Lake development project near the city.Read more: Behind PM Modi’s stinging critique of the IAS, a Jan meeting holds the clue“Those who enacted laws to invite foreign companies in Indian agriculture markets are trying to scare the people using names of Indian companies. The farmers are now exposing this politics of lies,” he said in his 30-minute speech.Though Modi did not elaborate or name any political party in this context, he was apparently referring to the Congress, which has supported the protest by farmers. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has in the past claimed that other parties too advocated farm reforms, but failed to implement them.Uttar Pradesh Congress leader Surendra Rajput said the PM should speak about the present, and not the past or the future. “He should remember he is holding the office of the Prime Minister of India, and not working as an actor,” Rajput said. PM’s remarks came at a time when thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, are camping on Delhi’s borders to protest the three laws passed by Parliament in September.Read more: PM Modi to address webinar for effective implementation of budget provisions in infrastructure sectorFarmers say the reforms would make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, erode their bargaining power and weaken the government’s minimum support price (MSP) system, which offers cultivators assured prices from the government, largely for wheat and rice. The government says the reforms were much-needed, will give farmers more options and eventually benefit them.AK Singh, former director at Giri Institute of Development Studies in Lucknow, said “both the advantages and apprehensions over the farm laws have been exaggerated”. “The PM should speak to farmers to work out a compromise on the issue.” Governor Anandiben Patel and chief minister Yogi Adityanath attended the programme organised to mark the birth anniversary of Suheldev, an icon of the state’s Rajbhar community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-small-farmers-already-benefiting-from-new-laws-101613497487010.html
