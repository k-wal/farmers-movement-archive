21-02-2021||India||Will soon visit Gujarat to mobilise support for farmers' protest: Rakesh Tikait||Farmer leader Rakesh Tikait on Sunday said he will soon be visiting Gujarat to drum up support for the movement against the Centre’s contentious farm laws.He said this as he met visiting groups of supporters from Gujarat and Maharashtra at Ghazipur on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border where he has been camping along with his supporters since November.The Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) national spokesperson also claimed that farmers will eventually not be able to take any part of their farm produce because the new laws will favour only the corporations.Citing an example, he said, “The milk produced in villages cost around ₹20-22 per litre but when it reaches cities through corporations, it costs consumers anywhere above ₹50 per litre.”“Now the corporations are building large storage houses and warehouses to store foodgrains and once there will be shortage in market, they will sell it at rates of their choice,” Tikait said, according to a statement issued by the BKU.“We will not let such a situation arise. We are only concerned about this and will not let corporate control crops in the country,” he said.Tikait was presented with a “charkha” (spinning wheel) by the visiting group from Gandhidham in Gujarat.“Gandhiji had used charkha to drive the British out of India. Now, we will use the charkha to drive out corporates. We will soon go to Gujarat and mobilise support for the farmers’ protest for repeal of the new laws,” he added.Meanwhile, over 20 women from Rohtak district of Haryana also joined the stir at Ghazipur and assured their support to the movement.Thousands of farmers are camping at Delhi border points of Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur with a demand that the Centre repeal the three new farm laws and make a new one guaranteeing minimum support price (MSP) for crops, fearing the legislations would hurt their livelihood.The government, which has held 11 rounds of formal talks with the protesting farmers unions, has maintained the laws are pro-farmer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-soon-visit-gujarat-to-mobilise-support-for-farmers-protest-rakesh-tikait-101613929895286.html

Five other agreements, including one for a $25-million line of credit for the development of roads, were signed on Saturday.The agreement between India’s EXIM Bank and the Maldivian government for the defence line of credit will facilitate capability building in the maritime domain, Jaishankar said without giving details.Cordial meeting with Defence Minister @MariyaDidi. Useful exchange on our defence cooperation. India will always be a reliable security partner for Maldives. pic.twitter.com/0TTZVAMRfJJaishankar and Maldives defence minister Mariya Didi signed the agreement to “develop, support and maintain” the Coast Guard harbour in Uthuru Thila Falhu. The two ministers also reviewed various facets of defence and security cooperation during their meeting. Jaishankar said India "will always be a reliable security partner".Didi said the harbour and dockyard will mark “another significant milestone” in bilateral defence cooperation, while Jaishankar said the facility will strengthen the capability of the Maldivian Coast Guard and facilitate regional humanitarian assistance and disaster relief efforts.The Maldives doesn’t have a navy and the Coast Guard functions as the armed maritime component of the Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF). There is strong maritime cooperation between India and the Maldives, and in the past, New Delhi has provided patrol vessels and maritime surveillance aircraft to bolster MNDF’s capabilities.In addition to the harbour and dockyard, India will support the development of other infrastructure, communications resources and radar services at Uthuru Thila Falhu and provide training to Maldivian personnel. MNDF officials told the media that no foreign military personnel will be stationed at the facility, which will be used to dock, maintain and repair Coast Guard vessels.A joint statement said the agreement on developing the harbour was in line with several requests made by the Maldives since 2013 for India’s support to enhance the capability of its defence forces to effectively control and conduct surveillance in its exclusive economic zone.The agreement is also in line with a bilateral action plan for defence cooperation signed in April 2016 and subsequent discussions held during 2016-19.Jaishankar held a joint meeting with Maldives' finance minister Ibrahim Ameer, national planning minister Mohamed Aslam and economic development minister Fayyaz Ismail to review various infrastructure projects and economic activities being undertaken in the Maldives with Indian support.Also read: Pakistan unlikely to exit ‘grey list’ as FATF meets to decide its fate - ReportDuring a meeting with Jaishankar on Saturday, Maldives’ foreign minister Abdulla Shahid sought a second tranche of funding under India’s “high impact community development projects” scheme.

India is backing major infrastructure projects under two lines of credit worth $1.2 billion. New Delhi also extended budgetary support of $250 million last year to help the Maldives cope with the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.The five agreements signed on Saturday included a letter of intent between India’s EXIM Bank and local authorities on financing a housing project of 2,000 units, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for a grant of $500,000 for a fish processing plant, and an MoU on sustainable urban development.Jaishankar also handed over 100,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines as a grant.

21-02-2021||India||AP gram panchayat elections: Final phase concludes with more than 81% polling, isolated incidents of violence||A few incidents of violence, mostly in Guntur district, marred the fourth and final phase of elections to the gram panchayats in Andhra Pradesh on Sunday, which saw 81.78 per cent polling. Police made lathi charge at a couple of places in Guntur district to quell clashing mobs while polling agents of candidates were allegedly beaten up in some places, police sources said. In Sattenapalli constituency, agents of rival candidates clashed with each other inside a polling station and suffered injuries. Both were rushed to the hospital for treatment. At Mutluru village near Guntur, a polling agent attempted to immolate himself after rivals allegedly thrashed him inside a polling station, the sources said. This led to tension in the village as villagers alleged that police remained mute spectators while the miscreants jumped over the polling station compound wall and carried out the attack on the agent. "Some stray incidents do happen but we have acted swiftly. We will bring the culprits involved in the violent incidents to book," Guntur Urban district Superintendent of Police Ammi Reddy told reporters. He said a strong police force was deployed under the direct supervision of a Deputy Superintendent of Police to prevent untoward incidents, given the sensitive nature of the polling station. In East Godavari district, two old-aged men collapsed and died after exercising their franchise in separate villages, in what was suspected to be cases of heart attack. Rain did not dampen the spirit of voters as they lined up in good numbers to exercise their franchise in some mandals in SPS Nellore district, sources in the State Election Commission here said. In the fourth phase, polling was held to elect 2,743 village sarpanches and 22,423 ward members in 3,299 gram panchayats. Already, 554 sarpanches were declared elected unopposed. According to the State Election Commission, more than 80 per cent polling was recorded in each of the four phases of elections to the panchayats. After a protracted stand-off between the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy government and the State Election Commissioner N Ramesh Kumar and the resultant legal battle, elections to the gram panchayats, the lowest tier in the Panchayat Raj structure, were completed in four phases between February 9 and 21. Though the panchayat elections were conducted on an apolitical basis, the ruling YSR Congress claimed to have won more than 82 per cent of the village bodies. The main opposition Telugu Desam Party, however, said the panchayat polls proved the people rejected the draconian rule of Jagan Mohan Reddy. Elections to the urban local bodies, scheduled for March 10, will be a direct fight between the political parties, as also the polls to mandal and zilla parishads the second and third tiers of the Panchayat Raj structure will also showcase the real strength of the parties. The SEC is yet to announce the dates for the mandal and zilla parishad elections, which have been abruptly deferred in March last year due to Covid-19 outbreak, as it is seeking legal opinion on the way ahead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-pradesh-gram-panchayat-polls-over-81-polling-recorded-in-final-phase-101613919414023.html
21-02-2021||India||'Government well aware of fiscal management': FM Nirmala Sitaraman||Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharam on Sunday said the government was well aware of fiscal management and would keep finances in a healthy condition and not leave them unattended.“Debt to GDP, other indicators which are important for a healthy economy, have to be carefully managed in such a way that sooner in a sense, in a reasonable time frame, the fiscal deficit will also be kept under the healthy level and not let unattended for decades together,” said Sitharaman, who participated in an interactive session with the Bangalore Chambers of Industries and Commerce (BCIC), on Sunday.She said that the Union budget was about setting the path for the next decade. The Budget 2021 of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government was criticised by various quarters over lack of stimulus for a pandemic-impacted economy and higher borrowing.Also read: 'Second wave knocking on our door' - Maha CM on fresh Covid-19 surge in stateThe finance minister said that the government's borrowing was largely aimed at providing a boost to sectors like infrastructure where public expenditure was involved.She stressed the need for uninterrupted yet sustainable growth.Sitharaman said that the budget plays the role of a facilitator to enable the private sector as the key driver of economic growth in the country.“The most important component or input required here is the participation of the private sector. Unless the private sector is energised and facilitated enough, India is just losing a very big opportunity,” she said.The finance minister said that the Covid-19 health crisis is an example of how the private sector and the government can come together to achieve common goals.She mentioned India's proactive approach to provide vaccines to other countries where the government plays the role of a facilitator."If that is the way India approaches its responsibility, it will be incomplete unless the government plays its role, that of a facilitator, and the private sector plays its role as a key driver. So that’s the message this budget has talked about,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-well-aware-of-fiscal-management-fm-nirmala-sitaraman-101613919763079.html

21-02-2021||India||Centre, UP govt working for big business houses’ welfare: Priyanka Gandhi||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Sunday said the central and Uttar Pradesh governments were working for the welfare of big business houses and not for those who had voted them to power.Interacting with members of the Nishad community at Baswar village in the trans-Yamuna region here, Priyanka targeted the Centre and said like the three new farm laws, the laws applicable to rivers were for the benefit of industrialists rather than fishermen and boatmen.The Congress leader visited Baswar village to meet members of the Nishad community, who have alleged that they were recently beaten up and their boats damaged when a team of district administration and police took action against illegal sand miners in the area.Addressing locals, the Congress general secretary said, “Farmers are agitating against the unjust farm laws in the country and here you people were targeted. All this is because the government has forgotten that it was your vote which has given them power to rule and now they have forgotten you (voters) and instead are working for the welfare of industrialists, neglecting your welfare.”Priyanka assured them of fighting for their rights on sand mining and ensuring that the issue is raised in Parliament.“Taking cover under the National Green Tribunal’s orders, the BJP government is providing benefits to mining mafia and big industrialists, who are exploiting the natural resources,” she said.On February 4, a team of officials, accompanied by heavy police force, had raided the ghats in Baswar and Mohabbatganj in a crackdown against illegal sand mining. The villagers later alleged that policemen assaulted them, including women and damaged their boats. However, the police denied the allegations and said persons involved in illegal mining pelted them with stones. An FIR was also lodged against locals in this connection.This was Priyanka’s second visit to Prayagraj in the last 10 days. She had visited Sangam and taken a dip in the holy water on Mauni Amavsya on February 11.Referring to her Ganga Yatra in 2019, she said “When I undertook the Ganga Yatra, I was informed how you people were earlier given lease of resources of the river so that you could earn your livelihood. Now, the present government has snatched away the rights of those who live near the rivers, affecting the livelihood of thousands of families. Policy makers across the world understand that people dependent for their livelihood on the forests or rivers can never harm them. However, in contrast, big business houses are not directly dependent on these resources and, therefore, exploit these natural gifts without caring about the welfare of the rivers, forests and animals.”Congress legislature party leader Aradhana Mishra, who accompanied Priyanka along with party’s state president Ajay Kumar Lallu and senior party leader Pramod Tiwari, said the party would raise the issue in the state assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-up-govt-working-for-big-business-houses-welfare-priyanka-gandhi-101613917504738.html
21-02-2021||India||Bengal withdraws criminal cases against TMC’s ally, Gorkha leader Bimal Gurung||The West Bengal government has started withdrawing criminal cases slapped against Bimal Gurung, president of one of the two factions of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) and hundreds of his followers who took part in the 2017 Gorkhaland movement that witnessed violence.Charged under several sections of the Indian Penal Code and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), Gurung appeared in public last year after remaining underground for three years and offered to support chief minister Mamata Banerjee and help her win the assembly seats in Darjeeling and other parts of north Bengal. He has already been provided security cover by the state.Binoy Tamang, Gurung’s rival and leader of the GJM’s other faction, is an ally of the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) since 2017. Tamang, however, is opposed to Gurung’s re-entry in hill politics.Gurung earlier supported the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and helped it win the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat thrice since 2009. After resurfacing in Kolkata on October 21 last year he took a U-turn and accused the BJP of betraying the Gorkhas.The process of withdrawal of the cases against him, his supporters and GJM general secretary Roshan Giri has started, said lawyers in Darjeeling.A senior lawyer, who did not want to be named, said, “It is not Gurung alone who is being spared. Cases slapped against Binoy Tamang and Anit Thapa, general secretary of the other faction, too are being withdrawn as well.”Thapa is chairman of the board of administrators of the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA).Pranoy Rai, public prosecutor at the Darjeeling district court, said around 80 cases have already been withdrawn.“More than 156 cases were pending against Gurung. The state law department had asked for my opinion. I gave my views and an application was sent to the governor which is legally required. Around 80 cases have already been withdrawn,” said Rai.Under Section 321 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.PC), a public prosecutor in charge of a case may, with consent of a court, withdraw the case before the judgment is passed.The process of withdrawal of cases has also started at other courts in Kurseong, Kalimpong, Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar. The last submission for withdrawal of all pending cases is likely to be made on Monday, lawyers aware of the developments said.A legal expert, who did not want to be named, said that under section 321 the accused first makes a submission before the state, seeking withdrawal of charges. The executive order is subsequently issued by the law department and public prosecutors file petition before the court.Lawyers representing Gurung, Giri, Tamang and Thapa said most of the cases slapped against them are political in nature and hence their withdrawal will not be a difficult process.As far as the UAPA cases are concerned, the Supreme Court, while hearing a petition from Gurung last year, ordered a stay on all investigations under scheduled offences of the National Investigation Agency Act including UAPA. The interim order passed by the Supreme Court is still in force. “No action should be taken until further orders on it are passed,” said Rai.Roshan Giri said, “We do not know anything about this since nothing has been communicated to us officially.”BJP state vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar said, “Mamata Banerjee is taking desperate measures to win the elections but nothing can change the outcome of the coming polls. People have made up their minds.”Asok Bhattacharya, senior CPI (M) leader and legislator from Siliguri, said “Mamata Banerjee, who framed the charges, has now decided to withdraw them since Gurung is campaigning for the TMC.”Gautam Deb, senior TMC leader from north Bengal and tourism minister, said, “I will not comment on this matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-withdraws-criminal-cases-against-tmc-s-ally-gorkha-leader-bimal-gurung-101613914371850.html

It has already lost its majority,” he told reporters.DMK MK Venkatesh also submitted his resignation to the Speaker saying he was dissatisfied with the government.The ruling alliance MLAs are scheduled to meet to decide on Monday’s course of action. “We have to take a decision on whether to attend the trust vote tomorrow or submit our resignation to the Lieutenant Governor (L-G),” said a Congress leader in Puducherry.In the 33-member House, there are 30 elected members and three nominated members belonging to the BJP. The Congress presently has 9 MLAs. It includes assembly Speaker S P Sivakolundhi who isn’t allowed to vote unless there is a tie. The Congress has the support of two DMK MLAs and an independent MLA from Mahe. The opposition has seven MLAs from All Indian NR Congress led by former chief minister N Rangasamy, four of AIADMK and the three nominated members of the BJP who are allowed to vote.Newly appointed Lieutenant Governor Tamilisai Soundarajan has asked the Congress to prove its majority by 5 pm on Monday. The voting will take place by a show of hands. If all ruling and opposition MLAs are present in the House, the Congress government will lose as it will get only 12 votes.“Elections are less than two months away so we will work towards the elections where people will give us the majority,” said a senior Congress leader not wishing to be named.A senior BJP leader in Puducherry said on condition of anonymity that they may not stake claim to form the government. “In a week poll dates will be announced so what is the point of running a government for about 60 days?” the BJP leader said.A spell of President’s rule seems imminent in the current scenario.The Congress alleged that the BJP used money and threats to destabilize the government.“The BJP has used muscle and money power and threatened the MLAs,” said Puducherry Pradesh Congress Committee president A V Subramanian.Since January four other Congress MLAs including two ministers have quit. Two legislators - A Namassivayam and E Theepaindan resigned in January and joined the BJP. Another Congress MLA, N Dhanavelu, was disqualified in July last year for anti-party activities. Chief minister V Narayanasamy had earlier said that the party is yet to accept the resignation of health minister Malladi Krishna Rao.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-govt-in-puducherry-faces-exit-as-2-more-mlas-quit-ahead-of-floor-test-101613915604709.html

21-02-2021||India||Sonia Gandhi writes 3-page letter to PM Modi on fuel prices. Read full text here||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Sunday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the record-breaking prices of fuel being sold in the country and accused the government of profiting from people's misery and suffering.The letter from the Congress chief comes a day after petrol price reached an all-time high of ₹97 in Mumbai, while diesel was selling at ₹88.06 in the country's financial capital. The fuel prices have been rising in the city for the last 12 days. Petrol was sold for ₹96 per litre on Wednesday and diesel ₹87 on Thursday.Petrol prices have already touched ₹100 in two states of the country - Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. The petrol price touched ₹100 a litre in Rajasthan's Sri Ganganagar district and rose to record highs elsewhere on Wednesday.Drawing parallels with the UPA government, Gandhi said, "What baffles most citizens, is that these prices have been increased despite moderate prices of International crude oil. To put it in context, the crude oil price is nearly half of what it was during the UPA Government’s tenure."Here is the full text of the letter written by Sonia Gandhi:Dear Prime Minister,I hope this letter finds you well.I write to you to convey every citizen’s anguish & deep distress regarding the spiralling fuel & gas prices. On one hand, India is witnessing systematic erosion of jobs, wages and household income. The middle class and those at the margins of our society are struggling. These challenges have been compounded by run away inflation and an unprecedented rise in price of almost all household items and essential commodities. Sadly, in these distressing times, the Government has chosen to profiteer off people’s misery & suffering.Fuel prices are at an historic and unsustainable high. In fact, Petrol has breached the ₹100/litre mark in many parts of the country. The surging price of Diesel has added to the escalating woes of millions of farmers. What baffles most citizens, is that these prices have been increased despite moderate prices of International crude oil. To put it in context, the crude oil price is nearly half of what it was during the UPA Government’s tenure. Therefore, your Government’s act of raising prices (continuously for 12 days till February 20th) is little less than a brazen act of profiteering.I fail to understand how any government can justify such thoughtless and insensitive measures directly at the cost of our people. Your Government has increased excise duty on Diesel by 820% & on Petrol by 258% over and collected upwards of ₹21 lakh crore in the last six and a half years. This unaccounted-for windfall is yet to be passed to the people for whose benefit it was ostensibly collected.As I had expressed earlier, it was cruel on the Government’s part to refuse to reduce fuel prices even when global crude oil had crashed to $20/barrel last year. The whole principle of deregulation & dynamic pricing is predicated on the principle that reductions in crude oil prices will proportionately benefit the end consumers. The fact that your Government fails to do so implies a deliberate and conscious decision to deny the common man his legitimate due.Instead, ironically, your Government has been unreasonably over-zealous in levying excessive excise duty on Petrol and Diesel, i.e., ₹33 on every litre of Petrol and ₹32 on every litre of Diesel, which is higher than the base price of these fuels. This is nothing short of extortion to cover up economic mismanagement. As the principal party in opposition, I urge upon you to follow ‘Raj Dharma’ and reduce fuel prices by partially rolling back excise duty.The astronomical rise in domestic non-subsidised LPG Gas cylinder to ₹769 in Delhi (and over ₹800 in many states like Uttar Pradesh) is even more cruel and has impacted every household. Can there be any justification for the Government increasing the price of a cylinder by ₹175 in two and a half months since December 2020?The truth is that as GDP nose dives, the prices of Gas, Diesel & Petrol continue to rise unchecked.What is equally distressing is that despite being in power for almost 7-years now, your government continues to blame previous regimes for its own economic mismanagement. To set the record straight, domestic crude oil production has fallen to an 18-year low in the year 2020.Governments are elected to ease the burden of our people and at the very least, not work directly contrary to their interests. I urge you to roll back these increases and pass on the benefit to our middle & salaried class, our farmers & poor and our fellow citizens. It is they who are battling an unprecedented economic slowdown, widespread unemployment, wage reductions & job losses, high prices and erosion of income.I hope you will agree that it is time for your Government to focus on solutions instead of looking for excuses. India deserves better.With good wishes,Yours Sincerely,Sonia Gandhi||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-gandhi-writes-3-page-letter-to-pm-modi-on-fuel-prices-read-full-text-here-101613911102646.html

And, hence, such people become a protective layer between the infected person and unaffected people, thereby breaking the chain of viral transmission.Guleria here also gave the example of Brazilian city Manaus which even after having achieved the herd immunity in October is now battling the second Covid-19 wave."They (Brazil) had claimed that they got heard immunity with almost 70 per cent of the population being protected because of the past infection, and yet because of the Brazilian variant and waning immunity a large number of people got infected again. And now they are in a very bad situation because of resurgence of cases," he noted.Here, he also asserted that no sero surveys done so far has suggested India being "anyway near" achieving the herd immunity.Over 21 per cent of the population, aged 10 years and above, showed evidence of past exposure to Covid-19 in the Indian Council of Medical Research''s (ICMR) latest national sero-survey out on February 4.Stressing on the importance of vaccination, which he said is essential in India's fight against the coronavirus, he said they too will change with time tackling not only the "emerging variants" but giving more robust immunity lasting for a longer period of time."What we have today is not the only vaccine, we will have better vaccines as time moves on and as research moves on. But right now we should take what we have if we want to really make sure that the situation in our country does not deteriorate," he added.The JLF, now in its 14th edition, features over 300 speakers and performers representing around 25 Indian and 18 international languages and over 23 nationalities. Some of the big names making it to the festival this year include the likes of American linguist Noam Chomsky, 2020 Booker Prize winner Douglas Stuart, Nobel Laureates Joseph Stiglitz and Malala Yousafzai, Microsoft Corporation co-founder Bill Gates, and actor-author Priyanka Chopra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/herd-immunity-difficult-to-achieve-aiims-director-randeep-guleria-101613910417999.html
21-02-2021||India||Vaundhara Raje’s loyalist MLAs complain of being sidelined in Rajasthan assembly||Factionalism in the Rajasthan unit of the BJP has become more evident with MLAs considered close to former chief minister Vasundahra Raje writing to state party chief Satish Poonia, complaining of being ignored in the state assembly.Raje's supporters recently held a ‘chintan baithak’ (brainstorming meeting) in Kota city and pitched for her to be the chief ministerial candidate in the next assembly polls in the state.Around 20 MLAs including former Speaker Kailash Meghwal, Narpat Singh Rajvi, Kali Charan Saraf, Pratap Singh Singhvi, Pushpendra Singh, Rampratap Kasaniya, etc have written to Poonia and complained of prejudice against them in the House.“Some members are able to raise public issues daily through adjournment motion and many aren’t getting a chance despite listing issues under the motion. We have urged Satish Poonia to ensure that all are given equal opportunity,” said a senior MLA on condition of anonymity.Adjournment motion is to draw the attention of the House to a recent matter of urgent public importance. The budget session of the assembly that began on February 10 is currently on.“Some of the old and experienced MLAs are feeling ignored. I agree with them and so I have signed the letter. Floor management is the responsibility of the leader of opposition and whip and the MLAs feel they are being ignored,” Meghwal said.He said the MLAs feel that they are not being given the importance they deserve in the assembly proceedings. “This feeling should come to an end all be given equal chance,” he said.Senior BJP MLA Narpat Singh Rajvi said, “I have signed the letter as I didn’t like the idea that an adjournment motion should come up after a nod from the leader of opposition when it should be the Speaker’s prerogative. This is against the practice of assembly and has never happened in the last 70 years.”Another signatory to the letter questioned how could the leader of opposition or deputy leader of opposition decide which MLA would bring an adjournment motion. He claimed that only those MLAs who are in sync with the leader of opposition are allowed to bring in an adjournment motion.“There is resentment among the MLAs as their voices have been muzzled,” he said.Deputy leader of opposition, Rajendra Rathore refuted the allegations. “There is no such thing and everyone is given a chance to speak. Around 47 MLAs spoke on the Governor’s speech,” he said.On raising an adjournment motion, he said it is the prerogative of the assembly Speaker. “I am not aware of any such letter. There might be some misunderstanding,” said Rathore.BJP state chief Satish Poonia who is in Delhi to attend a party meeting could not be contacted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaundhara-raje-s-loyalist-mlas-complain-of-being-sidelined-in-rajasthan-assembly-101613910729470.html

Overall, it is not too much but govt is keeping an eye on it," Khattar was quoted as saying by ANI.Explaining that the revenue collected by the government will reach people eventually, Khattar said, "Whatever revenue is collected by the government, it is used for people," the chief minister said.He added that the Value Added tax or VAT in Haryana is comparatively lower than other states.Taxes account for more than 60% of the pump prices of fuel. A part of these is central taxes and the other part is taxes levied by the state.Also read | 'Govts elected to ease burden of people': Sonia Gandhi to PM on fuel price hikeThe remarks by Khattar come a day after petrol price reached an all-time high of ₹97 in Mumbai, while diesel was selling at ₹88.06 in the country's financial capital. The fuel prices have been rising in the city for the last 12 days. Petrol was sold for ₹96 per litre on Wednesday and diesel ₹87 on Thursday.Petrol prices have already touched ₹100 in two states of the country - Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. The petrol price touched ₹100 a litre in Rajasthan's Sri Ganganagar district and rose to record highs elsewhere on Wednesday. ₹100 per litre retail price was the first time the fuel was sold at rates in the three digits anywhere in the country.Mounting criticism on the government, the opposition has been attacking the central government by questioning the record-breaking surge.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who had increased central excise duty on petrol and diesel by a record margin last year to mop up gains arising from international oil prices plunging to two-decade low, remained non-committal on cutting taxes to give relief to consumers.Also read: West Bengal govt reduces tax by Re 1 per litre on petrol, diesel"This is a very vexatious issue. An issue in which no answer except reducing the price (of fuel) will convince anyone.

21-02-2021||India||Delhi appears to be heading towards reopening, taking on challenges of post-Covid era||With the number of coronavirus cases in the national capital coming down, Delhi appears to be heading towards reopening completely and taking on challenges of the post-Covid era.From schools to colleges, courts to public transport, the places and services which were partially functioning so far in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, are getting into action towards a complete reopening.According to Saturday’s health bulletin, Delhi recorded 152 fresh coronavirus cases, recording a marginal dip in the positivity rate while one death was reported.According to officials, Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) is likely to hold a meeting on Monday to decide the future course of action with regards to Covid preparedness and precautions.Various Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs), however, have cautioned that the government should take a safe approach and not open everything completely yet.The Delhi Court has announced that from March 15, all of its judges will hold physical hearing of cases and the existing system under which only 11 benches -- two division benches of two judges each and nine single-judge benches -- hear matters via the physical mode will continue till March 12.The high court had, on March 25, 2020 restricted its functioning as well as that of the district courts till April 14, 2020.It was subsequently extended from time to time till January 16, 2021. The high court had, on March 25, 2020 restricted its functioning as well as that of the district courts till April 14, 2020.It was subsequently extended from time to time till January 16, 2021.The Delhi Transport Corporation has also sent a proposal for consideration in a DDMA meeting to allow travel by commuters in the aisle or standing position in public transport buses in view of the declining Covid-19 cases in the city.The DDMA had in November last year had allowed the running of DTC and cluster buses with full seating capacity. Before that, the service of public transport buses was resumed under unlockdown relaxations in May at half their seating capacity.Similarly, the metro services resumed in September last year allowing commuters to travel while following Covid protocols.Schools in the national capital, which closed in March last year ahead of a nationwide lockdown, reopened for class 10 and 12 students from January 18 followed by class 9 and 11 from February 5. The Centre had allowed schools to reopen from October 15 last year, however, Delhi government delayed the move till cases came down to a lower level.The CBSE has already announced that the board exams will be conducted from May 4, three months later than the usual time.The Delhi government which was earlier contemplating scrapping nursery admissions this year so children do not spend another year before mobile and computer screens, has also given a go ahead to the admission process and the application window opened on February 18.Universities like DU and JNU have also reopened partially for students. While JNU began phasewise reopening of campus in November last year, Delhi University began the process earlier this month.Various departments under Delhi government, are also working with full strength now. Various markets, both regular as well as weekly markets are also opening now.According to Himanshu Vaish, President Panchshila Cooperative Housing Society RWA, in view of the severity of the virus and lives lost to it, caution must be maintained."People themselves have learnt a lot of lessons in the pandemic and so it would be better to take forward the safety measures and precautions till there is a final solution to the Covid-19," he said.Echoing his views, Pankaj Agarwal, general secretary, Safdarjung RWA, said, the cases of Covid-19 are rising in some states like Maharashtra."After lockdown relaxations some people have become casual towards the safety measures. The government has to face pressure from different quarters to lift restrictions but I think the suggestions of experts must be followed," he said.The overall infection tally in the city stands at 6,37,755, while the death toll is at 10,898. On Friday, 158 cases and one death were registered.No death due to Covid-19 was recorded in Delhi on Wednesday, the third time single-day fatality count stood nil in February.On February 9 too, no fatality from the infection was registered in the national capital, first time this month, and after a gap of nearly nine months.No death from Covid-19 was recorded on February 13 as well, the second time in the month when the single-day fatality count was nil.Delhi recorded 94 fresh Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, the lowest in over nine months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-appears-to-be-heading-towards-reopening-taking-on-challenges-of-post-covid-era-101613908777229.html
21-02-2021||India||'Govts elected to ease burden of people': Sonia Gandhi to PM on fuel price hike||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Sunday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over rising prices of petrol and diesel, accusing the central government of "profiteering off people's misery and suffering".Also Read: West Bengal govt reduces tax by Re 1 per litre on petrol, dieselIn the three-page letter, Gandhi lashed out at the central government saying it has been "unreasonably over-zealous in levying excessive excise duty on petrol and diesel"."On one hand, India is witnessing systematic erosion of jobs, wages and household income. The middle class and those at the margins of our society are struggling. These challenges have been compounded by run away inflation and an unprecedented rise in price of almost all household items and essential commodities. Sadly, in these distressing times, the government has chosen to profiteer off people’s misery & suffering," Gandhi said in the letter."What baffles most citizens, is that these prices have been increased despite moderate prices of International crude oil. To put it in context, the crude oil price is nearly half of what it was during the UPA government's tenure. Therefore, your government's act of raising prices (continuously for 12 days till February 20th) is little less than a brazen act of profiteering," she further said.Watch: Sitharaman on hike in prices of petrol and dieselThe Congress president also said that the Centre has increased excise duty on diesel by 820 per cent and on petrol by 258 per cent and collected upwards of ₹21 lakh crore in the last six and a half years.The deregulation of fuel prices, said Gandhi, was meant to benefit the common man. "The fact that your government fails to do so implies a deliberate and conscious decision to deny the common man his legitimate due.""The astronomical rise in domestic non-subsidised LPG gas cylinder to ₹769 in Delhi (and over ₹800 in many states like Uttar Pradesh) is even more cruel and has impacted every household. Can there be any justification for the Government increasing the price of a cylinder by ₹175 in two and a half months since December 2020?" Gandhi said in the letter.The senior politician also said that governments are elected "to ease the burden of our people and at the very least, not work directly contrary to their interests".The prices of petrol and diesel have seen relentless hike in the last few weeks. At some places, petrol has even crossed the  ₹100-mark.Gandhi's letter further intensifies the Congress' protest against rising fuel prices. The party took out marches and observed bandh at several places on Saturday to attack the Centre.In Rajasthan, Congress leaders were seen riding on tractors, camels and elephants besides participating in foot marches and raising slogans against PM Modi.In the national capital, activists of the Indian Youth Congress (IYC) staged a protest at Shastri Bhawan and demanded the resignation of Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan.Meanwhile, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman called the the price hike a "vexatious issue" and said that the Centre and state governments will have to together work out a mechanism to bring retail rates to reasonable levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fuel-price-hike-sonia-gandhi-writes-letter-to-pm-modi-101613908819936.html

It’s a part of BJPs larger plan to divide & pit regions, religions & communities against each other,” she said in a tweet.The delimitation commission for the union territory was formed by the Union government on March 6 last year, just six months after the special status of Jammu and Kashmir was revoked and the erstwhile state split into two union territories – J-K with a legislative assembly and Ladakh without one. Earlier the delimitation of the constituencies in Jammu and Kashmir was scheduled to be held in 2026. However following the abrogation of Article 370 on August 5, 2019, the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Act increased the number of voting constituencies for J&K from 87 to 90.Justice (retired) Ranjana Prakash Desai is the chairperson of the Commission while Election Commissioner Subash Chandra and State Election Commissioner KK Sharma are its members.The commission has five associate members including three National Conference MPs and two BJP leaders - Union Minister Jitendra Singh and Jammu MP Jugal Kishore. Of the five, three member parliaments (MPs) from National Conference (NC) – Farooq Abdullah, Akbar Lone and Hasnain Masoodi have already announced to dissociate from the exercise on the grounds that the J&K Reorganization Act 2019 is under scrutiny in the Supreme Court.In a letter to the commission chairperson after being called for a meeting scheduled on Thursday, the NC members had written that “it would not be in tune with the mandate and spirit of the constitution of India to associate with the proceedings taken in exercise of the powers under an Act, the constitutional validity whereof is under challenge…”.They also wanted the commission not to go ahead with the exercise. “We would also respectfully request the honorable chairperson, a renowned legal luminary of the country, not to go ahead with the proceedings…,” the letter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delimitation-in-j-k-is-bjp-s-exercise-to-divide-communities-says-mehbooba-mufti-101613907331563.html

The Congress even took out marches and observed bandh at several places on Saturday to protest against rising fuel prices.In 12 days (till February 20), retail petrol prices rose by ₹3.63 a litre, a record since the pricing was deregulated in 2010, and diesel rates went up by ₹3.84."The Centre earns ₹32.90 per litre in taxes from petrol, while the state gets ₹18.46 only. In case of diesel, the central government's earning is ₹31.80 per litre as against ₹12.77 for the state," Mitra said on Sunday.The bengal government's move comes a day after finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that Centre and state governments will have to together work out a mechanism to bring retail rates to reasonable levels.However, Sitharaman, who had increased central excise duty on petrol and diesel by a record margin last year to mop up gains arising from international oil prices plunging to two-decade low, remained non-committal on cutting taxes to give relief to consumers."This is a very vexatious issue.

In Kashmir, people have shown faith in democracy. Upcoming Elections were discussed and the support that the BJP is getting, in West Bengal shows people are fed up. In Assam, the government is hopeful of winning with a mandate,” Singh said.Referring to Kerala and Tamil Nadu, Singh said the party organisation has been strengthened. “In this meeting, the PM and party president were thanked for giving the party a new direction,” he said.A resolution on Atmanirbhar Bharat is also expected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-passes-political-resolution-on-centre-s-covid-19-response-101613905516147.html

21-02-2021||India||Alappuzha, Nagpur, SBS Nagar: Centre names 'cause of special Covid-19 concerns'||The Covid-19 situation in India has come to a point where a sudden spurt of daily cases is being noticed only in a few pockets of a district or a state. A day after the ministry of health identified the states of Kerala, Maharashtra, Punjab, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh where the cases are on the rise, the ministry on Sunday zeroed in on the areas which need to exercise special caution.These areas are reporting a higher weekly positivity rate than the national average. The weekly positivity rate is the percentage of people testing Covid-19 positive in a week out of all those getting tested. The national average is 1.79 per cent which denotes that only 1.79 per cent of people out of all those who are getting tested in a week in India are testing positive. Some of the districts, identified by the ministry as areas of concern, are reporting even an eight per cent weekly positivity rate.Centre tells states to scale up testing as Covid-19 trajectory witnesses surgeAlappuzha: This Kerala city is reporting around 400 daily Covid-19 cases, which is not the highest in Kerala. Kozhikode, Ernakulam, Malappuram have more daily positive cases. But Alappuzha is a cause of special concern, according to the ministry, as its weekly positivity rate has increased to 10.7 per cent.In the last four weeks, the weekly positivity rate in Kerala has ranged from 13.9 per cent to 8.9 per cent, the ministry said.Nagpur: Nagpur on Saturday reported 725 fresh Covid-19 cases and six deaths. On Friday, the number was 754. According to the health ministry, weekly cases have increased by 33 per cent in Nagpur.Amravati: In Maharashtra's Amravati, which is observing weekend lockdown this Saturday, Sunday, weekly cases have increased by 47 per cent. Amravati is one of the major contributors to the increasing number of the daily caseload in Maharashtra.Nashik: On Saturday, the Nashik division's cumulative case tally stood at 2,84,160. Nashik has registered a 23 per cent weekly increased in the number of fresh cases.Akola: Akola division's weekly increase of Covid-19 case is around 55 per cent. On Saturday, the Akola division, which includes the Amravati district and Amravati municipal corporation, reported 1,726 fresh cases.Yavatmal: Yavatmal has registered a 48 per cent rise in weekly Covid-19 cases. It is under a 10-day lockdown till February 28.Overall, Maharashtra's weekly positivity rate has increased from 4.7 per cent to eight per cent.SBS Nagar: In Punjab's SBS Nagar, the weekly positivity rate has become 4.9 per cent from 3.5 per cent and the weekly cases have more than doubled from 165 to 364.Apart from these specific areas, Chandigarh, Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Maharashtra have weekly positivity rate higher than the national average.The sudden increase in the number of cases in a particular area indicates that either a more contagious mutant strain is behind the new infections or there is laxity in containment. The ministry has asked all the states to strengthen both surveillance and monitoring of the mutant strains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/alappuzha-nagpur-sbs-nagar-centre-names-cause-of-special-covid-19-concern-101613904654051.html

It will be implemented in Uttar Pradesh as well, and the required money for its implementation will also be paid by us. For this project, the Union Parliamentary Affairs minister has been made the nodal," UP's Legislative Assembly Speaker Hriday Narayan Dixit told PTI on Sunday.Uttar Pradesh has filled all the required documents, and it is ready to ink an MoU with the Centre on this. They are moving ahead on this, and the necessary equipment have been installed, he added."The 'paperless' budget is a part of the e-vidhan. Now, this (budget) is going to be paperless. Subsequently, everything will be paperless. Once the e-vidhan is implemented then the agenda will also become paperless, and the question and answers will also become paperless."At this time, it will be only the budget, which will be paperless, rest of the things are yet to be made paperless including the agenda and copies of bills," Dixit said.He also informed that as the finance minister will read his budget speech on his tablet and the MLAs will be able to see it on their tablets.To a question on whether e-Vidhan will be implemented by the Monsoon Session of the Assembly, Dixit said, "Nothing can be said as of now. It may or may not be implemented. But, the Centre wants that it should be speedily implemented. We also want that it should be implemented at the earliest."Implementation of e-Vidhan will help in putting many things including the agenda in the public domain."Things which the public used to know through the newspaper will be known to them rather fast. 60 per cent of cost will be borne by the Centre, while 40 per cent of the cost will be borne by the state," he said.'e-Vidhan' is one of the 44 Mission Mode Projects (MMPs) under Digital India Programme launched by Government of India with a vision to transform the country into a Digitally Empowered Society and knowledge economy.The Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs has been made the 'Nodal Ministry' for the implementation of e-Vidhan MMP re-designating it as National e-Vidhan Application (NeVA) in all the 31 States/ UTs with Legislatures on the line of Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly to make the functioning of State Legislative Houses paperless.e-Vidhan software of Himachal Pradesh Vidhan Sabha was upgraded as National eVidhan Application (NeVA), a single application covering all 39 Houses (Lok Sabha Rajya Sabha 31 Assemblies 6 Councils) to bring all the legislatures of the country together, on one platform, thereby creating a massive data depository without having the complexity of multiple applications.Earlier this month, the Uttar Pradesh government had asked members of the state''s legislative assembly and council to purchase tablets for a paperless budget session.On February 2, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had directed that the state cabinet should hold a virtual meeting in future for which ministers must be given training.Adityanath had said, "Modern technology is extremely helpful in performing various works quickly and in a transparent manner. Ministers should be imparted training for e-cabinet meetings at their official residence and office. Information regarding the security features for the e-cabinet meeting should be given to them."He said the initiative will help the state cabinet go paperless."Efforts should also be made to make the state budget paperless on the lines of the Union Budget," he had said.On February 1, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had read out the Union Budget speech in the Lok Sabha from a tablet instead of a conventional paper document.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/everything-including-agenda-of-house-questions-answers-to-become-paperless-up-assembly-speaker-101613904260727.html
21-02-2021||India||Govt working on law to regulate social media: Ram Madhav||Senior BJP leader Ram Madhav said that social media has become so powerful that it can even topple governments, leading to anarchy and weakening democracy, and solutions to tackle this are needed to be found within the constitutional framework.Speaking at the launch of his new book 'Because India Comes First', Madhav said democracy is stressed and facing new challenges with the rise of "non-political" and "non-state" forces."Social media is so powerful that it can even topple governments and regulating them is difficult as they are borderless. These forces can promote anarchy, which will weaken democracy but solutions should be within the constitutional framework," he said at the event hosted by the Prabha Khaitan Foundation on Saturday evening.The existing laws are not adequate for this, he said."We require new rules and laws to tackle and manage. The government is already working in this direction," he added.Madhav's comments come amid a row between the government and Twitter over blocking of accounts with Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad asking the micro-blogging site to follow the Indian law.Besides, the Supreme Court has issued a notice to the Centre and Twitter on a plea, seeking to regulate hate content and to make a law as per which action can be initiated against Twitter and their representatives in India for willfully abetting and promoting anti-India tweets and penalise them.Madhav said that in his new book he has penned his observations on several decisions of the Modi government.Answering a question on Gandhi, he said the RSS does not undermine any leader's contribution.Gandhi was a great leader and his mantra of Ahimsa has been adopted by many global leaders, he said."There may be differences of opinion, which we even find between Nehru and Gandhi from the letters exchanged between them but that does not mean we disrespect a national leader. In the RSS morning prayer, we have Gandhi's name along with other leaders," Madhav said.On Kashmir, he said that with the abrogation of Article 370, grassroot leaders are coming up against the hegemony of a few families.He also emphasised that it is the responsibility of the people of the country to make Kashmiris feel that they are part of the 1.3-billion-strong family."Kashmiris are victims of propaganda for long. Things are changing but may take some time," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-working-on-law-to-regulate-social-media-ram-madhav-101613903608637.html

This is the second resignation party has seen in one week.Talking to news agency ANI, the former Congress MLA said, "I took this decision because the party didn't give me due recognition in the government and in the organisation."Not ruling out his chances of joining other parties in the UT, Lakshminarayanan said, "I will be joining, as per decision of people of my constituency."Lakshminarayanan said he has also resigned from the party membership. The MLA's resignation comes on a day when the ruling party members are slated to meet CM Narayansamy to discuss the future course of action, though similar discussions on February 18 yielded no results."This government led by Narayanasamy has lost the majority," Lakshminarayanan told reporters.A slew of resignations has put the Congress government on thin ice in the Union territory as the party scrambles to hold onto power.The party has witnessed resignations from four Congress MLAs, including ex-ministers A Namassivayam (now in BJP) and Malladi Krishna Rao had quit, while another party legislator was earlier disqualified.The BJP, in coalition with other opposition parties, has shown signs of dominance in the UT to form the government as it has a comfortable majority mark with 14 MLAs.The process to hold floor test in Puducherry was fast-tracked this week after former Telangana Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan, who was handed over the additional charge of Puducherry, directed Narayanasamy to prove the majority on February 22.Shortly after the Congress MLAs resignation, Puducherry Assembly Speaker VP Sivakolundhu said, "I have received resignations from two MLAs.

21-02-2021||India||Experts prepare to drain lake in Uttarakhand after chopper delivers special gear||A helicopter on Sunday delivered special communication equipment to an expert team to analyse a lake formed upstream in the Rishiganga in Uttarakhand and communicate from the remote area about their findings and how to drain the lake, the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) said.The special equipment - quick deployable antenna (QDA) - which is based on satellite communication, helps authorities to reach out to people or officials in areas where there are no signals and send and receive voice and video data and hold video conferencing. Under this technology, 1.2-metre QDA (V Sat) and 1.2-metre V-SAT very small aperture terminal is used.The expert team was formed by Uttarakhand’s chief secretary Om Prakash and includes scientists from Uttarakhand Space Application Centre, Geological Survey of India and others apart from officers from the Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) and the SDRF.The team reached the lake area on Saturday and are now analysing the lake to find out ways to drain it so that it doesn’t breach in future and lead to another tragedy like the one in Chamoli on February 7 when a glacier broke off to trigger a devastating that killed dozens. Many others are still missing.“The experts will analyse the lake and direct the SDRF and ITBP men to drain it out by widening its mouth,” SDRP spokesperson Praveen Alok said.Ridhim Agarwal, DIG SDRF Uttarakhand said an Indian Air Force (IAF) helicopter took two Navy divers to the lake on Saturday to measure its depth.“The chopper hovered over the lake and Navy divers descended close to the lake surface and used their hand-held echolocation devices for measuring the depth of the lake. The lake depth has been found to be around 8 to 9 metres”.Agarwal said they knew the other dimensions of the lake and to understand the quantum of water, they needed to know the depth of the lake. “Now as we know the depth, we are roughly aware of the quantum of water there. Our experts are looking into how this water can be drained out by widening its mouth”, she said.In October last year the Uttarakhand SDRF had acquired the QDA technology to effectively tackle the challenges from disasters and reach out to affected people in the remote areas of the Himalayan state at the earliest.The state government has already distributed 248 satellite phones in the remote areas of the state so that timely communication is possible between authorities involved in dealing with disasters and emergencies and the people living in remote areas with poor or no mobile phone connectivity. To further strengthen the communication, the SDRF has now acquired QDA technology.“SDRF has procured six QDA systems including three static and three mobile ones. The static QDA will be set up at SDRF headquarters in Dehradun while mobile QDAs can be sent to the affected area by a helicopter so that communication regarding the disaster, rescue and search and other emergencies could be established quickly. This will help in effectively managing rescue and search operations in real time and will help the authorities here in reducing casualties due to various disasters”, Agarwal said.In October last year, a trial of QDA systems was conducted by establishing communication between SDRF control room in Dehradun and Gunji area in Pithoragarh, Malari area in Chamoli and Tiuni area in Dehradun district. After the successful trial, the QDA technology was inaugurated by chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, who interacted with the village heads and others in these areas through QDA and discussed the main problems facing them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-prepare-to-drain-lake-in-uttarakhand-after-chopper-delivers-special-gear-101613902019037.html

The lawyer has to deposit the amount with the Welfare Fund of High Court Bar Association, as per the order.“Every profession has certain dress code and people belonging to a particular profession are recognized by their attires. The lawyers’ dress code is governed by the rules prescribed under the Advocates Act, 1961, making it mandatory for lawyers to wear black robe or coat with white shirt and white neck band. The Rule framed under Section 49(1)(gg) of the Advocates Act, 1961 prescribes the dress code for Advocates irrespective of designated Senior Advocates or other Advocates,” HC judge justice SK Panigrahi noted in his order while imposing the penalty.“The profession is solemn in nature and its profundity is complemented by its attire. Being an Advocate, he is expected to appear before the Court in a dignified manner with proper dress, even if it is a virtual mode,” the order said.Soon after the Covid-19 lockdown was announced in March, the Orissa high court switched to virtual hearing from March 26 with a limited number of judges taking up cases by virtual mode as per the roaster assigned by the chief justice.During the virtual court system, the HC had waived off its dress code of black coat and gown and advised the lawyers to wear plain white shirt / white salwar-kameez / white saree, with a plain white neck-band.Also Read: Odisha cop forges judge's signature to release murder suspect, arrestedIn a similar order, the high court in September last year expressed its unhappiness over lawyers’ conduct during virtual hearing asking the State Bar Council and High Court Bar Association to advise the lawyers to maintain basic decorum and decency in court proceedings while appearing via video conferencing.The HC took exception to a lawyer arguing his case from inside a moving car instead of his home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/orissa-hc-lawyer-fined-rs-500-for-not-wearing-neck-band-during-hearing-101613901326721.html

It is the same configuration like Chandrayaan-2 but it will not have an orbiter. The orbiter launched during Chandrayaan-2 will be used for Chandrayaan-3. With that we are working on a system and mostly the launch will be next year in 2022,” Sivan told PTI.Chandrayaan-2, aimed at landing a rover on unchartered Lunar South Pole, was launched on July 22, 2019 on board the country's most powerful geosynchronous launch vehicle.However, the lander Vikram hard-landed on September 7, 2019, crashing India's dream to become the first nation to successfully land on the lunar surface in its maiden attempt.Chandrayaan-3 is critical for ISRO as it will demonstrate India's capabilities to make landing for further interplanetary missions.He said ISRO is targeting December to launch the first unmanned mission under the Gaganyaan project. The mission was originally scheduled to launch in December last year.It will be followed by another unmanned mission and the third leg is the main module, he said.Gaganyaan envisages to send three Indians to space by 2022. The four test pilots selected for the mission are currently undergoing training in Russia.When asked about the launch of the third module of Gaganyaan -- the manned mission -- Sivan said, “A lot of technology needs to be demonstrated. We will decide on the time (of the manned mission) after checking whether all the technology is perfect.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chandrayaan3-launch-delayed-further-to-2022-says-isro-chief-k-sivan-101613901105054.html

The navy also shared a video of the operation, which, it said, was carried out on Saturday.“In a joint Indian Navy-IAF operation on 20 Feb, naval divers were winched by IAF’s Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) at a height of 14,000 feet to measure the depth of the glacial lake formed 5 km upstream of Tapovan, Uttarakhand,” the navy said in a statement. “The Naval divers took the task of recording the depth of the glacial lake using a handheld echo sounder. The scientists will use this data to determine the pressure on the mud of the wall of the dam,” the force added.The navy said that with no road access and time criticality, its divers were quickly mobilised onboard the IAF’s ALH.Several workers were trapped inside a tunnel of NTPC’s Tapovan-Vishnugad hydel project as flash floods struck Chamoli district on February 7. The glacial lake was formed above the disaster-struck Raini village in Rishi Ganga river’s catchment area. The Rishi Ganga hydel project was completely washed away and the Tapovan-Vishnugad hydel project suffered extensive damage.The death toll in the tragedy, which was triggered by the overflow of the glacier lake, reached 67 on Sunday after five more bodies were recovered, according to officials. “The rescue workers found five more bodies till Sunday morning taking the death toll to 67. Out of the total bodies recovered, 34 have been identified while 33 are yet to be identified,” Swati Bhadauria, district magistrate of Chamoli, said.A multi-agency rescue operation was launched in the wake of the disaster. Besides the three wings of the armed forces, agencies like the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) and others are involved in operations to rescue and search people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chamoli-floods-at-14-000-feet-navy-iaf-joint-op-to-measure-glacial-lake-depth-101613897959308.html

Abhishek's wife Rujira Narula has been asked to join the probe. CBI has also summoned Abhishek Banerjee’s sister-in-law Maneka Gambhir for questioning in the same case. Gambhir has agreed to join the investigation tomorrow while Rujira is yet to respond to the CBI summons.Though the probe has been going on since November, the CBI move comes close on the heels of Abhishek lodging a defamation case against Union home minister Amit Shah. A designated MP/MLA court in West Bengal issued summons to Shah on Friday to appear either personally or through a lawyer before it on February 22. The defamation case pertains to Amit Shah's statements against Abhishek Banerjee at a rally in Kolkata on August 11, 2018.In the coal theft case, CBI on Friday conducted searches at 13 locations in four districts — Purulia, Bankura, Paschim Bardhaman and Kolkata.In December, the CBI raided the residences of Vinay Mishra, a TMC leader, businessmen Amit Singh and Niraj Singh. It has been alleged that illegally mined coal, worth several thousand crores of rupees, have been sold in the black market over several years by a racket operating in the western parts of West Bengal where the Eastern Coalfields Limited operates several mines.BJP has also alleged that the kickbacks reached Abhishek through Vinay Mishra, who was appointed by Abhishek.In November, the agency had registered an FIR against Anup Manjhi alias Lala, one of the suspected kingpins of the racket, Eastern Coalfield Ltd General Managers Amit Kumar Dhar (of then Kunustoria area now Pandaveswar area) and Jayesh Chandra Rai (Kajor area) besides ECL Chief of Security Tanmay Das, area security inspector, Kunustoria Dhananjay Rai and SSI and security in-charge Kajor area Debashish Mukherjee.This is not the first time Abhishek's wife got embroiled in a controversy. In 2019, Rujira had been held at the Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport for carrying gold without a declaration.(With Agency Inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-team-reaches-abhishek-banerjee-s-house-summons-wife-in-coal-theft-case-101613897891859.html

21-02-2021||India||UN chief voices appreciation for India's leadership in fight against COVID-19||UN chief Antonio Guterres has voiced appreciation for India’s leadership in the global fight against the coronavirus pandemic and its efforts to bring a “much-needed supply” of the COVID-19 vaccines to the world market.India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti tweeted on Saturday that Guterres, in a letter dated February 17, “extends his personal gratitude” to External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar for “India’s offer of 200,000 doses" of COVID-19 vaccines for UN peacekeepers.The Secretary-General says “India has been a global leader in pandemic response efforts”, Tirumurti tweeted, expressing his gratitude to the UN Chief.In an excerpt of the letter tweeted by Tirumurti, Guterres says, “Indeed, India has been a global leader in pandemic response efforts having provided critical medicines, diagnostic kits, ventilators and personal protective equipment to more than 150 countries.“Efforts by India in developing and manufacturing one of the two vaccines currently granted Emergency Use Listing by the World Health Organization bring a much-needed supply to the global vaccine market. I also appreciate your continued efforts to support and strengthen the COVAX Facility to ensure more equitable access.”COVAX is is a global initiative aimed at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines.On Wednesday, India, which has been hailed as the pharmacy of the world, announced the gift of 200,000 COVID-19 doses for UN peacekeepers.“Keeping in mind the UN Peacekeepers who operate in such difficult circumstances, we would like to announce today a gift of 200,000 doses for them,” Jaishankar said, addressing the UN Security Council open debate on the implementation of resolution 2532 (2020) on the cessation of hostilities in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.Quoting the Bhagavad Gita, Jaishankar had said “Do your work with the welfare of others always in mind.”He told the meeting that it is this spirit in which India approaches the COVID challenge and urged the Council to work collectively to address its different dimensions.The 200,000 doses essentially mean that it will be possible to administer the required double doses of COVID vaccines to all UN peacekeepers across missions.According to UN Peacekeeping, currently, a total of 94,484 personnel are serving in 12 peacekeeping operations across the world led by the Department of Peace Operations.A total of 121 nations are contributing uniformed personnel to the UN peacekeeping missions. India is traditionally among the largest troop-contributing countries to peacekeeping missions.Stephane Dujarric, Spokesman for the Secretary-General, had told PTI in response to a question on the Secretary General's thoughts on the announcement by India, said that Guterres is “extremely grateful” for the gift of 200,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses for UN peacekeepers and the distribution will be operationalised by the UN's Department of Support.“We are extremely grateful for this donation announced today by the Indian delegation. The distribution will be operationalised by the UN's Department of Support,” Dujarric had said.Earlier this week, two versions of the AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 vaccine were given WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL). The versions of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, produced by AstraZeneca-SK Bioscience (AZ-SKBio) and the Serum Institute of India (AZ-SII), are now available for global rollout through the COVAX Facility.The vaccine Covishield is the version of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India. Covaxin is the indigenously developed vaccine by pharma company Bharat Biotech.Jaishankar said these two vaccines have already been granted emergency authorisation and additionally, as many as 30 candidates are under various stages of development.Under the initiative “Vaccine Maitri”, which translates into Vaccine Friendship, India is providing vaccines to the world.Last month, Guterres had said that the vaccine production capacity of India is “one of the best assets the world has today”, and had applauded India for supplying COVID-19 vaccines to nations around the world.“I would like to say how much we count on India. I mean, India has one of the most advanced pharmaceutical industries. India played a very important role in the production of generics for use that was a very important element of democratisation of access to medicines all over the world,” Guterres had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/un-chief-voices-appreciation-for-india-s-leadership-in-fight-against-covid19-101613882134740.html

It means CNG is growing very well," Maruti Suzuki India Executive Director (Marketing & Sales) Shashank Srivastava told PTI.Explaining why the demand for CNG vehicles has gone up, he said as the prices of petrol and diesel as a fuel have gone up dramatically, the running costs have also increased."The cost of running CNG is only ₹1.5 per km whereas for petrol and diesel it is almost ₹4 per km. People are now preferring CNG as the running cost is very low so there is a growth in sales of CNG vehicles," Srivastava said.Also read| Hyundai aims to strengthen its SUV lineup in IndiaCiting Maruti Suzuki's own example, he said,"In the models that we have CNG, the penetration level is almost 21 per cent. Our CNG volumes last year were around 1,06,000 units. If you look at 2020-21 we have already crossed 1,19,000 units and we will end up the year with about 1,55,000 units. It will be almost 50 per cent increase."In Mumbai and Pune, the CNG penetration of Celerio and WagonR is almost 70 per cent. In Delhi, CNG penetration of WagonR is 50 per cent, he added.Stating that the growth of CNG sales was 18 per cent last year, Srivastava said in the last five years, MSI's CNG vehicle sales were at about 75,000 units in 2016-17, which grew to about 106,000 units last fiscal year.Another reason for the rise in demand for CNG vehicles is the increase in the number of cities under CNG stations network, he said adding four years ago, the number of CNG stations in India was 1,200, which has doubled to 2,400 at present."By next year the number of stations will be 4,500. So if you look at it, in four years it will go up from 1,200 to 4,500. Also the number of cities covered will go up. It has already gone up from 145 four years back to 240 this year," he said.Also read| UK's Rishi Sunak to raise business tax to pay for Covid-19 supportMoreover, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said in the Budget that the government would increase it to 100 more cities. In March 2022, it is expected that there will be almost 375 cities covered, he noted."The network is also increasing. Thus the availability of CNG is getting better...The government is also helping by expanding the CNG network. We can sell in new cities where CNG was not previously available. Then the waiting time for CNG filling is also going down as the number of stations are going up," he said.Also, he said consumer's concerns over safety and performance of CNG vehicles have been addressed with the company offering factory fitted vehicles where "there is no compromise in performance as well as safety. Now the customers know that there is no difference and the running cost is lower".When asked if Maruti Suzuki is planning to tap the favourable conditions for CNG vehicles by increasing the number of offerings, he said,"We have a plan to expand the CNG portfolio, to get CNG in other models also. We have 14 brands out of which eight have CNG and over a period of time we are trying to get CNG in other models also."While he did not share details, Srivastava said,"We have a time-based plan to get other vehicles into the CNG. We are actively working on it. CNG is a very good option when the petrol and diesel prices are very high. We are very focussed on this and consumers are reacting very positively to this as the numbers show."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-petrol-price-hike-maruti-to-cash-in-on-increased-demand-for-cng-vehicles-101613892019319.html

21-02-2021||India||Centre tells states to scale up testing as Covid-19 trajectory witnesses surge||As India’s active Covid-19 caseload witnessed a rise this week, pushing the country’s disease curve upwards, the Centre on Sunday wrote to states and Union territories advising them to step up testing to contain the spread of the virus at the earliest. The central government has asked states to work on five major areas—improve the overall testing numbers by focusing on increasing the proportion of RT-PCR tests, refocus on strict and comprehensive surveillance as well as stringent containment in selected districts, regular monitoring of the mutant strains through testing followed by genome sequencing and monitoring of the emerging cluster of cases, focus on clinical management in districts reporting higher deaths and all negative rapid antigen test results to be mandatorily followed by RT-PCR test. The instructions come as the country witnessed a spike of 86,711 cases of the coronavirus disease this week taking the infection tally close to 11 million. Of the 10,991,651 positive cases, 145,634 are active, which accounts for 1.32% of the total confirmed cases. The upward trend rides on the back of a sudden upsurge of cases in Kerala and Maharashtra. The Union ministry of health and family welfare said that more than 74% of the active cases are in these two states. “Of late it is seen that there has been a spike in the daily cases in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh also. Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir too are witnessing a surge in daily new cases,” it added. Maharashtra continues to report the highest daily new cases at 6,281 while Kerala added 4,650 new cases. Only two states – Maharashtra and Kerala account for 77% of daily new cases reported over the last 24 hours, the health ministry said.Pointing towards weekly data, the ministry stated that in Kerala the average weekly cases have fluctuated between a high of 42,000 to a low of 34,800 in the last four weeks. The weekly positivity in Kerala has ranged from 13.9% to 8.9% during the same period. According to the government, the southern state’s Alapuzha district is a cause of special concern where the weekly positivity rate has increased to 10.7% and weekly cases have increased to 2,833.Meanwhile in Maharashtra, the weekly cases have increased from 18,200 to 21,300 in four weeks and the corresponding positivity has also increased from 4.7% to 8%. The areas of concern are the Mumbai Suburban areas where the weekly cases have risen by 19%. In Nagpur, Amravati, Nashik, Akola and Yavatmal the weekly cases have increased by 33%, 47%, 23%, 55% and 48% respectively, the ministry added.Five states and UTs of Chandigarh, Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Maharashtra -have weekly positivity rates higher than the national average.

However, the two sides will need to continue discussing details of addressing residual issues pertaining to disengagement in Gogra-Hot Springs and patrolling rights in Depsang bulge area,” a senior official said about the talks held on Saturday.Although the disengagement from friction points of Gogra-Hot Springs on the banks of Chang Chemmo River, a tributary of Shyok, is not expected to be contentious, the related force deployments along the Khugrang river, another tributary, will need to be worked out mutually step by step.Depsang bulge is a 2013 legacy issue with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) trying to muscle out Indian Army patrols from patrolling points 10 to 13 by blocking the ingress route at Raki and Jeevan nullah. While the Indian Army claims to be patrolling these points, Depsang is a continuous source of friction and a possible trigger to future military escalation.Also watch | Why China blinked after months of deadlock. Shishir Gupta explainsWhile the military commanders on the ground are working towards disengagement in east Ladakh, the alignment of the LAC in the western sector has been left to the special representatives of the two countries on boundary resolution. However, the Indian prerequisite to special representatives level dialogue is that both sides restore the status quo ante on the LAC and neither unilaterally disturbs the status quo by use of force.Also read | Special representatives’ talks on cards, India, China to restore status quo anteEven though the two sides have withdrawn their armour from the Pangong Tso, both armies will remain wary of each other as Indian troops will not forget the transgression through use of force by PLA on finger four in May 2020 and the Chinese will not forget the Indian counter on north and south banks of Pangong Tso on August 29-30. The PLA may have also learnt a lesson of high-altitude deployment and the havoc rising glacial waters of River Galwan can play on troops deployed on its banks for military operations.It is quite evident that PLA wanted to enforce the 1959 line, rejected by India at that time, on Ladakh LAC, but the Indian political and military response was more than a match for the expansionist Chinese army.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiachina-10th-round-positive-detailed-roadmap-to-tackle-residual-issues-next-101613889696029.html

This is where India will set up an example for other countries. 2021 census will be fully digitised and will create a digital system," Kumar said at a press conference here.Announcing India's first-ever digital census, Nirmala Sitharaman, who presented the Union Budget 2021-22 in Parliament, had said the forthcoming census -- an exercise to determine the population of the country -- would be the first digital census in the history of India."For this monumental milestone task, I have allocated ₹3,768 crore for Financial Year 2021," Nirmala Sitharaman said while presenting the paperless budget.According to a NITI Aayog release, the Prime Minister said that several concerted steps have been taken to empower the poor and bring about a noticeable change in their lives."Since 2014, more than 2.40 crore houses have been constructed in both cities and villages. Similarly, over 3.5 lakh rural houses have been provided with piped drinking water within 18 months of the launch of the Jal Jeevan Mission," the release said.Prime Minister Modi added that the Bharat Net Scheme for internet connectivity in villages is bringing about transformational change. He said the Centre and States should work more closely on such schemes to improve ease of living for our citizens.Keeping in mind the aspirations of a young country like India, the Prime Minister stressed on the need to build modern infrastructure.He said the youth plays an important role in catalysing change in the country and cited the success of Digital India campaign to emphasise this point. He said that innovation must be encouraged, and more technology should be used to provide better opportunities for education and skill development.The Prime Minister also emphasised on strengthening MSMEs and start-ups. Every State, every District, has its unique strengths, he added.He said products should be shortlisted from every district and promoted--this will create healthy competition among all Districts and States, which will help in boosting our exports. He said that the Aspirational Districts Programme implemented in partnership with States holds a unique example in this regard.The Prime Minister said geospatial data was liberalized recently, which would incentivise entrepreneurial endeavour, start-up innovation and the tech sector in general. Focus must be on ease-of-doing business for the international audience and on ease-of-living for our own people, he added.The Prime Minister said the Central Government has introduced the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for various sectors, thus providing an excellent opportunity to increase manufacturing in the country. He urged the States to take full advantage of this scheme and attract maximum global investments and reap the benefits of reduced corporate tax rates.In the sixth GCM meeting of NITI Aayog, States/UTs also mentioned efforts made to improve water accessibility, supply of quality and reliable power, internet connectivity and bandwidth availability, quality healthcare services, sustainable agricultural practices to mitigate the risks of climate change, undertake suitable reforms to build an advanced manufacturing and innovation ecosystem, thereby bolstering exports through the One District One Product initiative, apart from building on futuristic tech and inclusive governance models.The Chief Ministers also noted marked improvement in the development of physical infrastructure, including digital connectivity, across the North-Eastern region, along with a greater thrust on the Act East Policy, with the aim of providing impetus to the economies of the NE States.This Governing Council meeting paved the way for synergies across all tiers of the Government, with substantial collaboration and cooperation in the agenda items. The meeting provided an opportunity to address the objectives of advancing economic, social and demographic welfare, the release said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-says-next-census-will-be-most-remarkable-digitalised-census-niti-aayog-101613881311339.html

21-02-2021||India||At 16-hour meet, India, China discuss further disengagement in eastern Ladakh||Military commanders of India and China on Saturday discussed further disengagement at other friction points in eastern Ladakh along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in a meeting that lasted for nearly 16 hours.The meeting of the corps commander-ranked officers, at Moldo on the Chinese side of the LAC to ease tensions in the Ladakh sector, began at 10am on Saturday and went on till 2am Sunday.The 10th round of military dialogue comes a day after the Indian Army and China’s People's Liberation Army (PLA) on Friday completed the disengagement process at the tense Pangong Tso sector of Ladakh. Outstanding problems with the PLA at Depsang, Hot Springs and Gogra - friction points on the contested border - were on the agenda during Saturday’s meeting, people familiar with the development said. “The proposals discussed during the talks to normalise the border situation will be put up by both sides before their higher authorities. The agreement on the next steps of disengagement will be finalised after that. We expect disengagement at the remaining friction points to proceed smoothly as it did in the main trouble area (Pangong Tso heights),” a person tracking the developments told HT before the meeting concluded.During the ninth round of talks, it was decided that the Chinese PLA will move its forces to the east of Finger 8 on the north bank while the Indian troops will move to its base near Finger 3, defence minister Rajnath Singh had told Parliament earlier this month, adding that the two sides have also agreed to temporarily suspend their regular patrolling activities on the north bank of Pangong Lake. The Indian claim line extends to Finger 8, while the Chinese claim is up to Finger 4.The India-China border standoff began last May and saw both sides deploy 50,000 troops each in the Ladakh theatre along with advanced weaponry. PLA’s deployments in Depsang have hindered access of Indian soldiers to Patrolling Points (PP) 10, 11, 11-A, 12 and 13, as previously reported by Hindustan Times. The Indian Army’s patrolling activity has also been affected in Hot Springs and Gogra, where rival troops are forward deployed and where skeletal disengagement took place last year.Earlier this week, for the first time the Chinese army admitted that four of its soldiers were killed, and an officer was injured in the clash between the troops of both sides at Galwan Valley on June 15, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-16-hour-meet-india-china-discuss-further-disengagement-in-eastern-ladakh-101613877366611.html

He took to Twitter in English, Hindi, Punjabi, Kannada, Gujarati, Malayalam, Bengali, Telugu, Odia among other Indian languages to send his message on International Mother Language Day.“My greetings on International #MotherLanguageDay. Linguistic diversity has always been one of the foundational pillars of our civilization. More than just a means of communication, our mother languages connect us with our heritage and define our socio-cultural identity,” he tweeted in English.“We must promote the use of mother tongue in all spheres - from primary education to governance. We must encourage the creative expression of our thoughts and ideas in our own languages!” he added.We must promote the use of mother tongue in all spheres - from primary education to governance. We must encourage the creative expression of our thoughts and ideas in our own languages! #MotherLanguageDayNaidu’s tweets come a day after he had written to the members of Parliament and urged them to contribute towards the promotion of Indian languages. The vice president described the first learned and spoken mother tongue as the 'soul of life' and made a passionate appeal to all MPs in a three-page letter. "I request you to be an active facilitator in promoting native languages in the large area you represent in the Parliament. Given your standing among the people you represent, your efforts could give a fillip to the promotion of Indian languages. I sincerely hope that you would agree with me on the need for preservation and promotion of all Indian languages and do whatever is possible to enrich them," he wrote in his letter.Since 2000, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) has led the world in celebrating languages with a view to promoting linguistic and cultural diversity and multilingualism.“Every two weeks a language disappears taking with it an entire cultural and intellectual heritage. At least 43% of the estimated 6000 languages spoken in the world are endangered. Only a few hundred languages have genuinely been given a place in education systems and the public domain, and less than a hundred are used in the digital world. Multilingual and multicultural societies exist through their languages which transmit and preserve traditional knowledge and cultures in a sustainable way,” the UN has said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-int-mother-language-day-naidu-calls-for-promotion-of-linguistic-diversity-101613876053121.html

21-02-2021||India||‘Confident of completing housing for all in time’, says Nagendra Nath Sinha||The performance of the central government in providing housing has stood the test of the Covid-19 pandemic, rural development ministry secretary Nagendra Nath Sinha tells Saubhadra Chatterji. Edited excerpts:The ministry data said that in FY19-20, 56.6% houses of the annual target were completed whereas in FY20-21, so far only 4.16% of the annual target has been completed.We have to look at this data with the totality of the situation. The houses that are sanctioned in a financial year, their completion rate should be looked at only in the next financial year even as the ministry is encouraging the states and the beneficiaries to build houses as early as possible. Normally, we allow a year for completion of the houses, and treat a house as delayed only when the construction does not get completed in that period. We have cases where houses have been completed in just three months. We are happy that about 26 lakh houses have been completed so far in this financial year. This including those sanctioned last year and 2.65 lakh houses from this year’s targets.For almost six months, the state governments have had their operations paralysed due to Covid-19 pandemic. So, most of the new PMAYG houses were sanctioned only after August and beneficiaries got only 5-6 months to build their houses in this financial year. In fact, we should celebrate that despite difficulties presented by Covid-19 and attendant circumstances, beneficiaries were able to complete 2.65 lakh houses in a period of less than six months.We started this year with 1.42 crore sanctions and now we are at 1.91 crore of sanctions. Thus almost 49 lakh units have been sanctioned in this year. We are in the process of sanctioning more for which the states are being vigorously pursued.A performance audit paper says pace of sanction has slowed down drastically due to as Covid-19, elections and saturation of SC/ST beneficiaries.The availability of manpower in government offices had also been an issue. The other factor is that in some states, the Covid-19 situation seems to again look serious. So, the panic is still there. Another big problem is availability of land. The Centre is working with the states on this but after a series of land distribution programmes, there is very little land available near habitable areas. Some states have relaxed land norms, while some have allowed multistoried houses for the scheme.Some states have also indicated financial constraints and have been very slow in sanctioning PMAYG houses. Some states have returned targets allocated to them. But even despite Covid-19, sanction of about 49 lakh houses is not a mean achievement. There are still 40 days left in this financial year and more houses will get completed.Are you confident to achieve Housing for All by August 2022?First of all, I dispute the way completion rate is measured. It should be measured against the sanctions of a year ago, while 4.16% achievement is against the current years’ sanction. In fact, we should see this achievement vis-a-vis the last year’s sanction. What you are mentioning as low performance, in fact should be counted as a superior performance in the exceptional circumstances of Covid-19, as these houses have been completed in less than 6 months’ time.We started out with the permanent waiting list based on the SECC. We are confident of providing houses for all PW by the said period. Those who have come late through Awaas +, their houses will require some more time... Also, the states have been massively affected by Covid-19.The PMAYG started with a target to build 2.95 crore houses. What is the progress on that target?The SECC found 4.04 crore people didn’t have houses or had kaccha houses with not more than two rooms. The figures were verified by Gram Sabhas and the number came down to 2.95 crore. This was the target for PMAYG. Sanction of the houses is subject to verification as someone who didn’t have a house in 2011 SECC survey might have built a house in the intervening period, some people might have migrated permanently or died. Meanwhile, as Awaas+ survey has been undertaken where 3.57 lakh people claimed to be left out of SECC, 2011. We have asked states to conduct physical verification. Once completed, genuine claimants can be determined.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/confident-of-completing-housing-for-all-in-time-101613858652786.html
21-02-2021||India||India, China’s special reps to meet over LAC||With India and China agreeing to restore status quo ante on the Line of Actual Control (LAC), a meeting between National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, both special representatives on boundary resolution, will take place soon to sort out differences in perception over the undefined border, according to people aware of the developments.While the 10th meeting between military commanders took place on Saturday, the backchannel talks between the special representatives have ensured that no side will unilaterally alter the status quo along the 3,488km-long LAC and the status quo will be restored on all points, the people quoted above said. Doval and Wang had a video conference on June 7, 2020, and have kept in touch with external affairs minister S Jaishankar, holding the diplomatic end of conversations with Beijing.Although both Indian and Chinese military commanders have stood firm during the 10-month stand-off, the governments on both sides are taking a step forward to normalise relations on a reciprocal basis.It is understood that the Indian side has made it clear that it will stand up to any use of force to alter the status quo but is willing to discuss and build a positive atmosphere for sorting out all outstanding issues related to the LAC.“We have conveyed that the two sides can sit together and work their way towards resolving differences in perception over the LAC after China has created positivity by restoring status quo ante on Pangong Tso. There can be no dialogue if PLA uses force but if China can persuade that India is wrong or vice versa on border perception, then the two sides can mutually adjust to the perception line,” said a senior official in the know of the developments.According to national security planners, it is for China to create a positive atmosphere for recording forward movement in bilateral ties as India will respond in kind and more.“The trajectory that India and China ties take from Pangong Tso disengagement depends on Beijing but the PLA (People’s Liberation Army) withdrawal has been taken in the right spirit in New Delhi,” said a former Indian Army chief, asking not to be named.After the disengagement from Pangong Tso, the military commanders on Saturday were working out the modalities of withdrawal of armour and artillery from friction points at Gogra-Hot Springs and working out the modalities for restoring full patrolling rights to the two sides in the Depsang Bulge area, south of Daulet Beg Oldi sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-s-special-reps-to-meet-over-lac-101613858375747.html
21-02-2021||India||Interview| ‘Did not block any welfare scheme, ensured transparency’: Kiran Bedi||Former IPS officer Kiran Bedi, who was removed as Puducherry lieutenant governor (L-G) on February 16, spoke to Ramesh Vinayak about the powers of the L-G in the Union territory and the allegations of non-cooperation levelled against her by CM V Narayanasamy. Edited excerpts:The constitutional framework for the lieutenant governor of Puducherry provided that you had to work on the aid and advice of the council of ministers. But CM V Narayanasamy alleged that you did not?In terms of Section 44 of the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963, read with Rules of Business from time to time made thereunder, all decisions taken by the cabinet are to be placed before the L-G before they are acted upon by the concerned administrative department. In 95% of the cases, I went along with the decisions taken by the cabinet. In case of difference of opinion, the L-G is required to refer the matter to the central government and the decision of the Centre is binding.Your interpretation of the 2018 Supreme Court order in the case related to powers of the Delhi government and the L-G was totally different from the CM. You said that it provided the L-G the powers to intervene in day-to-day functioning of the government. Why do you think you were right?The administrative set-up of the UT of Puducherry is not that of the Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi. The UT of Puducherry is governed by the provisions of the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963. In respect of the Government of NCT of Delhi, it is governed by the constitutional provisions. The Supreme Court has categorically ruled that the NCT of Delhi is a sue generis (of its own kind) among the UTs, and therefore its order is applicable only to DelhiThe CM had alleged that you did not approve funds for building a dam or providing relief to fishermen and blocked almost every proposal of his government. How true is this?I did not block any welfare scheme but ensured diligence in public spending and transparency and fair deal in welfare assistances.How do you see your long-running confrontation with the CM, who was from the Congress?Their political needs were in variance with the rule of law.How do you respond to the Congress government’s charge that you had reduced the L-G office to an extension counter of the BJP?This is a blatant lie.The perception is that you have been eased out ahead of the assembly elections to blunt the Congress government tirade that you didn’t let it perform at the behest of the BJP.It is a presumption.What is your next plan? Would you like to revert to politics?The speed at which life unfolds, I am wondering who is the architect?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/did-not-block-any-welfare-scheme-ensured-transparency-101613855242370.html

The government had identified nearly 10 million health care workers for the programme. India also crossed the milestone of administering vaccine to over 10 million people on Saturday.Puducherry recorded the lowest vaccine coverage among health care workers, with only 31.9% of the registered beneficiaries receiving the shots till Saturday evening, followed by Chandigarh with 35.6% and Punjab with 38.7%. The national capital was also among the seven states and Union Territories with less than 50% vaccination coverage for the health care workers. According to the data shared by the Delhi government, 50.7% of the health care workers were immunised till Saturday evening.Among the 20 million frontline workers identified by the government for the drive, 3.6 million received the vaccine.So far, 10 states and UTs have vaccinated 50% of their frontline workers.

21-02-2021||India||Ex-defence personnel hit by phishing attack||The devices of multiple former defence personnel may have been compromised in a phishing attack launched through a government domain email address, according to technical evidence accessed by HT and disclosures by some of the victims, the latest in a string of attacks that have exploited privileged @gov.in and @nic.in email addresses.The new attack, which was through an email from an @gov.in address sent on Thursday afternoon, targeted a group of 43 former officers of the army, navy and air force who were part of the 56th course of the National Defence Academy. The sender lured some of them into clicking on a purported invitation for a dinner, which led to a set of malware.“Some 15-20 people said in our WhatsApp group that they had clicked on the link and were honest about it,” said one of the 43 people, who asked not to be named. Two other persons who clicked on the links themselves told HT that they had, and found suspicious files being downloaded.HT reported on Thursday that at least two government ministries — external affairs and defence — have sent out alerts this month to their employees, warning about the use of two specific email addresses that belong to the official nic.in and gov.in domains run by the National Informatics Centre (NIC). NIC runs the official email service, handing out accounts to departments, ministries and public sector units run by state and central governments.Also read: US still unraveling 'sophisticated' hack of 9 government agenciesThe people targeted on Thursday said they were not sure how their details may have leaked. One of the people HT spoke to said the 56th course alumni included some people who were also in senior positions in private companies. The three services chiefs, general MM Naravane, admiral Karambir Singh and air chief marshal Rakesh Kumar Singh Bhadauria too belong to the same NDA batch, although their email addresses were not among those targeted.If accessed through a mobile phone, the link that was sent in the latest attempt prompts users to install a malware disguised as an app for armed forces personnel. In the background, the programme links up with a ‘command and control’ server, and begins uploading any data — photos, documents, audio and video files — stored on the device.“It also sends WhatsApp files and documents and activates the microphone, records calls and uploads those as well as calls logs,” said Yash Kadakia, the founder of Security Brigade, after he and his team analysed the link and the malware at HT’s request. Kadakia said the malware appeared to only target Android phones, although another set of engineers HT reached out to said people who visited the link using a desktop computer too would be compromised, with anything they type being recorded.“This malware appears to be new and tailor-made for targets who are associated with the Indian military. None of the commercially available anti-malware products appears to flag it as yet,” Kadakia said, explaining that this was likely to be the first time this hacking tool was spotted in the wild.On Friday, a government official who asked not to be named said a third alert has been issued about a separate compromised @gov.in email address. It is not yet clear how these email addresses have been breached, and how many more there may be. Altogether, HT is aware of four NIC domain addresses – three with @gov.in suffixes and the fourth an @nic.in one – which are not being disclosed in order to protect any investigations there may be.When contacted by HT, NIC said phishing attacks “originate from spoofed or compromised accounts,” without responding directly to the specific cases. “State-of-the-art Security controls and measures are deployed to detect and mitigate phishing attacks at NIC. Additional measures such as mandatory multifactor authentication are being deployed to mitigate unauthorised access to user email,” it said in a statement.“Security measures for authentication of senders to avoid spoofing and to block malicious emails are deployed as per global best practices in NIC / government networks,” it said, adding that security measures “are continuously reviewed and steps are taken to mitigate emerging cyber-attacks”.The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (Cert-IN), which investigates incidents of cyber breaches, did not respond to requests for a comment.Two senior officials involved with the country’s cyber security said such attacks are not new or uncommon. “No government data has been compromised since sensitive systems are sequestered,” said one of these officials.The second person added that these incidents are the result of poor cyber hygiene and people fall victims to such methods the world over.The use of compromised government domain accounts also offers hackers the ability to appear more authentic to their targets and bypass system filters that typically divert suspicious emails to junk folders or label them as risky.“Any attack impersonating a government official is worrying. There is a greater chance that someone will click on a link that looks like it came from an official, increasing the likelihood of such campaigns being successful,” said Gunjan Chawla, programme manager, technology and national security, at Centre for Communication Governance, National Law University Delhi. “Such attacks also risk undermining trust in government’s digital infrastructure,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/exdefence-personnel-hit-by-phishing-attack-101613851786543.html

21-02-2021||India||From revenue deficit to special status: What CMs focussed on||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday chaired a virtual meeting of the governing council of Niti Aayog, the Centre’s policy think tank, with chief ministers. About 25 chief ministers spoke during the video conferencing and a majority of them raised the issue of fall in revenues which was affecting development in the states.“The Centre should compensate for the revenue loss due to Covid-19 so that development works can be carried out. There was also revenue shortfall due to slowing down of the economy,” said Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, adding to what several CMs highlighted during the interaction with the PM.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal asserted the need to pace up the manufacturing sector in the country. “In the last 70 years, our country has never given importance to the manufacturing sector; our country is lagging behind in manufacturing which is why China has captured our markets,” he said.Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren demanded a separate religious code for the tribals in the upcoming national Census, and suggested universalisation of old age pension and increasing wages of MGNREGA workers.Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan outlined that the state undertook agricultural reforms.Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy reiterated his demand for special status for the state, asserting that industrialisation was yet to gain the required momentum due to several constraints post-bifurcation.Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik, however, hit out at the “politicisation” of all actions of an elected government and pointed out that it was making development difficult. “Every crime is being politicised, every action of an elected government is being viewed from a poll angle. This kind of an atmosphere is one of the biggest threats to the pace of development and peace in the country,” he said in an apparent dig at the controversy over draft heritage bylaws issued by National Monument Authority for the Jagannath temple in Puri and Anant Basudeva temple and Brahmeswar temple of Bhubaneswar.Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar suggested ‘One Nation, One Rate’ on electricity supplied to states by Centre power plants. “We purchase very costly power as a result of which the state government has to give more as a subsidy,” he said.Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot demanded that East Rajasthan Canal Project be declared a project of national importance, as promised by the PM during election rallies in the state on 7 July 2018 and 6 October 2018.Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath highlighted that his state is the first in the country to inoculate 1 million people. He also highlighted how UP moved from 12th position to second in the country in Ease of Doing Business Rankings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-revenue-deficit-to-special-status-what-cms-focussed-on-101613851167362.html
21-02-2021||India||Need to give equal chance to private sector to grow: Modi||Days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi questioned whether IAS officers should run fertilizer factories or airlines, he told a meeting of the governing council of the Niti Aayog that the government has to “honour the enthusiasm of the private sector”. He said in the goal of self-reliance, every person and institution gets the opportunity to grow. His comments on the private sector came against a backdrop of the government’s ambitious target for strategic sale of several public sector units this year, including Air India, oil major BPCL and some banks.In the virtual meeting, attended by chief ministers and senior officials, Modi said the Union budget presented on February 1 evoked a “positive response” and added, “We are also seeing how the private sector of the country is coming forward with more enthusiasm in this development journey of the country. As a government, we also have to honour this enthusiasm, the energy of the private sector, and give it as much opportunity in the self-reliant India campaign.”The PM’s comments came days after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi accused the government of working on a “Hum do, Hamare do” policy that benefits a handful of industrialists but not the people of India. Gandhi had accused Modi of promoting crony capitalism.Modi’s speech on Saturday was aimed at refuting these charges as he said, “Self-reliant India is a step towards a new India where every person, every institution, every enterprise gets an opportunity to grow beyond its full capabilities.”In the Union budget, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman set a disinvestment target of ₹1.75 lakh crore for FY21-22. In her budget speech, Sitharaman said, “We have kept working towards strategic disinvestment. A number of transactions namely BPCL, Air India, Shipping Corporation of India, Container Corporation of India, IDBI Bank, BEML, Pawan Hans, Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd, among others, would be completed in 2021-22.”“Other than IDBI Bank, we propose to take up the privatisation of two public sector banks and one general insurance company in the year 2021-22,” Sitharaman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-to-give-equal-chance-to-private-sector-to-grow-modi-101613850865226.html
21-02-2021||India||India, China discuss next phase of disengagement||Senior military commanders of the Indian and Chinese armies on Saturday met in eastern Ladakh to discuss the road map for further disengagement of their troops at friction points on the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC), with the talks taking place after the completion of the first round of disengagement in the Pangong Tso sector, people tracking the developments said on condition of anonymity.The corps commander-ranked officers met at Moldo on the Chinese side of the LAC for the 10th round of military dialogue to ease tensions in the Ladakh sector. The talks began at 10am and were in progress when this report was filed.Outstanding problems with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) at Depsang, Hot Springs and Gogra — friction points on the contested border — were on the agenda, said one of the persons cited above.“The proposals discussed during the talks to normalise the border situation will be put up by both sides before their higher authorities. The agreement on the next steps of disengagement will be finalised after that. We expect disengagement at the remaining friction points to proceed smoothly as it did in the main trouble area (Pangong Tso heights),” said a second person aware of the matter.The India-China border standoff began last May and saw both sides deploy 50,000 troops each in the Ladakh theatre along with advanced weaponry.PLA’s deployments in Depsang have hindered access of Indian soldiers to Patrolling Points (PP) 10, 11, 11-A, 12 and 13, as previously reported by Hindustan Times. The Indian Army’s patrolling activity has also been affected in Hot Springs and Gogra, where rival troops are forward deployed and where skeletal disengagement took place last year. The Pangong disengagement took place on strategic heights on both banks of the lake. It saw the two armies pull back their frontline troops, tanks, infantry combat vehicles and artillery guns under an agreement reached earlier this month. The disengagement began on February 10.“I think we should not expect very speedy results (in other areas). Depsang, in particular, is one area where discussions to arrive at a consensus could be protracted,” former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda said on the eve of the military talks.The disengagement will be phased, coordinated and verified at all friction points. The first round of disengagement at Pangong Tso involved the pulling back of troops deployed eyeball-to-eyeball on the Finger 4 ridgeline at heights of almost 18,000 feet as well as withdrawing soldiers holding positions on the Kailash range on the south bank.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-discuss-next-phase-of-disengagement-101613850273085.html
21-02-2021||India||PM calls for cooperative federalism||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday called for “synergy” in the Union and state budgets, taking “competitive, cooperative federalism” down to the district-level and said that a better understanding between the Centre and the states in their policy framework was very important for the country’s development.Addressing a governing council meeting of the Niti Aayog, the Centre’s policy think tank, Modi also asked the states to reduce the compliance burden on the public, defended the reforms in the agriculture sector and asked for reduction in the import of edible oil worth billions of dollars.The PM maintained that India’s self-reliance (atma-nirbharta) will benefit from Centre-state synergy. Asking the states to take “full benefit” of the new performance-linked incentives that have been announced for the manufacturing sector and the cut in corporate tax rates, Modi pointed out the states have a 40% share in the National Infrastructure Pipeline announced in the budget. “Therefore, it is imperative that the states and the Centre jointly synergise their budgets, make plans, and set priorities,” he said.The presentation of the Union budget has been advanced from the earlier schedule in March to February 1 since 2017. Modi referred to the calendar that helps early planning and commencement of work, and said, “Now the central government has pre-poned its budget a month earlier. There are three to four weeks between the state budget and the Union budget. If the budget of the states is formed in the light of the budget of the Centre, then together they move in one direction.”The PM said he would like to see the budget of the states discussed in this direction. “States whose budget is yet to come, they can do this work on priority. Along with the Union budget, the state budget is equally important in speeding up development and making the states self-sufficient,” he said.The meeting also saw the PM defend the new agriculture laws once again. While the protests against the laws are still on, Modi said, “Reforms are very important in the farm sector to make sure our farmers get finance, better infrastructure and modern technology.” He added that even as agriculture has immense capabilities, the truth is that despite being called an agricultural country, “today we bring about 65-70 thousand crores of edible oil from outside. We can stop this. Money can go to our farmers’ account. This farmer is entitled to our money. But for this, we have to make our plans like that,” while pointing out how the import of pulses had reduced considerably.The PM referred to the abolition of 1,500 archaic laws and simplifying other processes, saying, “There are thousands of compliance requirements that now apply to common people, which can be eliminated. We have technology. There is no need for asking people to furnish the same things time and again. Let us remove this compliance burden on the people. This is also important for ease of living.”Expanding the idea of “healthy”, competitive, cooperative federalism, the PM said that businesses, MSMEs and start-ups need to be strengthened. Pointing out every state has its own merit and that each district boasts of its own talent, the PM added, “We can see different potentials. The products of hundreds of districts are shortlisted and promoted for their value addition, marketing and export. This has just started a healthy competition among the states but it has to be taken forward.”He said the export performance of a state can be replicated in the district levels to see how we can give special emphasis on this export in every state and every district. “We also have to carry this experiment between districts and blocks. We have to make full use of the resources of the states, we should earnestly take account of the exports from the states every month and increase it,” Modi said.In the meeting attended by chief ministers and senior officials, the PM referred to several steps taken to reduce poverty and said the use of technology was absolutely essential in improving governance at the grassroot level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-calls-for-cooperative-federalism-101613849999623.html
21-02-2021||India||Order on Disha’s bail reserved for Tuesday||A Delhi court on Saturday reserved its order on the bail plea of 22-year-old Disha Ravi, who is facing sedition charges for allegedly amplifying violence during a farmers’ protest by creating an online “toolkit”, even as the climate activist’s counsel said there was no evidence to show that the document was responsible for the violence on January 26.Even as additional sessions judge (ASJ) Dharmender Rana asked the Delhi Police to present anything that could link the “toolkit” with the violence and, consequently, the conspiracy for which Ravi was charged, the police said the case was still being investigated.Ravi was arrested from Bengaluru on February 13 by Delhi Police for allegedly creating and sharing the protest toolkit backing the farmers’ agitation against the Centre’s new farm laws. Delhi Police claimed on Monday that Ravi, along with Mumbai-based lawyer Nikita Jacob and Pune engineer Shantanu Muluk, created the toolkit and shared it with others “to tarnish India’s image” and that “pro-Khalistani” elements were included in the document. The two have already been granted transit anticipatory bail by the Bombay high court.If highlighting the farmers’ protest globally was sedition, then she was “better in jail”, activist Ravi told the Delhi court.During the three-hour hearing, the judge asked the police whether they had any evidence that the “toolkit” incited violence during the tractors’ rally. “How is the toolkit connected to the violence? What is the evidence? Is there is any evidence or are we acting on the basis of surmises and conjectures?” the judge asked the police.To this, additional solicitor general (ASG) SV Raju told the court that in a conspiracy, people could have different roles. He said that someone inspired by the toolkit could have been instigated to commit violence. Raju told the court that the document will have to be read along with the hashtags and links it contained, which were meant to “instigate people asking them to come on streets thus resulting in public disorder”. He said that because of the toolkit, some elements put a flag on the Red Fort as the document had a list of tasks to be undertaken to support the cause of the Khalistani movement.“First is the violence…Toolkit precedes the violence. Go inside Delhi, do this, do that,” Raju said.The court asked the ASG: “What’s ‘do this and that’? What is the link? Unless I satisfy my conscience, I don’t move ahead”.Raju contended that the “toolkit” had to be read along with the hashtag and links, which were of seditious nature.“It is not a simple message. The links are inciting people. Asks them to march into Delhi…. People are being told there is genocide in Kashmir… It defames the armed forces and talks about Assam.“The result was public disorder and disturbance of public peace… The toolkit showed India is bad country, it is killing Muslims. The flag was hoisted… We still want to investigate. We will certainly discover other things… We will be required to have a second look,” Raju said.The court, however, said: “What exactly is the evidence against this lady connecting her with the violence? Please don’t be repetitive. Apart from Khalistani link and that she was in touch… How do you connect the actual actors with these conspirators,” the court said.The investigating officer said that Ravi was connected to Poetic Justice Foundation, a Vancouver-based organisation. “The execution of conspiracy is different from the conspiracy. Conspiracy is meeting of minds. The requirement of law is that conspiracy is complete. Others have different roles. My intention was that a person reads the toolkit and gets swayed by it,” Raju said.The judge sought to know from the police whether the actual actors were arrested or not and whether any link was established. It asked whether there is any link between the conspiracy and the offence. “Should I assume that for now, there is no direct link? Have you arrested the actual actors? Have you established any link? Either I’ve not framed my query correctly or you don’t want to answer it. What is connecting in link between the conspiracy and the offence,” the judge said.Additional public prosecutor Irfan Ahmed told the court that the “toolkit” had embedded links which directed readers to various anti-India websites.The court sought to know whether there was a documentary evidence to show that the “toolkit” had incited violence. It also sought to know how “chai” and “yoga” were used to tarnish India’s image, as alleged by the probe agency.The police said that it was the entire “toolkit” of which “chai” and “yoga” were also a part, which are symbols being used to defame India. The police said that after the “toolkit” was leaked on social media, a cover-up operation was carried out and many of its parts were deleted. After this, sections 201 and 204 of the Indian penal Code (IPC) – which deal with destruction of evidence – were added against the activist. The ASG also said that the “toolkit” had a cheatsheet which contained information which defames the Indian Army and had nothing to do with the farmers’ protest.“Ravi had the right to edit the toolkit and she later deleted everything. This is the working of a guilty mind,” said the lawyer, adding that the “toolkit” was part of a “sinister design”. He said that a co-accused, Shantanu, was sent to Delhi to ensure the proper execution of the “toolkit”.During the hearing, the court also sought to know the past antecedents of Mo Dhaliwal and Anita Lal, founders of Poetic Justice Foundation (PJF) and asked as to how the police were ascertaining that they were supporting the Khalistani movement.Advocate Siddharth Aggarwal told the court that Ravi’s work and her cause were meant to save the environment and she did not intend to “sow disaffection”. “There is no disaffection being spread by the toolkit. It is just a digital document. My history has nothing to do with Khalistan. My connection is not with Sikhs For Justice or PJF. In this case, it is clear that thinking otherwise is attracting sedition,” Ravi’s lawyer Aggarwal told the court on behalf of his client.“I have no connection with the Khalistan movement, whatsoever. There is no single chat or conversation between me and the (banned organisation) Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) produced by the Delhi Police,” the counsel argued. He also contended that speaking to a secessionist did not make Ravi one too.The court reserved its order and said that it would pronounce the verdict on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/order-on-disha-s-bail-reserved-for-tuesday-101613848565577.html
21-02-2021||India||BJP leader held with cocaine accuses party colleague of hatching conspiracy||BJP youth wing leader Pamela Goswami, who was arrested with cocaine from south Kolkata on Friday, alleged that it was the conspiracy of another BJP leader Rakesh Singh.“I want a CID probe. BJP leader Rakesh Singh, who is close to Kailash Vijayvargiya, should be arrested. This is his conspiracy. I have all evidence,” said Goswami.In a video that went viral, Goswami could be seen raising the allegations while she was being taken to courtGoswami, 29, was arrested from a posh area in south Kolkata on Friday. Police had recovered around 90 grams of cocaine, worth nearly ₹10 lakh, from the car. Her friend Prabir Kumar De, 38 who was with her, was also arrested along with another youth Somnath Chatterjee, 26. De is also a BJP worker.“Today she is taking the name of Kailash ji. Tomorrow she may take the name of Amit Shah and Narendra Modi. I can face a CBI or CID investigation. I think she has been brain washed by the police and the TMC to say these things so that they can implicate me and the BJP,” said Rakesh Singh, a BJP leader.A senior BJP leader said that Goswami had joined the BJP in July 2019 along with two others, actor Surojit Choudhury and actor Rimjhim Mitra.“I didn’t have any contact with the woman over the past one and half years. How did I become a part of the conspiracy then? Am I a ghost that I will go there and place the cocaine?” said Singh.The police said that Goswami’s father Kaushik Goswami had sent a letter to the police commissioner and joint commissioner of police (crime) alleging that De, who was arrested with Pamela, had introduced her to drugs.In the letter, Goswami (Pamela’s father), stated that De was married and has a daughter who is 8-9 years old. He also alleged that De had first started a business with Pamela as a partner and then introduced her to drugs."We would definitely request you to kindly keep a watch upon this person so that he may not fleece any other girl or woman as he has done with our own daughter. We have further information that he has collected a lot of cash from the market running into a few crores of rupees," Kaushik Goswami wrote in his letter to the police commissioner.HT has a copy of the letter but repeated calls on Kaushik Goswami's number went unanswered.“If someone has been arrested with drugs then law will take its own course. Let the police investigate and the truth will come out” said Partha Chatterjee, state minister“I am not aware of this and hence don't want to comment. But more than 1000 of our workers have been put behind bars in narcotics related cases. We have full faith on the legal system,” said Kailash Vijayvargiya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-leader-held-with-cocaine-accuses-party-colleague-of-hatching-conspiracy-101613847323806.html
21-02-2021||India||Man murders 17-year-old girl in Begumpur||A 17-year-old girl was bludgeoned to death with a hammer on Friday evening at her home in outer Delhi’s Begumpur by a man whose proposal she had recently turned down, the police said on Saturday.Police are on the lookout for the suspect, 25-year-old Laik (identified by the police by his first name), who is a long-time family acquaintance.Deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Rohini, PK Mishra said, “Laik was very close to the girl’s family and had known them for the last five years. He was a frequent visitor to their home and had even lived with the family for two months when they moved from Bawana to Begumpur. He would often help the family with their day-to-day affairs,” he said.The girl’s father worked at a manufacturing unit and the family had moved to Begumpur from Bawana a year ago after building a house in the northwest Delhi neighbourhood.Laik, who too works at a factory, belongs to Hardoi in Uttar Pradesh and lived in Delhi with his uncle.Police said Laik was on good terms with the girl’s family until recently when he started developing feelings for the teenager. “Recently, he proposed to the girl, but she had turned him down,” the DCP said based on the police’s interactions with her cousin.On Friday evening, when the girl’s parents were away at work and her two brothers were in the market to buy vegetables, Laik visited her house.“We suspect that an argument ensued between the girl and Laik over her rejecting his proposal and that led to him beating her to death with a hammer,” the DCP said.After the murder, Laik allegedly locked the house from outside and left with the bloodstained hammer in hand.“While Laik was walking with the hammer, the girl’s brother saw him from a distance, but didn’t make much of it. But when the brothers returned home, they found the door locked from the outside and believed that the girl had left with Laik. But when they made a phone call to their sister and found her phone ringing inside the house, they suspected something amiss and broke open the lock,” the officer said.Inside, the girl was lying unconscious and injured. She was rushed to a nearby hospital where she was declared brought dead.The officer said that a murder case has been registered and multiple teams have been formed to catch Laik.The case figured prominently on social media platforms all through Saturday since the victim and the accused belonged to different religions. However, DCP Mishra said religion had nothing to do with the murder.“The man would have killed her even if he belonged to the same religion as the victim,” said Mishra.The officer said that the police have spoken to the girl’s parents who, too, did not see any communal angle in the murder. “We are looking to nab Laik at the earliest. While there is no communal tension, we are keeping a watch in the area,” the officer said.Last week in Mangolpuri, the death of a 25-year-old man who was stabbed to death by a group of men took a communal turn after his affiliation with some Hindu outfits came to light. Many political leaders visited the house of the deceased as Delhi Police increased security in the area and transferred the case to the crime branch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-murders-17-year-old-girl-in-begumpur-101613844072501.html
21-02-2021||India||Seminar addresses challenges faced by entrepreneurs with disabilities||Experts working with entrepreneurs with disabilities held a digital conference earlier this month, where they stressed on the need to focus on the challenges specific to the community.The virtual conference — titled Business Beyond Barriers-Empowering Entrepreneurs with Disabilities —was held on February 6 by Alliance To Promote Abilities and Rehabilitation (ATPAR), Network of Entrepreneurs with Disabilities for Assistance and Rehabilitation (NEDAR), National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People (NCPEDP), and the National Handicapped Finance and Development Corporation (NHFDC). The conference aimed at highlighting the contribution of disabled entrepreneurs and address the challenges faced by them.Thilakam Rajendran, founder ATPAR, which works on entrepreneurship for persons with disabilities across India, said that the community was invisible despite having the same dreams and contributions as other entrepreneurs.“It is time we move beyond perception blocks. All stakeholders should come together to enable and empower through convergence and inclusion to recognise their contributions and make them visible,” he said.Lack of financial inclusion, support and acknowledgment from the entrepreneurial ecosystem have proved to be the major challenges for the field, the experts said. They also said that world over, participation of persons with disabilities in employment is lesser than those without disabilities. Persons with disabilities are pushed into taking up self employment or entrepreneurship for survival, without any adequate skills, knowledge, financial inclusion, enabling eco-system, among other factors.Around 2000 attendees were present for the national conference, which included stakeholders from ministries, industry associations, corporates, and banking and skilling sector.Arman Ali, executive director, NCPEDP pointed out that disability could no longer be a barrier for people to be a part of the entrepreneurial ecosystem and to do business.To boost entrepreneurial options in the community, ATPAR also launched a business directory of NEDAR members. NEDAR was started in 2019 by ATPAR and currently has over 100 member-entrepreneurs and an online store — called “ATPAR Mall” on the Instamojo platform to sell products of entrepreneurs with disabilities.“Most people today are able to connect to the two words Persons with Disabilities or Divyangjan, but when we say ”Entrepreneurs with Disabilities”, there is a degree of disconnect. It takes an effort for us to explain that they have created an identity for themselves beyond just being Persons with Disabilities and today among many other identities they are artisans, artists, self-employed and entrepreneurs with disabilities who have carved a niche in conducting their business beyond barriers and are also contributors to the society,” the directory states in the preface.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/seminar-addresses-challenges-faced-by-entrepreneurs-with-disabilities-101613844073033.html
21-02-2021||India||PWD asks police to lodge case against new makeshift temple at Chandni Chowk||Leaders of three major political parties — the Aam Aadmi Party, the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress — on Saturday made a beeline for the new makeshift Hanuman temple that has come up on the central verge of Chandni Chowk main road, even as the Public Works Department (PWD) wrote to the Delhi Police asking them to take action against the construction.The PWD in its complaint to the Delhi police, however, did not mention the word “temple” anywhere instead referring to it as a “prefabricated structure”.“This is to inform you that last night (Thursday) some unknown person brought a prefabricated structure and placed at planter top in the median near Kucha Mahajani at Chandni Chowk road. In this regard it is requested to take necessary action at the earliest so that the project can be executed within the timeline,” the PWD complaint letter to the police said.A police officer, who did not want to be named, said, “Legal action has already been initiated in the matter.”Delhi government could not be reached for a comment on the issue despite repeated attempts.The old temple, which was located on the pavement of the carriageway towards Red Fort, had been demolished by the North Delhi Municipal Corporation on the directions of the Delhi high court on January 3. The PWD in its complaint clearly mentioned that the structure has come up without any permission from any of the agencies executing the project.Senior AAP leader Durgesh Pathak, AAP’s Chandni Chowk MLA Parlad Singh Sawhney and Delhi Congress vice president Mudit Agrawal and Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor visited the makeshift temple on Saturday and offered prayers at the temple.On Saturday, senior AAP leader and party’s MCD in-charge Pathak visited the new temple and offered prayers along with locals. He said that the North Delhi Municipal Corporation had demolished this temple of “Lord Hanuman” but the people had re-built it with their faith.“It is very sad that this temple of Sankat Mochan Lord Hanuman in Chandni Chowk was demolished. By doing so, the MCD played with the faith of devotees. But the devotees have re-built this temple. The AAP stands with devotees, and we have come here to pray before Lord Hanuman that he gives sanity to all,” Pathak said.He also took potshots at the BJP-ruled civic bodies and said that the BJP has betrayed the people of Delhi during its 15-year tenure in the MCD.Responding to Pathak’s allegations, Delhi BJP spokesperson Kapoor said that it is sad that AAP leader Durgesh Pathak has vitiated the atmosphere by giving a political statement while visiting the Hanuman mandir rebuilt by the locals of Chandni Chowk. “The original temple at Chandni Chowk was demolished as a part of Delhi government’s beautification plan on court’s order. Locals made several appeals to the government to save the original temple but they did nothing,” Shankar said.Delhi Congress vice-president Mudit Aggarwal on Saturday too visited the newly built temple and trained guns at both the MCDs and the Delhi government for the temple’s demolition. “Both the Delhi government and the BJP considered the temple a hindrance and engaged in manipulating the public by hurling allegations at each other,” Aggarwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pwdasks-police-to-lodge-case-against-new-makeshift-temple-at-chandni-chowk-101613843952532.html
21-02-2021||India||Day after PLA deaths are announced, hate messages target Indian embassy||A barrage of hate messages directed at the Indian embassy’s Chinese social media account, an outpouring of grief from Chinese citizens, and more write-ups in official media blaming New Delhi for the military standoff with India – all these marked an uneasy Saturday, a day after information about the deaths of four People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers was released for the first time.Thousands of abusive messages have targeted the Indian embassy’s Twitter-like Weibo account since information about four soldiers being killed and one injured in the deadly Galwan Valley clash last June was published in the PLA Daily newspaper on Friday.Many of the abusive messages on the tightly-censored Weibo account are peppered with expletives.Also read : Special representatives’ talks on cards, India, China to restore status quo anteEmotion is running high among Chinese netizens over the soldiers’ deaths, while state media reported that a person was arrested in Nanjing city for publishing insulting remarks about the PLA troopers.On Friday, multiple videos purportedly showing the lead-up to the Galwan Valley clash between Indian and Chinese troops in June last year were uploaded on several websites, and shared and viewed hundreds of millions of times.The edited videos show Chinese soldiers outnumbered by Indian troops. The message for the domestic audience was clear – Chinese troops showed restraint and valour while taking on Indian servicemen.None of the videos claim that 20 Indian soldiers had died in the clash.Photos of the four dead PLA soldiers circulated online, and evoked a strong reaction from Chinese citizens.For hundreds of millions of Chinese, it was the first time they learnt about their country’s soldiers dying in a battle.The Chinese government seemed set to mine the people’s emotion by allowing state media outlets to publish photos of the deceased from when they were young students.The news website, thepaper.cn, ran several photos of two of the deceased soldiers - Chen Hongjun and Xiao Siyuan - from their days at Northwest Normal University and Henan Agricultural Vocational College.Both universities announced on social media they would mark the deaths of their two former students by allowing teachers and students to pay tributes and carry out “mourning activities”.The nationalistic tabloid, Global Times, published an editorial to give its view on why information about the PLA soldiers has been made public now - eight months after the clash.“Back to the Galwan Valley clash last year, given the tense situation at that time, avoiding a comparison of casualties was more conducive to the stability of the border situation. Now that the round of border standoff has ended, we must make public the heroes’ deeds so that all Chinese people could admire and commemorate them to understand the weight of peace,” the Global Times editorial said.“Before the Galwan Valley clash, China had not seen soldiers sacrifice in clashes with foreign troops for quite a long time. The sacrifice of young soldiers including those born after 1995 and 2000 has shocked the nation.”The editorial also said that another reason for eventually releasing the information was to reveal the truth.“India has been trumpeting its ‘victory’ in the border provocations against China to cater to and encourage surging domestic nationalism. The unveiled number of casualties from China has debunked the lies of India, making it hard for India, who suffered heavy losses in the Galwan Valley, to continue to fool the domestic public,” the editorial added.Shanghai-based military expert, Ni Lexiong, said China did not release the PLA casualty statistics earlier because it did not want to provoke reactions.“China is not prepared to expand the border conflict with India, and so it did not immediately report casualties in order to avoid provoking anger among the Chinese,” he said.“Now that the two sides have reached an agreement on withdrawal and disengagement, the incident has been formally resolved. The Chinese side will be able to handle the casualties normally and it will not affect the settlement of the border conflict. This shows that China is rational and calm,” Ni added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/day-after-pla-deaths-are-announced-hate-messages-target-indian-embassy-101613818571651.html
